afternoon it's actually very rainy here
in Southern California which is weird we
have weather there's like wind and stuff
so um anyway I was watching my wife play
Final Fantasy 8 and I decided you know
what I should do a Q&amp;amp;A video well to be
honest I've been planning this for a
little while I was a little bit
self-conscious cuz I was like you know
there's lots of people who do like
regular Q&amp;amp;A videos I want to do this
maybe like once a month but then I
remembered this that sums it up for the
tech world today and that will shift
gears to our new segment probing Paul
where Paul answers your tech questions
so that's the name work going with for
my segment okay so I'm calling this
video series ask Paul for now but hey I
can bring probing Paul back if that is
what you guys want and this video is
truly all about what you guys want so
let's dive straight into it I have quite
a few questions to go through for today
I've I'm gonna start actually I'm gonna
start out actually with one straight
from YouTube
that's from mr. lithium 69 and this was
posted on the video that I posted
earlier this week about overclocking nan
Kay Intel skylake processors he asks
that unpopulated blank motherboard PCB
with standoffs is pretty cool I guess
this isn't really asking its anyway
anyone know what that is and there's
another there's actually a few other
questions on this video asking that same
kind of question and I can show that to
you guys right now um it's right here
although my little test bed is still on
it and basically this is it
it's a blank motherboard PCB and it has
little rubber standoffs on it I cannot
tell you guys where I got this because I
was told I'm not supposed to have this
but if you look at like a motherboard
manufacturing video they manufacture the
PCB as per the layout of all the traces
and everything like this first and then
it goes through a process called SMT
which is super multi transport know what
is SMT stand for surface mount
technology where they actually start
placing different things on there and
then they do like solder flow and all
that kind of stuff over it anyway you're
not supposed to be able get these in
this particular format with nothing on
them this came from a friend I use it as
a very easy like portable
test bed so I can just take a
motherboard and set it on top and it's
nice because it's positioned far enough
up that like dropping your graphics card
in there and stuff still works and
that's not too tough but anyway that's
what that is I actually get that
question pretty frequently so um if
anyone if you see anyone asking that
question in another video direct them
over here alright next series of
questions all come from Twitter
I'm Paul Hardware on Twitter if you guys
want to send me questions in the future
and let's start out with this one from
dual shot dual shot underscore CS asks
can you sli or crossfire two different
cards for example gtx 960 and 970 this
is a this is a tech support question and
i'm gonna be doing a few of these here
but a lot of the other questions in this
video are gonna be a little bit more
random short answer here's no nvidia has
requirements for how you can sli things
together gtx 960m GTX 970 don't go
together and videos requirements are it
has to be the exact same GPU so a gtx
960 or a gtx 970 and it also has to have
the same amount of frame buffer the same
amount of video memory that's also there
for example a gtx 960 4 gig and a gtx
960 2 gig cannot be SL ID together
beyond that of course best to have the
sli bridge directly am DS requirements
for crossfire are a little bit less
stringent AMD allows you to crossfire
cards that are in the same family not
necessarily the exact same GPU so if you
really are into crossfire and you want
more flexibility or if you already have
an existing card and you're looking to
get another card that could drop in
maybe consider AMD I guess AMD will even
go so far as to let you crossfire like
at 290 X and a 390 X together cuz
they're still based on the same GPU but
there are some vagaries in there I don't
want to go into too much detail since I
have lots of other questions to get to
you to get to you but dual shot thank
you for the question let's move on to
Reeve taylor who asks where do you see
your channel in five years a very good
question um this question probably when
i think about it makes me think mostly
about where these computer industry
especially when it comes to like
component level computer manufacturing
goes because there's been lots of
speculation for many years that the
whole the desktop is is you know
on its way out or that kind of thing I
don't necessarily believe that I think
desktops are still here for quite a bit
longer I think for people who want to
get work done and people who need to do
heavy lifting and for more advanced
stuff a lot of the wind's blowing for
more advanced stuff like like actually
doing video rendering or 3d modeling or
like VR work there's lots of uses for
full-size desktop computers so I don't
see my channel going too far away from
what its current the current topics are
as far as you know DIY PC building stuff
that kind of thing although I do want to
continue to branch out because when
eventually all computers are you know
the size of this coaster and you know
can be bought for a hundred bucks each
and you just set it there and it
wirelessly connects to everything and
manages your whole life for you and you
don't need to touch it granted that'd be
kind of cool but you know I like
tinkering so I might branch out in the
future other stuff I don't know but but
yeah hopefully in five years I'm still
doing roughly the same what I'm doing
now just with much faster hardware and
VR capability and fancier newer things I
guess okay let's move on to X I see X is
CA or BAM some BAM some MC Pro anyway
how long have you been doing PC oriented
stuff is the actual question here that
goes all the way back to gosh where
would it start my dad had a console just
like a like a keyboard and a and a like
a one of those old green CRT monitors
back when I was like 9 or 10 and he
would use it to remote into his work and
I would jump on there and I did a little
bit of like BBS stuff like back then
probably more so it started it would say
like Commodore 64 was the first like
computer that I kind of played with I
remember playing jump man junior back on
that although I didn't I never took it
apart or anything like that I started
doing PC oriented stuff as far as actual
PC oriented stuff when my dad decided to
take us out when I was like 14 which
would have been 94 not to tell you guys
how old I am or anything but I'm yeah
about 14 we we went out and got an HP
like an actual one of those flat
desktops with them where the monitor
sits on top and everything had that for
a little while I upgraded the memory in
that and
quite a few lessons in the process I
actually built my first computer when I
was 16 and then from there it just kind
of took off and I I never actually I
would always build my own computers
because I always just had more fun doing
it I like the flexibility and I like
knowing about the stuff so yeah I guess
it goes back to when I was early teens
it's kind of when I first started out
all right sneaks II Corsair asks so
what's one non PC or YouTube related
hobby that you have then he follows up
and says it's non youtube he correct
himself okay I'm gonna I'm gonna give
you three answers here one is gonna be
snowboarding even though I'm not a huge
snowboarder it is something I really
enjoy doing and I have actually planned
some trips coming up soon so maybe I'll
do some vlogging when I go snowboarding
and that kind of thing really enjoy it
again I only get to go like maybe once
or twice a season but we're gonna
Mammoth pretty soon so excited about
that second one would be guitar playing
another thing that I can do but I'm not
good at and I don't do often enough but
I enjoy playing guitar playing guitar in
a video here there before and then third
would be like hiking I guess hiking
backpacking I like I like exploring the
outdoors detaching getting out into
nature and all that good stuff so that's
another one but thanks sneak seek we're
safe for sending that in how many more
question I've got like five or six more
questions left but these are these are
more straightforward ones so I'm gonna
try to bang through them pretty quickly
geek geeky extra tech asks what video on
your channel was the video that made
your channel big this is a hard question
to answer directly because I will show
you some of the I guess more popular
videos on my channel but the real answer
here would be Newegg TV is really what
what really provided me with an existing
audience when I was doing videos for
Newegg and when I started my own channel
there was just sort of a natural flow of
people as I was like hey and I have this
video over here on my channel too where
I you know I'd say my actual opinions
and that kind of thing so that was
definitely the biggest help was starting
out with Newegg and that gave me kind of
that launching point it's one of the
things that I always bring up when
people ask me like I'm starting a new
channel what can I do and I always point
out like look I had a I had a leg up on
a lot of people by having that built an
audience with Newegg and the audience
would already go to Newegg and watching
to make videos and so they naturally see
me and all that good stuff anyway though
are the videos on my channel sorted by
popularity and hey i have a new most
popular video my best cpu for gaming
video with haswell-e comparison to sky
like and as well Wow broke 600,000 happy
about that but yeah my Titan my GTX
Titan 4 Way SLI video is very popular
for a while that's a - almost three
years old now a lot of my tutorials I
guess are very helpful doing something
that I know people will hopefully get a
lot of benefit from in a long run like
my how to clean a mechanical keyboard
video did that over a year ago but it's
still getting the regular views it's
still one of my very commonly viewed
videos and I still get comments on it
and stuff so yeah doing videos I guess
that you feel like have a longer
lifespan or that will help people for
you know an extended period of time is
often helpful in doing the comparisons
that people like to see so I couldn't a
9 64 gig first came out I did a video on
that and I specifically tailored it for
using it with GTA 5 which is very
popular at the time anyway I'm probably
going off on too much of a tangent but
those are some of the videos that's made
not a channel popular awesome Rheem lad
2k asks what got you into computers our
tech and this is a typo I'm assuming
computers or technology going back to
that other question of like how I kind
of first built my own computer and all
that kind of stuff I Legos as Legos a
good answer here I from a very early age
I really liked just kind of taking
things apart and putting them back
together from like a cassette tape like
I used to do I used to do like surgery
on cassette tapes and take the things
apart and take the cassette tapes out
and like fix like splicing together
cassettes I don't know just stuff like
that building whatever popped into my
head with Legos was always something
that kind of I felt like I had an
aptitude for earlier on in life and then
when I started working with computers I
guess I like I'm big on logic I like
things to be to make sense and be
logical and I always thought computers
made sense the way computers worked just
kind of made sense to me so I guess
those kind of things earlier on kind of
got me into that and then of course the
stuff already mentioned earlier in the
video with my dad sort of my dad my
dad's a software but he kind of started
me out
that path earlier on although now I'm
the hardware guy so he always PS
questions about hardware I get them ok
here's a Lamont Cranston question he s
will you ever do any hackintosh related
videos this I feel like also ties into
those other questions about how I
started out with technology and computer
building I would say probably not at
least not in the near future I don't
have any plans to because I don't really
work with much stuff over on the Mac
side that's been kind of intentional on
my part because I get a lot of tech
support questions and as much as I like
having a breadth of knowledge I just
kind of cut out the Mac side of it I
don't know quite a few years back simply
because I didn't want have to keep up
with both and because I have been
someone who has built my own computer
for many many years now the Mac OS was
always something like like building a
hackintosh it's easier now but like like
Apple blocked that for quite a while
they didn't want people building their
own hackintosh azure their own Mac
computers so that was I was kind of like
all right then I won't I'll just stick
with Windows and stuff like that so
that's why I really haven't done much
with hacking Tosh's again it's not
something that I would ever rule out it
might be a fun thing to kind of delve
into but I don't I don't have any plans
for it in the immediate future I guess
is the answer to that one all right I
have what four more questions okay this
one's from Swarna Vasile or at silver
sparks on Twitter one software or app
that I can't live without be it for PC
or from mobile give this some serious
consideration I was going to say
premiere because I edit all my videos on
premiere and that would be that would be
rough to live without but I have used
other editing Pro software so I will say
the software that I use to help organize
this video which was Google Docs I have
become really really invested in using
Google Docs for lots of stuff just like
I can get my laptop and type something
here and then it's just over here all
that kind of stuff I use Google Docs all
the time and I hope there's no evil
thing at the bottom of it that's
watching everything I do or something
like that Jimmy o or at plain old Jim
asks would you rather fight 1,000
forever a Kyle sized fractal Josh's or
one J's $0.02 sized nori hardware a very
good question
and I see what you were going here
before here Jim
for every Kyle or Kyle who I do the the
awesome hardware show with on Tuesday
evenings is he's very small he's a small
person but he's not like super tiny if
we're talking like you know the size of
you know like this mug or something like
that then yeah maybe I would go for the
the forever of Kyle size fractal Josh's
fractal Josh also is me he's a mean
fighter and nasty fighter so um you know
that's something to consider to see I
guess I would have to go with the Jays
to synthesize nori hardware because I
feel like a thousand fractal Josh's of
any size is just not something that that
I want to deal with ever Liam or Liam
mr. K asks how tall my I am about five
ten and a half five five eleven so I
don't know I have no idea if this is
accurate but about but a little less
than six feet tall is about 1.8 meters
for any of our friends who are viewing
this from across the pond or I guess no
not across anywhere else in the world
besides America well there's a few other
places that use the imperial system but
mostly America all right
last question here this one's from Jason
of Angelo at killer fm he's a writer of
tech articles on Forbes and lots of
other places too anyway boxers or briefs
briefs 100% always briefs sometimes I'll
wear boxer briefs but that's usually for
like working out or that kind of thing
you know when you need a little bit more
security I suppose anyway guys that's
all for this video I really hope you
have enjoyed its just answering some
random questions from all you folks out
there again I want to do this
I'm thinking maybe monthly maybe at the
end of every month a little doodle Q&amp;amp;A
section but again let me know in the
comment section down below if you're
enjoying this if you want to see it more
frequently than once a month what do you
think I should do with the title if you
think I should change it up at all but
thanks all you guys who have submitted
questions feel free to leave some more
in the comments section on YouTube and
I'll check that out before I do the next
Q&amp;amp;A video and as always thank you for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
