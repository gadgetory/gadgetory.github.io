absolutely so about a month ago I posted
a video about the state of the gaming PC
market and because it was awesome and
everyone loved it
it now has 1.1 million views and
Counting so naturally I'm capitalizing
on his popularity with a follow up video
and to counter-arguments to my own
original proposition that building a
gaming PC sucks right now no I say to me
from one month ago building a gaming PC
does not suck right now building a
gaming PC is awesome right now and here
are four reasons why first off AMD they
have done all of us a solid this year by
reintroducing Intel to the concept of
competition Rison has proven to be a
popular and solid choice for budget and
it feels really good to say this
performance gaming PC builds and the
follow up thread Ripper launch was some
really sweet icing on the cake albeit
not necessarily dedicated PC gaming
hardware there are now more viable CPU
choices on the market than there have
ever been before at the same time and
mainstream CPUs with six or eight cores
and multi-threading arrived just in time
for the rise in popularity of video
games streaming to sites like twitch or
YouTube unfortunately AMD's Vega launch
didn't give Nvidia quite the same kick
in the pants as the rise in launch gave
Intel but we'll give them a pass since
any GPU they actually launched this year
was destined to sell out or be
immediately marked up 300% anyway item
number two is me that's right let's move
on no building a gaming PC is awesome
right now of course because of me but
also because of other youtubers as well
I can't really take all the credit but
the fact is if you want to learn how to
build a computer yourself and you've
never done it before there's never been
a better or easier time to pick up this
hobby and get a system up and running
apart from the well produced generic how
to build tutorials that will guide you
through the base
steps there are specific guides to walk
you through assembly of a budget
mid-range or high-end rig with
commentary on the quirks of specific
computer cases troubleshooting tips or
even walkthroughs for advanced
techniques like custom liquid cooling
and CPU deleting reason number three is
VR and I know for those of you who have
decided that VR is lame or out of reach
financially this might not interest you
right now but it will soon and the
coolest VR experiences will be powered
by gaming PC's sure you'll find
augmented reality apps that work on a
smartphone that claim to be VR but for
actual vr gaming you need the graphics
processing power to push dual high
resolution displays one for each eye at
90 plus frames per second which is not
an easy task for a modern title we're
still a ways off from being able to
power vr gaming experience from
something like a smart phone so you can
take it on the go with you for now
though you'll probably find solutions
that involve a backpack or a short-range
wireless connection to a desktop PC if
you want to get away from the tethered
cables that the original HTC vive and
oculus rift brought us if you want to
jack into a VR experience right now
though a gaming PC is the best way to
get there and I think we're gonna see
more exciting VR options in 2018 and
finally reason number 4 is that we are
winning that's right according to this
single article that I found on the
internet which is beyond reproach 56% of
people who game spend most of their time
gaming on a PC and that makes sense as
PC gaming has become much more
mainstream in the past five to ten years
especially compared to consoles like
Xbox and Playstation it is now more rare
to see a delayed PC release of a game
that's released earlier on consoles as
distributors recognize that PC gamers
are now just a sizable portion of the
game community as console gamers if
you're looking for more evidence of the
continued success of PC gaming look at
the rise of eSports with massive TV and
live stream audiences packed arenas of
screaming fans and a multi-million
dollar prize pools
I mean ESPN even has an eSports section
on their website now soon the video
games will probably overtake the sports
ball and popularity somehow that will
benefit us all so guys those are my four
reasons why building a gaming PC is
awesome right now I just couldn't leave
you on a down note for 2017 and I had to
counter my negative video from last
month with a positive one
heck I can go on here's four more
reasons the existence of PC part picker
steam sales electric screwdrivers with
lithium-ion batteries and actually
decent stock heatsink fans like the AMD
race that we have here now this is I
guess technically this could have been
part of reason one AMD but okay I'm
giving you more reasons also aren't you
glad that none of my reasons were RGB
lighting for this video that was very
intentional also again I haven't even
mentioned that it's Black Friday week
right now so right now right now is a
great time to invest in some PC hardware
marked down for the holiday sales if you
have helped me out - feel free to click
my links in the description down below
before you shop I'll post some links to
some of my favorite parts and
accessories that I've been using this
year as well as this handy electric
screwdriver from Black &amp;amp; Decker with the
lithium-ion battery also if you're
looking for ideas for parting out a new
PC choosing all of your CPU motherboard
memory storage power supply case and all
that good stuff check out my monthly
build series I'll put a link to that as
well thank you guys so much for watching
this video subscribe to my channel if
you want to see more just like it and
