hello everyone and welcome to paul's
hardware i am paul of course and i am
back i've been kind of gone quite a few
weekends over the past month I was in
San Francisco I was in Boston I took a
trip to the desert but now I have some
time to make some more videos and to
celebrate I decided to do a little bit
of hardware porn for you guys and I say
that sure why not what I have here is
the new ITV test bed I brought it home
to do some final touches because it
worked there doing some construction
right now more on that in just a bit but
I thought I'd give you guys a nice close
up tour because currently it is
outfitted with for NVIDIA GTX Titan now
the case is probably the first thing
that stands out to you that is the in
windy frame case just did an unboxing of
this over on newegg TV it's going to be
our test bed test frame so to speak and
again I brought it home to tidy up the
cables get it camera-ready we're going
to do a video on this at work probably
next week assuming that they're done
with all of the painting and
construction they're doing right now
because we're getting a bit of an
expansion we're getting some more room
and some more space and to protect it
from all that I decided I might as well
just bring it home and finish up my
cabling again for way GTX Titans in
there so that's pretty awesome it's
probably about the best configuration
that we're going to have in this test
bed for quite some time but we've been
doing lots of testing on those and I
have one more video with benchmarks that
will be coming soon again over on new
ITV so stay tuned for that powering the
whole system is a Hercules 1600 watt
power supply by roseville you might
notice all the PCI Express cables that
are currently plugged in those are the
only thing that I didn't really tie down
too much as far as the cable management
goes and that's simply because they're
not going to be there all the time at
the center is an asus rampage for
formula motherboard kind of tying the
whole thing together it's an excellent
motherboard for both functionality as
well as overclocking now we have four by
four gigabytes of g.skill trident x ddr3
memory it's rated for speeds up to 2400
our stock speeds that we usually run it
out or 1600 for overclocking just
recently I was running at about eighteen
sixty six although I wasn't
to close attention to the memory speeds
for those particular tests our SSD with
our Windows 7 operating system is the
SanDisk Ultra Plus 256 gigabyte it's
attached thereto the back kind of tucked
out of the way and then of course the
center is an N cell core i7 3970 X CPU
so just about the fastest consumer grade
non xeon processor you can purchase
right now we're running it at stock for
the tests that were already up on newegg
TV for the upcoming ones we were running
it over clocked at 4.5 gigahertz that's
what it's set to right now that snakes
of course to the cooler which is the
cooler master seidon 120m 120 millimeter
closed loop cpu cooler but it's the
thicker radiator version no notice I was
able to actually attach it pretty nicely
to the in windy frame just using one of
the hundred and twenty millimeter fan
mats and all I had to do was turn it
sideways so that the fat parts of the
radiator can stick out and still
attached on there it actually works
quite well also running that on pull
well push-pull but I'm pulling air into
the case to give some more airflow over
the V RMS and whatnot on the motherboard
as mentioned we did do some overclocking
with this system I've been overclocking
I got it to a nice stable 4.5 gigahertz
because doing my last video with the
4-way Titans everyone said about how far
can this actually go so stay tuned again
newegg TV we'll be bringing you an
overclocking video with all the Titans
overclocked it's kind of finicky to
overclock for tightness all at once but
I was spreading them between 11 25 and
11 50 megahertz which was pretty awesome
got some pretty amazing numbers out of
it as well and then we also upped the
pixel counts by way of three NEC 30 inch
monitors 2560 by 1600 benchmarks at a
resolution of 76 x 1600 which is pretty
massive so stay tuned for that even ran
BioShock Infinite that that resolution
so got all that coming very very soon on
newegg TV but that is going to happen it
for this quick video again just want to
give you guys a close up look at all
this because some of these video cards
some of the titans are on temporary loan
I
I'm coming to the end of my time with
him which is very sad but it's been
really cool to play with all that
hardware and see what kind of
performance if you get also a kind of
power draw you need the 1600 watts is
definitely warranted under peak load it
was pushing past thirteen hundred watts
which is a lot of wattage but for the
amount of power gets Titans actually not
even that bed there's a closer look at
the newegg TV testbed which I currently
have here at home you've been watching
Paul's hardware thank you very much guys
for a brain with me over the past month
because i don't have been posting quest
many videos i should have more for you
coming very soon so stay tuned thanks
for watching we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
