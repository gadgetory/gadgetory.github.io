welcome to Paul's hardware I am super
excited because I have just powered on
my new system for the very first time
and everything seems to working
fantastically of course you guys haven't
seen any of the work I've been doing
today but that's what this video is all
about now last week I posted a video and
I asked you guys what you wanted to see
with my new personal build did you want
to see you tutorial did you want to see
like a speed through of everything and
the response was overwhelming it was
really the number of comments and
everything I got was was really really
amazing to me so thank you guys to
everyone who commented there and it was
also very mixed some people wanted this
tutorial some people wanted to speed
through so I decided why not do both so
I have a new overhead webcam thing set
up that I've been using today to do a
time-lapse of all the stuff I'd been
doing today which includes building this
system as well as shooting all of the
footage I need to do the tutorial for
how to build the system so for today the
time-lapse showing you the whole
assembly process and I apologize if it's
low points because I am doing a lot of
filming at the same time and then also
I'm going to be doing a tutorial but
that's going to take a lot longer to
edit so you guys have this for now I'm
going to do some final close-up sexy
shots of the system to show you guys the
finished product and stay tuned for the
tutorial coming as soon as I can
possibly get edited but thank you guys
for watching this video thanks to all
the amazing feedback on my personal
build so far don't forget to hit the
thumbs up button and like the video and
also leave me a comment and let me know
what you want me to add to this because
I have something yeah remember these
these are my LEDs that I bought in
Taiwan I still have some of them I've
used some of them already but I have
blue and I have weight and I don't know
what I should put in here so let me know
what you guys think blue or white I'm
kind of leaning towards whites but let
me know what you guys think what color
for the LEDs and here is the time-lapse
of everything I did today
enjoy
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
