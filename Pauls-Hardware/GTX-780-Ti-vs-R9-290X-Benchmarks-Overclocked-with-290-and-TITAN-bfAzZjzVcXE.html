hardware thanks for stopping by today I
think you'll be glad that you did
because I have a GeForce GTX 780 Ti
graphics card just here to my left so
today's video I'm going to be taking you
through some of the detailed specs of
the card giving you a nice close up look
of it and Kyle actually ran some
benchmarks on this card I was able to
coerce him into entering his benchmark
numbers onto my shared spreadsheet so
I'll be sharing us some competitive
competitive benchmark numbers as well so
thanks to Kyle for his 780ti benchmarks
if you want to check out Kyle's channel
he's probably doing a video on this as
well over on his channel
awesomesauce news so go ahead and click
the link if you want to see more of Kyle
in the meantime now let's go ahead and
take a closer look at Nvidia's newest
GPU now physically you're probably going
to notice that this card bares a
striking resemblance to the GTX Titan
the GTX 780 and the GTX 770 basically
it's just about exactly the same card
you've got the same PCB it's a PCB
layout the GPU is still based on the
gk110 although it is the maximum size
possible for that particular piece of
silicon and then they've also gone and
made some a few more slight adjustments
you might notice the title of the card
itself gtx 780 Ti is has some dark
printing on it
so it stands out a bit more and then
they've also gotten the well done what
looks like a bit of powder coating on
the aluminum fins underneath the
see-through window that you can see
right there so it gives it kind of a
darker look to it and I'd say probably
fitting for what is most likely going to
be the last card at least of a flagship
nature from this series
apart from that you'll notice all of the
familiar trappings six pin and eight pin
PCI Express graphics connectors dual sli
connectors for SLI configurations and
then the dark black PCB on the back and
the black and silver heatsink shroud
over the top the geforce gtx logo will
still light up and you can configure the
different lighting
options using nvidia software and then
at the back of the card you'll see your
video outs you've got a couple dual link
DVIs the HDMI and a full-size
DisplayPort full-sized HDMI and
full-sized of DisplayPort which are very
nice connection options internally we're
basing this card on five graphics
processing clusters still using the same
architecture again it's still based on
the gk110 that you recognize from the
titan we have 15 streaming multi
processors and that gives us a total of
two thousand eight hundred and eighty
CUDA cores more so than that 780 or the
Titan you also get 960 double precision
CUDA cores so heck I don't know what an
Nvidia is thinking or if they're
planning on selling any more titans
because at the price that this card is
which is $700 at launch it's pretty much
gonna smack the Titan around you'll see
that coming up in the benchmarks here at
240 texture units 48 ROP units and then
we're running at a base clock of 875
megahertz
a booth clock of 928 megahertz and you
will see frequencies beyond that thanks
to GPU boost 2.0 the memory is running
at 7,000 megahertz you get three gigs of
it
it's gddr5 memory of course and it's on
a 384 bit memory interface it gives you
a total memory bandwidth of 336
gigabytes per second a texture filtering
rate of 210 gig of texels per second and
this is still based on the 28 nanometer
fabrication process that is also known
as the Kepler architecture you get 7.1
billion transistors in this card it's a
dual slot form factor and they're
recommending a 600 watt power supply at
minimum for this card in your entire
system the TDP of the card itself is 250
Watts out of the box the card is going
to run at about 80 to 83 degrees Celsius
that is its temperature target so that's
what it's going to try to hit and next
up we're gonna look at some benchmarks
as promised I'm also going to talk a
little bit about overclocking and the
overclocking was kind of added late to
this video which is why you might notice
I don't mention it at the end of the
video I'm only gonna talk
now but here's a look at my precision X
settings from the EVGA precision X
utility I did a really really quick
overclock on this I did not have much
time to mess with the settings I had
kind of an idea in my head that I went
forward and I was able to find out that
the 780 I have really overclocked like a
dream or at least the one that we have
does I was able to get a 20% GPU
overclock so basically I took it from
876 to 1076 and the boost clock went all
the way up to 1219 megahertz so that was
pretty huge I did a little bit on the
memory to a 5% memory overclock to get
it up to 7400 and then when I actually
ran my benchmarks I didn't even that I
was doing it so quickly I hit the wrong
button so I prioritized the power target
rather than the temperature target I was
trying to do a temperature target of 88
degrees Celsius but with my OC settings
that card maxed out at 85 degrees
Celsius so just a couple degrees hotter
fan speed was pretty minimal like not
much difference from running the card at
stock and I got some pretty huge numbers
which you'll see in a second I am going
to include my 290x overclocked benchmark
numbers as well
the 290x had a 5% memory overclock and a
7 % GPU overclock so the GPU on the 290x
in these benchmarks was running at 1070
so here is all of the benchmark scales
on the 780 Ti and my benchmarks and my
overclocked 780ti benchmarks and I
notice there's a lot of talk lately
about you know should we show
overclocked benchmark so should we show
stock the reference benchmarks well I
was like hey why not show both that's
that's what I'm gonna do so here you go
so now that you've taken a look at some
benchmarks it should be pretty clear the
780ti is just about the fastest single
GPU card that's currently available that
includes the GTX Titan and it's
definitely going beyond to the
performance of the 290 X or whatever the
290 X is capable of right now now that
brings us to the next question which is
going to be price to performance or
relative comparison because that's
always what you want is the best bang
for your buck and as you might expect
from a top to your card Nvidia is
charging a top-tier price $700 for this
card is their manufacturers recommended
price and that's pretty expensive this
is definitely going to remain in the
upper echelons of folks who make really
high-end gaming systems for the time
being it's gonna be one of those cards
that you lust after and maybe never ever
get to actually mess around with I'm
lucky enough to have had one here so big
thanks to Nvidia for providing us the
cards for Newegg and I guess if you want
to leave me some feedback down in the
comment section below I'd like to hear
what you think about this card
especially when you're compared to the
290x so 290x has a lot going for it when
you comes to price and performance and
the 298 $400 is a really really good
value so Nvidia does have a lot of
competition from AMD even if Andy's top
cards can't match the 780 Ti right now
but all that being said I'd love to hear
your feedback so go ahead and leave me
some down in the feedback section below
a like or a dislike or a comments I'd
love to hear what you had to say thanks
a lot for watching this video don't
