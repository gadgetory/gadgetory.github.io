hardware this is hopefully the
long-awaited final build log for Riptide
the system right here which costs well
over $10,000 especially when you include
all the water cooling parts I have been
building this over the past month or
month and a half and it's been a lot of
work things haven't all gone smoothly
but fortunately I think today I have
things all figured out for the final
steps the RC 100m vme SSD and XS 700
portable SSD are both powered by
Toshiba's advanced 3d BICS flash memory
meaning you get solid-state speeds at an
affordable price the XS 700 is a wicked
fast external drive with USB 3.1 gen2
via a type-c connector and the SE 100
may be small but it's MDOT to nvme
interface means sequential read and
write speeds at well over 1,000
megabytes per second click the sponsor
link in the description to learn more so
let's start off by going over some of
this stuff I got some stuff arrived in
the mail I got a cobalt drill bit set
that can easily drill through metal I
wanted some smaller ones of these more
on that in just a second I also got this
little water bottle with a squirter top
and this is hopefully to make it a
little bit easier to fill on the top
since I do not have a dedicated fill
port but in the part 4 video where
everything went wrong the main issues
were in this area with the pumps and the
reservoirs I have these cool helix
reservoirs from alpha cool alpha cool
pretty much provided all of the water
cooling parts in this build and these
are separate they're not part of the
actual pump unit down there so Eadie's a
fitting to connect it up and I was
figuring out different ways of doing
that down here after thinking I had
everything figured out I realized that
there are actually holes on the bottom
of these reservoirs as well and the
plugs that I need to put on those or
spacing them off from the pumps back
here and that made it not sit right but
I have a solution for that and I think I
also have a solution for the pump for
mounting themselves so I got the other
reservoir here just like I'm trying to
kind of show you guys there's a 90
degree down at the bottom and this is
actually the old configuration that I
had set up my solution configuration is
basically just to flip the 90 degrees so
that the rotary parts actually on this
side and I'm just using a different
rotary extender on this side which gives
it a little bit more height and gives
clearance so I can put the caps on the
bottom and it actually sits on there and
that's actually sitting there pretty
cleanly but even with it sitting here
roughly where it would be vertically the
90 degree at the top too
not have clearance and I'm gonna need a
ninety-degree coming off at the top of
both of these to get liquid back in as
part of the loop now fortunately this
entire unit can come off because there
is a base plate here that it's connected
up to that everything is mounted to and
I actually really like this base plate I
like that everything is contained on it
and I like the after everything is set
up I should be able to remove this whole
combo unit by itself if I need to adjust
anything or get behind it or anything
like that but here though I can show you
the spacing of this adapter up here and
this is the solution from the things
going wrong in the first build and with
those spacers there you can see it's
sitting pretty much flush and pretty
much vertical and that's really all I
wanted was for it to be able to sit like
that so I can do that with both of these
pumps and both of those reservoirs and
then in order to solve my vertical
clearance issue I have of course the
drill bits that are over here and that
is simply to drill some new holes on
these metal mounts to alpha cool
provided and the goal be to lower the
pumps by I'm gonna say about a half of
an inch or so so I need to drill new
holes right about there I should be able
to do that on all sides even this back
one here that's holding both of them up
and then I will be able to lower these
pumps to take advantage of some of the
clearance that's down there at the
bottom as you can probably see I'll
still need to leave enough space so that
the wire can come back out of there
which it can bend a little bit but that
should give me enough space so that up
at the top I have enough clearance for
that 90 degree if I can get all that set
up I think I will be on the homestretch
of just doing the final bends that I
need to cut and get plumbed up here and
there and then I can actually fill
things up so all of that said it's time
to get to work once again on Riptide
well it is next morning so it is an
ideal time for a little little
pick-me-up a little wakeup juice most
delicious actually Joe discovered this
is this is just Red Bull without the
cool label on it but let's take a look
at the system so as you may have seen
last night I'm Anna to get both loops
all set up and filled it was very fun
very challenging was that pretty late so
that's why I'm a little tired this
morning but thankfully there are no
leaks so my paper towel stuff in here
didn't pick up anything as far as I
could tell so then I'm pretty happy with
all of the tubing runs that I have I was
trying to keep them relatively simple
but like you know I have this idea of
how it should look in my head from how
hard line goes I wanted everything to be
pretty smooth straight curves from here
to there the only thing I think I might
redo is potentially this one back here
I'm actually kind of holding that in
place with a couple velcro pieces which
I just use a screw to actually screw
into the radiator to hold it in place
which is okay for now that run is a
little bit more challenging because I
still have to be able to access the
front radiator drawer thingy there and
be able to pull that out and push it
back in so that needs to be able to kind
of come out and move back in with it but
for now I think everything's looking
pretty good so I have one last major job
to do on this before I can sort of
finish off this video and maybe give you
guys some sexy b-roll and that is the
cable management wherever kids don't
forget to plug in your SATA cables
before you install your graphics cards
here's a small dilemma I wasn't quite
expecting our SF 600 small form-factor
mini ATX power supply needs to provide
power to the four hard drives for the
NASA build it actually has a peripheral
cable here with four SATA cables on it
but the cable length between the plug on
the power supply side and where our hard
drive stop is not long enough this is
the only cable the SATA that comes in
the kit so I could of course use these
molex plugs that comes with one of those
as well and just use some adapters but
decided to take this old and slightly
crappy PCI Express power cable extension
from Rosewell I'm gonna snip these off
and then use that to extend this far
enough to be able to plug those in
quite a few people with earlier videos
as well as some of the pictures I've
posted have complained about this sli
bridge which is just the default one
that comes with the zenith extreme in
there so I'm upgrading to an aftermarket
SLI bridge high-bandwidth sli bridge
there's a few of them on the market I'm
not a huge fan of the aesthetics the
looks of a lot of them I've used the
Asus one already on an Arctic Panther so
I wanted to go something different this
is the zotac high bandwidth SLI bridge
dual card spacing it's got a nice sort
of matte finish it's just plastic and
this little Oh lights up in white so
even though I have no ZOTAC products in
this build I think this will look much
better well ok ok ZOTAC what did you do
ah ok for reasons unknown to me though
Tech has put these little ridges on the
top of the SLI things that's conflicting
with our blocks you think I like how
this looks though so I think I can
modify this I'm gonna get the rotary
tool out one more time
alright guys I have done quite a few
builds on this channel and there's
always a moment of truth at the end of
each one where we power it on for the
first time and I have never been more
excited / nervous I think than this one
right here so I have two systems to
power around I'm going to start off with
the small system here in the back that
will just make sure that my fan
configuration is working properly it's
already got lights on the motherboard so
things are looking good there's a little
power alright we've got fans on that we
got a rear exhaust fan back here and
just as planned we also have two of the
front and takes the bottom most ones
providing some air intake so that will
provide some fresh air for the hard
drives there as well as some area to
come back here to cool off this system
while it's up and running and then of
course a little bit of exhaust up at the
top now let's power on the big guy it's
always more intimidating when it has a
special style plug that you can only
plug in one-way lights on the
motherboard
Oh glorious
hmm we have water flowing in both pumps
hope to god there's no leak still going
huh that's that's cool
alright guys given how nervous I was
about all of the complexity and various
parts installed in here and the water
cooling loop and everything I'd say this
is a pretty successful first boot of
course I've got nothing plugged in back
here so who knows maybe none of this
hardware actually works but things are
looking up for now now I know there's a
few things that I still haven't handled
for example I never swapped in the blue
coils here and the helix reservoirs to
see how those look that's still a
possible thing that I can do though
thanks to all the quick disconnects and
everything this is not that challenging
of a loop to disassemble if I need to
get in there to do more stuff the cable
management however is fairly challenging
but at least everything's wired up and
fits in there and everything seems to be
working now you might have noticed that
there's a couple inserts for these helix
reservoirs is actually a UV cathode that
goes in there and I broke the one on the
left one so right now those aren't
connected but I might be adding a little
bit more color to that area I'm gonna
plug those in once we get a replacement
in and see how that looks
but I could also of course use more
suggestions so if you guys have any
feedback for me aesthetically if you
think it needs more lights in this area
or that area let me know how you think
this tubing looks actually now that the
lights are on it with the frosted look I
think that looks really cool but guys
I'm gonna end this video with a bit of a
montage of Riptide and it's at least
initial finished form thank you so much
for sticking with me through this build
series and of course the thumbs up
button and subscribe because I will have
at least one more follow up video on
this where I actually get the system up
and running test some of the parts and
the NASS and all of that good stuff
thanks again for watching guys and we'll
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
