the description to learn more hey guys
how's it going and welcome to probing
Paul episode number 24 we've made it to
two dozen this is my monthly Q&amp;amp;A video
there's really not too much to say
beyond that it's pretty straightforward
you guys ask me questions I answer them
I do this every month so check the
playlist if you want to see prior
questions asked in Prior months and I
will do my best to make a bit of time
Stamper e to go down in the comment
section below so check that out if you
want to jump to a specific question
let's get right into it though with my
first question from totally not Paul it
says hey Paul you're looking a bit
unkempt how about a haircut and a shave
also any thoughts on planned product
obsolescence very good question Paul
very timely glad you asked this question
right now because I do make videos to
put on the internet on YouTube and
sometimes other places too and I do
typically take a glance in the mirror
before I jump on camera and I usually
usually try to make sure I've shaved or
giving myself a haircut but I don't
shave all the way I don't actually have
a raise or anything like that I use just
a beard mustache trimmer and every two
three days I just kind of trim it all up
down there that's why you probably have
never seen me actually clean-shaven
because I don't think I've been
clean-shaven since probably my wedding
but um sure it's started here this is my
beard mustache trimmer it's a Braun BT
5050 and this has just died or at least
becoming usable which sucks because I
had the previous model before this and
it lasted me like four years and this
one is now like it's they usually self
sharpening but the blades have gotten
really dull and the batteries just
pretty much kicked the bucket after
about a year so that sucks
I hate wood products that used to be
good now become crappy with a new
version and what manufacturer and the
right man would mind would be like hey
boss I have a great idea let's make our
product crappier that'll give people a
great opinion of it in the future so not
going with Braun anymore for beard and
moustache trimmers let's move on though
they remainder other questions were
taken from the comments section
last month's probing Paul video first
one here from Nico says Paul would you
buy a minor used card basically a mining
GPU a graphics card that some
cryptocurrency miner has taken and used
for months or maybe a couple years in a
crypto mining setting and now they want
to sell it because they've gotten all
their money out of it and now crypto
mining is harder and so they want to
make some money back is that card still
worth buying there's a few factors to
consider here and there's really no
direct yes or no answer if the price is
right I guess would be the best answer I
could give you and hopefully prices will
keep coming down as they have in the
past month or two for graphics cards not
just new ones but also use once and if
crypto mining does become really
ineffective on graphics cards we might
see a flood of used graphics cards on
the market so if you're looking at like
half of what MSRP originally was for
something I can used mining graphics
card that I would say go for it because
your investment to your risk is
significantly less but there are three
factors I would consider when buying a
used card and bear in mind you're buying
a card on a used market so you're gonna
have to trust whoever selling it to you
to be honest with how they used it and
everything so number one was it
overclocked if it was overclocked
especially if additional voltage was
applied for an extended period of time I
would not buy that card simply because
overclocking especially with additional
voltage is the best way to basically run
out to a CPU or GPU lifespan and make it
die much faster number two would be a
question about the other power delivery
components on the board depending on the
board's quality and the quality of the
components used certain products are
more prone to failing more quickly than
others capacitors the little cylindrical
shaped things are what often you'll see
bulge and eventually pop and die now
good graphics card will use nicer
capacitors that have a much longer
lifespan but it's something that I would
visually look at on the card check the
caps indefinitely and make sure none of
them are bulging before you buy it if
you have that opportunity
the third thing would be to test out the
cooling solution basically the fans if
the fans have been running for a very
long time non-stop and the card has been
working the whole time then the fan life
might have degraded now fans are a
little bit more viable as far as being
able to like swap out fans and maybe get
the card back up and running again so
there again it would default back to how
much are you paying for this card but
any time you buy a used graph
scarred or any used computer component
you are taking a risk so balance that
risk with the price reduction that
you're getting by buying a used
component and also reality check double
check how much you would be able to buy
something for brand-new and then make
your judgment based on that next
question here from Andrew Swire and I
positioned this one as the next question
because it's kind of a follow-up to the
previous one but the question is how
much degradation does overclocking due
to a components this particular question
is as the guard's to a friend of his who
wants to overclock but isn't sure if
they want to because they're worried
about reducing the lifespan of their
components and that's a perfectly viable
fear and my advice to your friend here
would be go ahead and give it a shot
because as long as you're not cranking
up the voltage you're not going to have
much chance of actually damaging your
components with modern computer builds
and over CPU overclocking the computer
is going to shut itself off or basically
fail to boot before it allows you to do
anything that will actually damage that
hardware and unless you're like you know
wiring things up yourself or something
like that
once you've done some overclocking and
then you kind of hit a wall with the
clock speed you're able to hit then the
idea comes to you like oh if I increase
the voltage then maybe I can increase
the clock speed and yes you can this is
why if I'm overclocking I usually test
out some higher overclocks and test out
some increased voltage and then
eventually if I'm looking for something
long-term I adjust the voltage back down
to what it ships at stock or maybe
slightly above or even slightly below if
you can get away with it that's actually
a really cool thing to do and then find
myself a clock speed that you know is
higher than what it ships at but still
not crazy high to the point where I'm
worried about it running really hot all
the time because those are the two
things you want to avoid higher voltage
over an extended period of time and
higher heat over an extended period
period of time so this is another reason
why it's actually a little bit easier to
overclock in the winter versus the
summer because ambient temps might be a
little bit lower but hopefully that
feedback gives you a little bit better
idea of what to do moving forward but
give overclocking a try I waited way too
long to start overclocking in my
personal PC building career and once I
actually tried it I realized it's not
that difficult and it's really hard to
actually damage stuff unless you're
really doing things strangely for some
reason so give it a shot let me know how
it goes next question is from Mauro
wheat 23 and I actually responded to
this question last month but I'm going
respond to it here again he says why are
some of your videos 1080p some 1080p 60
and some 4k is there any rhyme or reason
to that now there is first off I
shouldn't be posting any videos that are
just 1080 anymore my live stream should
be 1080 60 and then beyond that I go
either 1080 60 or 4k the decision for me
is often based on the type of video so
recently I've been doing vlogs from time
to time because it helps me get stuff
done while also making a video and for
vlogging I have been using the rx100
mark 5 from Sony and I got this because
it's got the flip up screen great for
vlogging can do face tracking focusing
and not all that kind of stuff it's a
cool little camera and it shoots 4k but
it overheats when shooting 4k so you can
only shoot clips that are a few minutes
long so I've gotten used to using this
camera and then I realized that it's
more effective to use this camera if I
need to shoot a lot of footage at 1080
60 so for that reason 1080 60 is what I
go for for this 1080 60 is the capture
method that I have set up for these
videos so that's what this video should
be going at as well and then beyond that
if I'm doing anything where I'm trying
to get crisper cleaner footage of like a
case or a build or something like that
those I usually do 4k and I'm filming
more more often with my gh4 or my G H 5
H 5 which I'm filming this with right
now can do anything up to 4k 60fps so
probably what I'm eventually going to
move everything to is 4k 60 frames per
second next question is from Blakey 23
and this kind of relates to the previous
question he's asking if films display 24
frames per second that's usually what
films are recorded at why does 30 frames
per second in a game look awful and he
says he could easily Google this but
he'd rather hear it from me well Blake I
googled this just just to make sure I
wasn't feeding you any bad information
here so the 24 frames per second thing
basically goes back to the introductory
of filmmaking videography in general and
when they were developing film cameras
that take the photons going in and it
exposed it on an emulsification layer on
film that was in a camera that went by
you know cameras work point being they
were trying to find a frame rate that
was good enough that it would fool the
eye into thinking there was video going
on but slow enough that it was cheaper
because the more film you exposed the
more you had to develop and that was
money so they were trying to find the
way to make film and 24 frames per
second was what they decided on was okay
now interestingly enough even though
films were filmed at 24 frames per
second back then they were actually
projected at 48 frames per second they
would do two exposures for each frame of
the film now bringing this back to
modern times you probably noticing this
if you play video games because for me
the jump from thirty to sixty was most
noticeable when going from a game to not
a game and a big reason here that you're
noticing that more of something like a
video game is the responsiveness like if
you're doing something like playing a
game or even something as simple as
moving a mouse cursor across the screen
it's updating either 30 times per second
if it's 30 Hertz or 60 times per second
if it's 60 Hertz or 60 frames per second
the smoothness is just so noticeable
when you're actually taking something
and physically moving it around the
screen or if you're playing a game where
the responsiveness is important their
smoothness is also important when you're
say playing something like a
first-person game with lots of movement
going around updating the edges of the
screen keeping it from looking choppy
that's a very important thing for
something like playing a video game and
we compare that to something like film
and cinematography even within the
modern day there is something I think of
an aesthetic nostalgia for the way film
originally was 24 frames per second so
people refer to it as the cinematic look
or something like that which I can
appreciate and I definitely still
appreciate just fine 24 frames per
second and film work and stuff like that
and it really comes down to an aesthetic
choice also there is something of a
stigma with the higher framerate stuff
like The Hobbit was shot at 48 frames
per second I believe and a lot of people
got here today with that because it
gives you what's often referred to as as
the soap opera effect everything looks
too sharp and too crisp and it almost
makes things look fake ultimately though
I think it's just up to the individual
to decide what they like better when it
comes to viewing something like a movie
but definitely when it comes to games
higher framerate is always better 60 or
above for me and I'm getting to the
point where a hundred or above is even
better 144 Hertz the refresh rate
monitors are super nice and if you can't
afford one and you have a system that
can power one I highly recommend
checking one out thank you for your
question though next question is from
Peter KJ Richter this is a very long
question I'm not going to read the whole
thing but it's up here if you guys want
to read it thank you for your thanks at
the ends to all of us who make tech
channel videos and everything but the
questions here in the middle he's
basically talking about him and his
friends upgrading pcs they're maybe a
little bit older and how practical a one
or two generation old system is
specifically here a z2 70 or h2 70
system with something like a 6th gen CPU
so Peter my advice here would be double
check the current prices of new stuff
because there are benefits to getting
new things they're usually a little bit
faster and usually a little bit more
feature-rich the bino gets you other
benefits too such as a warranty from a
manufacturer so you can return a product
and get it replaced if you need to that
said you're talking about buying
computer parts the way I usually buy
cars which is I usually buy cars that
are 2 to 5 years old that have already
lost their depreciation value from
driving off the light lot and I try to
get a nice bang for the buck balance
between something that's relatively new
but maybe not new new and something that
will get the job done and of course
something that is maybe a little bit
easier on the wallet so yes
6th gen CPUs are still totally viable
even the newest stuff hasn't increased
that much in performance what you're
really gonna be stuck with though is
quad-core so that's your limiting factor
when you're talking specifically about Z
270 and H 270 there are no six core CPUs
available on that platform so if you
eventually down the line need more CPU
processing horsepower you're gonna need
to upgrade your entire system or your
friends gonna need to upgrade their
entire system just totally ok though if
the system was a bargain upfront then in
a couple years you'll probably be in a
position to upgrade it too so yes Peter
I think your friends will be satisfied
with that option just again double check
the current prices of new stuff before
you go and spend money unused components
a couple more questions these are less
tech related but first from Steve
Sanders Paul are you more Dread Pirate
Roberts or a Viggo Montoya this is
assuming Kyle will be the other and
there may be a reason that I wore this
shirt today
but I don't know if you asked this
question because of this shirt or it's
just perfect that your question provided
me a great opportunity to plug my store
guys if you gotta buy store stuff merch
for me we go to pulsar Burnett it's
linked in the video's description and
this is an awesome hardware shirt and I
am Dread Pirate Roberts and Kyle's inigo
montoya so Dread Pirate Roberts that's
what I go for actually dressed as
pat roberts or the man in black or
Wesley from Princess Bride for when I
was in third grade for Halloween
most of the people didn't know who I was
but I'm still a big fan of Princess
Bride and that's probably who I go with
although inigo montoya does also have a
pretty cool backstory but um I guess it
forced to choose I go with the Dread
Pirate Roberts final question here is
from Gonzo's twin one and he asked Paul
do you use elevators or stairs it's a
good question I originally thought this
question with escalator or stairs and it
reminded me of my favorite Mitch Hedberg
joke which is elevator when the elevator
breaks down when the escalator breaks
down it just turns into stairs escalator
has become stairs sorry for the
convenience I don't quite have the
delivery the Mitch Hedberg does to say
that joke properly but it's funny joke
anyway my I have a two floor rule with
elevators versus stairs if I'm going up
two floors I take the stairs beyond that
elevators okay and I also apply this
rule to other people who might be
writing the elevator with me when I was
in college I lived in a 12 story
building and anytime anyone got on the
elevator we were up on the 11th floor
anytime anyone got an elevator trying to
go to the second or third floor we just
stink-eye them the whole time like you
lazy piece of garbage use the stairs
you're taking time away from us getting
upstairs to play more video games but
guys that is pretty much all the time I
have for probing Paul for this month so
check out my peel box or here is my peel
box I guess I should say so if you guys
happen to want to send me anything we
usually do mail time on the live show
which is every Tuesday evening at 5:30
p.m. Pacific time with me and Kyle so if
you want to send stuff please go ahead
and do that I also put that in the
description of every single video that I
post but until next time thank you for
watching probing Paul I'll be back with
more tech videos so don't forget to
thumbs up button and subscribe of course
if you want to see more thanks again for
watching guys and we'll see you next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
