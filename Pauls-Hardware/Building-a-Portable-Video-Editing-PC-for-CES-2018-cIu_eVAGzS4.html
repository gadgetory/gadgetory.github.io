hey guys how's it going and welcome to
Pauls hardware this is my first video of
2018 and I'm actually off to a bit of a
slow start this year mainly because I
started the year off by being 6 so sorry
if I'm still a little bit congested but
this coming week is CES 2018 I've been
going there for the past 7 8 9 year I
don't know how long I've been going to
see yes very long time
but it's always exciting to go to CES
because it's in Las Vegas there's lots
of new technology it's a great way to
kind of get a feel for the new products
and stuff that are going to be coming
out in 2018 so stay tuned because I
gotta have a full week of coverage
coming at you guys next week as soon as
I make my way out to Las Vegas and if
any you guys happen to be there and you
see me around feel free to say hello
other than that though we are of course
gonna be editing videos while we're in
Las Vegas so to that ends I am once
again constructing a video editing PC
that we can take on the road with us
over to Las Vegas to get all these edit
videos edited in a timely fashion now
the first thing you guys might notice is
that this is an intel-based system this
is the RG Strix C 370 - I gaming for
most of the parts that I'm using today I
was just sort of scrounging stuff that I
have available here in the office this
is actually one of my only mini ITX
motherboards and of course I need a mini
ITX motherboard because I'm reusing the
famed and infamous and very difficult to
find Corsair graphite 380 T case not
very good for taking if you need to fly
somewhere but if you're able to carry it
via the handle on top very convenient
case to have and I like it it's the
white version in that we're gonna put
the motherboard and if any of you guys
are saying hey Paul or aren't you man
with a risin build for this because
Rison has a little bit higher core
counts and a little bit higher raw CPU
performance available on it the fact is
I don't really have a mini ATX rising
motherboard available to me right now I
put mine the one one that I had from
gigabyte and these systems that I built
for Rachel earlier this year so that's
where that is so long story short Intel
based system z 370 motherboard and then
the processor is going to be of course
8700 K
for any of you guys who were worried
about that I lost my 8730 a I found it
yes that's going in there so 6 cores 12
threads just slightly less than what we
could get with a risin eight core 16
thread system but instead should get the
job done just fine now we're gonna need
a nice storage array configuration here
so I got the 960 Pro from Samsung 512
gig that's gonna have the operating
system Adobe Premiere and basic files on
it for additional storage we've got a
Toshiba TR 200 SSD this is a 480 gig
version of that so that's probably gonna
act as a scratch disk and for additional
assets and that kind of thing and then
I've got a SanDisk Ultra - this is a 1
terabyte SSD this is where raw footage
is going to go so that you give us a
nice assortment of drives lots of
storage and different drives to put
different things on which is very
helpful when you're video editing and I
have the 1070 TI here this has been used
in just a few recent builds that I've
done here in the channel but this is
EVGA gtx 1070 TI it's a fairly small GPU
so that's one of the nice things about
it good cooler and I did have some GTX
1080s around but I couldn't find them so
this will get the job done just fine for
video editing you also want as much
memory as possible so I got the corsair
dominator platinum ddr4 3000 kit this is
a 2 by 16 gig kit so even though we've
only got two DIMM slots available on our
motherboard over here we are still gonna
have 32 gigs of memory which should
hopefully be enough for Jo as long as he
doesn't get into After Effects anything
or anything like that
to cool the CPU we've got the cryo rig
h7 quad Lumi sorry it's it's in its
unboxed state right now because I just
pulled it off of another system but
that'll keep our CPU nice and cooled
8700 K probably I'm gonna do too much
overclocking or anything since it
already runs at a pretty high frequency
and then of course a 380 T case so there
are our parts let's assemble this get it
all put together so we can start loading
it up and preparing it for CES
it definitely helps when you're building
a system if you've already built that
system before have used several of the
components in here internally and a few
other systems just recently and we
realized that this build is actually
pretty much a recreation of the build
that we did about a year ago for CES
2017 so it's got upgraded Hardware in
there of course and it still all fits in
there so there's been no changes to the
380 T from Corsair so any of you guys
are still looking to pay grossly
overpriced prices for this because if
you look on eBay or whatever they like
really expensive yeah probably not the
most practical thing but there you can
see our car rig h7 in there we get a
little bit of our GB accents although
that wasn't really the goal from the
motherboard as well so that's nice to
have other than that there's actually
plenty of room still in there this case
is made to support some amounts of water
cooling and there's even a radiator
bracket that you can see right here on
the side although we're not making use
of that going with a strictly air-cooled
system and the front you got the intake
fan and then over here where this side
goes on will be the inside intake for
the graphics card now with this powered
on it's actually very quiet not doing
any scientific tests right now but just
anecdotally quite quiet and of course
the EVGA gtx 1070 TI we're using does
have the zero fan mode so since the GPU
isn't warm the fans aren't spinning I
was able to put two of the SSDs our 2.5
inch SSDs right down here and the little
caddies that goes with and then we did
add a 4 terabytes WD red drive that was
sort of a late addition also neglected
to mention the power supply for this
build with CVG a 650 GQ also been used
with several different builds that I've
done just recently but thankfully
although we were very limited on front
to back space it's really crammed up
against the drive cage right there I pre
installed all the modular cables so we
had everything connected that we needed
to and then was just able to wedge it up
against there and still had enough space
to rat around the rest of the cables the
last thing we discovered is reporting
this together is that the motherboard
the ergy Strix Z 370 - I gaming actually
did already have a samsung 960 Pro nvme
SSD fiber and 12 gig even pre-installed
I had so I didn't forget that that was
in there I told
that was in there the whole time so we
left that as is and that will be our
operating system drives so last thing to
do is just pop the side panels back on
here and then of course get everything
loaded when it comes to Windows and
Adobe Premiere and any other software we
need maybe scene games to speak a gaming
system and guys it's gonna wrap it up
for this build video this has been my
build for editing at CES 2018 very
similar to my build for editing its yes
2017 but very nice to have a portable
case like a 380 t from Corsair so we can
haul it over there since I will be
driving anyway if you guys are gonna be
in Las Vegas next week and you see me
around definitely say hello thanks to
all you guys who have watched this video
and hope subscribe to my channel and
20:17 got a lot of stuff coming for you
this year so stay tuned hit the thumbs
up button on your way out and we'll see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
