youtube channel and welcome to another
time lapse video of my saturday
afternoon now I've done one of these are
ready and I got some really good
feedback on it so thanks for watching
that one you guys thanks for all of the
positive feedback by the way and I've
decided to do another one even though
honestly this one isn't too much
different from the last I do want to
continue to do these but I do want to
find some ways to mix them up so for now
here's this and as you can see I've
already gotten started with shooting
some more b-roll this is the cooler
master Neptune 240m that you might have
seen the video posted on probably
sometime last week depending on when
this video actually goes up I've also
got my tablet running up there in the
corner might notice i'm watching
watching logan there and text into kit
actually got a pretty cool tablet
extendo holder arm that i'm using right
there but you can kind of see the box
for at the very beginning of this but
yeah as I continue along i'm just going
to be shooting more and more close-up
video of the cooler master neptune 240m
nice a little cooler I've liked it so
far I want to do some more testing with
it and stuff and let me know if you guys
think that's like another cpu cooler
liquid cpu cooler roundup would be good
for you guys to see because i wouldn't
mind doing another one of those and
refreshing my numbers from last year's
video that one did pretty well alright i
think i'm just about wrapping up the
cooler master yes moving along to the
EVGA geforce gtx 980 i decided to do
kind of a quick overview on this card
itself but I wrapped it up also with
some overclocking tutorials which I
haven't really done when it comes to
video cards yet I mean there's just
there's a lot of different ones and
stuff but I figured hey for the 980 it's
applicable to a lot of the GPU boost to
point out cards so I went ahead and did
that tutorial again I'm not sure if that
is up because i'm not sure what order
and posting these videos in but if it's
not up now it should be up very soon ok
aha next up to legitimize my cooler
master video i decided to go ahead and
do an installation which i was happy
about so that's what i'm just setting up
here right now don't tell coolermaster
that's an NZXT case but
what the heck I think I've also moved on
from my viewing that's up in the corner
I i know i started off watching some of
Logan's videos i think i was watching an
episode of the tech and then i believe i
moved on to some some of the j and Jerry
show the tech talk on Thursdays and I
checked one of those out and I know at
some point I'm going to start watching
Linus tech tips here too but yeah there
goes the cooler into the case very
exciting this is this is fascinating
stuff this is uh speaking of which if
you guys are curious as far as how i'm
recording this i'm using a logitech c920
webcam that i have kind of attached to
the ceiling running down to a laptop
computer i'm using some software called
called chrono laps which is a pretty
nice software that can take control of
your webcam and then you can assign it
to take images every so often then I'm
compiling everything in Adobe Premiere
and putting it all together to set up
the actual time lapse it ends up being a
ton of image files and it takes a little
while to import but the end result is
pretty nice okay yes that is Jay and
Jerry actually no that's that's Jay and
Paul I watched the tech tech tech talk
episode where Jerry was away on vacation
or something and Paul was in there so
hey Paul how's it going if you're
watching this anyway I finished up the
Neptune 240m install and now we're
moving on to really what was intended to
be the highlight for me of this day this
afternoon and evening of building and
working with computers well not not
moving on to watching linus tech tips
although that is exciting because Luke's
there which one was that that was i
think i was watching the one where Scott
Watson was the guest anyway so now I'm
moving on to the htpc build and this was
a this was a really exciting project
because I had it like kicking around in
my brain for really quite a while I
think it was literally almost a year
that I had first came up with the idea
of using the WD Reds and some kind of
crazy raid configuration and an htpc we
finally went all the way through with it
so that's always that's always nice when
an idea comes to fruition like that but
yeah this is just taking apart the W I'm
sorry the fractal node 80 for setting up
all those drives in there getting
everything actually put in at this point
I had actually taken the whole system
and brought it
over to my htpc area and I had set it up
and run it for a couple days just kind
of out of the box kicking around and
getting a little bit dusty so I know
everything was working which is a nice
the only thing was the the blu-ray drive
that you can see right there the optical
slim slot-loading drive I was missing an
adapter cable for it which only came in
at the very last minute but even with
that I think I need to provide some more
power because I'm actually connecting
that through and an essay data it's a
USB adapter that I'm connecting to a USB
header on the motherboard because I ran
out of SATA ports because i have so many
WD tribes and my raid configuration it's
functional but um I think I just need
one more adapter cable to throw in there
mounting up the WD red drives now I was
happy with the node 804 when it came out
because I had already had this idea in
my head and the the 3.5 inch drive
storage on this case is actually really
impressive I'm only using half of the
spots for a 16 terabyte raid 5 array
which gives me about 11 terabytes of
easily usable space which is also really
sweet but I think that's almost wrapping
it up now I'm finishing some of the
wiring up on the front do a little
braiding on that cable there I like
braiding cables what I was exciting and
then I'm closing it up and then of
course I have to go and do some more
shots and everything like that but this
was another very successful very
productive Saturday afternoon thanks you
guys so much for watching this video
really appreciate it don't forget to
subscribe to my channel i'll be doing
more stuff like this and if you have
ideas for maybe ways that I could spice
up these types of time-lapse videos let
me know in the comment section down
below we'll see you all very soon
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
