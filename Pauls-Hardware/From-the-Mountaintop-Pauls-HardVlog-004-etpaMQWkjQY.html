hey everybody and welcome back to Pauls
hardware this is a vlog video that I
decided to do because I haven't posted a
video in the past week or two having
gone I'm trips and stuff so I'm just
going to share a little bit of our trip
that we're doing this weekend we're up
in the San Jacinto Mountains we're doing
a hike up to the top of tacky to peak
which is right up here it's in the hills
kind of up above Palm Springs mountains
i should say about Palm Springs inside
the California so we're headed up to the
top right there still got a little ways
to go so well we're gonna keep hiking
and I'll let you know how we're feeling
we get up there believe it or not our
dog Murray has never actually walked on
snow before
I got some more patches of snow here
this is actually like way less snow than
there should be right now for as much
cold leather snow and ice as the Midwest
and East Coast are getting in the u.s.
right now the west coast has pretty much
been in a drought it's been unseasonable
warm and it's been pretty much minimal
rainfall so far this year so we're
expecting a drought we're hoping for
some more water but yeah we're still on
our way up the hill now he's leading the
way down here she's she's very sturdy
dog should we try to keep her in good
shape right naari yeah we are so close
look I already there's birds flying
below us some beautiful rock formations
and a long way down that way so if you
guys are watching this video and you're
wondering to yourselves why am I
watching a video about Paul taking a
hike through the mountains well there's
a tech channel right that's what I
normally talk about it stick I guess
there's a couple reasons one would be
that for me well first of all I'm trying
to keep my content regular I'm trying to
bring you guys at least something every
week and particularly when I do stuff on
weekends is a time when it's a little
bit tougher for me to kind of keep up
with that so that's part of it and the
other part would be just I like to try
to maintain some balance I guess the way
I've done that a lot in the past is to
try to go out in nature do do hiking I
enjoy traveling the mountains seeing
things that sort of stuff so it's a
great way to kind of stay in shape and
I'm also fairly fairly introverted by
nature so the way I kind of recharge my
batteries is to do stuff that's out by
myself like this person my wife as well
and my puppy but um I guess I guess
that's as good reason I can come up with
alright guys we have made it we're up at
the top and we are at this fire lookout
station which the Rangers set up so that
they can look for fires icha it's an
amazing new from up here as you can see
hopefully the winds not killing the
audio too much but pretty much there in
sixty degree view all the way across
here we have some other hikers who have
also made the trip today but um yeah
very very nice up here this is uh this
is probably wrap it up for this video
though we're going to go eat some lunch
and then hike back down but very glad
that we made it and thanks to all you
guys for checking out this video I'm
guessing if you're watching this video
you already subscribed but if you're not
then hey go ahead and subscribe and
we'll see you all hopefully next week
I'll be bringing you some some more tech
stuff because I got some stuff lined up
coming up very soon so stay tuned for
that thanks for watching see you later
