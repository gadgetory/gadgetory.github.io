link in the video description to learn
more what's up guys today's video is
going to focus on a hardware upgrade for
my streaming system over here which
currently can handle several streams at
the same time mostly 1080 60 but I do
have a couple 4k capture devices in
there as well one of them is the elgato
4k 60 Pro and then I have a black magic
4k capture device in there as well the
Blackmagic one has been giving me some
trouble primarily when it comes to
working along with xsplit which I use
every Tuesday when Cal and I do our live
show because we can stream to both
YouTube and twitch at the same time but
long story short today I'm going to be
doing a hardware upgrade on this system
over here I'm doing an in-place upgrade
rather than actually swapping out parts
in the entire system because this is an
X 99 based system which could
potentially use an upgrade but it's
currently running the 69 50 X which is a
10 core 20 thread CPU which is pretty
capable CPU from Intel anyway doing a
lot of exposition here let's focus on
the parts I'm actually installing a
second 4k 60 Pro from Elgato then also
this capture device from aged well which
is significantly more expensive it cost
about $900 as compared to the $400 for
the 4k 60 Pro this is the pro capture
HDMI 4k plus LTE LTE just means it has
looped through so it can do an HDMI IN
as well as an output so if I was
capturing gameplay while playing at the
same time you could pass it through to
an external monitor let's take out the
4k 60 pro first I've already done a
video at least done installation and
with a bit of testing when I originally
set up the current version of my main
capture system here but this is a pretty
good-looking card I will say gamers
Nexus actually did some thermal testing
on this and found that it does get
pretty warm so depending on how you have
the system configured you might want to
get some active airflow flowing over
this because it's got a shroud on the
front here as well as on the back but
those are not necessarily
syncs so does not necessarily keep
things cool that said if you're a
building system that has a side window
or something and you want to make sure
everything in there is looking pretty I
think this card at least does get that
done properly this uses a PCI Express
connection that's a buy for connection
supports inputs from pretty much any
HDMI source so it does supports like
PlayStation 4 and Xbox capture it has a
pass through so you have an input as
well as an output on the back here so
lag free pass-through of the game you're
playing so you can game and capture at
the same time and it supports
resolutions up to 20 160 at 60 frames
per second that's 4k 60 Hertz as you can
sort of tell by the name 4k 60 pros our
major well card here has far less pretty
packaging it's pretty straightforward
but major well has been in doing
professional video products for
professionals for quite some time one of
the big selling points at least from the
reviews I've been reading about this
card in particular that it just works
it's it's very solid when it comes to
performance once you get it up and
running you should be able to go back
and continue to use it and it should
still stay up and running it is a bit
smaller than I thought it was gonna be
but it does actually have a low profile
bracket there too so for low profile
systems you could fit it in there by
swapping out that bracket does have an
active cooling heatsink with a fan on it
there and other than that's pretty
straightforward Green PCB on the back we
have HDMI in and outs they're not
labeled on here so I'm gonna have to put
some tape on there that would be a nice
thing you know in and out clearly
indicated on there but beyond that we
still have a PCI Express buy for
connection there I believe both of these
are actually PCI Express Gen 2 which is
all you need for bandwidth requirements
when it comes to an add on capture card
like this sports the same resolutions
4096 by 2160 at 60 Hertz so for K 60 and
then this does also support 10-bit video
processing for for for for chroma
sampling or for for for meaning that
there is no chroma subsampling and then
when it comes to signal detection we
have auto detection which is also a nice
feature of the 4k 60 Pro supports 3d
hdmi timecode which can be very helpful
in professional environments and it does
support HDR 10 when it comes to HDR
support I guess it's also worth
mentioning that since this is made for
more professional or enterprise
environments that it is rated for
continuous you should
usage 24 hours seven days a week and it
comes with a two year warranty from mage
will so these are my upgrades for today
I'll go over some of the components that
already are in this system but you can
check out that video if you're
interested because it's gone through a
few different iterations already and
then I wanted to point out that there
are already some existing reviews for
both of these cards that I will point
you guys towards if you want a little
bit more information on those I'm not
going to be doing very much on the
review side today my main goal is to get
them installed see if I can install them
with the system as is without doing a
complete overhaul or reformat or
anything like that and then see what
kind of performance I can get when it
comes to having three 4k capture cards
in the same system using them all at
once but for today I'm probably just
gonna start dabbling with that and then
hopefully follow up in a future video
sort of going over how I use this system
in its upgraded form and I'm very happy
to be getting rid of the black magic
stuff because honestly it's been causing
me more trouble than it's been worth
that said let's get started
so here's a look at the system as is
fortunately it's not quite as dusty and
filled with spiderwebs as when I took it
apart last time check out that video if
you're interested but where that be
quiet dark bass 900 case this is an x 99
system so LGA 2011 - 3 so it is starting
to get a little older but it does have
that 69 50 X processor remember that 10
core when Intel was charging $1700 for
10 core high-end desktop processor
fortunately it is a very functional and
useful processor so it's still been
getting the job done it's cooled by a
Noctua NHD 15 CPU cooler pretty much the
best air cooler I think that's on the
market as long as you can deal with the
not so great color scheme I have it
oriented vertically here simply because
if I had it oriented the other way
I was conflicting with some of the top
slots on the board there the memory is
of course their vengeance lpx kit that's
32 gigs total 4 by 8 gigs and then the
graphics card it's running right now is
the original founders edition GeForce
GTX 1080 Ti for power we have an EVGA
supernova 850 g3 850 watt power supply
there's a couple WD red 2 3 terabyte
hard drives and raid 1 there so that's
what I usually copy footage to right off
the bat so it's backed up or at least
stored on 2 separate physical drives
I've used a few different Intel 750
series SSDs because they do have u2
connectivity and that's actually one of
the downside to this board right now for
my main storage and operating system I
have an OC zrd 400 that's an nvme SSD
but it's connected to the only MDOT 2
slot that's on this board other than
that Asus opted to put a couple UDOT 2
connectors right here that can actually
pipe over 2 drives like the Intel 750
series but those actually went out of
style pretty quick the m-dot - form
factor was just much more popular and
usable so really don't see many u dot 2
connectors on boards anymore and
unfortunately unless I use some sort of
adapter I can't really use those for my
existing SSDs so I do want to put a
little bit more SSD storage in here I
think I'm just gonna drop a SATA 1
terabytes and disc SSD and then for
capture over here I have the already
installed existing Elgato 4k 60 Pro
that's installed in the bottom slot I
have a black magic 4k capture card up
here and then this final card here is
actually a firewire card that I
installed from
upgrading to firewire video and I don't
need that anymore so I'm going to be
uninstalling that too
so upgrade is pretty much complete right
now although I'm still not a hundred
percent sure about this can orientation
of the capture card since again these do
tend to get warm and since I've used em
using the reference design or the
founders Edition GTX 10 atti up here
there's no active cooling since it's
only got the blower fan out there there
is the fan on the major oil capture card
so I put that up on top I remove the
backplate from this upper Elgato 4k 60
pro just to provide a little bit more
space right there and who knows maybe
even maybe now the fan on the mage will
will help keep this card a little bit
cooler and then I was able to do two
slot spacing for the lower 4k 60 Pro
cards
alright guys I'm back and I had to delay
this by a couple of days just so I could
do start our proof of concept here I
feel like there's a lot more testing I'm
going to need to do with this
configuration because there's different
ways I'm planning to use it but for now
I just wanted to setup a single use case
that I think makes sense for having a
system like this with three 4k capture
cards setup in it so here I have a
completely separate computer this is
arctic panther and it is running 34 40
by 1440 gaming setup and piping that
into the mage well capture card and then
at the same time I have two cameras that
can output a 4k video signal so one is
the GH five that's up back there then
the second one is down here I might in
the future do stuff like live builds
where I actually have two or three
cameras going at the same time that I
might switch between for practical
purposes a setup like this might be used
for a twitch streamer who wants to game
an ultra-wide while showing an image of
them on screen and then maybe also
showing their mouse movements or
keyboard movements because a lot of
gamers like myself people don't believe
that we're as good as we are at playing
video games unless you actually show our
hands doing that stuff that they're
doing at the same time I know I know
that's hard to believe that people
people don't trust me about that all the
time so I'm gonna just play a little
Apex legends here capturing it on this
system but one more thing real quick so
the way I'm outputting from this
computer is just that I have both
outputs going on so this allows me to
actually game on this monitor the 3/4 GK
950 F from LG at 144 hurts or 143 at
least and then it's also outputting to
the mage well capture card and it's able
to also do 4k at 60 Hertz which is very
convenient cuz that means I can output
to the stream at a more reasonable frame
rate while still enjoying the high
refresh rate of my monitor here you
might also notice that the active signal
resolution is just 4k here but I'm able
to crop that down in OBS I'm just
showing the 34 40 by 1440 area and then
here's my OBS configuration where you
can see apex in the top and ultra wide
and then one camera and the bottom rates
and then the other camera in the lower
left and then if I was setting up to
stream for a bit I'd probably put twitch
chat or something like that right there
in the middle so at this point I'm
starting a game not streaming over here
but I am capturing it so you can kind of
see the results of the capture at the
same time at this point I think I only
have a few more things to figure out one
is going to be that the video camera cap
sure was actually acting a little weird
with the elgato cards but I determined
that the same thing was happening even
with the brand new card so I think that
might be my system as opposed to the
capture cards themselves and then also I
need to figure out some other
configurations to use this setup with
obviously gaming and streaming would be
really nice but if you guys can think of
anything else please leave me those
suggestions in the comment section down
below
also let me know what you think this
gameplay is looking like because I only
did a couple quick tests captures to
sort of make sure everything was looking
all right but if you guys have any
suggestions for me please let me know
them in the comment section down below
and I will do my best to check those out
I'll Rick's just stole the armor
no tell him well well I eventually died
but it was only because the other team
cheated but thank you guys so much for
watching this video
again comments in the comment section
down below if you have any suggestions
how you'd like to see me use this
current setup thank you again for
watching thumbs up button on your way up
and we'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
