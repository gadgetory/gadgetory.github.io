it is
you
you
what's up guys I've made my way over
here to the asus booth I'm near the ROG
area and I'm going to talk about the
thing that you guys are probably most
interested in here and that is the new
asus strix gtx 980 they have one up and
running here as you can probably see the
gum with a three fan design for this one
which we haven't really seen from acs
recently they've been going with mainly
dual fan designs for their direct see
two cards but here we can see this
pretty cool-looking system that they
have set up here I believe that is a
Maximus as a maximus 7 formula I think I
think that's right okay so they have
that set up with them probably the
coolest looking stock cpu cooler I've
ever seen but let's ignore that for now
let's talk about the Strix this tricks
is right there at the bottom it's
running I can't hear much it seems to be
very quiet it has a glowing strict logo
up on top which looks kind of cool a
little bit light colored a lot of these
demo units that we're seeing here at
computex are pretty early revisions and
samples and a lot of folks have been
telling us that they're still working on
the designs and they might do slight
modifications to them I cannot say if
that is the case or not for asus i'm
guessing this one is at least near
complete mainly because there's some
water blocks over on the other side that
i want to show you but um apart from the
980 TI GPU that's at the center 200,000
816 cuda cores their information here
for their boost clock and there turbo
claw their base clock and their boost
clock is all TBD so I'm guessing that's
probably because they need to do some
further validation and testing to see
the GPU yields and and what they can
actually get to as far as a reasonable
clock frequency for shipping the
finished versions of the asus strix gtx
980
but they do have a cool demo right here
also Wendell's with me hi Wendell okay
so here's a quick demonstration that ace
has put together for why they're custom
PCBs are awesome so this is the generic
PCB design aka the nvidia reference
design this is a traditional assembly
via dual inline package process right if
you watch any of our factory tours from
like gigabyte you might recognize it
that is we can see some of the sharp
points here and the soldering what's
going on as they're connecting up the
connection points of the card whereas
over here is the actual asus design for
the Strix GTX 980 and you'll notice look
how clean it is it's super clean how do
they do that well there's a video here
I'll all chalk it up to aerospace great
quality reliability via acs auto extreme
technology it's an automated process
which I find to be somewhat interesting
i think it's substitution if components
for surface mount performance okay so
they're using surface mounted instead of
dip but that's kind of their demo there
and it does make it look nice and clean
although i think they should put a back
plate on it anyway which means you won't
even be able to see any of that stuff
finally they do have some water blocks
here on demonstrations we have water
blocks from bitspower right here up at
the top they have a pretty nice clean
clear design here where you can see the
channels for the liquid to flow over and
that kind of thing of course you might
recognize the bitspower logo like they
have here and over here they do have a
silver plate down the middle too I don't
know hide the naughty bits or something
like that maybe they need some
additional cooling uh actually I'm
guessing that's for additional cooling
over the power delivery
yeah that's probably what it is we also
have an EK block here also a very key
partner for asus and this is just a
quick look at that one EK going with a
similar clear design i supposed to the
Fitz power but nice and clean and
squared off like a lot of EK blocks are
you can see the logo up there on the top
as well as EK logo down there by the
strict logo at the bottom finally we
have a thermaltake block as well this
one's a little bit more opaque or I say
completely opaque compared to the other
ones white on top black on the bottom
again looks like a pretty clean design
but they've opted to put the actual Jana
quarter fitting connection points
directly here on top of the card so we
should see some interesting
configurations I'm sure there's gonna be
lots of people doing multi-gpu
configuration water-cooled systems with
the Strix 980 TI this first look at it
here at capitec 2015 guys I couldn't
leave the gigabyte boots without showing
you their brand new gtx 980 TI it's
right here it is still going with a 3
fan cooler on there but they've done
some fancy stuff first off this is a 600
watt TDP cooler yes 600 watts which is
more than any planning person in their
right mind would need for a 980 TI but
that's going to give you plenty of
cooling of course as well as more
thermal dissipation I'm gonna flip it
over here so you can see the wind force
logo speaking of the wind force logo
right there this can now change colors
yes indeed seven different colors it's
not full RGB yet but that is something
that they're working on so you can can
light that up and change it to pretty
much your standard colors that you might
need to match your your case design or
whatever system you're building the
other cool thing is they have their fan
stop mode so these little LEDs on the
side are going to light up white when
the fan is stopped which means that the
GPU is not hot enough to cause them to
spin up apart from that if you saw any
of my videos on their 980
and how heavy that thing is this thing
is equally heavy there's a lot of copper
use in here there's a very dense fin
array they've gone with the alternates
alternating spacing for the fins to
create more turbulence and more heat
dissipation over those there are six
copper heatpipes across the center here
there's a believe there's four eight
millimeter and 26 millimeters so that's
pretty cool too for your outputs over
here gigabyte is sticking with the Flex
display so they're giving you an extra
DVI out which i think is useful because
a lot of folks are still using DVI
monitors if you have a 2560 by 1600 or
something you don't want to ditch it or
maybe even a couple that would be very
nice to have but of course you still got
three full-size DisplayPort outs as well
as the hdmi 1.4 and I'm sorry hdmi to
point out yeah that's 2 point 0 for the
900 series and then on the bottom of
course the beautiful gigabyte g1 gaming
back plate with the angular aggressive
look still looking super sweet and
that's that's pretty much it so that's
gigabytes take on the 980 TI I really
liked it I liked it so much I took it
over here by the window so you could
have a full backdrop while you're
looking at it but let me know in the
comments guys what do you think of this
card because there's a lot of custom 98
ET eyes out right now and I thought it
was interested in the gigabyte chose to
go with the kind of a more silver trim
on the outside you guys into that more
into the black version let me know the
camels hey guys I've come over to the
zotac booth and apart from some new Z
boxes that are over there
over kind of near where Logan is they
have a whole new slew of gtx 980 eyes
yes yes indeed i'm going to run down all
of them for you first off you have the
lowest end if you can call a 980 TI lo
and i don't think they would appreciate
that but i'm going to do that anyway
this is the 980 TI a opposition so it is
factory overclocked as though tax custom
three fan cooler and it also has a back
plate look at that it even says push the
limit on it with the zotac logo that's
that's pretty cool so this one's going
to use the reference PCB that nvidia
made but Joe tax custom cooler and it
does come factory overclocked out of the
box at eleven-forty boost so that's
number one we also have the zotac gtx
980 TI amp Omega edition this one as you
might be able to tell is a little bit
beef we all check that out they have
taken the wraparound black backplate
that we saw with the 960 and they
brought it over here to the 980 TI look
at that pretty nice so kind of a gray
backplate also says push the limit so
tech and I got kind of a hex pattern
going on in the back power boost that's
a big-ass capacitor that's situated
close to the GPU there this one has a
custom PCB the zotac designed themselves
and they used it in this card here which
also has a cool thing they're done with
the fans so if you notice the fans in
there they have a very interesting
design their kind of slotted and they
have a secondary fan blade in there and
though tech has done this to make that
look cooler no it's not just to make it
look cooler it's also to make it cool
cooler hahaha okay but it greatly
improves the static pressure and it
kills the dead zone for air pressure
that typically exists with most
traditional fan designs or at least so
I'm told by zotac so that's pretty sweet
and again this is a 980 TI amp omega
edition but that's not all oh no
have we have no fewer than two more to
talk about here this next one is
actually down in the case so check this
bad boy out so now you might notice this
is a very similar as far as the heat
sink design goes to the amp Omega
edition up there but this is actually
the 980 TI amp extreme edition comes
with LEDs right LEDs applied up and this
one is basically going to be their bins
model that is overclocked far further
than any of the other ones this boost
clock listed here 1335 is actually not
even correct it's 1355 boost and
according to so tech the highest
overclock gtx 980 TI out of the box that
you can currently purchase but that's
not all over here we have the 980 TI
Arctic storm this one is hybrid so this
one is sifted 1114 boost but that's what
the air cooling that you might initially
see right here in front of you again
same similar design for the the fans and
all that and they had a show that it so
tech I kind of like they're kind of dark
gray gunmetal look but this one is for
Kindle not be heavy oh my god that is
substantial there's water cooling
connectors there because this is a
hybrid solution he also notices Oh tech
logo there that will light up power
delivery for this one is a 6 been in an
8-pin and it's got a massive copper
block right down there against this
thing is really really heavy this is
probably the heaviest graphics card just
I've out of the box I've ever picked up
I'm going to set it down I don't
so if it's not re obvious you can run
this air cool just use the fans as is or
you can pop on a custom liquid cooling
connected there with your gianna corner
fittings and you can set this up to be
an epic water-cooled gtx 980 TI you
don't even have to worry about getting a
separate water block and installing it
and all that stuff they had a guy's a
rundown of the GTX 980 TI collection all
four of them from zotac here at computex
2015 so guys as you probably know
coolermaster is one of my fantastic
sponsors like on a text 2015 coverage
and i asked them to show me a couple
cool products that they have here on
display we're take a closer look at the
quickfire xt I so guys you might
remember the quickfire rapid I i did a
video on that recently the quickfire xt
I the version that's actually here has
cherry MX green switches this is going
to be available in the US with blues
Browns and reds which are very popular
but in the comments let me know if you
guys want to see the greens because
they're considering bringing the greens
of the US market but that's still
undecided so if you saw my video on the
quickfire rapid eye then this board
should be very familiar to you except
now we have some multicolored back
lights so we actually have two LEDs
there's blue and red so you can do blue
red and you can do the colors in between
such as Purple's of different shades of
magenta and that sort of thing and that
receives right here next to me he's
going to show us some of the quick
features for lighting and that sort of
thing so you got the perky lighting
lights up and then fades away you have a
little explosion lighting you can do
where it goes from side to side and then
you also have vertical so it's doing the
axis from that's horizontally and
vertically as you type that's pretty
cool too and then we also have just
straight colors of course there's
program buttons up here there's a bunch
of different match Matt girls you can do
and just like the quickfire rapid eye it
stores everything in the keyboard itself
so you can take it with you and it will
remember all of your settings so guys
this is going to be available soon
August August August time frame you'll
be able to see the quickfire xt I again
it's available in Reds rounds of blue
switches and maybe greens too depending
on if you guys want it guys if you don't
already know g.skill is one of my
sponsors for my computex 2015 coverage
and when I asked them hey g.skill what
do you have going on at school at copy
Texas yeah well they said of course our
OC world record stage and our OC World
Cup every year escale host this event
actually two separate events they do
overclocking extreme high level liquid
nitrogen based overclocking all week and
then they do competitions so you can
overclock the most and the best right
now the Lucy for Frankenstein
down to the final we're like less than
two and a half and it's a way the winner
of this is going to get ten thousand
dollars right now it's down to two
competitors allow can lam hong kong as
well as VV from South Africa right now
love can manage ahead by a single point
he's winning two of the three categories
whereas Phoebe has a wooded one we'll
see if it comes down to the wire and
there's a last-minute upset I I can't
even say today where I'm just gonna cut
I'm gonna come to the end we'll see who
wins yeah there it is guys final scores
overall allow kin lamb wins with an
overall score of 5 points he got one
point for CDR for memory clock speed of
18 45.5 BB did beat him there with a
memory overclock of 1918 luck in lab won
the Super 532 m with a final score of 5
minutes 57 seconds and 766 milliseconds
beating out VV by where milliseconds
like literally sent that are hundreds of
a few hundreds of milliseconds he also
had a 3d mark fires fire strike physics
score of 3403 I'm sorry 20 4824 compared
to be nice for 2020 4650</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
