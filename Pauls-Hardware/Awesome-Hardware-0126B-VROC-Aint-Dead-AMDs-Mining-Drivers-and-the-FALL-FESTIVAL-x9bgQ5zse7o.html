much Mary you should be should be live
any moment now
whoo hello everyone how's it going hope
you guys are doing well we are live this
is awesome hardware and this is a live
show
we talk about technology mostly computer
parts we also drink a few beers
sometimes we say a few curse words so
bear that in mind if you happen to it
defeats the purpose of the disclaimer if
you immediately know it gets them
prepared it gets them even way it keeps
them aware exactly exactly our yep
anyway though yeah so let's ease her
easily offended as Cal has already been
trying to push things as hard as he can
absolutely anyway this is episode number
126 every Tuesday evening we stream this
live show to twitch.tv slash awesome
hardware and then we stream two halves
half a has already been streamed to
Kyle's channel which is called bit wit -
that is in the description but yeah
that's why we've already had some
drinking done we've already been talking
about stuff for a while so if you want
to see what got us to the point where we
are at right now then definitely go
check out his link if you want to see
why we're slowing our words check
outside a exactly that's basically what
I'm saying
beyond that though big thanks to all you
guys for watching us live whether it's
on YouTube or whether it's on Twitch
many thanks to you guys for being here I
am going to hold on no spell that
correctly hey today we're going to be
talking about what new egg new egg
talking about Grimes handle AMD's new
drivers witcher switcher for for miners
and which we're talking about the
witcher we're not talking about the
witcher don't know where you got that
from but yeah also intel's vrock raid
stuff so some content there and also its
fall Oh
seasonal it's the seasonal show so later
in the show we're gonna have a Fall
Festival
we're gonna carve a goddamn pumpkin yeah
we need some goddamn pie mmm that's the
plan please anyway if you want to help
support our channels if you watched and
even like you know I like the cut of
their jib z' or that sort of thing check
out our stores pulsar bread dotnet is
mine we have some awesome hardware merch
we do long requested finally fulfilled
this one's designed by Brian it's it's
the sword fight shirt it has a sword
fight on the front and the awesome
hardware text on the back like so also
got the RGB everything shirts I have
just recently introduced a stainless
steel bottle opener with my logo I also
have some mugs pint glasses some hats
some zip up hoodies and pullover hoodies
also Kyle's store big weight tech slash
store he also has lots of fine
merchandise and it will be shipped to
you and you will you will enjoy and love
it yes you will if you buy stuff during
the show at the end of each half we say
your name and we thank you we're very
thankful for people who support us
mm-hmm all right let's get weird right
into the meat though let's let me dive
into the meats great
and first off continuing tech news
actually no we can't do that yet we
can't do that what why not okay it
before we get any beer of course we were
drinking some Sam Adams Oktoberfest yes
special beer it is October partying
smooth Sam Adams does a quite decent
doctor professed brew so that's what I
got indeed and I'm just pouring this out
here so we can quickly say Cheers cheers
to all of you there we go
for watching cheers Cheers
it's all downhill from here thank you so
much for being here everyone let's start
with the AMD news
AM D just today has released their
Radeon software crimson re-live edition
17.10.2011 AMD graphics card or you
might just be interested in the news of
it which is that the driver is
specifically aimed at some games that
have just recently launched destiny 2
came out today for the PC some people
have been playing it Demitri doesn't
like it it's just the game itself yeah
he doesn't like it oh really yeah
- I'm tweet about it he was like that's
a toss up game fine
 it's not pretty enough but yeah
the game itself has been doing quite
well I believe it is the best-selling
game of 2017 so far and already launched
on consoles just now launched on PC but
um
beyond destiny - this excuse me this
actual software update is also meant for
a few other games I'm pressing the wrong
button Assassin's Creed origins which
will launch on October 27th and just
three days
Wolfenstein - the new Colossus launches
also on the 27th also in three days - my
three days first-timers there - I think
I think you said three okay
I'm at surgery don't don't don't trust
both temps also some support for the
windows 10 fall creators update so
people who have AMD graphics cards you
should probably jump on this and get you
know but beyond that there's of course
lots of ongoing controversy and
discussion over the impact of
cryptocurrency mining specifically
cryptocurrency mining on GPUs and how
it's impacted the overall marketplace I
did a video on this roughly a week ago
now which is doing insanely well people
keep watching and I'm just saying all I
was doing
sanely while all I was doing was
complaining about stuff but okay alright
complain yes Scott is a viral all right
my real element I'll try to think of
some more things to complain about that
people want to watch Sam's gonna start
bitching everyone but the gold but now
my main point there was that there's
lots of cool stuff that's come out this
year and be getting back in the game
radians new launches as they get
everything there's some exciting
launches but the actual upshot for
people is that it's still very expensive
in certain areas to buy into getting a
gaming PC mostly with graphics cards and
also memory right now but if the mining
thing is a problem is it or is it not
being encouraged by the GPU
manufacturers themselves we've talked a
little bit about AMD launching some
mining support with their Vega drivers
Vega at 56 and Vega 64 very close to the
launch of those cards which seemed
slightly disingenuous since they were
talking about like oh we want to get
these cards into the hands of gamers and
stuff like that like look AMD if you
guys want to sell the miners that's fine
you're you're making a product you're
selling it and making a profit but don't
pretend you're doing one thing and
actually do another yeah because this
update also provides driver support for
up to 12 I'm sorry Windows 10
configurations of up to 12 compute
focused GPUs and GPU workload toggle
so the GP work little Toggl will
basically switch the graphics card
between em modes at optimize for gaming
versus a mode that's optimized for GPU
can cute stuff now when it comes to
cryptocurrency mining in general often
crypto miners will be already using
custom v biases and even custom and
custom drivers for example so it's hard
to say how much of an impact this is
actually going to have but for people
who aren't as in-depth into it for
enabling that type of stuff and if you
are mining on graphics cards that are
supported by this then it will probably
help out your output if you're
interested this is going to help select
rx 500 or X 400 r9 390 r9 380 r9 290 +
r9 285 cards specifically with well GPU
workload stuff but that basically
equates the GPU mining so AMD is
continuing to support mining on the
graphics cards and you can look at it
two ways you can say their business
they're selling their product to people
who want to buy it or you can say
they're supposed to be making gaming
graphics cards so them supporting other
things besides gaming is stupid it just
seems funny that it just feels like
yesterday when we were at that the AMD
rx Vega press event and they were just
and they were like we have these Radeon
packs we have this we devised this
amazing initiative to to really
block the GPU miners to open up our
inventory for for diehard gamers who
just want to play games and middle
fingers up to the miners with all these
Radeon packs and now we're here what
feels like a couple weeks later and and
let's do months what feels like a couple
of weeks but yes but still even if it's
a couple months later it just feels kind
of like they might be backtracking on
their initial promises or something but
yes but if nothing else it's more proof
to add that the GP manufacturers are
very well aware that a significant
amount of their products is being bought
by cryptocurrency miners and that that
is a customer that they are willing to
support to some degree yeah and we'll
see if they're able to meet the demands
because like that it's it's it's it's a
decision to make when you're doing
manufacturing is like how much of any
given product should we produce and they
typically will reign in production if
demand isn't there because you don't
want to over produce you don't want to
over saturate the market with your
product and lower the price at the same
time you don't want to over invest in
the amount of money that you're putting
into the production process as far as
paying the workers and all that kind of
things so if this really is just such a
thing where it's like all right we see
that Bitcoin mining is kind of here to
stay yeah and the ASIC resistance stuff
like aetherium that kind of thing where
it's like you can't really build an ASIC
to just do it because it's really just
kind of more that's just x86 processing
it's it's not it's not something that
you can make a very simple simple
associate or something like that to
handle yeah so but if they're able to
ramp up their production to meet than
the demand of this yeah they can
maintain prices and everyone's happy so
hopefully that's what we're gonna see is
that really what they're gonna be doing
is just being like alright there's lots
of people want these let's ramp up
production and then you know maybe in a
few months it'll I mean we have started
to see some evening out of prices yeah
we haven't seen drops in prices like
you'd expect to see after a year of a
product being out like a GTX 1060 sure
but you have at least seen some $300 rx5
80s for example are starting to become a
little bit more
available that kind of thing but anyway
let's move on
all righty new egg what do we get full
disclosure Kyle and I both are former
new egg employees although we both left
as of that 2014 2015 2015
I guess 2014 we left formally 2015 we're
still doing contract work yeah end of a
14 yeah yes anyway
a Korean bank or a group of Korean banks
has sued at nuoc they're alleging that's
new egg has aided in a massive fraud
which is and this is a fun picture of it
one of those mirror things person looks
familiar
never ever mind though never yeah I know
moving on anyway
new egg and ASI are the two companies
that are being sued this is a federal
court in Los Angeles by several major
Korean banks the industrial Bank of
Korea the Nonghyup Bank cab Hana bank
and Kookmin Bank are all alleging that
new egg and ASI corporation pursued
fraudulent deals with manyu --all with
the company called Manuel and Manuel is
a Korean electronics manufacturer that
sold home theater pcs as well as cheap
robotic vacuum cleaners as well as other
products as well from my understanding
in 2015 Manuel's CEO at that time Park
Hong Suk was convicted by the Seoul
Central District Court of fraud and has
been sentenced to 23 years in prison and
was also ordered to forfeit more than 31
million dollars of his ill-gotten gains
the banks loaned
large sums of money the banks involved
in the suit loan large sums of money to
Manuel and they're now targeting
American companies that they believe
aided in Monte Wells fraud the lawsuit
was first reported by the Los Angeles
Times on Friday it accuses new egg and
ASI two American
retailers it sold new a that sold manual
products of issuing think sales orders
according to the civil complaints manual
purported to charge ASI and Newegg
between 2530 dollars and two thousand
nine hundred and eighty dollars twenty
five hundred to three thousand dollars
per HTPC unit from manual when in
reality these HTTP sees were only worth
about eight dollars per units Wow so the
idea here is that they used the new egg
sales orders for these products with the
inflated prices in order to prove that
there were pending sales in order to
obtain loans from these banks that were
ended up being fraudulent it makes sense
that's what's going on you know and it's
something from what I've been reading of
a big deal if it actually turns out to
be true cuz they're they're under the
impression like banks won't know how
much this htpc is worth we can easily
say that's the technology that's built
in it's a three thousand dollar unit
it's like no guys just made shy it's
running on an atom processor cost you
eight bucks that type of thing give us a
loan very much okay and so cannellini
and Lee neon perhaps the tech in tech
illiteracy of the people who sure her
run the numbers perhaps rate that kind
of thing but one of the guys who worked
at the bank probably watches our videos
maybe that's that's what I that's what
or our ARS Technica's for this article
Kim's from by the way did talk to Matt
Streatham you ever met merrimette was
Matt Matt was legal he's legal counsel
for knew a key he was there when I was
there so I do I have met Matt hi Matt I
doubt you're watching but if you are my
man if I've met you I'm a they've denied
any wrongdoing Nick prides itself on
conducting business fairly ethically and
honestly the company vehemently denies
the allegations in the complaint filed
last week Ewing intends to vigorously
defend itself against those unfounded
charges
similarly crystal yuan of ASI his legal
department told Eris Technica that their
company stopped doing business with body
well several years ago
yes but anyway this is ongoing it is
yeah so they've been sued and we'll
we'll hopefully follow up with you guys
later on if we find out what actually
happens with all that the inside scoop
cool yeah
next up it intell's V rock is it dead
it's not dead it's not dead
according to PC world and Gordon Tong
it's it's not dead it's just trapped in
a hardware bundle there's been a lot of
confusion questions and whatnot about V
Rock the functionality of e rock has
been pretty well understood for a while
now it is a dongle or an add-on it's a
physical Hardware piece that you plug in
to an X 299 motherboard that will enable
additional raid configurations
specifically the rock stands for virtual
raid on CPU and this will allow you to
for example set up a raid array with say
direct PCI Express gen3 connections to
the CPU and have it be a bootable array
whereas prior to now you'd have to set
up something like that through the
chipset which might be limited and
bandwidth and that kind of thing right
so it's a cool function it's something
that a lot of people have been
interested in it's something that AMD
has sort of made more widely available
to people just recently as well Red
River with the threat of her platform
although there's some weird functional
quirks with that implementation as well
but anyway on the Intel side of it
originally there was speculation that
this was these little dongles we're
gonna cost like 500 bucks each or
whatever but now it seems like Intel is
going to be offering them to people and
hardware bundles weight with
motherboards like yeah paired with mobos
so V Rockies will be available and only
two ways bundled with new X 299
motherboards okay or bundled with Intel
SSDs okay that's how you get it that's a
shark is still only compatible with
Intel nvme SSDs correct that it also
appears to be something that they're
going forward with as well according to
this article Intel says it's leaving it
up to board and system vendors to decide
what to do for those who have already
purchased X to 19mm other words and
systems right but yeah it's it's it's
still kind of a weird situation it's
still not fully like yeah I'm still not
fully grasping it but I guess for now if
you were trying to get your hands on a V
rocky you might be able to buy it in a
bundle with a motherboard or in a bundle
within until SSD interesting yeah at
Computex they were talking about
potential different vrock prices for the
different different keys that might
enable raid 0 or raid 1 or 8 v costing
100 to 150 dollars and a lot of actual
you afi's do have updates that will show
you v rock functions but they won't
actually work unless the key is plugged
in so that's yeah just to continuing
kind of weird situation with that and
will hopefully bring you guys more info
on that seems like another no more once
we actually see a bundle with it a bit
with it advertised as part of it like
here like it feels like definitely like
another one of those responses to to AMD
I mean after AMD you know
allowed support for bootable nvme on Red
River for pretty much for free because I
can't imagine that all those rumors of
the dongles being $500 just came out of
literally nowhere I feel like maybe
somebody do something and that was
perhaps Intel's original plan until AMD
was like I will give it to you for free
as AMD tends to do to some degree and
then that's what maybe Intel is like
alright maybe we'll just start bundling
it with whatever vrock supported boards
there are just a competitive yeah so
this might open like this might also be
a follow up you know in some might have
been waiting for AMD to launch the third
Ripper thing and to see how how well
that took off and kind of really base
their response on that they're also
having to deal with the potential
overlap of this with the functionality
of some of their higher and server and
enterprise stuff which is very expensive
and they don't want to offer an
equivalent solution forward much less
since this is kind of an extra nine
nines more of a consumer platform so
yeah hopefully we'll see more
information soon or maybe actually see
some products for sale let's say like oh
like how much more if you're gonna buy
an Intel 750 series 1.2 terabyte hard
drive or SSD for X dollars whatever it
costs right now that plus a vrock key
how much would that cost right you know
yeah yeah what's that can be right so um
yeah and the article says say although
we have seen some testing like Jabbar
did some testing that I believe seem to
indicate that you might be able to do
other SSDs with vrock the article says
that until this confirmed that they're
still doing intel SSD so me which also
is very limiting so yeah makes it less
an arresting feature from the get-go but
let's move on okay
net neutrality we've been trying to kind
of keep you guys slightly up to date
with new this is from Techdirt com the
FCC has accepted a bunch of comments on
net neutrality and they are they have
already planned to basically
published their decision for what to do
next on day before Thanksgiving which
probably the even probably in the
evening on the Wednesday before
Thanksgiving which is a very popular
time to try to bury news because then
you have Thanksgiving in a long weekend
and everything and stuff stuff goes away
a little bit more so apparently not
anymore now that all these article all
these journalists are catching on and
releasing articles about how the FCC is
trying to be sneaky AF well we've been
trying to talk to people about this
because like net neutrality as a general
concept is something that everyone
supports now I guess I can't say
everyone everyone but like the majority
of people split people if you explain it
as a concept look I have a connection to
the Internet's there's lots of different
locations on the Internet where I might
want to access data from or access
websites from wherever whichever one of
those I'm accessing that data should be
provided to me in the same fashion from
one site to the other because the people
have nothing to gain from net neutrality
going away there's a zero to gain it's a
very simple concept and it's something
that everyone supports now only the
corporation discussion that you have now
that's going on right now is like well
the FCC right now they've classified
Internet service providers as common
carriers under title two of the titles
of common carriers which means that they
can be regulated as utilities which
gives the FCC the legal means to
actually enforce net neutrality now the
discussion that you'll see now on the
arguments that you'll see against this
is like well that's heavy-handed and we
don't need that sort of government
intervention the solution should be that
we have legislation that we enshrine in
law the prospect of net neutrality which
is fine and I'd be totally fine with
that just to be clear if there was a law
that was passed that said here's a net
neutrality and stuff in the internet
should be treated equally and everything
there wasn't a bunch of subparagraphs
put in by Internet service providers of
exceptions actions and that kind of
thing
I have you totally fine with that the
thing is the light touch approach that
the FCC was using in 2014 internet
server aizen's sued them and said no you
can't do this so the FCC was like all
right well in order to prevent Verizon
and other Internet service providers
from doing stuff like throttling your
connection to Netflix because you're
trying to watch a movie because suddenly
they're like oh no people are using the
data that we sold them like oh we sold
them a you know we promised them you
know that they have this much download
and this much upload and they're
actually using it because they're
streaming video things we promised you
Oh No so they've the throttle debt they
wouldn't throttle that there's plenty of
evidence of that and and then the
response to that was like all right well
they need some means of enforcing it and
the answer to that in the time in 2015
that was title - yeah now if there's a
solution beyond title - that involves a
law being passed that says net
neutrality is net neutrality lots of
people are behind that's fine
however it's enforced enforce it one way
or enforce it the other right the point
is right now the FCC is being run by
Ajit PI he is a former lawyer for
Verizon he's very very clear in his
intentions of removing the net
neutrality restrictions right now yeah
and the fear of people is that that's
going to be removed without some legal
means in place to prevent Internet
service providers from doing otherwise
so anyway I'll let Sagar how much ISPs
are how much money they're gonna give a
G PI if he demolishes net neutrality
it's I wonder how much is on the line
for him that's the only thing he's
thinking about like say blonde dollars
there's this over the world there
are tons of resources that you can go to
to see all the money that had been paid
to to like
members of Congress and Senators yeah
donations to their campaigns which might
have influenced their decisions one way
or another so that's one thing but it's
pretty crappy and shady that they're
planning very specifically on this very
specific day that's been used many times
in the past to try to like sweep stuff
under the rug we're gonna do it on this
day especially when you look at all of
the 22 million comments that have been
provided to them and if you look at the
ones that aren't provided by form
documents like 98% of them are in favor
of net neutrality sorry yeah I'm okay if
it's not enforced via title 2 I'm okay
with that but I'm not okay with title 2
being removed and saying like we're
gonna remove this and then we'll do
legislation in the future yeah that'll
never happen
like the laws have to be passed first
yeah exactly if you're yeah if you're
relying on the existing executive or
legislative branch to pass any laws
right now mm-hmm well let's move on this
can go way deeper if we let it but we do
have a show to finish we're 30 go delete
we did some donations to Puerto Rico a
few weeks back I think that was actually
maybe three or four weeks back on the
show because after the United States
suffered a slew of hurricanes this
hurricane season in September Porto Rico
is it really hard a significant amount
of their infrastructure was leveled and
if anyone out there still has the means
to provide any further donations to
Puerto Rico we highly encourage it
because they're still having a pretty
rough time but in the tech news side of
it
Google has actually our alphabet I guess
I should say with a parent company of
Google has actually been deploying
Project loon to provide some
connectivity to hard-hit areas of the
islands and you can see what if their
balloons here with a solar array on it
and that this is actually in Nevada but
it's on its way to Puerto Rico can they
really launch something in Nevada flight
to Puerto Rican
pretty crazy there alphabet they can do
anything but yeah
hurricane Irma took 95 percent of Puerto
Rico's cell phone towers these balloons
are a way to extend at the range of
their existing cell unit so cellular
network and pull a Wi-Fi extender yeah
and one of the major benefits is the
fact that these balloons are up in the
air so they don't have to deal with as
much of interference with structures and
that kind of thing or the limitations of
the internet connect internet towers
cell phone towers that kind of thing
that are kind of connected to Terra
Firma anyway this is another ARS
technica article linked in the
description like all of my articles are
so if you guys want to read a little bit
more up on it please check that out I
wanted to have a few more notes on this
but but I don't I'm sorry about that
it's running out of time but a single
balloon can serve an area the size of
Rhode Island Wow and Puerto Rico is
about three times the size of Rhode
Island three balloons theoretically I
would imagine given the shape and
everything maybe even so maybe one or
two more than that depends on how much
Netflix the Puerto Ricans are watching
yeah but I would have been 10 I would
imagine it would be a massive help to
them right now since much of the island
is still without power yeah as well as
without access to drinking water and it
makes sense Oh an alphabet you know has
a vested interest in in getting people
back online because they own Google the
more people that got on on on the
interwebs the more ads and more like
more ad sales and revenue and they
can rack up and advertising things like
that so yes it's purely it's a mutual
mutually beneficial motivated purely by
profit yeah mostly penguins one week ago
also on twitch we we were broadcasting
on Twitch actually I believe when part
of this happened but there was a giant
robot fight oh you were you familiar
with that I mean I was there's a big old
robot fights we talked a little bit of
ink about its kind of lead-up to this it
was Japan versus the you know it's
yeah there were actually three robots in
the fights the American the American two
company was called American megabytes
megabox megabots I'm sorry make it you
really are a tech nerd
I know exactly but they had a ranged
attack robot called iron glory fifteen
feet tall and six tons and then they had
their main robot which is called Eagle
prime 12 ton robot designed to lift and
saw things I saw lots of people but yeah
unfortunately the the actual thing
itself do and and bear in mind like
there's people in these there's people
in these massive robots so as we are
about like big robots fighting each
other and that kind of thing there's
people in them they can't just go at it
and blow each other all out someone will
die and shoot rockets and whatever right
the actual production though here was
just slightly disappointing to people
because it was staged over the course of
three days there was lots of downtime
apparently for the teams to go in and do
repairs a mother who's on the robots
themselves and the video itself is just
good like this is one of the things this
is slo-mo like no one wants to see one
robot punched the other robot and it
fell over like no one wants to see this
they want to see real-time look at that
lay that punch and that's all stage two
and like punch it they fell over that
was briefly reading over this article
it's not even like the robots are
actually doing that these are all preset
moves that the pilots literally just
like press a button and the robot
doesn't get pre-configured it's like a
preset move yes so it's not really a
real-time fight and I think you're like
what to come like three days there's
something to shoot the entire thing and
they only got like ten minutes of usable
combat footage out of the whole thing so
it's like it's cool but not when you
have this expectation that that goes on
for like a year or two since they
promised this fight was gonna happen
that there would this just be like this
organic Gundam Wing fight
and it would be like epic and like
everyone's imagine like your imagination
is always gonna outdo the reality right
and I think I feel like this is a
perfect example every time yeah so yeah
oh I feel it
unfortunately the giant robot fight was
a little bit of a letdown for a lot of
people but you know I am I am I'm
optimistic I'm optimistic that in the
future we will have the resources and
the technology to have my massive robots
fight each other for our amusement I
think this is something that will happen
and I think it's just it's just it's
just a matter of progress and the people
who are dedicated to advancing this
technology cuz honestly like you got
people in it right because you know
obviously it's like the mech and
whatever you have the person yeah make
these autonomous I don't want to say
autonomous autonomous use your words
carefully otherwise that's on it so make
these fully remote control by like a
couple by two or three human he would
control people and make them in such a
way that they're disposable enough yet
complete destruction of one right
wouldn't like level the company that
built it or something like that
give him a consciousness or you can have
robot fights or maybe doing AI I think
that would be something that would bring
bring really bring a lot of joy to a lot
of people I agree
all right final story here for our news
is player knowns battlegrounds many
people have played it super popular game
right now they don't have a huge
cheating problem they do not apparently
okay because they're anti cheat system
is banning more than six thousand
players every single day boom that's
right when you consider how many players
they have worldwide it is a massive
amount of players so there's still ative
this article says twenty thousand
players were banned home for by on
Friday
Samuel forty the author of this article
on PC gamer said he hasn't come across a
single hacker in
battle grands not an obvious one he says
battle eye is the company that police's
their servers the official account
tweeted yesterday that between six
thousand and thirteen thousand players
are getting their marching orders daily
Wow
on Saturday and crackdown on nearly
twenty thousand players within the
previous twenty 24-hour period
vast majority of those were from China
where in-game ads recently caused a
flood of negative reviews of the game to
hit steam but yeah they say over 320 mm
cheers have been banned from player
unknown battlegrounds so far more than
twice as many as posted by the actual
official account just a month ago so so
the Chinese cheaters allegedly were only
putting like they were like Hackley
adding add I don't know I don't know
what using my aimbot but they were just
putting ads and in the game
no that's separate that's a separate
thing so a lot of a lot of the it says
the vast majority of the hackers that
were banned in the pre in this 24-hour
period were from China mm-hmm separately
in China they've recently started
pushing in game ends
I believe that's from playing on
battleground site I see and that pushing
of in-game ads has caused a flood of
negative reviews I see it but I don't
know if that's just regional thing or
what huh but anyway point is hacking in
a video game stupid
yeah there we go don't ruin it forever
all right let's move on to I know where
to go I need nipped FML time thank you
really quick yeah you can I'll shoot it
halfway anything man bloody
there it is though there's a brief brief
pause hold on I need to get the mail
hold on hold on I wouldn't stay there
okay
all right everything's fine lutely
prepared for mealtime hey that's heavy
I'm dropping things hold on okay all
right so one of the things I intended to
do before we started today's show was to
go through some of these packages and
remove the labels I did not do this but
nevertheless let's begin mail sign this
first package is from John from Virginia
it looks like yes having to go ahead and
open it I might know of one what
that's candy I want some I don't know if
there's any candy oh you got some big
stuff over here yeah I know that wasn't
to the PIO box
I just don't careful these have oh the
fragile sticker no they're not label
John oh yeah yeah John sent me why the
cameraman are a sink this is the
addressable LED okay it's also magnetic
which is super cool this is from a fan
uh this is from John John who I don't
know if John isn't yeah I mean I think
he's a fan I don't know if he's also hey
Paul here's the 3-pin addressable RGB
strip fur arctic panther haha oh well
you said you needed in part three of
your reef refresh video I would like to
see it used as I ordered it by mistake
for my Z 270 and can
use it okay so John does not work for
kilowatt I thought it might be somebody
actually from kilowatts to handwritten
notes moving 3-pin not working on a four
pin header go figure keep doing what you
do I will watch and like the vid every
time thank you very much John will thank
you for sending this and I am totally
gonna integrate this into ya arctic
Panther back there because right now
it's got enough light but it's kind of
on the on the dimmer side and I was yes
I did connect up the the header so I
have the the lead can coming off the
motherboard so I can get plug-in a strip
- there we go awesome thank you John
beautiful alright next up next up also
sent to the peel box by the way guys if
you want to send me anything P o box for
three to five Diamond Bar California
that's listed in the description alright
I think I know where this is coming from
and perhaps someone who we should get in
touch with oh oh what what do you that
do you ever watch is a speaker key do
you ever watch the wind show this is one
of their sponsors isn't it it is
they sent they sent you jerky I don't
know so you don't know if it's directly
from them I don't know if it's directly
from them or if someone ordered it and
had it sent to a Carolina Reaper infused
that's yours
wait what can I do it's mine I'm down
for the mail buffalo bacon I was so
excited to try this this is only
actually I think someone might have
ordered that it was it was said with the
LTTE coupon and someone knew but when
saw was watching LTT I don't want us I
don't know if anyone in savage jerky
watches our show we'd love to have you
as a sponsor hopping
Buffalo which I think will also probably
be good one for you I'm trying to
peaceably no maple buffalo bacon that
those of you want to wear Carolina
Reaper I think currently is the hottest
pepper on earth there's there's two that
are have been made that are hotter
oh really since then yeah but it's it's
not surprising at all but I mean it's
like it's hotter than like a scorpion
back we're gonna ghost pepper looks like
bacon okay it's not kick a little bit
mm-hmm the maple buffalo bacon anchovies
a thank you to whoever said this to us I
don't know who it is
yeah whoever you are we appreciate it um
damn that's fine yeah there's no extra
note on the packing slip or anything so
whew I don't know if that's a fan or
what
alright oh boy a few more things here
and these aren't said by fans these just
arrived so I got this one here first
here so what that is Star Wars that
figured out later don't worry about it
all right
I'm gonna use my a bottle opener to open
package look how sharp that is okay I
almost need to cool it down with the
habanero stuff seems kind of painful
baby cool people oh oh there's two
things in here Oh batteries what this is
an Amazon order
oh and they shipped it together which is
weird because all right so I got some
Amazon basics and I know that this is a
shock now for Mike yeah cuz I have I
want to see if this fits
is it really that bad the Carolina
Reaper stuff is pretty n hot yeah still
very hot whoo whoo that's gonna last a
while okay so recently tested my audio
test oh it's my a DK audio Deutsche
craft so this is ooh that's perfect
oh yay is that replacing one of these no
it's it's I can have another one Mike
that's em over there that I ought to
switch around that I actually think this

one yeah hey so she says it's so like
cool this speaking of cool I could
really use something cool right now yeah
here it gets warm at this point compared
to the heat that I'm feeling oh yeah
but worse is it it's a building type of
heat ah
you really seem uncomfortable yeah it's
it's not the most pleasant okay
well alright so let's move on then I bet
here in a perfect state of mind for our
sponsor spot yeah you know you know our
soup for today advertisements seem like
a great way to get my mind off yeah

which has white accents on the radiator
as well as on the pump the pump block
combo just a delay at the bottom uh-huh

convenient not only that Kristen's is a

I am dying right now that's ice cream is
that our next segment there you go just
fall festival yeah and yeah if that
includes ice cream yeah I'm waiting
pretty formalities right now Oh looks
like someone's already dug in oh there
is a God Oh gonna have a nice cooling
effect it really does well you know
what's gonna go it's very nice of that
cow hmm what what's that homemade apple
pie
Oh homemade tools oh yes it's amazing
how that one bite I'm like instantly
restored back to health rest of the show
by the way is
mostly us eating stuff this is you guys
know hey you know what there's a twitch
category for that now of people huge
social eating is a thing so social
eating all right we should feel zero
shame right now I'll change that up then
stuffing our faces in front of a live
audience is oh seven hundred some people
as we mentioned briefly over at the
beginning of Cal's half it's so good I
need I mean it's good but this fall it's
falling in Southern California so cool
as is the hip and popular thing to do I
would I went to apple picking this past
weekend Wow yes what was really homemade
then yeah so I picked I picked the
apples these are Winesap apples which
you can't just go and buy a story that's
an heirloom variety of Apple no yes no
and then from Saturday night I've
brought the apples home and I used my
apple corer slicer peeler to apple core
and slice and peel them and then I made
this a fire and I don't see you very
even if substantial amount it looks
delicious
so this is a given a side profile show
you gotta see the layers of Apple that
you hand-picked apples in there looks
great so we're gonna serve some of this
up right now
mmm to celebrate I think my favorite
part so far of this pie is that it
doesn't contain Carolina Reapers
paralyzer prefer anything anything I'm
afraid so drilled that your pie does not
contain one of the world's hottest
 peppers yeah usually don't I
usually leave that out
oh god it's called it spelling drawer in
the recipe that there you go I'm getting
pie everybody looks great okay scoop
actually I could warm up doing it warmed
up
sure let me do this let me warm them up
okay yeah okay usually provides a nice
contrast between the coldness of the ice
cream one with the warmest of the pies
now imagine a look what's horrible I
thought I thought one of the dogs was
not I lost a piece of oh that's not good
bitch I've been here in a tow crushed
left behind
Oh Oh my nose is running from that jerky
well I could tell that was oh you
weren't making that up there what a
perfect opportunity like what a perfect
time for you to bust out the ice cream
I know it's just ideal if this is all
this is all fine you've totally planned
all this you you Fox I mean I didn't I
didn't know that you were getting
Carolina Reapers ie stuff in that you
know I it really is I you know what I
have to respect it though where's the
name well Savage
yeah Savage jerky yeah it definitely um
is aptly named granted I'm not sure you
know they've got other things like
jalapeno which is not a habanero sorry
oh then you would be pretty weak but um
what is this anything balance it out
with some of the maple buffalo bacon
jerky that Paul got no and it literally
is bacon super good
mmm ooh ooh Oh bacon and ice cream a
match made in heaven let me try this
alright we got a piece of bacon bacon
jerky it really is more bacon than jerky
I think I put some ice cream on that
it's like I'm pregnant right now
anything is getting with a pie oh I'll
do that too okay thank you
hmm yeah
oh my god he's so good feel like our
twitch view counts going up after we
stop stop talking about tech and story
just eating on camera like this
look we're getting more viewers we
should just we just every time just eat
a bunch of crap eat I mean it's a lot
easier yeah I'm cool with that
okay nice can be going on and then we've
got thank you you can yes I can scoop
you I'll skip ice cream there of course
is that good that's perfect there you
are lovely
whoo oh my god yeah the Fall Festival is
going really well is great
you've got pie huh bacon we've got this
pumpkin here and I was gonna have us
carve the pumpkin but I've decided
against that I'm just gonna put it here
oh the scenery
yeah doing brush to her perving is too
much work right now oh yeah no I
couldn't do it but look it's there in my
current state yes right so now we've got
our pie we can go ahead and maybe a look
at some donation comments and stuff yeah
all right what do we got here um let's
see Paul's half here we go
first off from Carl Hall the five
dollars in one sense of Canadians now

you should turn this old
HTPC into a casual gaming PC I haven't
using rocket League and some fighting
games RPGs nice show right now I'd say
in 10 gtx 1050 would be a good choice
yeah yeah rocket League and like basic
fighting games you don't really need
much horsepower for that so
and then they attend 78 50 K isn't gonna
be able to keep up with much beyond that
yeah cool benedikte $5 familete finally
able to tune in after a long time that a
lot of assignments ahead of time to be

Cain Harris 5 Australian perhaps Paul
get zero insertion force pullover
hoodies and just how much do you hate
front panel audio Paul um
I hate it too it's like the bastard FXX
it really sucks a lot of time mm-hmm
often the circuitry go into the front
panel connector is completely different
than let's go into the back connector
mm-hmm yeah that sucks sometimes through
it in with like the other one zero
insertion force hoodies I don't have
plans with that it's like a it's a it's
a design with lots of different colors
and everything so it's a little bit more
complex to set up then then then just
you know if logos so that's why the
hoodies are the way they're at I might
consider it maybe a limited run or
something like that yeah but thank you
Kane
thanks Ben machine v2 ten bucks can i
buy your old sponsor of hardware you
don't use forty-three please trying to
build my brother at EDC um machine we
can't ask that pretty much weekly daily
daily if not um and it's just a lot of
work honestly to box up you know first
of all I mean what can I sell anyone
anything that's half working or not
fully functional so before we ever sell
or get rid of anything we usually test
it right and then we have to like just
do it a little quality control and then
we have a like box it up like package it
make sure it's gonna like secure and go
to the post office and like ship it out
like yeah it doesn't seem like a big
thing but it really it really is it
takes a lot of time and effort to do
that sort of thing and so I feel like
that's why we generally don't sell a lot
of our stuff to fans occasionally Paul
and I in the past we've done a fan
meetup locally so anyone who's like in
our area can can meet up with us and and
like purchase some of the stuff that we
the excess hardware we have so many
burps right now for a very good price I
think I sold like a Liam Lee case the
last time for like 10 bucks there's like
a hundred and fifty dollar case I was
like ten dollars and that's that's
pretty much how we get rid of stuff when
it when it comes to like pawning it off
to like it's like you guys and
stuff like that so fever in the area
maybe you look out for one of those
meetups um but thank you for your
donation in the less NZ sure you didn't
or unit none Newton British pounds 10
pounds Rams darling were rising the
1,700 at 4 gigahertz at one point three
five seven volts okay try tweaking RAM
from autotext and P but can't hit even
three point one anymore with any voltage
tried going to default in BIOS but no
luck hitting anything about three any
advice had 3.1 any more on the XMP
depending on your board might be
specific to the RAM some boards do other
settings along with XMP settings
assuming that you're playing at
overclocking and stuff like that what
rank you use um I would say your 4
gigahertz 1.37 5 volts overclock is just
fine and I would stick with that as a
manual overclock rather than trying to
mix with XMP stuff yeah if that helps
yeah yep Jake 3d 10 bucks
jinx are you originally thinking freenas
not unread don't want to pay for unread
oops what has been your experience with
freeness also missed my first comment on
Kyle's half blue RGB pants is beating up
my experience with free Ness has been
good yeah I mean it's a very
intelligently designed file system as
far as ZFS cows and freenas has a lot of
functionality considering that it's free
software so I've enjoyed using it and
deploying in stuff actually and I need
to rebuild my freenas right now it's not
currently in use but I like it a lot so
if that's something you're looking into
I'd recommend checking it out especially
if you don't want to pay 400 Thank You
Jake Jeremiah
Boyet jamya how old are you guys why
didn't you build your first PC did you
ever had have barbed fittings in a water
clean gloop no I never had barbed
fittings in a water cooling loop we
usually use like
hey fittings to be honest because um
they've been a primary sponsor in the
past when did I first don't like first
PC 2011 I think after I got the job at
Newegg and all helped me we actually
built a system to get my first build
ever was actually on video we did a
little speed build between me and Joanne
Joanne tech lover mm-hmm that's the the
very first build I did where I actually
tried installing the motherboard to the
case without standoffs because I just ya
know that standoff seat were a thing I'm
last think I got so much for that
and then and then I finally built my own
personal PC about a month later at home
all on my own
booted it up for the first time all the
lights turned on the fan spun up and it
was like it was magic it was pure magic
what about you I put my first PC when I
was I think I did some upgrades on our
we had an HP desktop like one of those
flat desktop desktops when I was like 14
then we did like memory upgrades on it
mmm I built my first PC that I built off
of a a bare-bones system that I got at
Fry's I think that's 15 or 16
and what else did I ever have barbed
fittings I've I've used water cooling
loops with barbed fittings and I don't
think that's like something I've used in
a system I've built or anything I have
used barbed fittings I guess I should
say yeah I hope that's a good enough
answer but Thank You Jeremiah yeah no
Ark Adam net terrier $5.00 I also want
to thank you guys for the raid on my
girlfriend curious codecs last nice oh
sweet I released a video on my channel
showcasing her reaction on my show she
did have like to be honest we raided a
lot of people on Twitch she had one of
the most genuine and entertaining
reactions we've seen you began weeping
immediately yeah yeah there there are
tears are shed to set the bar for us cue
waterworks like all right we gotta top
this who I mean we make crime so we're
honored to have given her that shout
outs and to get her partner does she
mentioned earlier um congrats to both
you guys Geraldo Gerald's 10 bucks
fiance fine I'm sorry I heard that his
fiancee financed a boutique built PC or
be patient and buy parts over time my
wife and I are expecting our first child
in December and building right now is
out of the question but my I 537 50k is
showing its age so I would I buy your
warrants overtime if you can
troubleshoot them and make sure that
they're not defective because if the
issue with buying your parts over time
is that you know after let's say six
months you've acquired all the parts you
try you assemble a system and turn on
you find out like the Rams dead or
something but your moron or your return
policy for whatever site you bought it
through is no longer accepting return
you gotta like deal with the
manufacturer to see if like the warranty
is still good and like that
I generally recommend buying all your
parts at once if you possibly can
what you could do is just save up money
just save up money over time and then
when you finally have enough money buy
all the parts at once and just assemble
the cygnets that's a much better way to
go and then you'll also prevent yourself
in like second-guessing yourself when
you're like you know you've got like
half the parts already and like you know
it's like four months later like wait
should I have really bought that SSD
maybe I'll buy this as I see I just buy
everything at once it makes it so much
easier
in my opinion yeah I'd agree see if you
can hold that with this 30 750 K a
little bit longer and will you tell your
kids born yeah first make sure that
everything comes out all right there and
then then maybe the spare money that's
better but congratulations and and I
hope you enjoy being being a father
yes Gerald - buck donation this was
supposed to be a question not a
statement oh yeah I think we got that
was supposed to be supplemental yes
Heather wifey sauce sauce is $5 Kyle's
saved some room cuz I actually made
dinner tonight all I can't wait to see
your Halloween costume this weekend
yes wifey sauce already knows what
Paul's going to be nice and she's
taunting all of you with it I'm ready
for dinner - oh yeah CCAM good Chris use
the reefer dirty for the next deck tech

thing also I think it would be a great
night for an after party or Jamie now or
Halloween night he must mean Halloween
night because I don't think I'm in I
don't think I'm in quite the position do
an after party tonight
having dinner with Heather and all
afterwards but that's suddenly they get
games loaded yeah we have you games
loaded maybe maybe maybe there's a
special thing we could do where we like
we cut the show a little bit shorter
like we ended it like seven 37 45 ish
and then we do like a little after-party
you know what I mean like we used to
order could always continue playing
lovers in a dangerous space-time yes
that was that was a lot of fun initially
he did that briefly that was a good game
but yes well we'll definitely consider
that thank you very much you see Chris
Wesley five bucks need help with the 4k

we would need a lot more information
this followed up Chris mostly $10
donation okay
