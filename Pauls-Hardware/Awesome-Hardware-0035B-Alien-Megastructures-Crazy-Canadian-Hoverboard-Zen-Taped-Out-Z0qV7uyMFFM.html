would you like some more I am of course
so you're enjoying it then
yes it's a lovely supplement to my
normal it's quite tasty drinking
repertoire and your double-fist with
beer I'm doing my best
uh hello everyone and welcome to awesome
hardware
he watched inside be the second half of
the episode number 35 it is October 20th
2015 and if you missed the first half of
the show well you should watch it unless
you're watching live if you're watching
live hello thanks for being here great
people but if you're watching it in the
future you can go over to Kyle's channel
on YouTube and you can watch this first
half of the show and that will explain
many things to you lots of the origins
or create mark just as many questions as
we answer anyway that's on Kyle's
channel which is awesomesauce network my
channel is Paul's hardware thanks you
guys for joining us today we do this
show every Tuesday we broadcast it live
to twitch.tv slash awesome hardware 5:30
p.m. in the evening that specific time
is when you can watch it so if you want
to watch us live and hang out and all
that kind of good stuff then definitely
endeavor to join us all right or don't
kyle is providing alternatives to every
possible option that we may provide you
Joyce - yeah all right we're gonna start
off here with a few announcements and
some shout outs now yes oh you know what
I totally forgot to do was Bri bring up
Josh's yes I should do that he did send
me a high-resolution photo of the
majestic painting really he just had
done but I didn't have time to actually
post it and share it a copy link to
tweet this one's just as good it was
just good all right fractal Josh you
guys might be familiar with just before
the show did a live stream
he had Kimberly Schultz you can see her
Twitter handle right there she he
commissioned a painting by her of
himself on a unicorn with rainbows
shooting out of the
the the horn and he's holding it to find
our fun well blow up the chat right now
I define ass blow up the chat with your
best caption yeah for this video with
the captions many caption contest go
this in great detail I liked his sort of
I liked his look of like casual disdain
that he can pants in there is just like
I'm just this is what I do
I'm Josh and I ride it it's like he's
like any other day yeah I love the light
peeking through the clouds letting him
know it's epic it's an epic thing so
fractal josh on twitter if you guys want
to tell him he's got hair works in there
alright
in the meantime if you want a shirt that
doesn't have that on it I imagine that
will be made into a shirt at some point
okay anyway if you want to buy a shirt
from Kyle store it's awesomesauce
network.com slash store he has lots of
fabulous designs as you can see here and
we have an ongoing sweater sale so Kyle
only has one sweater left that's this
one if you want to buy sweaters there's
they're 10 bucks off my store is over
here at store dot Pulsar Burnett and I
also have the sweaters for 30 bucks I
also have the thumbscrew shirts like the
one I'm wearing today and then I also
have mugs and glasses some glassware so
if you want a nice mug or a 20 ounce
Imperial peg glass you can buy them it's
stored at Paul cybernet Yukie real and
that's a great way your what if you're a
team rebel I don't know I called it an
English pint too thick it's not an
English but I don't know it's hard to
classify glasses these you know you try
to just be an ignorant American and say
things that maybe aren't true and just
go with it and people call you on it I
don't know what deals it's a cup you put
it's just a cup let's just take a drink
yet okay do we have other announcements
yes since we got some Johnson John Doe
guys if you happen to purchase goods
from both of our stores at the same time
they will get shipped to you together in
the same box and you will get a refund
for some of the shipping costs depending
where you live it's usually about five
bucks so you'll get back but also Cal
and I have been trying to give shout
outs at least to the people who buy
stuff while we are broadcasting so have
a Johnson to go
Matthew Matthew hey big ol Johnson for
you sir nice indeed Oh GG all right
mm-hmm
Thank You Matthew yep you get to
Johnson's nope that's all for me I just
got one more that rolled in just five
seconds ago from Rudolph Rudolph thank
you sir runner
Johnson mom I am okay anyway so uh thank
you that's that's that's all what kind
of bun the Johnsons oh he got a hoodie
no he got a hoodie nice very nice
thank you mrs. battery the awesomesauce
better love it this isn't an
announcement but this was this came
across my my desk across the Twitter
desk earlier this week Oh the glorious
PC this is the easy machine by ace
vanquish he just posted this picture is
he going for a job with the bay right
with the with the computer strapped in
there but look at the comment the
comments afterwards are just awesome
right
seesee right boys in the hood right can
we I was gonna I wanted to have a back
and forth cruisin down the street with
my ex 6fo jock and the peasants clock
him doe went to the steam to get the
scoop knuckleheads out there playing
ninety-eight hoops a car pulls up who
can it be a fresh shovel Picador rollin
new well gee it rolls that as window
when he starts to say it's all about
playing that GTA ok yeah the Chevelle
Picador by the way is it's like one of
the cars in Grand Theft Auto yes it's
like the right okay it's like an El
Camino
I really hope all those people that are
different I don't know there I'll block
that so all right so let's let's let's
kick off my half of the show we have
news we usually begin the second we
usually end the first half and begin the
second half with with good old tech news
so pull up my stuff so I know what I'm
talking about here all right so let's
start out with some info Unzen we've
been trying to keep you guys updated
with AMD's upcoming new line of
processors based on
new architecture the new architecture is
codenamed Zen this is an OSI 3d net
article claiming that AMD Zen and their
k12 CPUs designs which actually are ARM
based CPUs for servers have taped out
which is a significant point along the
developments pipeline when you're when
you're making a processor okay it
basically means that the the
architecture itself is finalized
yeah so the funny thing here is is like
where this information comes from which
is actually a LinkedIn profile of an AMD
employee so the am the employee was very
keen to update their LinkedIn profile
right away when this happened who knows
if that means they were like actively
searching for new jobs or anything like
that I hope that's not why they did it
but they updated that LinkedIn profile
and put stuff like in Keller's profile
it's it wasn't Jim Keller's profile but
um wait where did it go five plus years
of digital design experience at high
performance x86 arm and CPU cores
spanning microarchitecture RTL
methodology and physical design from
concept to tape out successfully
designed and taped out various x86 ARM
cores including piledriver excavator
excavator Zen and k12 piledriver and
excavator the market microarchitectures
that are currently in AMD processors if
you buy them right now physical design
experience across different technologies
ranging from 30 to 90 meter 20 nanometer
to 16/14 nanometer FinFET designs so
there's some important details and some
of these points on on this LinkedIn
profile what is it based on the new that
they're based that based on those
manufacturing processes these must be
based on the new FinFET process nodes
they mentioned 16 nanometer and 14
nanometer fin fit which suggests that
AMD will be using both TSMC and Global
Foundries fabs because they're both
working on different process nodes right
now okay also the Zen architecture just
generally speaking is said to have at
least a 40 percent gain in performance
compared to AMD's existing excavator CPU
cores which it needs at the very least
and then also some recent rumors from
AMD claim that they're doubling
the number of decoder units al use and
floating-point units in each core of a
Zen CPU when compared to a to AMD
bulldozer based designs and just to give
you a high-level that would basically
put them on par with Intel's current
designs when it comes to those those
specific elements and how many of them
there are per quart these n architecture
will be launched and CPUs will be a m4
platform so a new socket it'll use ddr4
and then
AMD's k12 CPU which is the second part
of this article is scheduled to release
in early 2017 and it's aiming to make
arm a more viable server platform which
makes sense because you can put lots of
them together you can do many many cores
and arm just from the get-go has been
very power efficient true which you want
if you're doing a server ok a little bit
of Zen news there for you guys let's
move on to this guy this is a Canadian
inventor and this is another one that
popped up on my Twitter feed earlier
this week and he has this is a test that
he ran of a new prototype record-setting
hoverboard and we were just talking
about back to the future we were just
talking about there's some back to the
future tie-ins today so this whole video
which you guys might be able to barely
hear this whole video is very long it's
this is CBC News this article I'm going
to jump ahead to the point in the video
where I've put a note that this is where
it starts so this is a crazy hoverboard
so it's like it's like a drone that's
like uses drone helicopter thingies I'm
using all the wrong terminology here
around the edges propellers propellers
yes a couple of these but then he stands
on it so this is his first attempt going
out over the water and you can see just
like how he's moving across here but
this one he actually there was a system
failure the right side just kind of
collapsed so he kind of took a tumble
there but not to be daunted he went back
to the drawing boards what kind of
record did he set it was the longest
longest hover hover board flight so
here's him taking off and just cruising
around the lake like like this is what I
do all the time I just stand on this
thing
he's ready to bike like four or five
meters above the water and I just look
how stable it is I mean granted the one
before this he fell but but but you also
have to imagine that he's he's got the
learning curve down like I doubt
something like you or I could just jump
on that thing and be like we're good to
go it's probably actually unique a
different experience that you probably
got to get used to it also also
advancements in just drone technology in
general for like self balancing stuff
and that kind of thing
all is things that he said integrated
you know if he was controlling it just
then by leaning or I think he controls
it okay yeah as far as I know cuz yeah
he's got a he's got a wire with the
thing about his hand that I think he
eases so what was the record like did
how long was he in the air for or
hovering for um so the 275 meters yeah
that was the record yeah five meters
above the lake for a distance of two
hundred seventy five point nine meters
last night actually no this is this is
not so let me let me clarify that is his
old record that he broke in this this
didn't mention specifically the new
record what it was um but in May this
guy his name is Katalin Alexandra
Kellen and Alexandra Daru Mouse
Alex will call him Alex so Alex may
broke the world record for the longest
never bored flight this was a few months
back that was five meters five meters
above the lake for a distance of two
hundred and seventy five point nine
meters and that lasted one and a half
minutes this article is about him
breaking that record I said but they
don't say save those numbers so I'm
sorry I don't have that it's not
directly for you guys but I'm still
impressive this is a prototype that him
he's working on with his company which
is called Omni hoverboards and it's a
secret next-generation version and from
what I understand this video that we're
watching is him Reeb raking that record
but again they they don't really say
specifically what it is but pretty
badass freaking hoverboard I want one I
want one to do your Santa
cool yeah all right Villar saying that
there's a train coming through their
house again yeah there was a train sorry
about that
we've improved our audio situation with
these multi monoprice microphone you can
hear the train so now you can get that
surround sound thing when the train
rolls through okay here is a USB flash
drive that can fry your computer ooh fun
yes I'm kind of shy been on oh joy some
arts Technica yeah I could have done a
no joy segment this week but I didn't
all right so this is a researcher who
goes by the name dark purple which must
mean he's a prince fan or something I
don't know but he's developed this this
us beat killer flash drives this is
actually secondary version of this that
one of these has already existed this
one's just more badass and kills your
computer even more so there's him
plugging it into a system yeah so within
seconds of being plugged in the USB
stick delivers a negative 220 volt
electric surge to the USB port the
earlier and less powerful version of
this that he did I think last year it
drew it would draw power from the USB
port using a DC to DC converter until it
reached negative 100 volts and then it
would discharge that to the system
causing permanent damage to the hardware
inside this one goes up to negative 220
volts and then it process and then this
process runs on a loop until the
circuitry the rest of the circuitry and
the computer fails so they're they're
assuming based on that information that
the second version the more badass one
he made it works kind of based on the
same principles best April thumbs gift
ever
oh yeah hilarious look look you need a
huge be 332 gig here you go just yeah
just fire it up just pop it in there so
what what practical purpose could this
server is this just purely to like
really piss someone off like because if
I need like you somebody's sitting just
similar sitting at their laptop but you
know to Starbucks you just like walk by
pop it in and like they're $1200 MacBook
or whatever issues yeah so thank you
it's so quick without even them like
knowing what's happening yeah you could
literally just start to be like excuse
me there's something right here and just
plug it in and it's completely toast yes
although you could also just pick up
their laptop and smash it on the floor
you could that be less subtle sure you
play check out this video I have on this
USB Drive Oh what's wrong with your
laptop it totally killed but you have to
be drew I've got a GU yeah I don't know
I mean they they do like SSDs that
self-destruct and that kind of thing if
you know you can enter a kill command if
you're you know if the feds are raiding
you or whatever
yeah this seems like I don't know a
booby-trapped USB Drive seems like
someone mentioned and this is a good
point I was thinking this two spies
would use this or US military like could
be a military type thing like like like
let's say someone's about to you have
really important files on your well and
you just somewhere but that's part of
the article to is it saying that this
will this will likely deliver like
enough voltage to kill like the port
it'll probably permanently damage the
like motherboard in there but there's a
very good chance you know it's not the
damage isn't gonna spread far enough I
see two damage like your drives oh well
then this is just totally a troll device
yeah for someone you think yeah and I
guess just another reason to totally be
afraid of key USB flash drives yeah like
oh thank you like Steve has taught me to
do I think we go to I go I gotta like
trade shows with Steve and the you get
USB flash drives like candy at trade
shows people like oh you know our press
deck is on here it's got all the
pictures of the thing and it also
happens to be a 64 gig USB 3.0 Drive oh
thanks
and I get a big oh sweet like I've got
I've got these now this is like you plug
that in like yes and you just he doesn't
trust him and he's probably right to
some degree I mean bad USB and all that
kind of crap like having unprotected sex
yeah kind of is there so Steve that
article that we just talked about is
they might have already tweeted it to
all right
here's one more news article this is
from Paper Shotgun GTA 5 we talked about
a little bit early and earlier in the
show yes pretty cool
back to the future GTA 5 video on Kyle's
half there's a new update for GTA 5 I
believe this just went out today 1.6 gig
update and in case you're wondering what
the size is
this is their lowriders update lowriders
oh yeah really lowriders update yeah
like stars and stuff yes
lowriders are those things that's really
mature for so it adds a bunch of new
ways to customize cars you also get a
fourth purchasable property new clothes
new hair stars new hairstyles new
accessories some extra missions if you
watch the the preview here for this
expansion that seems to heavily feature
Lamar Davis who was very popular I liked
it there's some people just really like
Lamar I hated Lamar you hated Lamar so
badly like a Haley didn't like him I
just hated everything about it okay well
maybe you're not gonna be into this
update then you know but yeah deck out
your engine block with covers and air
filters coat your interiors with Ballou
or leather and patterns
Villu you have to say it like like
what's-his-face on the simpsons there's
a dude dang it I'll remember it later
choose custom colors and designs for
dowels add new steering wheel and custom
shift levers give you ride a lift with
hydraulics the more powerful bumps the
higher you can bounce okay
meet up your friends and fellow car
enthusiasts to show off your new ride
use the player interaction menu while
inside or outside the car to open up
vehicle doors hood and trunk oh that's
fancy hmm switch to the engine to flash
your neons and bump your favorite radio
station no can you only apply this to
the lowrider vehicles or can you do
these things with any car in the game
now yes thank you and until a g25 I was
like I was thinking of Futurama zapp
brannigan not Simpsons but they both use
the same animation stuff so forgive me
you can always count on catch that exact
Branigan Qun velour because that's what
his outfits made of and he wants people
touch it ok I did it he did a future I'm
a reference and I did
realize it okay that's that's all for
tech news but of course it's freezing
because cuz mark Starr knows how to do
yeah downloadable content mm-hmm they
give it out for free and then if you
want to buy Rockstar money then you can
buy of in-game money if you yeah what to
but you just you get it for free paid up
I don't know fun okay uh what state of
threat is going on what is going on
what's my next segment my next segment
is sword fight it's a word fight oh I
was taking advantage of our microphone
it's fun I thought we should whisper the
entire episode we're on these days we
might well get the mics right down close
to our face right now mine's like too
far away next anyone there you go first
of all freaking people out now okay
sword fights is the segment where Cal
and I both take opposite sides of a
controversial topic and we argue it and
we also allow you guys to join in by
letting us know what you think about
that topic via a straw poll so not to
spend too much time at the introduction
but let's jump right into it in video
game ready drivers to require GeForce
experience to install we already discuss
this on Cal so half of the show I
already expressed my disdain for it now
okay so really anything to argue here no
um I'm posting the link in chat right
now if you guys want to jump over to the
straw poll and argue and start giving us
your feedback but I didn't want to argue
like is this a good thing or is this a
bad thing because I think most people
would think that it's stupid and sucks
at least that's what I think so instead
of asking any of that I'm asking the
question of what can we do about it like
is there is there anything we can do
about invidious dick no if it is dick
move
what why are you reading that out of
context arms what can we do about
invidious dick move to lock drivers
behind GeForce experience registration
can we can we do anything
there anything that the public can
affect so my answers here we should all
just switched AMD of course nothing
Nvidia really they really got our balls
in a vise it's that's so painful having
our balls in a vise or I put a third one
which is everyone just wait for that new
console Nintendo is working on hey cuz
you always gotta have a way out
yep through it I'm saying screw screw PC
games I'm going console and I'm going
intend oh the best one of all I mean
alright so we'll leave the third one for
anyone who wants to vote on that and
what do you think Kyle you want to take
switch to AMD or like there's nothing we
can do you know take the hopeless you
know argue the Pat it's always fun to
argue that that everything is shit and
nothing can be done yeah or you can say
we should switch AMD I'm gonna say that
we should switch to Andy okay
you want to start it yes okay I'll drink
my bourbon you should do that getting
nice and liquored up cuz you're about to
get decimated to you AMD he's the pain
AMD I mean they're just better in every
way possible can I vote can I vote on
sure all right so you should go with AMD
because for one they're just a cooler
company all around like if you went to a
party there'd be like little cliques you
know there's like little groups of
people that hang out at parties there'd
be like the nvidia group there'd be like
the nvidia group who'd be like kind of
the preppy kids like the cool kids but
they wouldn't like let you into their
group unless you like brought him a beer
or something and they would like try to
like own the party like it was their
party and you know everything would be
proprietary somehow I don't know how you
work that into a party but anyway the
AMD kids would be like maybe not as cool
maybe not as popular but still very more
inviting their monitors would be cheaper
their monitor technology because you
know free sync and stuff so what what
I'm saying here is AMD I don't think is
that bad as people say
they are and I feel like NVIDIA keeps
shooting themselves in the foot with
like every every few months nvidia does
another thing that's stupid
or or shady or proprietary or all the
above and i feel like they keep getting
away with it because people keep buying
their cards so maybe we should just
maybe maybe just go AMD go team red for
like a year or two and then once nvidia
loses all their sales or majority of the
market then they might you know be
humbled and come back with you know a
more reasonable approach to their to
their business model are you done and
bourbon okay that's that was most of
what you said there didn't make any
sense oh it made perfect sense paul but
nevertheless i think you're wrong no all
right so um yeah basically we're we're
all screwed we're all screwed in this
situation this is an example of why the
free market is you know requires
competition in order to bring the most
and the best out of companies because
without competition then you basically
have companies doing whatever the heck
they want in this situation you have
nvidia vs AMD we're talking specifically
about drivers here so let's ignore AMD
on the CPU side let's just specifically
talk about GPUs and nvidia it's it's
there's no question about it you can
just look at the numbers and vidya has
kind of a stranglehold on the market
they have a much larger share of the
discrete GPU market if people are buying
graphics cards to game on chances are
they're buying an A or an Nvidia
graphics card and not an AMD Nvidia has
seen this and they basically said that
we have a mandate from the masses to do
whatever the hell we goddamn please so
they're like we don't have enough people
on GeForce experience we need to harvest
more emails so that we can we can send
them emails to advertise them things and
we also need more people to use GeForce
experience so we can have stuff pop up
for them to I mean do you first
experience isn't then
when it comes to like ads and that kind
of thing you know it's supposed to be
there to help you but um it's still
there doing stuff in the background when
you might not want to but this is the
grave we've dug ourselves we have no
choice but to resign ourselves to
forever doing whatever that or just
accepting whatever the heck nvidia wants
to do will swallow it and will like it I
still vote boycott okay let's see what
you guys think what can we do about this
situation I got the results nothing all
right I was wrong it's doom and gloom
we're all screwed yeah I mean pretty
much but there you did have quite a few
people you know who did seem to say you
know just switch to Andy mm-hm that's
alright that's heard I mean that's
that's the thing that sucks about this
is that if you bought an Nvidia graphics
card three months ago or six months ago
or a year ago and you know you can only
build a new system or buy a new graphics
card every three years or something like
and you don't like this decision I don't
know if you're on the point if you're on
the cusp of making a purchase then you
can do then something like this can can
cause you to affect your decision of
what you might purchase and you might
say you know what like look at lo novo
right now
I used to recommend them the LoVo as a
laptop to people all the time because I
don't spend a lot of time with laptops
but it was always a solid recommendation
now because it's tough lenovo has done
recently I would not recommend him yeah
but if you bought a Lenovo laptop six
months ago before you know this crap
came out then you're kind of stuck with
that or whatever but anyway yeah I'm
referring to super fish in the other
garbage in the lenovo is pulled recently
by the way but okay thanks to all of you
guys for giving your feedback for the
straw poll let's move on to one other
sort of fight question here so the u.s.
actually they sort of tease us last week
and then I believe I think it was
yesterday maybe even the day before
yesterday knows yesterday was Monday
they have announced the task force a
task force task force aimed at mandatory
drone registration
and we're not talking about that drone
we're talking about that drone no yeah
so this this that's a government drone
dude that shoots missiles and kills lots
of people this is a small drone that
flies in the path of a 747 and kills
lots of people that an 11 year olds
flying yeah 11 year olds are flying or
something like that look at that that's
a cool picture actually so what's the
deal every single drone or just certain
drones that are people or that are doing
certain things or is it's like you buy a
$20 drone that can go a thousand feet in
the air you got to register it so what
this is talking about as small rogue
drones weighing less than 55 pounds
these have been an increasing concern
among safety regulators for years
specifically when it comes to US
airports and flying drones near US
airports and there's something to be
said there because a tiny drone that
gets sucked into a jet intake couldn't
cause a pretty major problem yeah in
fact we talked about this a little bit
when there were a bunch of fires here
over the summer in Southern California
and they were trying to do the air drops
for the fire retardants to help fight
the fire and they couldn't because
people were like flying their drones up
there to try to get pictures of the fire
and stuff like that yeah so the question
we're gonna add ask or argue or answer
right now is this one right here I
should also be posting this in chat
which is should you be required to
register your drone this is at a federal
level this is the US government and I
vote from the last option this task
force this tech what can I say the task
task force asked for pork it's at this
task fork as they've been they've been
tasked with such a difficult word to say
I have tasked with all right coming up
with a solution for this by basically
requiring mandatory drone registration
if you buy a drone and you live in the
u.s. you have to register it right that
way if you fly it into something and
cause damage I guess then they
immediately know who is a fault right
so Kyle what do you watch which side of
this do you want to take options are
what are the options
yes drones are dangerous especially in
the hands of humans no it won't help and
I don't like filling out paperwork or
the third answer which is what if the
drone has again attached and that's as
close as I'm gonna get to comparing this
to gun laws cuz that's just a can of
worms that I don't want to dive into
right now okay uh should you be required
to register your doing I am gonna go
with the obvious and correct no it won't
help and I don't like filling out
paperwork okay
mainly because just like any other thing
that's the US government tries to
regulate and you know there's there's a
bunch of examples examples of this like
like gun control right I mean you have
to be in a lot of states you have to
actually register for a gun have that
gun tied to you or whatever and that
doesn't really stop or keep anyone from
getting killed or hurt if someone wanted
to fly a drone into the place just to
interrupt here the parallel lied that
was certain there's an obvious parallel
here there is no federal gun
registration laws there nothing like
that exists in the u.s. there isn't no
this would become this would be a
federal federally mandated register your
drone thing so this is this is our state
regulated and it depends on your state
that's what I mean in some states
there's actually you actually have to
register your gun
no you yes well okay this is this is it
all right I didn't want that I didn't
want to make this one about guns but
what I'm but yeah use I'm using that but
this is my point
this would be a more strict control when
it comes to actual registration of
something if you're comparing guns to
drones right then then the current
federal gun laws in the United States
right but I'm comparing these some state
laws of guns to this federal regulation
of drones because there are some
parallels between those two things yes
what I'm saying is if you try to
regulate anything they're all
be a group of people then go out of
their way to to do whatever they want to
bypass those laws okay um and and even
if I mean who's to say that they're not
registering it under a false name or a
false identity and then you have some
people getting in trouble because
someone has committed drone registry
fraud like if I you know registered your
name and identity to a drone and I flew
it into a plane killed 200 people then
that's not very good for you and there
will be it doesn't matter how how tied
up a grip you know the government has on
on on things like this something is
always gonna slip through the cracks so
this really just costs more tax dollars
or more energy and effort and time and
creates more problems really than than
it than it solves
okay yes and that's why you wrong if i
were agreeing with kyle would say and
why do we even have laws against killing
people because people are gonna break
those laws anyway but rather than
pointing out his logical fallacy if what
i will actually do is argue the opposite
which is that yes drones are dangerous
especially in the hands of humans I
think what this comes out to something
called accountability and people being
accountable for their actions if you
look at stuff like how people act when
they're online for example and there's
been lots of arguments philosophical and
otherwise about this that ever since the
advent of being online that people have
been able to register in sand use
pseudonyms or that kind of thing Google
for example for quite a while tried to
really encourage people to use their
real names because what they found and
lots of studies is that when you're
forced to use a real name and identify
yourself as who you are that guess what
you're not an asshole to people anymore
or like you don't feel comfortable going
out and being a troll and like randomly
throwing hates at people and that kind
of thing and that's because you're
accountable because you now know that if
I go out and say hey you you know
whatever hateful thing I want to say to
this person or this group of people or
whatever you want to say that cannot be
directly attributed to me this is the
same thing that they're trying to do
with these laws when it comes to drones
which is basically saying hey for all of
us who might say look at those jerks who
were you know flying their drones
near the fires in Southern California
and preventing people from you know you
know preventing the planes from going in
there and and firefighting and
everything well there's a small
percentage of people who maybe who were
in that situation at the moment who
might say hey I can get some cool
footage here and upload a YouTube video
and get a bunch of hits or something
like that which is probably what's on
your mind and you might not even
consider the the other possible
ramifications my point here is though
you would definitely second you would
definitely think twice about doing
something like that
if you knew immediately that your drone
was registered to you and that via
whatever means of identification
anything you did with your drone that
same extension of yourself was no longer
anonymous but we're arguing swordfight
which means I was taking a cite for that
I think there's definitely more nuanced
arguments when it comes to that but as
always let's see what you guys think
about the drones I'm actually pretty
curious about this one no it won't help
and I don't like filling out paper at
paper
so people duck against this I would say
argued against paperwork and I would
have one that's true I would say when it
comes down to it I would be against this
- I don't think drones should be
registered they like it said that it
definitely when it gets to a certain
size like it needs to be yeah I mean
looking at the video that we showed
earlier if the dude flying around you
know the the hover board drone or
whatever means that it's a manned
vehicle it's not an you UAV unmanned
aerial vehicle is what this actually was
referring to but yeah be online anyway
very interesting I'll be curious to see
how that goes I don't own a drone right
now but um I don't know making it more
difficult for people to get them or just
more of a pain in the ass because you
have to register it or whatever or if
you if you had to have like a drone
license I'd be interesting to see how
that goes drone insurance alright next
up it is time for our buzzer spots
that's right
yes another live show is sponsored by
Giga bytes and we say huge thank you to
gigabyte for sponsoring our show yes as
always we explained to them what we do
on our show and
all the drinking and stuff that goes on
and they still wanted to sponsor us so
they're cool we said okay we're cool
like that and we said hey gigabyte if
you want to sponsor us how about you
send us some of them products that you
have and we will show them to people on
the channel yep on the show and that's
pretty much how it's gone so today we're
taking a look at you just know you're
Vanna White here let me and good all
right so we got a top-down view here
this is the H 170 and - Wi-Fi
motherboard from gigabyte and this is
actually a board that I will be doing a
build with fairly soon I think in the
next week week-and-a-half
give us give us give us some teasers
Paul are you are you building for
yourself or for this build was actually
gonna be for my brother-in-law Jason my
sister's husband and he's just he has
been wanting to build the new system for
quite some time and he has a rose bowl
case already make sure I get this closer
what you're gonna be doing with system
it's not gonna be a gaming system
although I might still like throw in a
last-minute graphics card in there right
now it's not gonna have a GPU but it's
gonna have a 6400 the i5 6400 processor
which is a quad core which goes for
about a hundred and seventy hundred and
eighty dollars and it's it's gonna go
right in there this is an H 170 board
which means it's not gonna be good for
overclocking you can do like a tiny
little bit of overclocking with it but
if you're going for one of the case Hugh
unlock processors like a 6700 care 6600
Kay probably not the best board for you
however this board can be had for about
110 or 220 dollars depending on where
you buy it at trying to make the camera
autofocus it's not another focus oh it's
not yeah I can barely focus like a
little bit I could get like really close
in then but then I'd have to get the
board like up here for it to be focus
okay
thank you wait good thank you anyway you
guys know what a motherboard looks like
again use your imaginations do that
anyway this bird has lots of cool
features though and as long as you don't
need to overclock your unlock processor
it's got lots of cool stuff all the
features you like and I want to point
out that it's got an MDOT two on the
back right there as well as nice snaked
in there so for just a little bit more
than $100 each 170 in Wi-Fi and it's
also got that integrated Wi-Fi you can
see little Wi-Fi card right there and
that's nice to have that it's got Intel
NYX I believe it does yeah I think it
does that's a good question though I
think it'd be on the box where the box
yeah you check area let's duel
Intel Gigabit Ethernet LAN yes yes to to
Intel NYX
dos on there and actually the Wi-Fi what
is the Wi-Fi I can't read it's AC
probably yeah it's it's a total of an HD
I think display memory say it uh land
man wait no doesn't say it doesn't say
oh yeah
ah hey don't eat that 11ac yes so we got
the Wi-Fi in there too and all just like
black pretty much black yeah yeah
motherboard
how many see the ports one two three
four five six yeah you got six SATA
ports and two of those are SATA or well
four of those can be plugged in with
SATA Express kind of nice too and oh and
it's got USB type-c 3.1 type C I believe
ya know what what Rozsival case is he
using for that it's like did it's it's
not one you can get anymore okay yeah he
I forget where he got it but like he's
he's like I have this case I was like
okay is it it's just one of the taller
it's one of the tall taller Oh
new genetics ones it's not the new trend
though that's probably the newer one I
one of these it's not for sale anymore
yes you probably won't find it on there
anyway okay thank you bye Thank You
gigabyte for sponsoring us oh you know
what one other thing we need to say what
this this right here we forgot to say
this on behalf of the show one other
thing for our sponsor guys gigabyte has
a feedback program that they have
started up so if you go to review
gigabyte us
you can review a gigabyte product and
you submit your review and that enters
you for a chance to win a gigabyte
bricks ultra compact PC so do that if
you have the gigabyte product and you
want to review it if you're gonna review
it anyway then do this and that just
gives you the bonus again review
gigabyte us sweet okay let's move on
what's next I don't know what's next and
I know if I should remove the dot-com
because they're becoming less and less
from from actual space comm but alright
if you guys are following me on Twitter
then you might already know that what
I'm about to talk about cuz I already
tweeted about it earlier this week and
that is Hughes that the astronomers may
have found giant alien mega structures I
orbiting happened to see catch this on
Twitter I think we're putting a star
near the Milky Way I this is amazing
this is amazing and fantastic look
aliens confirmed half life 3 confirmed
look at these space pictures damn which
don't show up well that's a right so
astronomers may have found giant alien
mega structures what are a lien mega
structures and why dude astronomers
think that they found them okay so Jason
Wright is an astronomer from Penn State
Penn State University and he is the one
who published an article specifically
about a star that's not in the Milky Way
but it's just above the Milky Way it's
about 1,400 light-years away it is
between the constellations Cygnus and
Lyra and the stars name is K I see 8 4 6
to 8 5 2 rolls off the tongue yes
but these scientists
renamed it or given it the loving
nickname WTF 0:01 oh that's easy
WTF stands for what's the flux does
really yes it does it makes perfect
sense science missing hippy scientists
are great at naming things exactly what
they are and I kind of like it sometimes
but then they make it an acronym so it
sounds I love how it 0:01 like it's the
first day the first WTF what the flux so
alright the way that s telescope in
space and the kepler telescope is one
that's specifically made for planet
hunting the way that they figure out if
there's a planet with the star this is
the star dims every so often because as
the planets rotating the star planet
moves between the star and our point of
perspective and then you get a bit of
reduction in light that's called flux or
the the the the amount of fluctuation of
the amount of light coming out and this
star was was actually identified back in
2009 as a candidate for having
earth-like planets orbiting earth-like
planets now this new stuff that they've
been talking about is okay I'll give you
guys the creepers to run do the
appropriate thing which is that this is
really really really probably not true
it's probably not what's happening this
is according to the article and
according to scientists who do their job
right this is like the very last thing
that you might consider as a possibility
but it is a possibility okay and for me
much like when you get on a plane and
you have to turn off all your
electronics devices
chances are your electronics devices
aren't going to mess with the planes
flight or guidance systems or anything
like that they busted no busters but on
the very very very very small chance
that it does you do better safe than
sorry so on the very very small chance
that there is something orbiting this
star that is not naturally occurring
then that's definitely something we
should take a closer look at so um do
you wish do you are you hoping
that they're the third alien
megastructures yeah you are
why not yeah me too I mean because some
people get freaked out about it like
they don't they don't like the idea of
aliens they're like no I want us to be
the only one like I don't know it'll
just come to I've seen Independence Day
I know how it ends
yeah yeah but I figure if they're out
there I mean might as well meet him
sooner rather than later cuz they're
probably if they if they really are that
advanced they're probably gonna find us
before we find them true anyway okay so
the encryption is nutrition alright so
the light from from from this star dims
like he would expect for a planet
rotating it but the light from the star
dims and random patterns
it also dims much more it dims as much
as 20 or 22 percent of its light is
blocked
most planets orbiting a star even large
planets only blocked maybe one or two
percent of the planets light so it's
huge I mean they can they already know
this is pretty much confirmed there's
something big or orbiting the star
that's blocking the light and a much
larger much more of the light than you
might expect
that's eerie the other weird things
about it is that it's a regular
regularly shaped and a periodic the dips
and the flux down below the 20% levels
so not what you would expect from a
regular orbits of a planet or something
like that so they have said that one of
the possibilities here that is more
likely than aliens since we have never
confirmed aliens to exist anywhere would
be a cluster of comets that's orbiting
the star okay I couldn't dim the light
from it
in a regular intervals and could dim
more sometimes unless at other times
right or it could just be alien
megastructures so um we'll go with that
now what they're talking about here is
something called the car - of scale are
you familiar with the car - of scale
that sounds too close closely -
the other thing I don't like what Oh
like the Kardashians gas card a photo
correcting you and even autocrine did
you mean yeah and unfortunately my car
daddy right because that comes up i
spells card acid I stopped her - shit
with the K H was just sad it's still ok
I know the Kardashian scale is a scale
made up in 1964 by a dude Kardashev
what's his first name
Nikolai Nikolai Kardashev which is a
scale for identifying civilizations and
their announcement so type one
civilization is where we're at right now
right or a technological level close to
the level presented on earth it's and
it's it's a scale that's based on energy
consumption so the amount of energy
we're consuming is currently a fraction
of the amount of energy produced by our
Sun right Kardashev scale type - would
be like if we grew up to the point where
we can harness all of the energy from
our Sun mm-hmm that would put us at type
2 and I think that actually goes up
beyond that yeah the entire radiation
output of its star and then a type 3
civilization would be able to possess or
utilize the energy on the scale its own
galaxy which is obviously far beyond
that but even just being able to harness
the all of the power from you from just
your star that you live on or near it's
pretty impressive and there's different
ways that you might do this one of them
would be a Dyson Sphere in the Dyson
Sphere something is like a large sphere
and this is a bad picture of one here
but um put the star in the middle you
build a bunch of structures around it
you get through solar panels or whatever
you you you harness the energy coming
off of that star so this is why they
think they're maybe maybe maybe might be
alien mega-structure surrounding the
star is because it's not outside the
realm of possibility for that to be what
that's what they're saying is that that
what is a lot of wishful thinking - this
is the quote they keep coming back to a
large cluster of objects in space looks
like
something you would expect an alien
civilization to build that you might
expect and I'm not coming guys so I'm
excited
moons are so pretty up upshot of all
this is that they're gonna be focusing a
little bit more attention on this on
this star I don't know if there's
anything further that we can derive from
this but hey kind of exciting yeah but
even if like they launched like right
now if we got if we could get in a
spaceship right now and head towards
that star at the speed of light it would
take fourteen hundred years crazy anyway
alright let's hope the aliens are a
little bit more on tales from space oh
wait that's wrong article this one
Russia and Europe are going to launch a
joint mission to the Dark Side of the
Moon and then they're gonna build this
be a base there how poetic
yes so pink floyd-- I'm sure we'll be
suing because they they own the rights
to the Dark Side of the Moon this is the
European Space Agency of the ESA and
Russia working together
coordinating they're planning an
exploration mission in 2020 there's a
picture of the moon for anyone who's
never seen it here's a needed some
filler there this is an early blue blue
print for their Lander it's called the
Luna 27 so this was announced by Russian
space agency which is a Rus Roscosmos
they in November Luna 27 as a robotic
Lander that will land on the south pole
or the Aitken Basin which is a giant
crater on the Dark Side of the Moon and
it will prospect it for resources that
could be utilized by future moon
dwellers and go be a moon miner I feel
like the the Gold Rush of the 21st
century
and then once you hit 18 you're no
longer
you're correct yeah oh look every cow I
become that you're very clever yoke
Russia in the meantime is planning to
land a manned expedition on the moon by
2030 and then the ESA is expected to
supply pilot which is a landing system
that uses later get laser guidance and a
set of sophisticated cameras to pick the
best spot for exploration and a
revolutionary drill that will burrow two
meters under the surface to make a nest
babies moon moon dust death moon metal
myth mithril mithril
yes sounds very unless they dug the
truths to Italy into deep the Europeans
are also going to construct an aren't
onboard lab that can immediately analyze
the samples that they gather
pair the reason for going to the South
Pole of the moon is because there's more
of a chance because it's really cold
there somatic crystallized water and you
can use that to make fuel makes nice
alright one last story here for tales
from space and this story is actually
not in space but it's got the massive
vibe to it so I thought I'd plop it in
here 3d printing has been used 3d print
it wasn't all 3d printed but it was used
as part of the process to make the first
real handheld railgun what ya know is
this fires plasma projectiles 560 miles
per hour and there's the dude being like
this is my real gun so these are these
are some of the projectiles that it can
fire what is a railgun Paul for those of
us who haven't played many video games
okay let me find it from the article
here so I know I'm speaking words that
make sense if I don't I mean using a
combination of 3d printing and widely
available components man built a
functional handheld railgun that has the
six capacitors and delivers more than
3000 kilojoules of energy for shots what
does it shoot he's used metal rods made
of graphite aluminum and copper coated
tungsten like the ones you can see right
there
I can also fire carbon projectiles and
Teflon plasma rods so a plasma gun
plasma is a state of matter by the way I
hear it says no the e/m railgun launcher
is a long-range weapon that fires
projectiles using electricity instead of
chemical propellants yes I use
electricity to propel the projectile now
there's two videos here and
unfortunately these videos are like it
happens that was it right there did you
see it this is how fast that's it that's
the shot firing it's so fast it's like
instantaneous so he really needs like
the super slow mo guys yeah he needs a
slow mo guys or something to jump in
here to just to see what's because
that's it that's even slowed down so 240
FPS yeah so it doesn't look all that
impressive but um there's like a kind of
a schematic of the gun and you I mean
one shot of that well if you got a head
shot of a kill you instantaneously but
independence whether you have quad
damage or not as well and how many
shields you have alright sweet that's
all for my scheduled content okay but we
have a few more minutes here so guys
we're gonna do some Q&amp;amp;A oh and if you
have questions then ask them in the
twitch chat or maybe send us tweets
although I haven't been watching my
tweets very closely I saw a tweet
earlier I should sell body pillows of
myself
Selby Master Singh said I should sell
body pills with myself I because the
money's gonna be making a penny worn out
I I can do that missing some hearts I
did I do okay what double of zero is
still zero I don't know what's going
someone said you promised double the
nudity and didn't deliver my wife
tweeted one swallow doesn't make a
summer
we're doing wise she's if you guys want
to follow my wife on Twitter she's mrs.
Paul Hardware that's right and it mostly
she tweets sometimes sometimes vaguely
suggestive sometimes just lately really
blatantly suggestive stats you just know
it's your specialty I have it anyway you
can tweet us suite of stuff Hallam I I
am sore I am freaking sore I spent the
past two two-and-a-half days building a
part of a fence and a gate on the side
of the house over here and it went
really well
I showed kyle earlier it's it's all
functional it sounds so simple when you
say it like a lion I made a gate but
then like in practice it actually is a
lot of work yeah to do a while you to
plan the whole thing out yeah there's a
lot of work but I'm glad that that's one
of my that's one of those projects that
I've been meaning to do for the past two
years and finally done but yeah
any node - OH - builds you have any node
- Oh to build spy I could actually do
I'm supposed to hit a freckle Josh I
should have hit him up like a month ago
but I when I built my dad's computer
like because the I built my new computer
like two months ago I actually gutted
out my wife's computer though and used
some parts there because she wasn't
using her system much at the time and I
was like oh this is perfect but now she
misses it she misses her computer that I
completely I initially gave to her for
like Christmas years ago and I took it
away from her for my dad's build so now
she wants a build and I was like okay
she's very picky with like what case she
wants but she likes the note - OH - and
I gave that to my dad - pretty much
everything that my wife could have
gotten I gave to my dad so I'm gonna ask
Josh hopefully if you can provide you
know assuming he can provide another
case I might do a build in there maybe
for some like gaming and stuff mostly
we're browsing the web it could be fun
yeah okay but PS if an up-or-down
depends if there's a filter at the
bottom of your case yep
yeah that's from no elf Aaron by the way
yeah I usually I almost always go down
all up is yeah really only situational
you
uh Alex Mallin who asks what happened to
the Paul's hardware bomb do we have a
bone what did we ever I don't think we
ever had a bomb why would we have a bomb
we don't Adam I don't know I was maybe
it was cuz you were talking about
growing weed earlier in the show oh
maybe now nope notes that has not been a
thing so I don't know where that I'm
still in process we're making it what
can you overclock a monitor currently
passed 144 Hertz
uh yes you can hand but that doesn't
mean it's gonna perform well yeah well
at work yeah this is a question I think
is it a soos I think it's who's coming
up with a monitor that's gonna be
overclockable to 165 Hertz
yeah I've seen I've seen a few go beyond
144 but it seems like 144 is kind of
like from the current menu you know for
the for the stuff that they're currently
able to mass-produce
144 seems to be like the the fastest
those monitors will go and probably the
fastest that they've found that people
see a good benefit from it or something
like that yeah yeah what are you guys
gonna do a performance performance per
dollar build that doesn't take for weeks
like LTP what's a performance per dollar
build uh it just means perform it's like
paying for the book oh okay
just like most building videos that we
do no I made one soon
what's your every color what's the
airspeed velocity of an inflates well o3
good are we doing it after show yes yes
we are Kyle's gonna go home though right
cows gonna go home so yeah but yeah well
we'll kick that off the after shows
we're going extreme individually then so
the after-party is on my twitch channel
which is twitch.tv slash Paul's hardware
or Kyle's twitch channel which is
twitch.tv slash awesomesauce news yeah B
Brewer no that's never yes
thank you sorry V Brewer Allyson Gipson
V brewer nine asks do you guys only
review things that are sent to you for
free no that's not the piece for me I'm
pretty sure it's for Paul too
ideally I'd like to have everything sent
to me for free so that I don't have to
like have that as part of my overhead
for the channel it helps when I can just
ask for a vendor for a product they send
to me it works out but if there's
something I really want to review and
it's not too expensive or even sometimes
if it's a really good product that I
need it anyway
I'll just go ahead and buy that product
myself because I can both use it and as
well as just review it for the channel
yes and I think well I don't think I've
ever like bought anything to her just to
review and are made it or like send it
back for a refund I don't think I've
done that yet I've done that once or
twice but um yeah yeah I mean I'm kinda
the same way if there's a product I know
I wants to try or that I have a specific
need of actually this motherboard is a
good example this motherboard I found in
research because I was like this is
after my brother-in-law had contacted me
and be like I wouldn't build the system
and I was like okay and he said I have
some parts already and as I got and he
told me the case is like I we need a
mini ITX motherboard I wanted him to get
on the new Intel platform on skylake and
so I started looking at motherboards I
found this one I was like ah that's got
a really nice feature set in a pretty
decent price so then I contacted
gigabyte and said hey here's what I have
planned for this the videos I'm gonna be
doing and then they were willing to send
that over to me so that's kind of how
that goes
of course we do also get manufacturers
who like hey we have this product we
want to send it to you I usually will
like I I don't I don't immediately say
yes to that when people hit me up in
fact I've been finding myself especially
recently saying no the vast majority of
the time but often I'll look up the
product or if they have information on
that they can sense me about it like I
want to look at the product first
because I don't want to waste my time on
garbage basically yeah I don't want to I
don't want to get a product sent my way
that I look at it like like this is I'm
either gonna have to say this is
terrible which granted I could do a
video and say this is terrible but I
feel like that's like
it's not a popular product already and
I'm like hey people you maybe thought
this is a good product and it's actually
bad then you know it seems like a waste
of a room yeah it just seems like more
of a waste of time so yeah I agree
that's some of the thought process
semana geek asks hey have you guys how
have your guys's water cooled rigs been
holding up so far any issues pop up any
regrets or upcoming changes as far as
hot lines concerned to my custom
water-cooled rig no regrets so far
everything is is pretty pretty much
working solid no leaks thank God knock
on wood
perfect perfect all this any upcoming
changes no none none as of yet I was
considering maybe mounting like another
exhaust fan at the back of my case just
to make it more neutral pressure instead
of negative pressure right now even
though that's been proven not to be too
bit too much of an issue for my case but
I've got like a little LED strip that's
I've actually zip tied to the the fan
holes the fan the the fan ventilation on
the rear so it's actually blocking where
the fan would go I wouldn't be able to
have both so if I actually put the rear
exhaust in I'd have to take out the LED
strip yeah there are there's clearance
issues there and you know it's it's a
showpiece so I'm going for going for
aesthetics here other things that I
might need to change though any issues
the pump needs to be tightened to the
the reservoir on the define s because
it's rattling a little bit hmm
so I just haven't done that yet because
you know to define us I've got three
full hard drives right behind that wall
I need to remove one of them and then
tighten it and then replace the other
hard drive and when you when you do get
around to that and this is a suggestion
from Lee all the way back to when we did
the water cooling do's and don'ts at
Newegg yeah just take all of your
fittings and give him a little turn see
if any of them though
started to loosen up yeah that's thing
personally arctic Panthers right there
behind me I haven't had any major issues
or anything like that last week when I
tried I was trying to do or know was the
two weeks ago I forget I was trying to
do - I was trying to game on him and he
wouldn't start up I was like what the
hell that was but then the next day
everything was fine so I don't know if
that's my only issue with it right
okay we should wrap up the show I wanted
to answer one last question which is
from Larry Bennett on Twitter asking if
my lieutenant data picture back there is
autographed no it's not although I did
get that directly from brent Spiner at a
at a Star Wars Star Trek and with Star
Wars at a Star Trek convention I we do
have a majority of the forge action
figure in there that was signed by levar
burton though no nice anyway okay that's
