female oh I trust me you can tell
there's a way to do it oh I think we
have some unresolved business from
earlier though like okay when it comes
to the fractal define r4 I happen to
support the black version of the case i
just i think it's superior i think it's
a better case absolutely not I would
have to disagree i think the white
define r4 is way more elegant it looks a
lot better than the black one hello
elegant yeah it's classy man yes ones
it's like a cracked out stormtrooper it
so I mean you want elegance if you want
if you want to know refinement was the
black to fire for i mean that's just
it's it's the picture of like clear i
mean it's it's Candida playing the black
define our for looks like the monolith
from 2001 space odyssey there's nothing
unique about it it's just a slab a metal
that's just so black I don't know
there's there's nothing original about
it you know I think we're just gonna
