so for a couple months now my wife and I
have been intending to sort of revamp
and redo our computer a few different
reasons for this one is that we haven't
really done a full thorough cleaning of
it since we moved in so it's a bit dusty
in the corners and difficult to get back
into the corner since it's gotten kind
of piled with stuff and then we also
wanted to install and integrate
sit-stand desks vertical desks that have
our motorized and can move up and down
now click this closure my wife actually
works at monoprice so we didn't buy
these sit-stand desk frames as well as
the monitor our mounts for them but we
did get them at costs so wanted to let
you guys know about that but of course
this whole project started with a fair
amount of cleaning out of stuff that was
already in here so we clearing out the
desks that already existed and then I
seem to have gotten a lot more clutter
up in my half of the space than my wife
but after a fair amount of elbow grease
and most of the day working on Saturday
evening we were able to get everything
cleared out and finally cleared out
enough space to actually start putting
the desk frames together so after dinner
we actually started getting all the
parts of the box and setting up at least
its the frame for my wife's desk
everything was pretty simple as far as
how it came apart there's two lights for
either side those are the heavy parts
those actually have the motors in them
there's a couple flat cross sections
that go across the base of each of those
and then a couple flat pieces that go
across the top and then the center you
can actually sort of unscrew and then
you can make it wider or narrower
depending on the size of your desk again
these are frames so they actually don't
come with the desk tops on them
so we took the desk tops off of our
existing desks and those were just from
Ikea and we were able to transfer them
over and put them on top of these frames
after they were set up and built
underneath each frame there is a control
box you just got wires and cables over
from either side to plug that into the
actual control box and then the control
box has a little break out part that you
and actually attached towards the front
of the desk where you can actually
control it and then that has a display
screen on it it has three memory
settings one two and three so you just
basically press the up and down arrows
to get the desk to go to the height that
you want and then you press memory and
then tap the button you want it to be
and that saves it there and then you can
just hit one two or three to have it go
up or down to the preset height that you
want if you're gonna set it up like I
did basically I have a height that's set
up for standing which is why I have it
set up to right now and then I also have
this height that's set up for sitting so
all you have to do is press that saved
preset and it will lower down to that
height if you - it's already up to the
height standing which is which is what
you do you don't have to do a hand crank
or anything like that now there was a
couple quirks here I will point out that
you're supposed to be able to do a reset
thing on mine by holding down the the M
button and that just doesn't seem to
function at all on my wife's it worked
so who knows but fortunately if I press
one it's able to go all the way to the
lowest setting then I was able to
program in height two and ninety three
so functionally it is working just fine
for me it's also pretty quiet I mean
it's not like silent or anything like
that but it's not like a loud noise or
anything you can probably hear that
going on below me it's not too bad at
all
now wants to sit stand at desk frame and
top are built in the top squid on the
next step is to set up the monitors and
you can't just set monitors directly on
the desk but we went with these monitor
arms attached to the back and that way
they can be readjusted to go forward or
back or driver and of course since
they're attached to the desk when the
desk goes up or down the monitors go up
and down along with it so so you can
just set up the height based on where
you're sitting and then whether it's in
the raised position or the lowered
position you can still look at your
monitors and and they raise the lower
with the desk which is pretty cool now
in case any you guys are looking at this
like a like a setup video or something
like that I do want to point out that
this is still a work in progress very
much so we're know by no means finished
with this room although it has come a
long way
I've set up this smaller desk over here
on the side and right now it's it's got
a bunch of stuff on it I have a set of
drawers that I have bought that I'm
going to put in this corner right there
that should help me declutter a lot
because if you guys saw the establishing
shot when my desk was still over on this
there's just piled with stuff and
honestly that's because I really don't
have any drawers or storage or anything
like that in here on a functional level
so we'll be adding that as well now you
might notice that we have a printer over
here which is just monochrome laser
printer and then you might also notice
the computers which are tucked down here
not on the floor out on the floor but
they are off the desks again just
because they're heavy and I don't want
to put too much weight on the desks if I
can avoid it just to keep things minimal
as far as what goes up there also it's
nicer to have a minimalist setup on the
desk so what's coming for the future
stage two of this computer room project
is going to be a custom-made unit for
this little corner down here because I
like the computers down here I don't
want to be able to tell too high I want
to lower this this is my main computer I
want to lower that one down just a
little bit I'd like to raise my wife's
computer up the top box right there as
well I like to raise that up a little
bit and then that that's mine ass right
now which currently isn't plugged in or
under and you're running or anything
like that it's it's literally just there
as a stand so I'm gonna be swapping that
out so I think I'm going to build a
custom unit for right here at the couple
different levels that the computers can
sit on there's a decent chance I'll also
take the printer and maybe see if I can
get that back in the corner over there
as well to kenny's up some of that space
make things a little bit more
presentable here so it's visible and
then also create that box so that the
lower part of it can be used
specifically for cable management and
storage because there are probably a lot
of you who are looking right now I'm
being like Paul cable management come on
come on because yeah I know
I'm very aware I'm very aware that needs
to be done and that is coming very soon
in the future actually about a bunch of
cable management stuff that I'm gonna
try out we did get a chance to go by
Ikea a quick word of warning don't go to
Ikea on a Sunday afternoon if you can
possibly avoid it it was a really
harrowing experience but I was able to
track down the Signum so I have some
signals that I can drop in there and
then I've also got a set of stuff that I
got from direct from Amazon I'm gonna
try that out as well but the reason I'm
showing you guys this sort of in-between
phase is one well we got a lot of work
done under here and that was useful but
- I just wanted to point out that cable
management is
not necessarily something that you can
just sort of attack and tackle all at
once especially in assists and death
situation because the cables coming for
the back of these monitors are limited
in size so if I want to run all the
cables properly which would include like
running them down the actual monitor arm
and there's a little plastic box right
there with a caddy that allows you to do
that there's a good chance I'm going to
need longer cables whether we're talking
power cables DisplayPort cables HDMI
cables and that kind of thing so that's
part of the reason I got everything set
up here first so I can get some
measurements see what cables need to be
replaced and then also of course build
that box down there so the computers can
be set up properly and then like I said
I want to build storage for cables and
cable management's that's under that box
I do also have a UPS back here so the
UPS should be held in the box as well
and that will tidy everything up and I
really want to get this I really want to
get this space looking good let me get
the cables super clean I want to have
them all hidden as much as possible and
also need to fix that wall outlet that
wall outlet is not working now the one
last thing to mention about the controls
on the desk is there's the M button that
you can use to set what preset height
you want it to go up to when you press
the presets 1 2 &amp;amp; 3 there's also a t
button and you can use that to do a
timing mode so basically tell it how
much time you want to be in one position
like if you're sitting and then it'll
warn you after a certain amount of time
to like a you should stand up and then
let you stand up because the basic idea
overall is that you should try to stand
as much as possible and sit as little as
possible so this allows you to still
work at a computer while doing either
one and easily switch between then the
guys that's gonna wrap it for this video
I hope you've enjoyed it
this was our weekend project and I think
it turned out pretty well although again
there's still more work to be done so
I'll be covering the cable management in
here those little hopefully a custom
build up a little a little box down
there it keeps computers off the ground
and do some cable management's retention
in there as well thank you guys so much
for watching this video if you enjoyed
it thumbs up button and we'll see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
