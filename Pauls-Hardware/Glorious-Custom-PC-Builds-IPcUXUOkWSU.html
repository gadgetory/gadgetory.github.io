Nevada is brought to you by Cooler
Master enter max ocz Toshiba and deep
cool hey guys I'm over at MSI now this
is not a suite this is not a booth it is
at ballroom the MSI ballroom here at the
Venetian and as you can see behind me
they have an array of really really
awesome boutique builds from their
system integrator partners I'm gonna end
this video with a little montage of all
that stuff but first they have a new
monitor that they're working on and they
also have on table computer and also
have a cool Z 370 motherboard that they
got a design and innovation to work for
so let's check it out all right let's
start off with the design and Innovation
Awards they did get one for the MSI
Lightning GTX 10 atti
which is a really nice graphics card and
I'm not gonna talk about it because
1080i is old me let's talk about this
right here though this is the Z 370
god-like gaming they have received a
design Innovation Award for this ATX
form factor for a Z 370 motherboard it's
kind of interesting but it's got a
killer extended killer networking switch
and Wireless extender which I'm told is
ten gigabit light I believe it's tiny
gigabit if it's not ten gigabit then I'm
wrong about that but more to the point
though this is LGA 1151 motherboards of
course supports Intel copy Lake
processors for ddr4 slots they get their
reinforced steel armor across the DIMM
slots as well as all the PCI Express
expansion we've got three counting three
one two three m dot 2 slots going
between the PCIe slots there as well and
they have an 18 phase power delivery
configuration going on up here at the
top not only that but they have some
heat sinks built in there that actually
look to be quite beefy and actually have
some slotting going on and that kind of
thing to enable air to flow through to
hopefully keep those VRMs nice and cool
when you're doing a terrific lucky you
got a four pin an eight pin supplemental
CPU power connector and flipping around
here on the top right you can see
there's a set of controls specifically
made for overclocking since this is a
guide like motherboard so it's gonna
have RGB lighting all of the good things
that you would expect mystic light
compatible of course and game loose
which is basically what they're
referring to
that's a teen phase power delivery
configuration s next up is this tiny
little computer it's called the Trident
3 Arctic also a receiver of a design and
Innovation Award tiny little computer
here but they have packed a lot of stuff
into it it's got an i7 8,700 processor
it's got an Intel three-hitter series
chipset motherboard which I presume is a
custom design by MSI GTX 1078 gig is
integrated in there 16 gigs of DDR for
memory and m2 2280 slot with the 256 gig
PCIe SSD in there as well as a one
terabyte hard drive as well as Intel
wireless AC 30 168 Wi-Fi 330 watt AC
adapter for power silent storm cooling
is what they're calling the cooling
system integrated here and I like the
front
io on this it's got a few USB 3.0 ports
as well as a type C port and then there
is an HDMI out right on the front for
some VR action it's also got a little
bit of RGB lighting in the top right
corner and then as you can probably tell
and All Whites design and that's why
it's called the Arctic version of the
triad 3 moving over here to this monitor
MSI has been busted into the monitor
market and they've been trying to
differentiate themselves with some
designs that are well a little bit
different and perhaps a little bit
unique this is the optics MP g27 CQ the
one we're looking at is a cute wqhd or
2560 by 1440 27 inch monitor 16 by 9
aspect ratio and it is a VA LED backlit
curved panel with 144 Hertz refresh
rates and a 1 millisecond response time
and those are of course all very good
stats for gaming so they've apparently
designed a pretty solid monitor when it
comes to the base specs but let's make
it a little different they have this set
of LEDs going across the bottom of the
monitor these light up in rainbow
fashion as you can possibly see right
now there's actually eight individual
LEDs in each of these five strips but
you can also use it along with the
SteelSeries software in order to
actively engage those LED strips while
you're playing a game such as csgo so
for instance you can set up some a
couple of those bars to indicate your
health and a couple of the bars to
indicate your hands your ammo and maybe
the middle bar is going to indicate
to get headshots and I'll count up when
you get headshots then you can play the
game and right there below the screen in
a area that's still fairly accessible to
your eyeballs you can see what's going
on with some of your stats in the game
so that's somewhat useful I think
another cool feature is that it's
actually got a USB connection to your
computer in order to control those LEDs
but there's also an on-screen display
utility that you can access from within
windows and you can use that to do stuff
with the monitor that you would normally
have to use the monitor controls in
order to do such as brightness and that
kind of thing you can also use this to
set up profiles associate them with
games and that makes it a lot of use
here to get your monitor set up and
configured when you want to play it
specific game with a specific
configuration MSI has also put some
bling on the back of this monitor and
depending on where your monitor is this
may or may not be useful to you but it's
got a pretty cool effect you can also
control this with the software for the
LEDs on it
and that's pretty cool and then for
controls for the monitor they've
actually integrated a little thumb knob
or a little a little four-way a jog dial
thing right there and so you can reach
around behind the back to use that to
control it I am on the fence about that
implementation but it is there and
that's how you would access stuff okay
but if you don't like that or it's not
your thing then you can go ahead and use
the controls from within Windows and
just connect up that USB connection for
that Oh finally here we have Edsel Edsel
is he's very great cinematographer and I
like this thing he has going to keep his
glasses on it's very it's very practical
very functional you know you could
probably you could keep money in that
just to put the money into the strap
also holding his hat on and also greatly
improves the cinematography skills as
you can probably see that
oh my gosh Oh oh yeah that's what we're
doing were talking about products here
see we're trying to film this Mont this
laptop and lady just came up and picked
it up and causes problems anyway this is
a GE 63 raid or RGB edition very similar
design to the G 63 as they've had in the
past it's got some new features though
some macro options that you can set up
with the keys to actually integrate with
the games you're playing and that kind
of thing I don't go into too much of
detail as far as how that works but then
we'll at least show you the design
because it's pretty cool looking and
they've added these RGB strips along the
back and what they said they wanted
people to do with this is like if you're
gonna be gaming and streaming from your
laptop then point your camera at
yourself while you're gaming on the
laptop and then your people watching the
stream can see these LED lights on the
back of the laptop I again I'm not sure
if that's gonna be a real a practical
thing or not it seems a little odd to me
but effectively you can do use the same
function for the monitor I just showed
you and set it up with these LEDs and
basically do the same thing and it's
also still controllable by that
SteelSeries software so you know either
it's gonna make your laptop look pretty
or maybe your Lanier's when you're
streaming people can watch and have fun
and there it is guys my quick tour of
the msi ballroom area here at the
Venetian and as promised I've made my
way back over to here where they have
all the system integrator systems and
starting down there with origin let's
take a look at these epic builds with
origin side ax cyber power high power
but I didn't get footage of that one so
who cares about that there's a main gear
system but I did a video on main gears
build so check out the main gear video
gonna see more of those we also have a
computer upgrade King CLX
digital storm and exotic PC so guys
enjoy this montage hit the thumbs up
button if you do and of course stay
tuned for more coverage from CES 2018
here in Las Vegas Nevada coming very
soon hit the subscribe button
there's that again I add now he went
away he's very shy
it's very shy anyway a big final thank
you to my sponsors of course enter max
OCC to shave a deep pool and
coolermaster and we'll see you guys in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
