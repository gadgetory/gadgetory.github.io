link in the video's description what's
up guys welcome back to Pauls hardware
this is my monthly builds video for
November 2018 every month I part out a
couple pcs so what we're looking at
today are parts lists I'm not actually
building anything so if you guys want to
see a computer put together feel free to
check out my builds list because I have
lots of actual PC builds there today is
more about choosing the parts before you
build a PC so if you're building for the
first time or if you're just not quite
sure what you should put together
I do get feedback every month so last
month I asked people what PC builds they
wanted to see this month in November so
we have a Black Friday deals PC it's a
little too early for Black Friday
although there are some deals coming up
but I did do a $750 build for you and
then I tried to do $1,000 bill but it
came up more than that what I'm actually
gonna be building in my follow up video
to this is gonna be something akin to
the $1,000 build and then I have a
$1,400 version that's a little bit more
high-end
I did note that there was next to zero
interest in the really high core counts
unlock Zeon's or skylake X's so we are
gonna skip those and we're sticking with
mainstream AMD builds in the meantime I
will be doing this again next month in
December so feel free to click the
strawpoll link in the description and
vote on that so you can give me your
feedbacks so let's jump right into the
first build these seven hundred and
fifty dollar build or as close to that
as I could get it honestly this was
seven hundred and fifty dollars
yesterday now it has crept up and priced
a little bit to seven hundred and sixty
two dollars but what we have here is a
balanced PC and a PC that honestly I
could say if someone came to me and said
I have 750 bucks to spend I want a
gaming PC this is probably what I would
tell them to get it's based around a six
core AMD Rison two processors so the
2000 series there's a little bit faster
they're based on the 12 nanometer
manufacturing process instead of 14 so
it's a nice little step up it's only
hundred and sixty bucks - and you get
six cores and twelve threads Intel has
nothing near the CIM the performance of
the CPU at
price range I've paired it with an air
cooler here the hyper 212 black which is
only $35 although you could easily save
that 35 bucks and get away with the air
cooler that's included with this
processor the motherboard I've chosen is
a B 450 tomahawk and I've already got
this right here because I will be
building this system I chose this
largely based on Steve from hardware
unboxed recommendation because he tested
a bunch of B 450 motherboards and look
at their power delivery as well as
features power delivery can be limited
on B 450 motherboards especially the
less expensive ones but the tomahawk
actually has a pretty good configuration
for that beyond that we have a 16 gig
memory kit not an 8 gig kit so I was
happy that I was able to include that
it's still hundred and thirty-five bucks
but this kit should work just fine with
Rison 240 gig SSD so you will want to
add some more storage to this in the
future or hopefully soon maybe if you
have an old hard drive lying around and
rx 578 get graphics card a forty seven
dollar cooler master master box case 550
watt power supply from Corsair this is a
basic one but it's got all black cabling
and then a couple Corsair ml fans these
are Maglev fans so they're nice fans add
these to the case which only ships with
one case fan and you will have a much
better cooling situation so here's the
CPU available from a wide variety of
retailers so this isn't just like some
quick like sale price it's always 160
you probably be able to get the 2600 I'm
guessing if sales this year anything
like last year for even less than this
so keep an eye on the 2600 it's already
a good price at 160 bucks but I imagine
you might even be able to find it
cheaper this is the hyper 212 black from
cooler master and I printed 12 is very
popular cooler I am glad they decided to
make it in all black because often when
we see the hyper 212 if we complain that
like wow it's a good cooler but it
doesn't look that great
this one's just all black and clean and
it isn't even that much more expensive
35 bucks
again you can go without this if you
want to save a few dollars but this will
run cooler and quieter than the stock
heatsink fan motherboard is the MSI B
450 tomahawk are you mentioned why I
chose this but it's only about 100 bucks
I don't have good pictures right here
but oh there's been one I already
explained why I chose this one but
here's a quick closer look at the
picture of it at least it has all the
basic features for a system that you'd
want to put together it's missing some
of the higher-end motherboard features
and the one main thing
it's gonna be missing for the system I
put together a USB 3.1 gen2 front panel
port but that's because I'm going with a
weird configuration with the case I
chose but more on that in just a minute
memory kit is again the g.skill ripjaws
5 is just a standard all-black kits
which does work with Rison so you should
be able to plug in X and P values and
run this at ddr4 3200 speed SSD is a 240
gig Toshiba although you can spend just
about 20 bucks more to get yourself a
500 gig SSD again more on that in just a
minute but if you are on a budget 40
bucks for a 240 gig of main operating
system Drive will get you up and running
but again I recommend keeping an eye out
for additional storage because you'll
fill that 240 gigs pretty fast if you
have an old hard drive from an old
computer that you can repurpose or just
spend another 40 or 50 bucks on another
1 or 2 terabyte spinning mechanical hard
drive 4 graphics card the RX 578 gig
version only $170 this is quite a bit
cheaper than the rx 580 although if you
can afford an RX 580 it is a decent
little step up in performance from this
but how much these prices have come down
compared to what they were just a few
months ago but the good news is that
that's available and in stock and not
too expensive
finally a case we got the master box
this is a solid all-around case it's got
a good airflow it's got a nice layout
it's got a shredded power supply area at
the bottom it's only 4650 from new angle
with a $10 promotional gift card that's
a good deal
power supply actually had a different
power supply chosen but I again was
trying to keep this under budget bear in
mind if you're gonna spend $50 on an 80
plus bronze 550 watt power supply you
can spend 10 or 15 dollars more for an
80 plus gold power supply and even 650
watt versions so keep a close eye on the
power supply ranges
I feel like this power supply you should
be able to get for about 40 bucks and
when it comes to efficiency ratings
power supplies you will pay more in the
long term with a bronze rated power
supply than a gold rated power supply
just because it's going to waste more
energy via waste heat and that for that
reason a gold rated power supply might
be something that you're interested in
finally I did add fans because the case
only comes with a single fan you
definitely wanted to add some more in
the ML series is a very nice one these
have no lights or anything like that and
you get two of them for $27 you can't
get cheaper fans in this two but these
are just ones that I'd recommend so
there you have it a about 750 dollar
actually more
like 765 right now if you include the
mail and rebates and a very good system
a very powerful gaming system but you
can go up from there so what I have is a
system that's like the high end version
of the $750 system and actually cranked
up the price pretty quickly so this is
about a one thousand four hundred and
fifty dollar system with a bunch of
upgrades and of course you could swap in
some of these upgrades or none of them
or all of them depending on how much
money you wanted to save I do want to
point out that a big reason why the
price is pretty high is because the case
I'm building with is the cooler master
SL 600 M and that's the $200 case I am
building in this case because I have it
here and I wanted to try it out and give
you guys an idea of what the case is
like but you can save probably about a
hundred bucks and get away with a much
less expensive case you could also save
money by not going with an all-in-one
liquid cooler but based on the gamers
nexus reviews of the master case SL 600
mm yesterday which has very good cooling
for the graphics card because it draws
air in from the bottom CPU cooling was
not so good and they used an air cooler
a standard air cooler for that but if
you had a liquid cooler at the top it
would go along with the airflow and I'm
imagining it would work a little bit
better so for that reason I paired this
up that is why the price is a little bit
more but of course you can mix and match
to swap things in and out between these
two system builds and you'd still end up
with a powerful system just depending on
whether you wanted the eight core
processor with the 2700 versus the six
core version from before I upgraded the
motherboard specifically to have better
power delivery for overclocking but also
to be compatible with the front panel
USB 3.1 gen2 type-c port that is on the
case I feel bad having a case that has
that without actually pairing it up with
the motherboard that has the same I did
upgrade the SSD but it was only about 15
bucks more again 17 dollars more for a
480 gig version and then we have a Vega
56 which I also have right here and I
already bought anticipating doing a
comparison between this build which is
much less expensive and the super
high-end 3000 ish dollar build that I
did last month and a Vega 56 for $400 is
actually somewhat reasonably priced of
course after I bought this like I
literally just bought it with my own
funds for $400 and two days later like a
day and a half ago the price is
increased by $75
so for that reason I used a parametric
filter on this parts list to pair you up
with a Vega 56 but it's not the same one
I'm using for $405 right now you can
still get the asrock blower version of
the Vega 56 which probably wouldn't do
quite as well as this one but it's in
keeping with the price and it's hard to
deal with price fluctuations sometimes
also worth noting that you do get a
3-game bundle right now the games are
Assassin's Creed Odyssey Strange Brigade
and star control origins so if you're
interested in those games and that's
maybe an additional value to but if
you're not then that doesn't matter but
you'd have some free games to hand off
to friends or something like that back
to the rest of the parts though we have
a rise in 720 700 which you can get for
about 40 or 50 bucks less than the 2,700
X overclocked this and it's basically
the same as the 2700 X which you should
be able to do with an aftermarket cooler
264 also worth noting again that this is
a hundred bucks more than the six core
version so if you don't need the two
extra cores just use the six core
version if all you're worried about is
gaming or maybe some gaming and
streaming this is a six core version
will still do you just fine again I'm
using a 240 millimeter all-in-one liquid
cooler for this it's a hundred and
twenty dollars it's a solid on one
liquid cooler with addressable RG B's
but it does cost a bit more than an air
cooler so if you wanted to save money
then consider that as rock x4 70 Taichi
I again mainly chose because of this
little port right here the USB 3.1 gen2
but it's also got good power delivery so
if you wanted an upgrade over the B 450
motherboard that I chose then this would
be a suitable one for this rig use the
same memory kit so nothing to mention
there I did want to quickly talk about
storage I'm looking at SSDs with this
breakdown between the 250 gig and the
500 gig range if you sort them by price
per gigabyte you'll find the best deals
right now are on 500 gig Class SSDs
first 240 gig one that comes in here for
thirty-six dollars and 44 cents is this
adlink one but just again something to
point out that you should reality check
these prices because you might find a
better deal on an SSD that has higher
capacity and a 500 gig SSD is a really
nice thing to start out with there's the
graphics card again we already mentioned
that's there's a graphics card I'm
actually using I wish the price didn't
jump up so much that's
but you got to deal with it here's the
case SL 600 M which I didn't realize was
a $200 case I have not built with this
case yet but initial reviews that I've
seen that came out yesterday were pretty
positive again 200 bucks so you got to
take that into consideration you could
get by with a much less expensive case
but I'm gonna build in this case and try
it out so all that you guys know what I
think and finally a power supply this is
a 650 watt 80 plus gold certified rather
than the 550 watt 80 plus bronze rated
power supply used in the first build but
again look at the price here we're only
talking $66 versus the $50 price of the
first one so if you want a little bit
more power and you want a little bit
more efficiency definitely worth the 15
bucks or so that you can upgrade to this
one and again easily swap this in to
that first build if you wanted to
finally though my entire intent here was
to try to do an A to B comparison last
month I built the fastest PC you can
build with a ninety nine hundred K which
costs over five hundred dollars and an
RT X 20 80 TI which costs 1200 bucks if
you can even find them in stock right
now what I wanted to build was a bang
for the buck PC on the AMD platform with
Rison and with a Vega 56 assuming the
prices stayed reasonable and then show a
comparison between the two pcs in their
performance because I think the amount
of extra performance you get spending
$3,000 or so on that super high-end PC
versus what you get spending say 750 or
even $1400 on the pcs I'm looking at
today it's not going to be all that much
especially depending on the monitor that
you pair it with and that is the final
part for today's video is pairing this
stuff up with the monitor the monitors I
like right now are 2560 by 1440 high
refresh rate monitors that also have
variable refresh rate technology that
means free sync on AMD side or g-sync on
the Nvidia side the reason I like this
resolution and those technologies is
because you don't need to spend an
exorbitant amount of money on a graphics
card in order to push say a 4k
resolution 1440 is also step up from
console resolution which for the most
part is 1080 yes there are games that
play at 4k but they're capped at 30
Hertz so going for the high resolution
high refresh rate and then the variable
refresh rate all ties into those things
that make PC gaming special and
something that you can be like yes
that's that's why I spent this extra
money on that is for these features but
do you need to spend the amount of money
that I spent on the system last month or
can you get by with something like this
to that end here a couple monitors
because I'm going to take the entire
cost into consideration not just the
price of the computer itself but the
monitor price too and when you're
talking freesync you can get some much
better deals than you can with g-sync
unfortunately for 2560 by 1440 I didn't
find as many good deals as I was hoping
for but this is actually a 31 point five
inch ALC monitor for two hundred and
eighty dollars it's a free sync monitor
but it's also IPs and it's got one point
zero seven million colors so it's at
least got 10-bit color representations
so if you want an inexpensive monitor
that's larger that's 2560 by 1440 and
freesync up to 75 Hertz this is a solid
choice for you this would be a little
bit better as a dual purpose monitor for
gaming and also content creation or
something like that if you wanted
strictly a gaming monitor then I will
point you towards this Acer which I
found the best prices on as well as
having this feature set
it's a 27-inch 2560 by 1440 this one
goes up 244 hurts so much higher refresh
rate
combine that with freesync and you're
gonna have a very nice smooth gaming
experience and this is available for
three hundred and fifty-six dollars
three hundred fifty-five dollars the
cheapest g-sync 2560 by 1440 27-inch
monitors you can find are all around
$500 in up so that's a decent savings
when you compare the freesync monitors
to the g-sync monitor and also be
comparing gameplay between the two once
I get this system all built and put
together but that is coming in a future
