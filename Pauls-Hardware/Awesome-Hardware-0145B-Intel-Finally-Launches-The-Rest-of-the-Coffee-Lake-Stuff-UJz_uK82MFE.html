to sad to meet early the show Callum ah
so you have two cats that are male and
female I do that have two very different
personalities they do one super hyper
and the other one was super chill dogs
well not super hyper but yeah it's
depends today's it's very situational
some nuances there yes okay I'm sure
they get along
hello everyone and according to the text
on the streaming software over here it
seems like we are live so hi everyone
welcome to awesome hardware heyyyyy this
is a live show about technology we talk
about computers mostly and we stream
every Tuesday evening at 5:30 p.m.
Pacific time we stream the whole show to
twitch.tv slash awesome hardware or with
stream two halves the first half we
already did episode 1 45 - a has been on
Kyle's channel bit wit a link to that is
in the video's description we are now
kicking off 1:45 second half we sure are
baby which means a few things first
we've already been drinking a few beers
so cheers to any of you guys for joining
us please drink responsibly
and we will try our best not to slur our
speech which is always one of the
difficult things about making this show
beyond that occasionally we do use adult
language so if you have any young ones
or people who are offended by that type
of thing lock them in the cupboard or
whatever you do with them kill them all
and then also we we do have some stores
if you guys enjoy the content that we
produce and you wanna help support us
Paul sorry Burnett is my store where I
have a brave shirts mugs pint glasses
hoodies all sorts of good stuff it's all
real high quality so buy some stuff
helps support us and we will shout
Johnson to your face at the end of this
half of the show Cowell store is also
available bit with tech slash store
here's a new design and the ripped game
pad is very violence and offensive lots
of people you should definitely
represent it and wear it on your chest
buy it anyway yes we're only 21 in the
chest it's worth it but yeah if you buy
stuff we will shout your name up at the
end of the show which is a just a crazy
incentive to do that and spend money
anyway we're gonna talk on the first
half of this show mainly about some
intel news that dropped today it's
actually pretty expensive
and we'll try to gauge your opinion on
how excited or or not excited you are
about it and then the second half of the
show we're gonna play some video games
hi class indeed I'm looking forward to
that line actually but um
let's kick things off with a burp yeah
as is tradition and the news segments
and the the bulk of this news I'm going
to be driving from the inand tech
article about this Intel's expansion of
their 8th gen core lineup and this is
again pretty expansive covers new
launches coming to the mobile space some
mobile processors as well as socketed
desktop processors on the mainstream
side so we're talking LGA 1151
processors that are compatible with
the same motherboards that have been
launched for coffee leaf okay hold on
but there are new motherboards coming up
new chipsets because more budget copy
copy like actually launched five months
ago October wasn't coffee like launched
but it didn't fully launch there there
there were there were things missing
from it right around it so again the
intact article that's linked in the
description as long as as well as all
the articles we're going to talk about
today it has a lot more on this so if
you guys are really interested I
encourage you to read that this articles
by dr. Ian cut hrus and he points out at
the beginning that there's lots of
different aspects to Intel's processor
strategy so not just products but sort
of how they are trained to set
themselves up in the marketplace we have
the core I nine 8950 HK which is a six
core tagged as a core i9 processor
although I feel like the core i9 tagging
of that is sort of weird it's it's a
mobile processor though weird that's six
core and twelve thread pretty I mean a
really high-end mobile processor but I
still feel like I nine was just recently
introduced for their for their
enthusiast lineup and some branding
suddenly tagging a six core processor
that's based on the same technology but
there's also other mobile stuff six new
Intel H series 45 mobile CPUs forunate
until you series 28 watt mobile CPUs and
I am NOT going to be going over this
today but as I was sort of doing
research and everything there's a bunch
of new product drops for laptops today
so it seems like there are a bunch of
laptop manufacturers who have been kind
of holding up and waiting for Intel to
get to
here's all the stuff and now we can sell
it and people can buy it so there's a
bunch of new laptops I don't have any
more details on them than that
but if you're if you were in the market
for a laptop it's definitely gonna be
worth your while to do some
investigation as to the new products
based on Intel's new stuff that's been
announced today but when it comes to
this list specifically we're gonna
mainly talk about a little bit more on
the 8950 HK and then we're going to talk
about the new desktop coffee like CPUs
because they've fleshed out the rest of
the lineup because there's really only
been about five coffee like SKUs
available since it launched back in
October and then there's four new
desktop chipsets that will be available
in new motherboards which of course will
be compatible with all these new coffee
like CPUs as well as the existing like
8700 K and 86 under K but starting off
the court I 989 50 HK if you're a laptop
user and if you're into powerful mobile
technology this thing is actually pretty
beastly it's a 6 core processor with 12
threads 2.9 gigahertz base clock and 4.6
gigahertz nominal maximum turbo we say
nominal maximum turbo because it can
actually turbo beyond that depending on
the configuration that it's in more on
that in just a second note the graphics
that are integrated is the Intel UHD 630
the comparison we're looking at here on
the anent tech chart is the new process
of 8950 HK compared to the the last
year's high-end highest end processor
which was the i7 7820 HK which is based
on cable ik h i launched back in january
2017
both of these are 45 watt TDP CPUs but
you can see there's a big boost in core
in thread count 6 core 12 versus the
four core eight thread of before also we
have a significantly higher turbo
frequency at 4.6 gigahertz and then we
have this TVB thermal velocity boost
which is like intel's like you know that
turbo stuff
we want to like do another one of those
and put it on top of the turbo what
that's what that is
what's the difference between TVB and
TVB all right you're making me jump
ahead in my notes here Kyle but I will I
will humor you TVB is another phase on
top of turbo boost if the CPU stays
underneath a certain temperature which
for this specific CPU is 53 degrees
Celsius then it can clock up to 200
megahertz faster ok that's pretty much
it so from the 4.6 from the 4.6
gigahertz boost it can go to 4.8 give
your hertz boost but under that
threshold if it's under the threshold
gotta bear in mind this is this is a
mobile processor so we're talking about
laptops the laptops these are probably
going to be integrated in our our
desktop replacement laptops that are
usually significantly larger that can
have substantial cooling systems that
are integrated with multiple heat pipes
and fans and that kind of thing so you
know there's a trade offs there's a
balance between the lightness and
portability versus the amount of power
that's in there but this is a mobile
processor so the 45 watt TDP is pretty
impressive now it should be pointed out
that the 45 watt TDP is based on the
base frequency right of 2.9 gigahertz so
at 4.6 it's probably different so 4.6 it
definitely increases beyond that can go
but but but Intel isn't giving as much
information about this and this is
actually something that in kind of
laments in the article is Intel decided
I feel like sometime in the past year or
two like hey we're not going to tell you
all the different steps of turbo that it
get it goes to right I mean everything
and we're gonna leave that out they said
that because it's proprietary or
something like that which is
kind of weird because any third-party
manufacturer who integrates this into a
laptop because it's a case Q CPU can
overclock it and set it to whatever ever
frequency they want and also Intel
withholding this information any actual
person who gets the processor physically
can just test it and tell you what the
different turbo states are and
everything so
right anyway III happen to agree with
the in and his assessment of Intel's
decision to withhold that information
but yeah for the record if you guys do
want to check this article out and
scroll down to the bottom
oh right further down no no it's not on
this page but it's further down they do
actually have a chart of the different
turbo turbo frequency steppings and that
kind of thing but beyond that bla bla
bla bla bla
oh I actually just already said that
turbo velocity boost Intel is not
specifically stated that this is a
coffee Lake derive CPU but they have
said it's based on the latest generation
40 nanometer process technology which
basically means it's 14 nanometer plus
plus which is what coffee Lake is based
on so let's we can safely assume it's a
cathodic processor even though Intel
hasn't said that explicitly also worth
mentioning for any of you guys who are
on the workstation markets or just
looking for other options oh did I
mention it's five hundred and eighty
three dollars for them it's the laptop
for that's the tray price for the
processor so that's the oh wow if you
buy a thousand of them at a time it's
five hundred eighty-three bucks it
probably means it's going to be about
six hundred dollars effective price for
consumers although when it comes to
mobile processors it's hard to say
exactly how much it costs because
usually it's integrated into the price
of an entire laptop right but the trade
price is still a decent step up from the
7820 HK from before which was three
hundred and seventy eight dollars so
yeah you do also get some enhanced DRAM
support though ddr4 2666 as opposed to
the ddr4 2400 and you get obtain support
to slightly slightly faster integrated
- yeah UHD rather than HD which I can't
tell what that means besides a hundred
megahertz faster you know that gives it
an ultra how do mega Hertz faster its
ultra announced that's wrong
all right what else can we talk about
here
beyond that oh did I mention this yeah I
was I was just mentioning the Xeon we
have stats in the Xeon somewhere zeon
mobile processor there's a Xeon
equivalent of this process processor Wow
that some people might be interested in
it's called the Xeon eat when t1 86m
it's a little bit more expensive Trey
price 623 dollars what whereas it is not
overclockable as in the case q88 950 HK
is it gives you ECC memory support as
well as support for Intel vPro and V Pro
is an important feature for people who
want to use this in it and in office
environments it's it's a it's a set of
features that allows remote access to
the computer and hardware security and
all that kind of thing
but other than that it's effectively the
same it's got the same turbo frequency
it's got the same base frequency it's
got the same l3 cache so yeah for you
guys who are looking for a workstation
like super high-end workstation setup
maybe check out some of the new laptops
that will undoubtedly be coming out
based on the Intel Xeon eat when t1 86m
all right beyond that though jumping
back to the original list here there's
of course the six new until eight series
processors for Intel u series processors
a crap ton of laptops coming out based
on those in different configurations and
all that kind of stuff not that not
delving into that for right now
we're gonna jump down to the desktop
stuff because I have a feeling that is
what you guys are a little bit more
interested in so the coffee like desktop
processors that have now been added to
the stack if you guys are reading this
Anandtech article all the ones that are
new are labeled with an asterisk here
so prior to now we've only had five
processors in this line up to the 8700 k
8780 600 k and there's 8400 for example
so on the i7 level we're adding the 8700
T which is a 35 watt TDP processor with
a 2.4 gigahertz base frequency and a 4.0
gigahertz boost frequency again this 35
watt TDP is based on the base frequency
so depending on the laptop there's that
it's integrated into and the cooling on
that laptop and and and so forth you may
or may not be able to hit that boost
frequency consistently over time for
example these do still these do have V
Pro enabled and they've got 2666 ddr4
DRAM support and yeah just just
basically giving you the wider range of
processors that you may have expected
before with an Intel lineup that wasn't
prior to now available on coffee leaks
so on the i-5 side there's a lot more
8600 the 8600 t2 8,500 8,500 T and 8400
T these are all six cores six thread
processors whereas the i7 or six core
with hyper threading so that 12 threads
then again we have 95 65 and 35 watt
variants these all have a little bit
less l3 cache per core and the new ones
have V Pro support whereas the old ones
do not so maybe something to keep in
mind if you're building systems for an
enterprise environment or that kind of
thing the I threes have a few more as
well
8380 380 100 T 117 excuse me 117 dollars
for a 8100 T is the lowest price here
for the new processors and that's a 4
core for thread CPU again 35 watt TDP
with the 3.1 gigahertz base frequency
alright well there's a Pentiums down
here and seller ons and the dogs
freaking out right now well that I hold
on
listen to me now they're not gonna
listen hey sorry the dogs are barking
here's a chart showing the actual turbo
turbo frequencies per core so if you
guys are interested in a specific
processor then you can do that it's also
got the core I'm sorry the cost listed
next to it as well so again links to the
Articles we're talking about today are
linked in the description down below my
goodness sorry the dogs you guys are
allowed to second level Wow to go along
with these new processors chipsets
okay okay she just comes around a well
my wife my wife is home okay it's just
wife with the assist to pair up with
these new processors we now also have
new Intel chipsets which new
motherboards will be based on that you
can now buy for less money than you
would have previously spent on a z3 70
motherboard sure cuz again since October
the last five months
z3 70 was the only LGA 1150 1151
motherboard that he could buy that was
compatible with coffee like right now we
have four new chipsets that are
compatible with Intel APIs generation
processors the H 370 the Q 370 the be
360 and the H 310 and a kind of unique
thing about these new processors is that
they actually is kind of an upgrade so
there is something that's better about
all four of these that is not as good
about the Z 370 and that's specifically
the integration of 802 dot 11 AC Wi-Fi
Janene chipset stuff I think you said
processors you meant chipsets right I
said sorry yes chipsets ok chipsets yes
so all four of these new Jets AC Wi-Fi
have the ability the possible ability
for the motherboard manufacturer and so
you want to implement it to connect up
802 11 AC Wi-Fi now that's nice
the article goes into more detail when
you're talking about these budget chips
at motherboards especially like
something like an h3 10 you're looking
at motherboards that are usually in
there like 4 to $60 range right adding
Wi-Fi to something like that either to
the left 11 AC which has a theoretical
throughput of like 17 hundred megabits
per second mm-hmm which is faster
possibly than wired gigabit yeah it was
pretty fast
but to add that to a budget chipset
motherboard costs about 15 extra dollars
because you have to add like an antenna
and the extra hardware that goes along
with it yeah so basically the super
budget motherboards like h3 10 you're
probably going to need to look
specifically for one of those that has
the eight or 2011 AC integrated if
that's specifically something that
you're looking after right you'll
probably see it integrated more into the
b3 60s and the h3 70s and so on but just
something to keep an eye on just because
the motherboard chipset provides the
ability to have that connectivity
whether it comes to 802 that 11 AC Wi-Fi
or USB 3.1 gen2 which is also a new
native thing that's been added to these
motherboards hmm it doesn't necessarily
mean that the motherboard manufacturer
is actually providing those plugs in the
connectivity for that so right here's
another possible thing that you could
say this is an upgrade that's not to say
that there haven't been z3 70
motherboards that have had USB 3.1 gen2
but it's been by virtue of an add-on
chip so having it natively I can't say
this for sure because I haven't tested
but usually it means it's it's a bit
better you it's a bit faster native
connects connectivity but you can't have
four USB 3.1 gen2 ports on the HD 76 on
the cue 374 on the B 360 none on the HD
10 however so yeah all that to be said
then you're just gonna be a bunch of new
motherboards based on this and
they're gonna be cheaper than see 370
motherboards cool cool last thing to
point out all of these chipsets have the
again possible functionality if the
motherboard manufacturer decides to
implement it of what they're calling
ambient computing enabled heart at a
hardware level through the chipset which
allows for wake on voice commands in the
low-power mode so it gives your computer
the possible capability to act like a
smartphone or other listening device
like a smartphone with Google assistant
or Siri or like a smart speaker or you
can say okay Google and tell it to do
something you're in a computer could now
potentially have that capability at
least the hardware functionality is
built in into the chipset for that so
kind of fun yeah depending on whether or
not you like talking to your computer
and telling it to do things more stuff
on Intel like I said there's like
honestly the amount of stuff that Intel
dropped today was pretty ridiculous
yeah so let's switch over to what's
being called I three plus I 5 plus an i7
plus just to explain to you guys what
this is if you happen to encounter it
octane memory we've talked about a
little bit I've covered a bit I'm on my
channel but it's really really fast it's
not NAND flash memory it's a new
technology that Intel has developed but
it's functionally equivalent to man dab
it is way faster and it's very
responsive and everything but the
products that intel has launched based
on it thus far have been somewhat
underwhelming if you're a home user
mainly because what they launched at
first were 16 gigabyte and 32 gigabyte
Intel opt in memory modules that you
could use as basically like a cache
driver and accelerants for an existing
access to your hard drive which was
vaguely useful but not that awesome
especially if you were already running
off of a full SSD he didn't get a lot of
benefit from
so intel has launched new products based
on update in the interim since that
first came out and now they have
actually expanded the octane line-up and
they've also the there's it's like a new
generation basically a newer more
power-efficient to update memory caching
parts are coming out sixteen gig 32 gig
and now adding a 64 gig variant 64 gig
was not previously available so like i
have compared this to like system memory
a lot so when you talk about a 16 gig or
a 32 gig comparison it's it's really
talking about a like an amount of obtain
memory that's equivalent so you what the
same amount of a system memory that you
might have and system memory is still
faster than up team mm-hmm so bumping
that up to 64 gigs is a nice bump I'd
still like to see something beyond that
but the other cool thing that they have
done is they've enabled it to cache a
secondary data drive now so not just the
main operating system drive like before
so whereas you may have had zero
interest in the OP tain drives that have
been available because you bought a 256
gig samsung 960 Evo or our 960 pro right
for you half a year or a year ago and
you're like I don't care about this
because what I have is just not good or
faster and I'm gonna see no benefit from
this right if you have an opt-in ready
platform like the new until motherboards
that are coming out and you already got
that super fast
nice 256 gig 500 gig nvme SSD that you
know your operating system and programs
are going to go on but you've also got a
for Turner by 8 or 8 to buy mechanical
hard drives that you're always
irritated with because it's always so
slow I'm your Indian nvme drive caching
that with an Intel opt in SSD a 32 gig
or even more ideally a 64 gig and would
be an effective upgrade benefit to you
when you're using that drive so it makes
sense there you go
Intel update getting a little bit more
useful and a little bit more effective
one last thing to point out this is a PC
perspective article they were asking
about caching across multiple drives
with a single opt-in drive that's not
possible right now so you still have to
pair your opt-in drive with a single
drive whether it's a slower SSD or
mechanical drive that still works right
now interesting okay no word or
indication if that might be something
they're able to add in the future that
would mean it would be cool if they
could peer blaster or something yeah
there you go
all right moving on next article is from
text bot necessary this is Steve so
we've got new chipset motherboards
coming out and you got you might be
interested what all right so effectively
what's the difference I've been looking
at a Z 370 by the board I've been
considering a purchase for a while I've
been interested in coffee lake in a6
core processor or I've been cross
comparing that with what's available on
Rison sure and I'm not quite sure all
right now we've got these new
motherboards based on these budget
chipsets what's the actual difference
besides the lower price mm-hmm what am I
giving up if I if I go with B 360 this
article is a very good way to
investigate that and learn a little bit
more because it's specifically comparing
a B 360 chipset motherboard to a Z 370
chipset motherboard okay so first off no
CPU or memory overclocking so even if
you have a case Q's processor like an 80
600 K or 8700 K you will not be able to
overclock it if you don't get a z 370
motherboard be 360 or anything below
the overclocking that's pretty that's
been the way until I'm doing it for
quite some time right also you do not
get any raid support so the the SATA
ports you can connect up to you cannot
configure multiple drives into a raid
zero one or five configuration so that
is something that it can do on Z 370 is
that how it's been also with previous
generations of until platforms options
that's rate
I don't yeah I mean I I don't want to I
want to say yes completely but I know by
and large that's something that you that
that's a that's a feature that drops off
when you step down I think there maybe
have been some because like q3 skew
which the q1 have already forgotten it q
q 370 q 370 is like the highest end
business oriented chipset so no
overclocking but it has some more
support for like v pro and you know more
more enterprise type connectivity right
and functions but I I do not I do not I
do not know cuz I feel like that's
something that you could easily do like
you you could set up a raid array or
something like that and not have an
overclocked CPU like I feel like those
two things are independent of each other
and you might not care about
overclocking but you still might want a
trade set up so I feel like that's
that's like that's a big reason to
upgrade to like Z 370 you only mean like
if you wanted to take advantage of that
sort of Drive system I know why people
hear the buzzing euros these are all in
the same circuit
oh listen are you okay to turn off the
fan I'm okay they should get more beer -
for you at least but that's not the
on/off switch yeah just the left an old
school it's old school old school five
years old maybe I'm okay actually for
now
yeah I've realized I did say beer but I
realized you were out but I actually
still have a decent amount I mean it's
not anymore dude here no it's done okay
probably good anyway moving right along
though alright B 360 versus Z through 70
so apart from not having access to read
you also gotta have fewer PCI Express
Lanes directly to the chipset there's a
church down here so for example you have
the Flex io4 the chipset that the
motherboard manufacturer can assign how
they want to you have up to 24 available
on Z through 70 you only have 12
available on be 360 you'll also notice
for example well USB 3.1 gen2 you
actually get an improvement because you
have up to 4 available natively but you
have less USB 3.1 jet and one Matt Rita
excuse me a little bit less USB 2.0
this one's an important one here until
rst pcie 3.0 MDOT - storage you can have
up to three
MDOT to connected devices for like nvme
superfast SSDs with z 370 that cuts down
to 1 you know with be 360 so that's a
pretty decent fall that granted with a
budget set up you probably won't need
more than one super fast SSD I feel like
a little higher-end set up I've maybe
more maybe this makes sense for you but
um I don't know for me for me when I
compare the fall-off in features that
Intel sets up when you drop from the Z
series then below I mean the
overclocking is huge but comparing it to
what AMD gives you like I feel like you
get more bang for your buck with the am
D budget boards sure then you do with it
what's Intel absolutely um but again
there's more and more particularly if
you're overclocking so if you're not
overclocking it might be a little bit
more feasible for you also worth
pointing out that um the memory already
mentioned is not overclockable if you
for example get memory that has an XMP
profile you can't go and plug that in
with a B 3 B 360 motherboard you won't
get the memory frequency so like the
memory frequency is based on the the
processor that you install if you'd have
an i5 or an i7 give 2666 capability if
you have an i3 of 2400 capability the
memory that you install if you install
say 3000 speed memory of 3200 speed
memory is gonna run at that baseline
frequency that's based on the processor
you have installed but you can still
plug in the XMP value and the timings
will plug in sure so that's the thing
why would you need to run super high
speed memory on an Intel based platform
without seeing more direct benchmarks
from it
I couldn't say I know I know in the past
it hasn't had that much impact on the
Intel platform and it was more of a
thing when like with a with AMD and
risin right to where the memory
frequency became more of a thing where
like yeah you want you want to get the
faster memory because it's gonna give
you a nice boost not having tested any
of this stuff myself for being able to
reference anyone else those benchmarks I
can't say whether or not that's going to
be the fact here as well but I mean
faster memory is faster memory and
usually even if it's minimal it's
there's some kind of game you get from
it mm-hmm
anyway beyond that's there are
benchmarks here in the article and Steve
has done us all a solid by testing
different chipsets and different
motherboards against each other which
must be very boring work because as you
can see here there is no dairy similar
yeah he's testing in eighty seven
hundred and i7 eighty seven hundred with
the Intel Box cooler he also tested it
with in after-market cooler a deep pool
gam X 200 T and then he's also got some
benchmarks for the 8400 down here as
well basically if you're talking about
simply switching chipsets there's no
difference at all and that's to be
expected
yeah he finds that with the gam X
specifically with the 8700 he got
improved performance now this has a
little bit more to do with the processor
and the power delivery configuration on
the motherboard than it does necessarily
with the default the chipset
functionality but here you can also see
kernel important 1.3 benchmark with
really not much difference and P over
here pov-ray 3.7 with not much
difference and blender but also all
marginal not much difference apart from
again
that 8700 with the aftermarket cooler
but
I really looking at there is the impact
of an aftermarket cooler and a budget
motherboard that has lower quality of
power delivery and configuration for the
CPU right because that is lower quality
over time with a higher power draft CPU
with more cores and more threads more
going on more going on generally an 8700
versus an 8400 the power delivery
elements heat up over time and
eventually lead to throttling which
affects performance so you get more
performance with an aftermarket cooler
but there is still some leveling off
based on the actual motherboard
configuration itself kocha so there you
go even though there is no inherent
difference in performance between say a
budget chipset be 360 motherboard and a
nicer Zi 370 motherboard you will often
find that the more expensive chipset
chipset motherboards are paired with
higher level quality higher quality
components which can lead to better
performance over time it's not a
universal statement though so it's it's
why you got a cannon it's why you got to
kind of pick and choose and be aware of
the difference things that might impact
the performance especially when it comes
to the power delivery configuration of
the motherboard and also something that
you know maybe you wouldn't consider
when you tackle it's like I'm not
overclocking and I'm you know I'm not
going to push this up to 5 gigahertz or
something like that so why would it
matter they're using an 80 700 and i7
8700 which is going to run at a default
base and boost frequency and steppings
in between and they're still seeing the
fall-off in performance based on the
motherboard not having
the sufficient enough power delivery
elements to not overheat over time wait
so I'm sorry why would Aziz 370
platformer see better performance than a
B 360 platform I missed that it's not
inherently because of any difference in
the chipset and it's simply because a Z
370 motherboard is more likely to have
say for example that are more power
phases and to deliver power to the CPU
or better Hardware on the power phases
to little over power CPU like more power
phases isn't necessarily better right
you know there's there's a mosfet of
choking a cap or basic power delivery
elements per phase and you can have a
better MOSFET choking a cap and four of
them or you can have eight lower ones
but the effective thing is that all
those is a delivering power to the CPU
are going to warm up over time if you
have a CPU that's drawing more power
they're going to warm up more and if you
have fewer phases or lower quality
components they're gonna get hot to the
point where it starts the throttle right
make sense that it's kind of like nature
of the beast type of thing okay so yeah
don't expect a huge drop-off in
performance going with Beast be 360 but
the article does summarize by saying if
you're considering a higher inch
processor like in 86 I'm sorry I like an
8700 that has six cores and twelve
threads then it might be worth your
while to invest a little bit more on
your motherboard as well anyone hearing
a hum in the background the fan is off
is most likely due to the refrigerator
or Hiro snoring yeah I'm looking at you
Hiro
he doesn't care he doesn't care about
that anything you've just said well now
in no respect for chef
he stopped well as I said I feel like
soft music yes he got self-conscious now
I'm gonna need to just just keep snoring
here oh we love Mike chords I'm gonna
try to do some troubleshooting guys over
the next week or at least between now
and the next time that we let your me
from here and try to figure out what's
causing that all right let's move on
then with the Intel stuff for now just a
couple more stories and then we're gonna
play some video games real quick before
we end things see this is a digi times
article which may or might not end up
behind a paywall
that happens over time we've talked
about nvidia GPP and its potential
impact on the graphics card market
several times over the past month or two
and this is just a little follow up on
it industry sources said that three
Taiwan brands have reportedly adjusted
their new product at development
roadmaps
they may also launch new gaming brands
based on AMD's GPU platform so the the
idea here is that nvidia GPP program the
geforce partner program forces companies
that work with both AMD and NVIDIA to
solely align their gaming brand which is
usually a sub brand with nvidia so with
it with gigabyte its horas with asus rog
or republic of gamers with msi it's
their gaming MSI gaming gaming and as
yes it just call it gaming so the
implication here from the article is
that there is movement on the side of
these GPU manufacturers who work with
both brands to create another different
sub brand for the AMD stuff now what I'm
still kind of curious about is whether
there is some specific legalese or
contract stuff going on
rents them from using the word gaming
with those brands we'll have to wait and
see but there is a little bit of
feedback for people MSI chairman Joseph
sue said the market demand for graphics
cards will continue to expand her bus
leaf remaining and gaming uses how
incredibly generic at the same time we
should point out that as Rock is now
making AMD graphics cards discrete AMD
graphics cards which we talked about a
little bit when it was rumored and but
now it actually does seem to be a thing
so more like are they doing five 70s and
five eighties or are the Vegas that's a
good that's a good question hmm I wish
it I wish I could answer that question
right now
foggy I had to do an internet search to
answer that I bet a bit about check pull
that up
tell us chat tell us all right let's
continue though the agency vipro we've
talked about a little bit there is a
link in the description to a pc gamer
review of the HTC vive pro there are
some drawbacks to it namely our most
importantly the price this is very
expensive it's another 800 bucks for the
vipro headset and you need to already
have an HTC vive original that has the
light boxes and everything to work with
if you don't have that and you're just
buying it straight from the get-go it's
more than that right it's like a
thousand eleven hundred you would have
to buy both together I don't think
they're currently selling really a buy
Pro really as a kit stand alone as Wow
as far as I can tell
however that's crazy the flip side to it
is that you get a big increase in visual
clarity a 2880 by 1600 pixels are 1440
by 1600 per eye it's an improvement over
the 2160 by 1200 of the orig
had set 78% increase in resolution and
according to the review it's enough to
effectively eliminate the visual
detractions from the original HD see
that that might have taken you away from
it such as the rounding and blurring at
the edges of the frame of you as well as
the screen door effect that you get from
pixels being spaced a little bit too far
apart that was pretty annoying yeah so
800 bucks you get the headset and you
get a new link box but you do not get
the controller's or the base sensors
looks Li Haslam we're asking around the
face face mask area - there there will
be a discontinued bundle containing the
pro two original controllers and two
original base sensors with extra
equipment discounted to $2.99
so that would still make it $1,100 for
everything you need to spend not to
mention you with you know deter an aster
PC to run VR at that resolution yes
you're talking about a high resolution
say grade better base hardware as well
and that was always one of the drawbacks
of the original HTC vive - yeah so this
is still a niche product but for people
who already had the vive and are really
into it it's an upgrade that you can
purchase and you think about them you
don't really think about how the
inflated RAM and GPU prices affect the
VR market so much as like the immediate
obvious PC DIY market but you need a
good PC to run VR and now you need an
even better PC to run these new and
improved headsets and the pricing for
all that is jacked up to the point
where if you were if you were like you
know a little bit hesitant to spend
$1000 on a decent gaming PC that could
run VR you're probably looking at like
1,500 to 2,000 dollars for a system that
can do that now
yeah it's crazy not a great time to
release a brand new headset with
increased resolution and higher
recommended specs but you know also Hiro
is snoring down there and snored away
although he just opened his eyes and
they feel self-conscious that I
appointed him that you're very
self-conscious here alright before we
play video games I have one last bit of
just fun to share with you fun and this
from writers and technology is is is fun
but it's also fun to watch when new
technology fails so yeah this is
actually from Russia and they're
attempting to launch their first-ever
postal drone Russian postal drone that
will deliver mail to people in Russia
and they have a bunch of gathered around
as it takes its maiden voyage
yeah it's fly into the air so great ever
so people and waves are still dressed
like their fur goes there it goes right
into the side of the building
oh my god here is this and the jaw oh my
god that happened so fast
smash I hope it wasn't carrying a
fragile product like a piece of glass or
something I don't know if they actually
had any any actual mail your wine
delivery for some wine glasses turret
then but anyway I thought that was kind
of funny so you guys get drone fails are
always the best
all right we're gonna gosh gosh darn
it's already eight o'clock so only
let's do this quickly them all right and
we can we can actually overlap this with
an answering question sure
so in the past when we've done awesome
hardware and we haven't done this for a
while we have after the show done an
after-party where we played video games
yep so we stopped doing that because we
realized that after we have done a live
show and drank beer and everything the
TARDIS did get tired and it sucks
so my thought was hey let's attempt to
integrate the after-party with the
adversary with part of the show itself
or you're terribly we're gonna start
that off today
today's After Burner being curious about
this simulator is inspired by Jays
livestream earlier today and we've got
some PC gaming simulator we're gonna
play right now all right do it
this is currently on Steam early access
is $20 whoo and all of that we're gonna
check out the new game right now we know
that tessellation right there and
triangles oh my gosh and again maybe
your pc p-- you know program just you've
got mail
okay what does he say oh well yes there
it's just
Oh
oh we've got a Hey look there's
mods ooh
why aren't why aren't our posters up
there Paul there should be like a Paul's
hardware and a bit wit you're like
poster we should have we slipped off
teamed up less I got some music playing
I like that nice Asus flat-screen there
aces panel oh yes all looks like a one
wireless mechanical keyboard perhaps
alright so we go onto our computer and
into our email have you have you tested
this out yet
no I watch Jay playing it earlier today
JD on livestream
okay had way more live years and we have
that's okay
they were crappy yeah the quality of our
live viewers is far superior to Jay you
guys are way better so I have a memory
they very very loose idea of what goes
on basically you check your mail here
and your uncle your uncle Tim used to
have this PC shop all right computer
it's handing it down to you and he's
saying that's the company's not doing
well and there's no money and rent and
energy and don't forget to put thermal
paste on there and also he borrowed $15
for fuel so you start at negative $15
Wow
yeah uncle Tim's a bastard I
know other than that here's our first
email which says hey Tim I hope he can
help me I have some viruses so we click
go to PC and then we're out in the
hallway here and so out in the hallway
of the business I swear your computer's
that you're gonna work on line up so
click on that
wait has ever Oh right-click and I pick
it up and then we're gonna walk it in
here set it down in our workstation and
then we can see as we mouse over the PC
what our objectives are we need to
remove the viruses the status is also
that it is not loaded
I wish debug LEDs were that advanced
where I could just be like you need to
remove viruses just just boot to the
operating system we need to run a virus
scan okay how do we is that isn't is it
an s3 40 all right looks like an s3 40
case it might be it's got the cable
management bar the window the feet there
we go
the body that shitty Intel topically
right click and drag that we can we need
to we need to pimp this PC out Paul we
even like critique it and change it
probably probably terrible it looks
terrible it needs our help
okay so we're gonna click on cables here
plug in the cables this is cable
without you have to click it and hold
this is riveting stuff you have to hold
it for a second in order to actually
pick it up just like in real life so
realistic fascinating ok insert USB
Drive so we need to go to our inventory
and get the USB Drive and plug it in
there good power it on the PC boot it up
it is powering out we can see the fan
spank yeah it's good wait you just click
the power button you don't actually
watch the button they should make you
press the button on the computer its
power button down here yeah there's
different power buttons Kyle yeah but
that one she okay yeah you can click it
directly to you if you really want to
okay um can you move the side panel yes
you can but we're not doing that now we
just need to get the virus scanner
installed take it off it was just stupid
desktop background so this is the
Omega the Omega OS cow can you change
your desktop background not make it look
like but I don't know restart all right
good can you can you can you can you
boot into the BIOS there's a lot of boot
into the BIOS I didn't see a splash
screen that lets you delete that's
possible mmm okay we're gonna scan the
computer clean it clean those files Wow
one second virus comb that's impressive
boom computer protected I wish it was
that easy cool alright small wise this
is nothing accurate about the simulator
all right pick up the computer and throw
it there backdoor through that your
enemies click their reward look at this
hell yeah hundred dollars bitches we're
now in the positive and we're gonna get
an answer thank you for picked fixing my
PC it's moving faster than it has in
years Wow this package is satisfied with
their service he'll slide really quickly
I know like literally two seconds after
you we just earned $100 that's good
money
that's awesome money quitting my day job
to build pcs what's next what's next
I've got the bug all right so obviously
since our first interaction went so well
you know we got some referrals from
other people yeah how does how do these
referrals pop up so quickly I don't know
so we need a name or Tony easy start
Fiverr two gigs SATA Drive okay yeah
fine fine
could you look at my PC it's running as
well remove viruses all right we know
how to do that that's easy and then we
got a graphics card is fried itself I
need to replace by a GTX 970 needs to be
replaced the same one GTX 970 maybe one
of the Cheyenne ones okay
she and Jonathan Berg GTX tents of a
gamer
okay real brand what it's not a real
brand doesn't mean she and how do i
is she in how do i how do i order new
just a shop we gotta go to the shop all
right this is too complicated and then
70 I want I want a prebuilt desktop
simulator where you just buy a computer
and then it just ships this is to say
what she said right the 970 gamer yeah
we get that
and that's inaccurate it should actually
say 3.5 gigabyte sad it should say 3.0
inaccurate I'm very disappointed in the
authenticity of this application all
right we got Next Day Delivery for 30
bucks or three or five working days for
ten bucks I can't imagine that we're
gonna do I don't wanna pay $30 for
shipping that's okay emails
back Queen Britney our account is
overdrawn make her pay we know that your
life doesn't always run smoothly so we
can provide a free overdraft for all
your customers forever Jeff limit is
$1,000 so we can get it we can get up to
$1,000 in the hole free money free -
exactly how that should work all right
why are your stools so they can go pink
or semi opaque I think that's because
you must be level three to build the
second workbench
you must have a gtx 1080 to render these
- you must be level eight to build the
third workbench so we got to level up
get a level up in our pc building skills
kyle it's a role-playing game there's
also a fire - fire extinguisher up here
and we got a z97 and Wi-Fi no and we got
a huge power strip we got some CDR w's
there apparently as well all right we're
it's got into the world no ending the
day to advance to tomorrow pay rent $500
cool so that's what it's like that this
is basically what Paul and I deal with
every day if you ever wanted to know
what our lives are like just play this
game but we could do this accurate it's
like a hundred percent we could do this
and simulate it yeah and then we just
make computers all day and give them to
people and they forget to order them
more Tony's Easter 500 gig let me shoot
it
I feel like this almost makes a bad name
for PC bowling because I feel like
building a computer in real life is way
more fun than this and most people who
are curious about building their own pcs
are gonna play this simulator and be
like well that's something I'm never
doing in real life
that was terrible Alice only
just need to remove the viruses from me
just gonna play it a little bit longer
before it's good you should start going
over a donation let's let's go over
donations um
the junkman thank you very much for the
1000 donation both of you are the ones
who helped me build my first PC about to
build another just wanted to say thanks
and I only go to your channels for
advice messed up the last one lol
thank you very much Chuck man good luck
on your second build and very glad that
the first one was a success and that we
were able to help you with that
Congrats though photos Iggy so two foes
Iggy $5.00 hello ba portugee been
watching awesome hardware since since
episode 39 but I haven't been able to
donate till now thank you tax returns a
good job
you did a good thing for once thank you
very much Ziggy appreciated man
another one from Ziggy five dollars
displaying the tax return equally but
between Paul and Kyle enjoy nice I like
that I like tax socialism bitch bazinga
X $20.00 for more makeup Paul being a
casual gamer will I see much difference
between 5 milliseconds and 1 millisecond
response time monitor only to the very
trained eye will you see a difference in
my opinion I could be gaming on a 1
millisecond or 5 millisecond response
time monitor and really have the same
experience I think unless you are that
in tune or a professional gamer would
you really see a huge noticeable
difference 5 milliseconds is still
fairly fast especially if you can get
that on an IPS panel where the color
reproduction is a lot greater than say a
TN panel that doesn't have to shift
things as quickly and and can be quicker
so I think 5 milliseconds is just fine I
would just say if you're going with IPS
5 milliseconds is fine if it's TN then
you might as well go for 1 milliseconds
because it's faster if I vary less I
agree Phillip Rams $10 mr. Paul with you
going to solar will you be totally off
the grid now hidden away from government
eyes and other undesirables not
completely I'm still connected to the
grid and I mmm everything will be backed
up on the solar and the power wall
except for the AC I don't use the AC
very often but they see will still be on
the grid Brad jolly $5 dos equis or
Tecate too late already ported Osakis
just copped a shirt from each of your
stores keep up the good work thank you
very much Brad I would probably prefer
Dos Equis over Tecate me too lesser of
the two evils
you know Ducati does have the cool bald
eagle though that's very sweet
trolling trolling ttan 20 Canadian
jessica's Kyle sucks
sometimes LOL jk thanks Troma Killington
great pick me up and to boost to my
confidence
you know you no that's no I'm just
kidding
everyone's entitled to their own
opinions and sometimes you're right
sometimes I do suck just just ask my
wife she'll tell you Kyle Kyle sex all
the time
hi lung $5 from the love from Texas Kyle
you should do a weekly pay my PC video
surprise no one has paid money to tell
you this before a weekly pimp my PC
video weekly weekly maybe maybe monthly
maybe monthly would be cool I mean I try
to do that with booted booted was like a
livestream series that I did I was
rapping about it booted just just didn't
take off I mean I think live a live web
series for YouTube was a bit premature
back then I think it still is streaming
on YouTube just hasn't caught on like
twitch has obviously but I did like the
idea of booted and I still you know who
knows one day I might try something
similar to it just in a different way
but well I guess we'll see
but yeah 10 my PC is a has been a very
popular segment on awesome hardware and
we don't plan on stopping it anytime
soon maybe we'll do some something else
with it as an extension later down the
line
Bradley long $10 I like beans beards and
now beams beans like the food I like
beans too oh and by the way love
watching the live streams thoughts about
the HP Envy x-360 Ivers and support for
rising new processors I've heard the HP
Envy s the X the HP MVS have been pretty
good I don't know about the particular
model that you have they look super sexy
if you having graphics drivers issues I
don't know I mean try reinstalling them
that's a pretty obvious first step
and I can't I can't really say what else
is the issue I'm not too familiar with
that particular model of laptop haven't
actually had one in the studio but good
luck hope everything works out hope
you're still I like how the music in
this game has sort of gotten more a beat
as you've continued making more systems
and yes obviously it's more girls along
with with your progress yeah makes sense
yeah I'm feeling it Cole Jackson five
Canadians I hate that I live in Canada
sometimes I was gonna buy the bit with
desk Matt but Canadian shipping is $15
so here's the donation because y'all are
awesome thank you very much mr. Jackson
we appreciate the donation and I'm sorry
that shipping costs can sometimes be
extreme I agree I'm from either of our
stores that is sort of the nature of the
beast
but we do what we can and believe it or
not those shipping rates are better than
what they were in years prior we're
constantly trying to hammer that down
cuido Cellucci $5 i went out that the X
370 boards already have a toe to toe 11
