Pauls hardware this is probing Paul my
monthly Q&amp;amp;A series that I usually do
towards the end of every month this is
episode number 7 and this is for August
of 2016 it is getting late in the summer
and I've been traveling this month but I
cannot neglect probing Paul so let's
start off with a look back through the
sands of time look how tiny Cal's little
picture is getting down there sorry so
small anyway those are all the previous
probing Paul's but let's get started
with the first question this one comes
from Prince and this was posted on last
month's video so if you guys want to ask
me questions for this month post them in
this month's videos comments section
question to ask can you turn a
closed-loop water cooler into an open
water cooler or a custom loop you might
say I have a closed water cooler and I
was wondering if it's possible to use a
pump and water block for an open water
cooler kind of tight on money right now
I'd like to use as much as I can for my
closed system on a new open system the
answer is yes you can in some situations
but it can vary now I have a couple
actual choices or things that I've done
here in the past let's start off with
what I think you probably have which is
something like one of these right here
this is a thermal take water 2.0 this is
a basic ace tech OMS closed-loop cooler
comes with the pump block combo here and
these sort of standardized types of
closed-loop cooling connectors these are
fixed and they're not really meant to be
removed yes they can be removed yes they
can be reused I've seen it done but it's
very difficult and you're going to be
dealing with questions about the seals
going on there and it's just not the
best idea these are kind of close then
they're meant to stay closed that's not
to say that you don't have options for
this though if you if you want to do it
so here is the radiator it's still kind
of dusty from a swift tech H to 20 H to
20 X whichever this one was this one has
barbed fittings on the end and this one
is made to be expandable what happened
here was the pump failed causing me no
small amount of heartache and then I
basically removed the tubing via the
tool plant fittings there in the end and
I was able to have this radiator which I
now use to like say look at 240
millimeter radiator fit so that kind of
thing
or it's a copper radiator which is still
very
nice and just the pump networking
doesn't mean the radiator has anything
wrong with it also you notice as a fill
port on there and that is kind of
important for topping things off
continuing along though I have some
suggestions for you if you really want
to buy something new I'm assuming you
already have one but fractal for
instance has expandable loops so this is
their Kelvin coolers difficult to get in
the US but elsewhere it's a little bit
more easy to find these have G 1/4
fittings on the end so that basically
makes it a lot easier to replace these
adapters if you need to another one that
has standardized G 1/4 fittings is the
Alpha cool iceberg it's used to be made
and sold through Coolermaster but now I
think it's just an ethical product again
you can remove the fittings and replace
them if you want to or they're just a
little bit easier to swap out because
they're that G 1/4 standard EK also
makes the xlc predator this one's cool
because it actually has a quick
disconnect in the middle so you can use
that quick disconnect to like disconnect
easily and then loop in another part
part to the system assuming you get
other quick disconnects that are
compatible and that is a great option as
well
I actually just built this system behind
me this testbed and I used a fractal
cooler and I was able to I didn't expand
it but I had to remove the fittings from
it and sort of to feed them through and
definitely having replaceable removable
fittings was very helpful for that
anyway thank you for the question next
question though from Sean Roode's will
you make an all AMD PC sometime this is
a good question a timely question
considering that I just also posted a
video with a first look at AMD Zen this
was actually from last week at faith
that's supposed to be muted it's from
last week they had some new
announcements about Zen they had some
architecture details actually coming
pretty strong with us they also had a
side-by-side comparison of a Zen vs. 269
hundred K which should be taken with a
grain of salt but it looked promising
all that is to say that yes I'm very
excited about making an all AMD system
especially now that we got the new
Radeon rx cards rx 40 I think is a very
good card
I won't build one now though because a
m4 isn't much that's really what I'm
waiting for
socket am 4 is going to be the new
socket for both AMD APU s as well as AMD
CPUs APU s have integrated graphics CPUs
do nots
and the Bristol Ridge chip that we're
that they're talking about here should
be an eight-core 16 thread socket aim
for CPU without an integrated GPU as far
as we know and it should be really cool
option so something like that combined
with like a new Vega GPU that we're also
hopefully going to see by the end of
this year would be a really exciting
build to do all that said I don't see
myself doing one any time soon until I
can get my hands on an m4 motherboard
for more on that let's go to the next
question look at I tied these two
together somehow Jose Vasquez says wait
so current AMD CPUs and ApS will work
with the new am 4 motherboards a very
good question and I think there's going
to be some confusion here but I will
explain the to the best of my knowledge
what I know so far all right so currents
AMD CPUs and ap use current generation
that slot into socket am3 motherboards
am3+ motherboards or FM 2 plus
motherboards two different types of
sockets I'll use the same CPU
microarchitecture it's all based on the
original bulldozer chip bulldozer
microarchitecture that they started I
think in 2010 or 2011 when the 8150
launched everything since then has been
different iterations refinements to that
same CPU microarchitectures it's still
32 nanometer I believe but even the most
recent chips are based on excavator
those are just refinements of what's
going on
so what we're gonna see when am4
launches is an initial offering of
motherboards or so we're told so we're
expecting that our am 4 and that will
slot in current generation AP use not on
the not with the same socket though so
you will need a new apu you're not going
to be able to buy an AP right now that's
FM 2 plus and then slot end into an amp
and AM for motherboard so when I am for
launches what you will have is current
CPU microarchitecture based ap use at
least that's what we're expecting based
on probably excavator cores with some
you know maybe a polaris GPU in there
something like that that would be cool
but those will not be using Xen and then
maybe at the same time or maybe later on
down the road we will see Xen CPUs maybe
even ap use was then
in them as well new microarchitecture
new am4 socket but you'll still have
apparently other a m4 based previous
generation microarchitecture apu is also
available i hope that makes some sense
but what i think going back to the
previous question i will plan on doing
is when a m4 launches with an APU
current gen I'll do a new update on
maybe it may be a budget build on that
or something a little but we're more
reasonably priced with like an FX our X
480 and then further down the line when
Zen actually launches hopefully by the
end of this year we have Zen like
hopefully really good performing CPUs
something like that with a Vega GPU I'll
totally do and as long as everything you
know launches as we're expecting then
then yeah you should be seeing that for
me as well all right let's try to rip
through some more of these questions
mini house asks in the future ultra wide
benchmark videos can you upload them in
21 by 9 aspect ratio yes maybe I've had
different thoughts on that I think what
I might do is 4k with the 21 by 9 sort
of embedded in 4k I might upload native
a 21 by 9 but it really cuts down in the
number of people who are who could watch
those videos I know people who already
have a 21 by 9 monitor it's really cool
watch that format but I'm what I'm
trying to do is get people into that
format so if you have a 16 by 9 and you
have to watch a 21 by night it's just
you can't see quite as much so yes I
will take that into account and perhaps
just how I do things in the future what
I really need to do is start doing
everything in 4k anyway frequency asks
would you use liquid metal as thermal
paste for GPU and/or CPU yes totally
would liquid metal thermal paste is
often touted as some of the best options
that are out there often works a little
bit better than synthetic stuff you do
have to worry about conductivity so
using too much and splurging over the
sides is a little bit more of a concern
in that aspect I also thought I don't
usually I'm not usually nit picky about
thermal paste simply because usually
from the best thermal paste you can get
to like the corner sort of mediocre
crappy stuff is a difference of two
three maybe four or five degrees Celsius
which isn't a huge difference and I
don't often go like the min/max route of
trying to get the best of the best of
the best possibility of everything and
go for maximum overclocks so for that
reason i'm
is picky about the thermal pace but
that's no reason not to use it just
remember it's conducted more on soldier
asks hey Paul what's that keyboard
you've got there I mean the one you're
using in the video and the one in the
background I have a few here so this is
Corsair k95 old-school red switches this
is actually the keyboard that I used in
my how to clean a keyboard video which
is one of the more popular videos I've
done and it still works although I'm
moving around all my questions right now
there's only like one key that's still a
little sticky 0ne that's just one of
them though there's also that this one
this is the master keys Pro L from
Coolermaster RGB and all that good stuff
that's a nice one and then my floater
keyboard is this one right here which is
starting to get a little bit dusty and
dirty which is a quick-fire rapid I also
from Coolermaster and I just like it
small so if I set up a system I can just
plug it in or sometimes I use this down
below me on the floor to control the
teleprompter with my toe but I'm not
doing that today all right yo ton ninja
asks hey Paul for the next episode can
you answer this what is a good
introductory camera and setup to get I
would like to make tech videos like mine
or Linus's or Jays or any of the large
tech tubers alright so if you're just
starting out it's difficult for me to
say you should invest you know a
thousand dollars in a camera or
something like that which is was
originally what I was going to say get a
gh4 gh4 is really nice but actually what
I would suggest is to start out with
something like cell phone because cell
phone cameras as long as it can do like
1080 video anything that's coming out in
the past two three years can be pretty
decent granted some of them have much
better optics than others but it's a
quick way to get yourself off the ground
they have good storage some can even do
4k and you know you can just point it at
stuff and start making your videos
before you take the next step of
investing in a camera that said if you
are thinking about investing in a camera
I will tell you some of the actual
features that I look for and of course
I'm using my GH 4 to show you alright so
one thing I really think you should
consider if you are doing YouTube videos
and especially if you're filming
yourself is a flip-out screen that way
when you're filming yourself you can see
what you're filming and you're not have
to like go back behind it or use a
wireless thing or something like that
having a audio input is going to be very
important if more you do video the more
you realize audio is often overlooked
and having a good audio solution can
really improve your quality you can
record separately but being able to just
plug it in and record straight the
camera is very important I also really
like having an HDMI out a clean HDMI out
that you can use live that's what I'm
using right now to capture all this
right now with my other gh4
and those are just things I would keep
my eye out for next from Justin Murray
what's the wrist rest you're using and
have a tried or ergonomic mice and I can
do a head-to-toe ergonomic setup video
or something like that I haven't really
considered the full organ Amma kid EO or
anything but this you're wondering is
what is this it's handstands handstands
yeah I got this on Amazon based on
reviews I really like it so far made in
China but it's got microbeads in there
and I got it because people are like oh
you can like make a little hole and
remove some of the microbeads if it's
like you know if it's got too much
support but mainly I like having my
wrist straight when I'm using the mouse
you know eg I gotta try to keep this
plane straight and as long as I do that
I typically don't get too much fatigue
or anything also you know generally good
practices like keeping the back straight
and the feet flat on the floor and all
that good stuff is important as well
yeah I like this wrist rest and I'll
post the Amazon link to it down in the
description if you guys want to check it
out a couple more questions den Van
nuyen says between a 69 hundred K and 59
60 X which will you choose they're both
a core that both have similar
performance
they are both similarly priced if I am
not mistaken here's the 69 hundred K
thousand well 1100 bucks right now on
new egg here's the 59 60 X well 1016 so
it's about eighty to eighty-five dollars
cheaper I would still say just go with
the 69 hundred K because you're already
spending a thousand dollars relatively
speaking
eighty bucks more it's really not that
big of a difference Broadwell e is going
to be fast around in instructions per
clock level granted you potentially
might have better overclocking with 59
60 X but that really is going to vary on
a chip by chip basis and honestly if I
was just buying one of these straight up
right now I just I just sack up and go
for the 16
100 K because it's you know let's it's a
little bit better a little bit better
and why would you but why would you
spend a thousand dollars on a processor
and not get the best processor you could
because you don't want to spend $1700 on
a 69 50 X that would probably be a good
answer to that question jacks Macintosh
says the thumb screw logo on your shirt
is there any meaning behind it or is
just a thumb screw I don't I'm not
wearing the shirt right now but I have
it on my fancy mug right here my thumb
screw logo I really like I wanted
something that was simple and hopefully
slightly iconic and that represented PC
building to some degree without being
like a graphics card or something I
guess if there's a back story would go
back to my one of my earlier power
supplies and one of my Furley er custom
built systems was a PC power and cooling
and I forget well I don't think I had to
have the power supply replaced I forget
why but I had to get in touch with PC
power and cooling and they're just
really nice and really good service
they've been bought and sold since then
but I still like PC power and cooling
but they sent me a little a little
envelope with like four thumb screws and
as the first thumb screws I'd had with a
PC edge just like this is so much better
they were like brass you know I think I
might stall them around somewhere anyway
that's that's as much of a back story as
I can come up with for my thumb screw
logo maybe 2.1 gigahertz oh oh God see
see what happens you've upset the dogs I
was I only I only sketched out for half
a second that Hiro was gonna knock my
camera over finally this is my p.o box
if you guys want to send me stuff for
three to five Diamond Bar California and
I
I promise I'll check it soon and then we
usually do mail time on the live show so
I that's when we actually open those
things anyway guys thank you for
watching this video I hope you've
enjoyed it hit the thumbs up button
leave me more questions in the comment
section down below if you want me to
answer your questions next month also
check out my store you can buy shirts
mugs pint glasses all that good stuff
