Pauls hardware if you've been watching
my channel recently you've probably
spotted my beginners instructional
tutorial series about how to build a new
gaming PC for yourself get it up and
running I started off with a $500 build
and a complete step-by-step guide on how
to put it all together I followed that
up with a $750 build and upgrading the
$500 build with new components and
making it faster I also followed that up
with comparing those two systems against
each other and some benchmark battles so
that was fun too and then finally I also
did a first 5 things you should do with
a new PC built kind of taking it from
the build is constructed stage to the
getting the UEFI set up getting Windows
installed and getting everything
configured so it's going to actually
work can be a functional computer for
you today's video is a follow-up to that
video the first 5 things I'm doing 3
additional things that I think you guys
should do with a new PC build and I
actually going to start off with an
apology because in my first 5 things
video I kind of did an oversight a
mistake if you will I was mistaken about
how Windows installation works on a kind
of a nitpicky little thing but I think
it's something that bears a little bit
more explanation and correction but
before I get into that I want to point
out that for today's video other than
all the stuff that I've talked about in
those previous videos that you'll need
such as the computer at a keyboard and
mouse and a monitor and an internet
connection for today's projects the
three things you will need that Windows
10 USB installer that you made perhaps
in the previous video and then I'm also
going to be working with an external
drive which I've also encouraged you
guys to get I actually have an SSD one
terabyte external connected via a USB 3
adapter which works because it's really
fast but if you have something like an
external mechanical drive or something
like that
just make sure that it's sizeable enough
to store a backup image of the
installation of Windows you have and
perhaps even to start up some games
because I'm going to be going into some
steam configuration stuff too but first
back to that correction of my mistake
here is the UEFI as I've already
explained it's UEFI not a BIOS in here
is where we went into before to tell the
computer to boot not off of the drives
that are installed but to boot off of
this Windows 10 USB installer that I'm
so I'm going to plug this in right now
I'm pretty sure that's not going to be
just recognized immediately so let me
restart really quick and get back into
the bio so that that USB installer'
actually is recognized I'm tapping
deletes again just as the system boots
up to access the BIOS and there it is so
now over here on the right side we can
see the windows boot manager and that's
what is created when you install Windows
10 it puts a little boot manager on to
the BIOS we also have the SSD that I
installed windows on to and then we have
two options here for USB the disc that I
just installed USB disk 2.0 and USB mode
or that same USB disk in it UEFI mode
and here is where I made that
fundamental mistake as I was setting up
Windows before if you are changing your
boot priority which you can either do
directly here in the BIOS and then
reboot and save or you can do what I did
before which was to use the motherboards
boot shortcut key which happens to be
f11 for this motherboard other
motherboards have this as well so I'm
tapping f11 right now so system starts
but this will allow me to just tell it
hey just for this one time go and boot
off of something else other than the SSD
for example so here is really the
correction instead of choosing USB like
I did without really mentioning it or
anything
choose UEFI that will install a new efi
mode and it will just do a couple kind
of fundamental different things when it
actually installs Windows basically
tying in with the UEFI functionality of
the motherboard and what the upshot is
here is you're going to get much faster
boot times in fact this system cut a
good five six seven seconds off the boot
time it is still booting pretty fast
before is maybe 15 to 20 seconds now
it's like 10 to 15 so that's pretty cool
but anyway once you do that it will take
you back into the standard Windows
environment and from here you can go
back to my first five things you should
do with a new pc build video and go
through the installation just like I
told you before so that is step one and
just in case you guys have already
installed Windows and you're thinking to
yourself well you jerk why didn't you
tell me about this the first time well
let me show you how you can tell what a
mut Modi actually installed it
so now that I am booted back into
Windows I am just going to check out my
configuration that the storage is set up
in because this will actually be done
automatically I'm going to right click
on this PC and go to manage by the way
this will be done automatically by the
Windows 10 setup and just by taking a
quick glance at this in Disk Management
you can actually see how it's set up and
whether you're in a old-school bios mode
or updated UEFI mode and basically the
recovery partition right here is what
you look at 450 megabytes is the size
that you will see if you're in UI ufi
UEFI mode you will also see an
additional efi system partition right
there and then you'll see the remainder
of your hard drive to actually use
usable space on the hard drive or SSD or
whatever use and right there if you did
not install in efi mode you will see a
500 megabyte partition right here and
you will not see any fi system partition
and that's just a quick way to look and
check what you're actually set up in now
if you did not install in efi mode then
you're gonna have to go back and
reinstall windows if you really want to
do that but i would say if you didn't
don't worry about it again it works just
fine i've used lots of systems in that
configuration and really the the
fundamental benefit you get is just a
few extra seconds faster when the system
boots up for the first time which again
is nice but that was just bugging me it
was bugging me so much that as I was
installing it just didn't move that down
I would like to say one last thank you
to anyone who commented in the first
five things you should do when it's long
a new PC build who said hey Paul
shouldn't you have chosen to eat UEFI
mode and I was like should I have and
then I had to research it and I was like
I was like I have been wrong about this
so that's part of the fun of making
videos about technology on YouTube is
eventually you will get something wrong
and then people will call you out very
quickly on it but I like being called up
because I want to I want to be correct
damnit about the stuff I'm trying to
teach you guys now let's move out to
thing number two which is making a
system backup image I think this is a
really useful thing to do for anyone who
is installing Windows for the first time
simply because if you've been following
along with all of these steps as I've
been doing for you guys as far as
installing windows everything from
booting off of this drive to plopping
Windows onto your SSD or
drives that you're booting off of too
even the little things you might do with
the operating system like changing the
folder options so that Windows doesn't
hile
hide file extensions that kind of thing
all of that stuff if you were to go back
reformat your computer and reinstall
windows again you would have to do it
again which isn't a huge deal but it's
just it's going to take you time you
know an hour - depending on how
particular your you are about everything
so what this going to do is basically
take a snapshot of your system however
you have it set up and then it will
allow you to recover from that snapshot
whenever you need to so so just click
the Windows button and go up to backup
and restore I just search for backup
it's called backup and restore Windows 7
you'll find this right here you will at
this point want to take your external
drive and plug that guy in so that it
will be recognized as a device you can
backup to and then from here you go over
sorry that popped up go over to create a
system image it will automatically look
for the backup devices that you have
available it sees my single drives that
I've plugged in right here that's the
only one tells you how much is free on
it and then we're just going to hit next
here it will tell you the backup
location and also tell you that any
existing system images from this machine
might be overwritten and I've also tell
you what it's backing up which is those
two partitions as well as the C Drive
which is what you need you can also do
an exclusion option here if you have
additional drives plugged in it will let
you exclude them I don't have anything
else connected so you just click start
backup and it will go through and it
will create to that backup I already
went and did this yesterday so the
backup is actually here in Windows image
backup folder on this Drive and there
you can see a couple backups that I've
done and now real quickly let's run
through actually restoring from this
backup after you've created it so I will
take my Windows installer because we're
going to boot off of this and use this
to do the recovery and plug it back into
my computer here at the back and then I
will reboot and once again tap the f11
button to get into that boot quick boot
environment and tell its to again boot
in efi mode because that's what we want
to do it will go through EFI boot
operations like you have seen it do
before and now instead of clicking
install now
going to move down and click repair your
computer in this Windows 10 operating
system environments that will take you
to the next page which will give you a
few options we're going to choose
troubleshoot and then from there choose
system image recovery and again make
sure that that external drive wherever
you have the image copy to is on there
it will tell you to choose the target
operating system you're going for
Windows 10 and then it will scan for the
image and it will automatically find it
if it's done in the standard way that we
have done it just now from here you can
just click Next and bear in mind that if
you are restoring this image onto an
existing SSD or drive or whatever that's
on there it's going to delete everything
on that drive so bear that in mind here
going to do an exclusion until to
exclude the USB Drive that we're
currently booting off of which is kind
of nice tell it to format every
partition disks and then go ahead and
click Next and finish it will tell you
that all just will be restored and
formatted yes and this will only take a
few minutes after it finishes you can
reboot your system and then everything
will be exactly as it was when you
created that system image it's a really
convenient way to kind of get your
system set up exactly how you want it
and then have that backup image there in
case something goes wrong if you get a
virus or anything like that you're just
up restore from the image and you're
after the races once again let's move on
to the third thing though which I think
you guys might find useful this is Steam
setup because again if you're building a
gaming PC probably want to play games on
it and getting Windows setup is one
thing but you got to get the games
loaded up and chances are if you're
gonna play games on a gaming PC you're
going to be using steam at some point
granted is not by any means the only
exclusive game platform for the PC but
it is definitely the most expansive and
everything so go and download the client
first or steam powered comm is where you
get that click install steam it will
download it'll guy install steam now and
you'll run that and it will do automatic
updates I'm also going to plug in my
accounts and do the automatic account
activation but I won't show you that
stuff I'll be right back in just seconds
with Steam set up properly
okay so I actually reinstalled steam
here just so I could show you guys how
this is working so when you first
install steam you will have no games and
what I'm going to try to show you guys
right now is how to get games onto this
computer without having to redownload
them again because games can be 40 50 60
70 80 gigs maybe you have like a cap on
your bandwidth or something like that
you don't want to redownload them maybe
you've already downloaded them somewhere
else and you just want to play them
faster so popping them onto this system
can be Kopp can be done via copying them
from an older system or something like
that but you have to do it in a specific
way and then also setting up additional
Steam libraries on the system will allow
you to for instance choose when you
install a game for the first time I want
to install this on the SSD so it loads
really fast or I want to install this on
the hard drive because I know it's a big
game and it's going to take up a lot of
space and I want to put it on the 2
terabyte drive so I won't use up all the
space on my SSD that's the basic
decision you might made might make so
basically we're going to go to settings
and that is where we're going to be
doing most of this stuff so first off
let's make a new library on this system
so if we go back to our computer we can
see here the SSD that we've installed
steam onto we also have our two terabyte
storage drive I just plug that back in
so it would be recognized again and
again my first five things video I
showed you guys how to actually set up
that drive so it's accessible as it is
right now I just unplugged my Windows
installer because that doesn't need to
be there and here is my external drive
that I have plugged in this has some
games on it but but I'll show you how to
set up an external drive to use as a
library or also to copy games onto an
existing drive so here we'll make a new
folder and we'll call games and then I
like to go in there and make a new
folder called Steam library
very because that's the default name the
steam likes to use for its steam library
so now that that exists we will go over
here to downloads on the steam settings
choose steam library folders and we'll
see that there is the default one under
Program Files this is on the SSD the c
drive that's already there and how much
space is used since we don't have again
any games installed and nothing is there
so we click add a library folder change
the drive from our c drive over to our
so we'll go to the D Drive
we found our games folder that we put
there and choose Steam library and hit
 and now we have two library
folders here on the C Drive and on the D
Drive so now if we were to go to install
a game it would prompt us and say where
do you want to install to and that's
where you can make that decision but
let's say we already have a game
downloaded somewhere and we want to plop
it onto that drive and not worry about
downloading it ourselves so for that we
will go back here actually the first
thing we want to do is exit steam close
it out of the system tray down there
let's go into our storage drive in our
games folder and our Steam library and
we have it right there you'll note it
makes a steam apps folder there and then
we're going to fill that out with a
little bit more stuff in just a moment
let's also go to my external drive here
and again I use the same layout here so
I know where stuff is I have a games
folder and I have a Steam library in
there that will also have steam apps and
then in there in the steamapps folder
this one called common and then that is
where all of your games are so we're
going to duplicate that folder over here
since we don't have any games installed
that common folder hasn't been made but
we can make it just make sure you name
it common just as the normal one is and
then let's take a game let's find a game
that's maybe a reasonable size let's do
chivalry so we just take the whole
chivalry folder from here where it was
installed before drag it over there and
we'll wait just a few moments for it to
copy here's a benefit of having a SSD
external drive is it copies it well
that's not too bad we're copying it to
mechanical drive so it's going at about
the maximum speed that that mechanical
drive can write at and now chivalry is
copied okay
so let's just close that out let's go
back over to steam load up again
and from here chivalry will not appear
as installed that's assuming of course
that you own this game - you have to own
the game it doesn't appear as installed
but we can hit install here now and then
we need to pay special attention here to
where to install it - and again we're
going to go back to that D folder that
we already did it because since we put
the game here we want it to try to
install there and then it's going to
actually discover stuff so we'll it will
initially start say creating stuff and
that'll be like discovering like oh we
found the game there and then it will go
through and discover all those files
then in a few moments it should pop up
as being there and available to play
we'll give it a second ok so I had to
double check something really quick bad
thing because I was pretty sure that I
was doing this properly and then it went
and started to download an update what I
realized is that the version I copied
over here of chivalry is has not been
updated in a while so the one I copied
over was like 2.5 or 3 gigs but the
current existing version of chivalry is
8 gigs so if you copy a game and it's
not to date it will recognize the files
but then it will attempt to update that
game to whatever the latest version is
so chivalry in this particular case
happens to need an additional five gigs
of downloads face but it is working and
it is downloading and now once that
download finishes this game will be
installed on our 2 terabyte drive I also
brought faster-than-light over here just
because it was fast downloaded I wanted
to confirm that everything was working
properly and it was alright so let's
move on to the next step which is adding
an additional library of something that
already exists which is actually a
little bit more simple so that should be
easy
well again jump over here back to
settings and then we'll go over to
downloads and we'll again hit the Steam
library folders and here's where I use a
technique very often to take a single
Drive and move it from computer to
computer and run the games off of that
drive again with an external SSD like
the one I have it works really good they
all have to do in order to add that
additional library it said add library
folder go to the drive I have
that the games installed on to which is
the F Drive in this case again go into
games and choose that Steam library
folder and hit select and suddenly I
have 14 more games installed Dada
there they are but then I'll tell you
the amount of space and how much space
is taken up and all that good stuff I
make can hit close and okay and then
when we go back to our library we will
see many many more games that are
installed that have been downloaded and
are there and should either be ready to
play or often you know when you click
play on them they'll have they might
have to do a quick update or something
like that but you will avoid the problem
of having to completely redownload the
game and it's going to save you time and
hopefully so you know save you from your
bandwidth cap if you happen to be in a
situation where you have one of those
but that's all for this video guys I
really hope it has helped you a little
bit more thank you for bearing with me
as I have corrected myself but hopefully
added a little bit more useful
information to this one as well to make
it well more useful I suppose anyway hit
the thumbs up button if you enjoyed this
links to everything I have done as well
as the past videos in this tutorial
series are down in the description thank
you all so much for your feedback on
this one I will be back more with more
videos very soon and we'll see you next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
