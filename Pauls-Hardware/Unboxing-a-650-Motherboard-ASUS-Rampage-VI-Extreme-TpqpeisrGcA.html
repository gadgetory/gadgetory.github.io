what's up guys welcome back to Pauls
hardware I have gotten a lot of new CPUs
this year in 2017 when AMD sent over
their first Rison processors they had
like a wooden box and I did an unboxing
of that and they sent over the thread
ripper and they had like these two
massive boxes and I didn't unboxing of
that so now that intel is releasing the
high end of their cpu line up the
skylake X CPUs that they promised us
back at the beginning of June I figured
I owe it to them to do an unboxing as
well so let's get started see we have
two black boxes here one says 16 for the
16 core 79 60 X and 18 which I have to
assume is for the 18 core 79 80 X II the
extreme edition of course the old school
course stat packaging and inside boom
there's the 18 core and the 16 core but
I guess that's pretty much all there is
to it thanks for watching guys okay I'll
be honest I I did think it was kind of
funny the difference between the intel
packaging and the AMD packaging i do not
care how well my 16 core and 18 core
processors that are actually packaged
and unboxings are you know they're fun
but they don't really matter when it
comes to performance so I was getting
ready to test these and I started to
unbox this right here which happens
coincidentally to show up at the same
time the rog rampage 6 extreme r6e which
is the top end
the X 299 chipsets LGA 2066 motherboards
from Asus so I started to get this out
of the box so I can test these
processors and I realize you know this
is kind of a unique experience it's a
six hundred and fifty dollar motherboard
the only other motherboards available
right now the high the most expensive
one is 500 bucks 650 for this one and
it's currently available for pre-order
at least as it's the filming of this
video from B&amp;amp;H so I figured since I got
my unboxing shirt on anyway why don't I
give you guys the experience of unboxing
the most expensive X 299 motherboard
that's currently available and show you
what actually get in the package what
gives Asus the audacity to think they
can charge 650 dollars for this thing so
the first thing when you open the box is
you actually get this extra fold-out
flap asus has been doing this recently
with their motherboards and it says
welcome to the republic since you are
now joining a distinct new government
which is run by asus they have an island
somewhere I'm told I know the details
but I remember I understand if I get my
feet levels up enough then I actually
get to visit or something like that
beyond that we got the motherboard of
course it's a little cardboard packaging
and I'm actually going to come back to
that in just a moment other than that we
have a set of stickers do not disturb
our GU choice of gamers etc they have
sort of a soft metallic sheen to them
which is very pleasant to the eye so put
those up on the door of your bedroom so
that your parents know not to bother you
I guess it's the point of those inside
we have accessories in this hopefully is
where you know you're gonna see a lot of
added value when it comes to this type
of motherboard now all these are in
plastic packaging so give me a minute
and I'm gonna take it all out
all right here's all the accessories and
starting off with this small pile right
here these are basically small screws
that you're gonna use to attach things
like em that to drives and extra pieces
that might attach in extra places
you also got a little front panel
connector header adapter right there for
documentation you have several bits of
that cable mod cables 20% off coupon RG
Cable stickers you can add those to your
SATA cables so you can keep track of
them some more information and IRG case
page which is just the ROG I that looks
kind of cool and exercise case bad just
goes that one's actually not too bad at
all and then of course the standard ROG
users game now other than that you have
all this stuff here starting with this
little box which is basically just your
USB driver and utilities and they put it
in here just so it's a little bit
tougher to lose because it is kind of a
nice small USB brushed metal finish
thing and much better than having a
driver disc I will say six SATA cables
pretty standard the rest of the cables
here all specialized to what some degree
or another so for example you got some
temperature sensors that you can connect
to different reading points on the board
and position on your keys or in your
system where you want them to this is
the adapter cable for this unit right
here which is the fan extension card
allows you to add allows you to add a
bunch more addressable PWM controllable
fan the headers to the to your
motherboard which is very nice an
additional four right there and then a
connection point for the motherboard
there's also additional temperature
reading points on there requires a molex
power input and the cable for that you
have a couple LED cables one is for
standard LEDs the four pin that you've
probably seen before RGB and the voltage
and then of course you have the new type
of LEDs the addressable digital LED is a
connection point for those on this
motherboard there's actually only three
plugs on the board so this one is has
one blocked off so you don't get this
cube mixed up you do need to buy digital
addressable LEDs of a special variety to
connect those so that it's not
compatible but you
both types of headers on the board so
you can use either one this is the dim
not to card which is a riser card that
has 2 m dot 2 slots on it one on each
side goes into a extra slot that's next
to the memory I'll show you that in just
a second so I'll keep that one out
alright from what I can deduce this is a
dippin dot to fan mouths so you can add
a fan like an active fan or something to
mount it you dim dot to slot that's
interesting and new haven't tried it out
before it looks like they have a couple
different VGA brackets that little
holders and actually this one has RG
logo on it was a bit of a bitching on
the side it's kind of cool so if you're
having problems with GPU sag those
should help you out you get three sli
bridges you get a three-way you get a
double spaced two-way and you get a
four-way so they must not have chatted
with Nvidia about the lack of support
for three-way and four-way SLI recently
but you do get a nice rigid rigid black
bracket black finish nvidia sli logo
orgy bridge right there not quite as
fancy as the ones that you buy from them
that have the LED lights on them but
there you go finally a couple antenna
because you do have multiple Wi-Fi
radios on this device 802 dot 11ac and
then of course that cup holding it's
really nice it's not a couple anyway
I'm just gonna call it a POG I like pogs
and here's the motherboard itself this
was actually where I got into when I
decided that I should do this unboxing
video so by the way let me know guys if
if this was a good idea or not because I
kind of debated about it in my head for
a little bit I was like is this
something people would even be
interested in but I can only do it like
before I actually use the board once the
board gets set up and everything there's
kind of a lot less points to doing this
because it's got to be fresh it's got to
still have all the plastic on it like
like this board still has so the first
thing you guys might be able to see well
not really but from your from that's
head at least is it's got a fixed IO
shield on the back so I'm gonna peel
that off of there and that is pretty
nice I must say IO shields can be a pain
in the butt especially if you forget
them so the fixed one is it's sort of a
nutrient that's we've seen once or twice
before in the zenith for example also
from a Zeus but let me just get some of
this plastic off now you might notice a
lot of what looks like silver finish on
the top here but then this actually has
this digital LEDs gone along the edge
and I will hopefully have this all set
up fairly soon so I can hopefully also
give you guys some footage of that but
the LEDs kind of shoot across here and
it look really cool and there's actually
some like texture underneath there that
you can't see unless the lights are
actually on which also looks pretty
pretty kind of unique and cool I mean
granite completely an aesthetic feature
does nothing for the performance of the
board so for anyone who hates that you
know I don't yeah I see where you're
coming from but a lot of people who are
investing in a board like this or
planning to build a system that they
want to make look really good as well as
perform really good so RGB LEDs have
people people keep buying them so the
manufacturers are gonna keep making
stuff with them a lot of people keep
buying them I think I've gotten all the
plastic parts off of this I think all
right so there is the board proper and
as you might be able to tell
quad-channel memory LGA 2066 socket
right there
LEDs again which I hope you can see I
don't even know what all lights up right
now but you guys probably know better
than I do right now because I'm
hopefully showing you the LEDs look
massive power delivery at the top a
heatsink that actually looks like it's
built for air flow yeah this heatsink
actually looks like it was built for
airflow they put some slashes through
there so it's not just a massive block
so it should do pretty good imagine
would do a better job of heat
dissipation due to that 8 plus 4 and the
power delivery up here there's a corner
that has a significant amount of control
points and connection points for higher
end overclocking features such as I
believe this is the ability to turn off
individual PCI Express lanes so if
you're doing multiple GPUs or if you
have a water-cooled setup where you
can't physically remove them that gives
you the access to that start power and
reset buttons as well as clear clear
CMOS and a safe boot a retry this is a
retry and a safe boot button that's for
a higher end overclocking this is a
standard RGB header up here in the
corner as well as a couple 4 pin PWM fan
headers and then you've got 24 pin there
is the special new connector for USB 3.1
gen2 which is really nice to have
there's only one of them on here I was
kind of hoping they might they might
throw two on there but that's what you
get you also get to another four pin fan
header USB 3.0 here as well as over here
and then bottom right-hand corner
typical stuff front panel connectors
more connection points this fan fan fan
and I believe this is a water pump
header right here this is a water pump
Plus 2 right here as well a couple more
fan headers this is the actual digital
LED connection right here so there's
it's it's a 3 pin there's one pin that's
spaced out and then there's again
another standard RGB header that's down
here as well so this one's addressable
can do some cool effects but you need a
special addressable digital LEDs another
fan header there's tons of them on this
board a little supplemental power for
setting up multi-gpu configurations TPM
front panel header and then
I don't know if I showed you this one on
the side there's LEDs that kind of run
down the edge here along the side and
those are kind of tucked in between the
edge of the motherboard and the sort of
partial backplate that's here on the
back that has a RG logo on it which is a
unique design we've seen fullback plates
with a lot of Asus boards recently but
they went for this sort of half design I
can't like it it's cool
and finally for IO what really is the
nice things to speak up here would be 10
Gigabit Ethernet super speed USB 3.1
gen2 I'm not sure if they have 3.2 gen1
on here yet not positive if that's the
thing or not but they've got gold plated
connectors here for the i/o and these
also have LEDs that rest inside them so
you can actually see when the LEDs light
up which I oh you want to plug into for
like speakers or microphone or that kind
of thing
externally mounted cleared CMOS as well
as BIOS preset buttons so that's very
very handy to have as well I guess
lastly we pop in the dim dot 2 here so
with the dim bat 2 in it gives you 2
more in about 2 slots up here there's
name dot 2 right here and then it's also
au dot 2 connection point right there so
a tons of connectivity just defaults
natively for high-speed and VM e SSDs
and that's really kind of what you're
probably gonna be interested in also
e-atx as I mentioned that it's an EI TX
the extra-wide form factor giving you
additional space for activities so there
you go guys this has been a quick
unboxing and a quick overview real quick
before I go tiny Tom Logan over at OSI
3d has actually done a much more
in-depth review of this motherboard
where you actually test it and stuff
like that so I haven't recommend
checking that out if you're interested a
little bit more on this motherboard then
my granted is kind of lightweight
unboxing and quick overview of features
that I've given you guys right now so
I'll post a link to that in the
description check it out if you're
interested
thank you so much for watching this
video guys and again let me know if
unboxings are worth it at all to you
because I'm still doing them here and
there I'm trying to make them only
products they're a little bit more
unique or have something special about
them but that's all I have the time for
today I'm gonna actually get started
testing these processors but that video
is probably going to go up before this
one so you priority seen it
I'm very confused time travel was
difficult thanks for watching guys and
we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
