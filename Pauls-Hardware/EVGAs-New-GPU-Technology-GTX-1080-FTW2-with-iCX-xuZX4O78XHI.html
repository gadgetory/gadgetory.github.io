group of tech writers and youtubers to
their US headquarters in Brea California
Jay and Kyle were both there also Steve
from gamers Nexus and we got a little
tour and it was all quite lovely EVGA
wanted to show us their newest graphics
card series no it's not a vega card or a
1080 TI but a second lineup of nvidia 10
series based cards with icx technology
they are not just slapping new coolers
on existing GPUs though these cards have
completely redesigned PCBs and EVGA has
patents granted or pending for 11 new
integrated technologies in these cards
before I get into what some of those are
though why would Eva GA launch a new
product line in the middle of a GPU
lifecycle like this many of you may
immediately point out to the problems
that they have with the 1080 and 1070
for the wind cards which in a very
limited number of cases caught fire
while on use due to overheating VRMs
limited yet but it was enough that EVGA
decided to issue a recommended firmware
update and shipped customers a new
thermal pad kit if they wanted it they
did not deny that the vrm issue
definitely pushed this launch forward
for icx a little bit more quickly but it
would be wrong to say this is a hundred
percent a reaction to it they were
working on these designs long before
that story broke also to be clear the
icx series cards which will come in gtx
1060 1070 and 1080 variants will not be
replacing the current ACX cards the
issue with ATX cards has been resolved
they're still for sale and these icx
cards will probably cost twenty to
thirty dollars more here is what that
extra money will get you though first
off of course as mentioned they're going
to be available in 1070 1060 and 1080
varieties I have the 1080 for the win at
two right here and you'll notice two
after the difference typical naming
schemes from EVGA to indicate icx as
well as course icx logos on the box now
these GPUs have nine sensors that are
integrated onto the PCB they're
specifically geared to test the GPU
temperature providing additional thermal
probes beyond what's already there in
the GPU itself power and memory areas as
well the new PCB design allows these
sensors to be placed in close proximity
those heat generating components because
especially if you look at nvidia gpus
over the past few years they've gotten
very efficient and in fact the GPU is
not always the hottest part of the
graphics card anymore in fact VRMs and
memory can overheat as well so keeping
tabs on the temperatures for those
critical critical components is very
important now they're going to check and
monitor these temperatures via NFC use
or micro control units and they've
scattered these across the board these
are programmable from my understanding
and they can actually do lots of
different things whereas right now
they're being used for things like
temperature temperature control and
reactive lighting on the board it could
be programmed potentially to do other
things as well another advancement is
asynchronous fans they actually have
separated their fans so that the left
one is primarily there and ties to GPU
temperatures and it's actually going to
be more directly cooling the GPU as well
and then the right fan is actually going
to be tied to your memory and your power
temperatures the upshot to that is that
if your GPU starts to get hot the left
fan will spin up if your memory or your
VRMs start to get hot the right fan will
spin up then of course if everything
starts to heat up if you have a card
under serious load they'll both spin up
but they'll spend at different speeds
and you can actually control them
individually there's two separate fan
curves available in the precision XOC
software so you can have controller in
both of those and tune them to your
heart's content EVGA also redesigned the
base plate and the back plate for this
card they're diecast and they are form
fitted so that they can make more
contact which is a different heat
generating perch of the GPU so they're
going to actually act more as he sticks
now base plates and back plates have
been able to do this to some extent in
the past but Eva GA has expanded on the
design making more direct contacts with
those vital components and creating what
they're calling pin fins just to create
a little bit more surface area on the
base plate itself and that should
theoretically allow more heat to be sunk
into those heat sinks then of course
dissipated as the air flows over it
they've also redesigned the actual
aluminum thin stack itself they have
created what they're calling a half-open
design so they have kind of l-shaped
fins that are staggered nuts to allow
both more surface area
but to also allow the air to flow
through there a little bit more easily
when doing side-by-side comparisons with
the old for the wind design they notice
that they would get actual pushback from
the fans as they were pushing air onto
the fins
whereas this allows the air to flow
through it more easily so you don't get
that bounce-back effect from the fans
train to actually cool the fins off you
also have more direct airflow and it can
flow through the thin holes that are
there as well just just a hole staggered
throughout those fins again more airflow
and according to EVGA is testing also
lower temperatures you're going to get
because of that they've integrated a
safety fuse onto the board as well this
one seems to have limited actual usage
in my personal opinion it's really there
as a worst case scenario fail-safe if
you still solder all over here you're
the back of your your graphics card and
then you try to power it on or something
that few should pop before more vital
components overheat so it could again in
those extreme worst-case scenarios maybe
prevent a fire in your computer but it's
not something that's like you use a
serviceable or anything like that if
that fuse goes you're probably going to
have to arm a the board but it may allow
EVGA to do more recovery from RMA's and
cards that actually do fail now again
just to point out the ACX coolers will
still be around along with the icx
coolers the ACX coolers will be a little
bit less expensive and you can expect
the icx cooler based GPUs to be about
twenty to thirty dollars more so let's
talk some testing next and first I
wanted to share just some of the footage
that I had of EVGA test setup because
they did have some clear cameras there
and they were doing actual visual
thermal load testing basically they had
a fourth awayin card set up right next
to a for the win two card they had the
cameras point at the back both with
cards running at the same frequency
running the same tests and visual you
could you could look at the thermal
readouts until that yes the for the win
two cards are staying cooler we can
assume that is due to the design
integration of the additional cooling
components in particular when you're
looking at the backplate because that is
where some of their issues came up with
the previous for the win card now I was
able to do some load testing myself just
some basic tests running Unigine Heaven
and I found that with everything at
stocked the GP was hitting 71 degrees
Celsius the power was a 70 degrees
Celsius memory was about 72 degrees
Celsius and those are fluctuating within
a few degrees of of each other but if
you look at the new EB GX EVGA precision
x OC software and they've delivered us
an early version of it here you can
immediately see the difference in that
you have GPU temp power temp and memory
temp listed right there they've also put
little checkboxes will not check boxes
but color boxes right next to them and
that is because you can control these
temperatures by simply going well as
long as you get into the advanced
functions which I've completely
forgotten how to get to now here's that
fan curve I believe they need to update
this because the drop down isn't working
properly to select either one but here's
where you would be able to select either
fan and control it again we're working
with the fairly early revision of the
software and then here in the Advanced
tab section you can see that you can
control
still the appearance LED and they it
should add some more versions to this I
think I like demo one it's usually let
it go with thermal LED right here though
is what you have some additional control
over as well so the thermal LEDs are
three separate LEDs that they've
integrated onto the cooler they're all
labeled GP and M so you have one for G
for GPU p for power M for memory so I
started off having it set to follow
batch color so it just means it will set
it up and match with the colors that the
rest of the RGB LEDs are showing if you
want to be matchy-matchy you can assign
it an ambient color so if you just
specifically want to tell each of those
LEDs what to do you can do that as well
or you can do the bit more practical
means of showing temperature color here
with those so as you can see I set a
temperature range for each item and then
it will change the color of the LED so
you can get a quick visual look at
what's going on with your graphics card
without even needing to know too much or
look at on-screen utilities or something
like that so right now it's set to be
blue one that's and when it's pretty
cool and then once it gets above sixty
I'll turn green and then if it hits 83
or more it'll turn red indicating hey
it's too hot right now you need to turn
up your case fans or something like that
beyond that all of the other functions
that you might have come to
and when it comes to EVGA utility are
still there you can still overclock just
as you did before you still have access
to sensors and actually speaking of
sensors you don't still have access you
now have access to sensors as well
though and here's a quick look at that
we can see the memory sensors here these
are actually on the front side or the
the side of the PCB that the cooler is
on and then we also have more sensors
that are arrayed on the back side for
over here for Prime shock five over here
for power that one that's added for GPU
and then of course those pre for memory
and we can see the individual
temperature of all of those if you want
overclock and everything like usual you
still have all those abilities here the
fankerz saving your profiles all that
good stuff so this is an enhancement to
the precision X I would see utility and
it seems to be fairly functional from at
least as far as I've played around with
it so far speaking more realistically
and a little bit more critically though
they're not using new GPU they're still
GT X 1080 GPUs or 1072 1060 whatever the
case may be for the current that you
might happen to get so we're not looking
at a vast difference or really any even
significant difference when it comes to
actual performance I did attempt some
overclocking with this card and I found
that it overclocked just about the same
as most of the other GTX 1080s that I've
tried I was able to hit two thousand
fifty megahertz pretty stable with
everything set to stock I cranked the
fans up to about 2,000 rpms which did
add some noise but brought the
temperatures down by about 10 degrees so
instead of hovering around 70s low 70s
they were hovering around low 60s that
did allow me to get about 25 megahertz
more when it came to my overclocks about
2075 but again we're not looking at
night and day difference you shouldn't
be expecting to get these cards and
suddenly you're going to get to 3 400
megahertz more unless you're you know
doing some really crazy cooling stuff
with them or going crazy with the
voltage of that kind of thing I didn't
go that far when it comes to testing the
other thing that you want to bear in
mind is that again those other cards are
still available so if you're considering
an IC X card you should really consider
what you want and don't buy it
because you're expecting it to be
insanely faster than the other 10
on the market buy because you like the
technology buy it because you like the
concept with keeping better tabs on
which different parts of your card are
getting hotter or buy it because you
like the basic concept that EVGA has
come up with here I asked them very
specifically do you think Nvidia is
going to start taking any of these ideas
that you've integrated and possibly
integrating them into founders additions
or making them standard across cards
they couldn't really comment on that but
I wouldn't be surprised to see a little
bit more active monitoring of the
different areas of the graphics card
especially if it helps keep things
stable by adjusting fan speeds or just
more active cooling when it comes to
those hot spots like VRMs and memory the
other stuff you do you don't always
consider the sides of GPU but god I
thought is going to do it for this video
I hope you've enjoyed it this has been a
quick introduction and some brief
testing of the icy explore as mentioned
I was there with quite a few other tech
journalists as well as youtubers so I'm
going to actually dig up their stuff
that they've been writing as well I'm
sure there's more testing that's been
going on besides just what I've gone
over so I'll post links to their
contents in the description down below
and that I am planning on using this ITX
base EVGA gtx 1080 for the win 2 in my
February build so stay tuned for that
too and I'll be doing some additional
testing with it so if you have any ideas
specific things you want to see me work
out please leave those comments down in
the comment section below thank you as
always for watching this video and we'll
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
