video is a quick one about five power
supplies and sleeving snafus power
supply sleeping snafus that's right this
video is pretty much unplanned the
reason being I'm in the midst of this
power supply sleeping project behind me
and I came to today and it's like I'm a
they're gonna do a video or I'm not
gonna do a video and since this isn't
finished this is kind of the in-between
so I want to explain to you guys a
little bit of this ongoing project
behind me some of the problems I've
encountered and some of the ways maybe
you guys can get around them if you
encountered them yourselves so they're
in the back is the arctic panther this
is my ongoing project to sleeve the
power supply and the other cables within
the case as you can see everything's in
chaos on the table right now I have been
recording this using my camera up there
and be a little bit of time-lapse yes
I'm out in the living room but I
hopefully this will be like the last
project that I have to like commandeer
the kitchen table for because over in
the garage which is back the other
direction I'm getting some air
conditioner I do I do have a guy coming
out this week to do air conditioning at
least he's going to do an estimate and
hopefully get that installed really
quick and then I have a big project out
there to like remodel the whole thing
and I will be documenting that as well
but on to what this video is actually
about which is the snafus and you guys
can look up with that that stands for if
you aren't a military person let's start
off with snafu number one which is the
choice of power supply now this is the
fractal design Newton thousand watt and
it's a very good power supply it's 80
plus platinum rated and a thousand watts
and all that good stuff however there
are some drawbacks to my choice of this
as my power supply for this build
primarily being that it's not a hundred
percent modular so that means I am going
to be sleeping these power supplies
coming out of this and this is the part
of this project I've been kind of
putting off till last I'm also going to
need to probably mod this gap right here
in order to make it wider so that I'm
with the sleeving on all these
individual cables there which there's
about I think 50 of 48 or so that I need
to sleep directly coming out of the
power supply that's going to be a bit of
a job now there are some modular
connectors down here
you can hopefully see there and that's
what I've been working on so far so back
over there you can see some of the work
that I've done including the one like
kind of successful sleeping jobs that I
did right here which is one of my 8 pins
granted they haven't been trained and
set to go how they should but this one
turned out pretty nice so this leaving
itself has been turning out pretty well
but um that doesn't mean that I'm not
encountering setbacks so yeah setback
number one again choice of power supply
if you are doing this I might recommend
going for a fully modular power supply
that way you can just sleev the modular
cables and not have to worry about the
stuff coming out but we're going to do a
full full-on job on this we're still
going to do that all the way but it's
just gonna take a bit more time
here's snafu number two right so here's
one of the cables that I sleeved this is
one of the motors this is one of the peg
connector cables you might notice it's
got one connector on one end and two
connectors on the other as since I'm
using all the existing cables from the
power supply I am NOT like sleeving my
own brand new cables so my intent was to
reuse all of the cabling that came with
the power supply but I did what I
shouldn't have done mangled one of the
ATX connector pins kind of smushed it
first and I tried to bend it back
straight and then it broke so you can
see this one on top there is that's how
it should be when I'm bottom there that
one's broken now since I broke that and
I didn't have the right tools in order
to fix it and this is one of the cables
that goes from one to two I was kind of
screwed over for the time being but I'm
I have found a way around that which
I'll get to in just a moment here and
the way around that is to acquire some
more tools so this is snafu number three
which is that you realize you don't have
quite all the tools you need now a lot
of my hardware and stuff has been
provided by mainframe Kustoms they did
all the sleeving sent over the sleeving
and all that good stuff and they sent
over some of the tools I've been using
including ATX pin remover as well as
this nice little pair of wire cutters
what I needed to borrow and this is from
Kyle is the actual aid actually TX pin
crimper right there because I got a
crimp some pins if you guys didn't
already catch Kyle's video on sleeving
cable extent
check that out he did a really good
tutorial on it but I'm gonna need this
to reapply at least that one pin to the
cable he also gave me the rest of his
gear which includes a molex pin remover
which I don't have some more heat shrink
which I'm okay with as well as the
actual pins themselves so I'm gonna need
to replace the pin the broken pin over
here from that cable and hopefully get
that cable up and running again the
other tools or gear or whatever that I
realized I might need one of them is
right here I wanted some paint so I
wouldn't pick that up I also needed a
soldering iron which I'll come back to
in just a moment but the reason I needed
the paint is because when you're
sleeving cables and they're brightly
colored like this they will shine
through especially if you're using
lights leaving so I'm actually going to
be spray-painting all of the cables from
this black once I get them unsleep so
that it looks nicer and hopefully that
will keep things looking nice and then
finally tool wise I also decided that I
probably need a soldering iron for a job
that I have coming up specifically to
deal with two cables going into one
cable like that one I showed you already
sleeved but I'm gonna deal with the
upcoming ones in a different fashion
using some tips from Mike Landon Berger
aka Lutra Kustoms because he has a bunch
of really good tutorials very long and
in-depth tutorials on his YouTube
channel so using that I'm going to be
using the soldering iron in order to
splice together double/double wires into
single wires and here's snafu number
four which is that I wasn't really
planning on doing any soldering with
this particular project but now I
realized I needed to the specific reason
is because since I'm using actual the
actual cables coming from the power
supply and not extensions some of these
cables have two pins going into the same
plug it's like you can tell right there
with those two orange ones on the bottom
that is very difficult to sleeve and
even if I did sleeve it right up to the
connector here it would not look good so
in order to do this proper I'm going to
have to splice those wires somewhere
along the chain here and that involves a
little bit of soldering and some precise
cutting of the sleeving around the wire
the existing plastics leaving around
wire in order to get it to work properly
and we'll see how that goes because my
soldering skills are not all that good
that's naturally number four wasn't
expecting to need a soldering iron and
snafu number five just because you know
lists of five are good is time that is
right if you can't already tell I've
been working on this for a few different
days granted I haven't been working on
them all day every day or anything like
that but I have already invested a fair
amount of time in this it's been a
learning process since I haven't really
done this before and since I'm hoping to
give you guys at least a little bit of a
tutorial on how I'm doing this and the
techniques I'm using it's involved a lot
of filming a lot of trial and error and
a lot of just kind of preparing for the
worst or dealing with issues that come
up so guys I hope you even enjoyed this
little video on the snafus that can
arise while you're doing cable sleeving
I know it's been kind of short and rough
and all that good stuff but I am working
I'm doing lots of footage and stuff and
I will have some more videos coming very
soon hopefully finishing up the arctic
pan Theory ASAP and then also moving on
to that garage project which I think you
guys will be excited about and I am
definitely excited about it because it's
been a long time coming anyway thanks
