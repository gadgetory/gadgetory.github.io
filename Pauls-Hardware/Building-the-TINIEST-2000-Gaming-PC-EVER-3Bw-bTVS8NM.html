March 2018 this is going to be a very
small build actually probably the
smallest full-fledged gaming PC that
I've ever assembled and it's all going
to be sort of structured around this
case right here which comes from Poland
by a company called doctors aber this is
the century 2.0 second version that
they've done of this it's a limited run
case and this is going to cost you two
hundred and thirty euros which is about
two hundred and fifty US dollars but
doctor zebra has put a countdown up on
their website so it is coming very soon
and if you can stomach that upfront cost
you can put together an insanely fast
computer in a really really small
footprint only about seven liters of
space in this so I'm going to be
installing an 8700 K as well as an RT X
2070 this is going to be the smallest
and most powerful system I've ever put
together the enter max liquid tech to
360 almond liquid CPU cooler is now
available in a special edition white
finish for a clean and elegant look that
highlights the addressable RGB LEDs the
liquid tech to 360 can handle 500 watts
of heat dissipation and features a high
flow rate pump and block premium leaved
tubing anti-vibration pwm fans and sexy
aura belt logo and edge lighting that
you can customize with the included RGB
control box or motherboard software
click the sponsor link in the
description to learn more so the first
decision you have to make building in a
case is small is do you want more cpu
horsepower or more graphics horsepower
because the length of the graphics card
is going to affect your ability to
install an all-in-one liquid cooler in
this case so you can go with a longer
full at fuller length graphics card in
which case you could fit in an RT X 20
80 or 2080 ti even but then you would
not be able to fit the radiator from all
in one liquid cooler so I have opted to
go with a slight downgrade on the
graphics card so for my graphics card I
have the RT X 2070 this is the gigabyte
Mini ITX Edition and it's only 170
millimeters long which means I still
have room for the radiator on my liquid
cooler which is the Corsair h-60 which
has a little hundred and twenty
millimeter all-in-one radiator however
this will still be too thick with the
included fan which is 25 millimeters
thick so I'm going to be using this fan
to cool that radiator which is a Noctua
NF a 12 X 15 PWM fan so fortunately I
already had that on hand that will be
cooling my engineering sample core i7
8700 K so I'll have six cores and twelve
threads of course another potential
upgrade here could be something like a
9700 K or 99 hundred K however given
that the 9900 K has a hard time being
cooled by even 240 millimeter all in one
liquid coolers I felt like the 8700 K
was a little bit better choice for a
motherboard I have the RG Strix Z 390 -
I gaming from Asus this is a higher-end
mini ITX motherboard that actually can
perform a bit of overclocking so I will
see if and they follow up testing video
I can try that out and see what we can
do with our 8700 k and then we've also
got a kid of memory this is a HyperX
predator kit ddr4 I actually had
originally planned to use a corsair low
profile kit for this this predator kit
is not very tall and it is not RGB bling
or anything like that but it is 2 by 8
gigs in 3200 speed so hopefully this
will fit in there if I have any
conflicts with potentially the tubing
from the all-in-one liquid cooler I
might need to swap this out for
something more low-profile but for now I
think it should work
finally for SSDs I have two of these
little m dot two nvme SSDs the Intel 6
Series the 660 P to be specific I have a
one terabyte and a two terabyte version
and I found when I was parting out this
build these are actually cheaper price
per gigabyte or the same price per
gigabyte as 2.5 inch SATA drives so in
this very small build where space is an
issue even for little 2.5 inch drives
having both of these m2 I think will be
a great choice still get three terabytes
of storage and heck if that's not enough
I mean I can still fit a couple 2.5 inch
drives in there so I've got some crucial
2 terabyte guys I might drop that in
again we'll see how things go when it
comes to space but there are my parts
let's get started putting this thing
together
so the first few steps were motherboard
preparations so we went ahead with the
installation of the CPU as well as
getting the back plate for the h-60
setup fortunately that's got some
adhesive on it so it's gonna stay in
place so we go to mount the pump lock
unit it can screw down to those mounting
points and that's one of the last steps
in the process I will be referencing the
Sentry 2.0 manual which is available
online for further steps because there
are some unique steps to this build
process and then of course installed
both of the SSDs one under the heatsink
up here on the front and then one more
is installed to the back and then the
memory so the motherboard is good to go
now doctor's neighbor actually sent me
two of these cases because it's
available in two colors black and then a
gray which is supposed to be the same
gray color that like I think military
ships and planes are so it's kind of a
cool light gray color I actually have no
idea what color is in here it's just
gonna be luck of the draw
so we'll see what color I'm actually
building in it looks like it might be
the black so there is our case I'll set
that aside for now inside we have a fair
amount of foam and then they have
separated out all of the accessories
such as the riser card for the graphics
card and then we've got some pastor
cables for USB 3.0 as well as our power
cable other accessories and brackets and
there's a stands that you can use for
vertical orientation and they've also
included a screw driver which is
actually a Torx screw driver because
that's one of the changes they've made
on this version from version 1.0 is
using Torx screws and also reducing the
number of different types of screws that
they're using overall they used to have
six different types of screws now there
are three what they sent me as an
engineering sample they're very close to
it being the finished version since it
does look now like on the website they
have a countdown to when they're
actually selling these but one of the
final changes they're making is a update
some of the o-rings in there so they
sent me an extra pack of those in case I
need to swap them out so this is a seven
liter case which is very very slim this
way which you can see it doesn't live
you leave you a whole lot of vertical
space for doing stuff but here is where
your motherboard IO shield would be over
on this side is where you would have
your IO for graphics card power is going
to route through to a plug right there
then this is essentially the front
there's a power button right here that
we are going to be mounting ourselves at
the bottom we have a space for some USB
3.0 ports and then they've pre attached
a couple of these panels together with
screws and put rubber rings behind them
I'm pretty sure this is just something
that they've done for shipping to make
sure that if the panels are rattling
around as it's being shipped we don't
get any damage to the finish on the
paint there and they put one on either
side just to hold the side panel on
another thing you might notice
especially if you've looked at the
original century 1.0 is that there's a
lot more of insulation they've they want
to make sure you can accommodate
higher-end Hardware in here and since
there's really no active cooling there's
no space to put active fans on here
except for the fans that exist on the
hardware you install they wanted to have
as much of that as available available
as possible it also means that there are
no dust filters but since this is a
steel case you could potentially add
some magnetic dust filters if you wanted
to I believe we can now just lift off
the side panel like so and here we can
see an additional piece they've added
this specifically to help with some of
the heat dissipation from the backside
of the graphics card since that is where
that is going to go right here is where
your motherboard would sits here is
where your power supply goes which kind
of shows you like that's pretty much
everything another word power supply
graphics card and then we're gonna be
fitting a radiator right here and one
last piece that's removable is this one
right here which wraps around and I'm
guessing by this being removable will
give you greater access to this side
specifically for installing radiators
perhaps but I shall find that as I build
and let's go with the first step which
is going to be actually getting that
radiator so here's our radiator mounts
and I wanted to shift this further down
but I think it'll be okay I have it as
far left as it can go with the mounting
holes that are in this sort of
ventilation area here so that's where
that's gonna sit hopefully there's still
enough room for the power supply power
button is next
let's get me into this well certainly
corner of the radiator I had a brief
moment of panic because I thought that I
wasn't getting the proper line up for
mounting the radiator to this part of
the side panel so I did have to position
it out so we're actually in the second
row of screw holes here which means it's
not quite up against the side of the
case fortunately though there's still
enough room here so I actually installed
the front panel button there power
on/off button first that way I could
then mount the radiator in here to make
sure there was enough space this is just
gonna be hanging loose until we get
mostly done with this build but at this
point we can do kind of a test fit
drop everything in and make sure that we
have enough room so that is where the
power supply is going to go yes it looks
like still enough room for plugging in
our modular cables over there here's our
teeny tiny little gigabytes
RTX 2070 and that is you're gonna fit in
right there and they are very rate about
that hundred and seventy millimeter
length requirement that is exactly how
much space we have and then finally
we've got the motherboard which fits in
like so look at that we're done
almost
we have a we have a very strange
mounting system going on for a fan here
here's the deal this fan is I think 15
millimeters thick I did not purchase
this fan as a standalone not to a sells
these by themselves they're about 20
bucks each that would come with proper
mounting screws I don't know the proper
mounting screws for this because it was
actually stolen from the NHL 12s that I
already have which doesn't come with
those screws so instead I'm using
standard mounting screws here but I've
put spacers on them so they're sticking
out a lot it's really silly but you know
what it's gonna hold it on its going to
get the job done so I'm okay with this
my other alternative would have been to
actually like hack the ends off of some
of these screws I just want to make sure
as I'm mounting this I'm not screwing
down through the radiator
this is all coming together a little bit
at a time I have the main power plug
plugged in for the motherboard as well
as the eight pins supplemental power
over here got some PCI Express power
coming over for the graphics card when
that gets installed just trying to get
everything kind of tucked down in here
there's a very very narrow gap between
the power supply and the motherboard
that you kind of have to write a bunch
of stuff through that's also where
there's a decent amount of i/o including
the USB 3.0 header which is like right
under there so I got to plug that in
there and then route the actual plugs
around here to the front of the case the
riser bracket for the graphics card is
in three pieces so you got a vertical
piece here that comes up out of the
motherboard with a ninety degree angle
and then you got another piece of slots
into that but then these two screws here
are actually holding on a bracket that
goes underneath and that actually kind
of grabs the PCI Express slot right
there and keeps it pretty sturdy so
that's where your graphics card ulm outs
and I'm glad they did that a bit of
reinforcement day
getting these hoses to stay where they
should be and also not kink when you
have to do sharp angles with them is by
far the most challenging part I think of
this build but I think by kind of
looping them this way and then back
around there I can still have free
liquid flow I did have to add a stupid
SATA modular cable because this pump
only accepts a SATA power so that kind
of sucked there's a lot of work that
went into this tiny little PC so I think
it is not ready for the powering on for
the first time plugging the power from
the back I'm gonna realize that the
power supply is internal but I did not
turn the switch on did I oh maybe I did
turn the switch on hold on if I turn the
switch on oh I did turn the switch on
okay so protip turn the power switch on
your power supply on before you put the
side panel on and everything like this
otherwise you'll have to reopen the side
of your case to get back in there to
flip the switch on because the switch is
no longer external plus side though a
system is up and running we just did a
little double boot for me I can see the
fan spinning on the graphics card you
can also just sort of see the Corsair
logo on our own one liquid cooler down
there as well which is hopefully getting
the job done now of all the things with
this build that made me the most nervous
routing the tubing for the almond liquid
core is definitely the most sketchy part
just because there's not a lot of space
to work with especially after all the
cables are installed and you definitely
don't want to kink the cable of an a i/o
like that if you can at all possibly
avoid it so that may mean there's
something to be said for some of the
higher-end almond liquid cores that have
sleeved cabling or cabling that might be
less prone to kinking so maybe keep that
in mind or if you're concerned about
including an LM one liquid cooler and
the system is small maybe just stick
with a low-profile cooler that would
give you a lot more flexibility with
your graphics card - but I think when it
comes to cooling performance for
something like in 8700 K or especially
like a 9700 K or 9900 K you're
definitely going to want something more
than just the simple low profile cooler
that you could fit and it
like this I would also recommend
possibly plugging in your power cable
pass-through because there's a plug on
the back and you got a past that true
through where the power supply is maybe
consider plugging that in and routing it
first because you can get it further
down underneath all the other cables and
it is a thicker cable that would help to
get out of the way and the last thing to
note just when it comes to getting this
system up and running and getting the
side panel back on
I did have to remove two of these longer
screws with the standoffs that were
holding in my Noctua fan to the radiator
and that's simply because they were too
tall and on this side of the case where
there's that thicker area to help
provide some heat dissipation for the
backside of the graphics card it was
conflicting so I had to remove those in
order to get that on so right now it's
only being held on by two screws and
again this problem would be solved if
you bought that fan by itself and it
shipped with its own screws rather than
stealing it from an air cooler that you
already own but guys that's gonna wrap
it up for this video thank you so much
