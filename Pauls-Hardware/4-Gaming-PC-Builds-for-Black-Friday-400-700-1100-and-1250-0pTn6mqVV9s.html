in the description to learn more ok
everyone it is finally time we are
finally ready to invest and buy a new
computer there's multiple reasons why
now is a good time to do that one prices
prices have come down graphics cards you
can now buy for reasonable prices SSD
prices have come way way down that's
super nice even memory prices not as
good as it could be but much much better
than they were six months or a year ago
so I am going to take you through four
bonus builds today this is sort of an
extension of my monthly builds a series
but these are parts lists so if you want
to see a tutorial on how to build a
computer check out my most recent how to
build a computer video and if you'd like
more builds videos of me actually
putting builds together check out my
builds playlists which I will link down
in the description now all the builds
today share some similarities but they
scale up and price starting at 400 bucks
then 700 dollars then around $1,100 and
finally my best all-around system that
includes a monitor for 1250 these are
all mainstream systems so I'm not
looking at crazy high core counts or
really expensive parts I'm just trying
to give you guys parts lists that I
would legitimately recommend if I had
friends who had 400 bucks or 700 bucks
so what have you I'm not carrying too
much at all about aesthetics it's more
about performance and then I'm also
going to start out by going down sort of
some conceptual things about the PC
parts in general so the parts lists
include the seven main components for a
computer which includes a CPU and you
will also need a heatsink fans sometimes
that's included with the CPU sometimes
you can buy it separately you also need
a graphics card that is very important
the only way you wouldn't need that is
if you have integrated graphics which
the lowest end $400 build has you're
also going to need a motherboard the
socket for the motherboard should match
the CPU that you choose and then the
form factor for all today's builds we're
looking at ATX form factor builds should
also match your case so if you want a
smaller case like micro ATX
mini-itx make sure the motherboard you
choose is mini-itx and then also get a
case that matches and then for the most
part you should be able to use the same
other components that I'm sharing with
you guys today
you also need memory it's also called a
RAM random access memory the current
memory standard is ddr4 so all the
systems I'm talking about today use ddr4
and then my recommended memory
configuration right now is 16 gigs to 8
gig sticks so you can run them in
dual-channel mode and that is what all
of these systems I have put together
today are going to be using as well
moving on from there you will need a
case to put everything in you'll need a
power supply to provide power and then
you will need storage via a SSD you can
also use a hard drive but I always
always recommend right now if you're
building a computer use an SSD at least
for your operating system
other than that you might need some few
other parts you will need a monitor to
plug into you'll need a keyboard and
mouse you'll need an internet connection
and a router the router is often
provided by your internet service
provider and you'll need an operating
system such as Windows 10 or Linux I'm
not including these for the most part in
the costs of the builds I'm putting
together today except for the final one
that does include a monitor and then for
an operating system if you want Windows
10 check out the video I posted about
getting Windows 10 on the cheap and that
will get you off and running without too
much expense finally the core components
I'm using for all the builds today can
be summarized as such this is 5 of the 7
items excluding the CPU and GPU you can
get a solid case for 50 bucks so that's
kind of you're starting off standard for
a case you can get a solid power supply
for 30 to 50 dollars you can get a
motherboard for about 90 to 110 dollars
you can get a 2 by 8 gig kit of memory
for $100 right now and for an SSD you
could get a 250 gig one for 30 bucks you
can get a 500 gig one for 55 dollars and
then if you need a CPU cooler you can
get that for about $20 so that's kind of
your baseline costs and then beyond that
you'll need a CPU and GPU which will add
significantly to this total in some
cases but this is your starting off
point and if you're shopping for these
parts this is kind of the ballpark price
you should be looking at so starting off
with my first build here which is only
$400 features a risin risin 320 200g APU
which includes a CPU and a GPU in the
same thing so for this build we don't
need a discrete graphics card so that
list I was showing you that ends up at
300 bucks for the low end at 100
to that for your risin 320 200 G and you
get a full fully functional system for
about $400 all these parts lists I am
using PC part picker to put together but
I'll have links to all the individual
parts down in the video's description as
well as the full lists if you want to
check them out so let's run down this
real quickly our CPU is the 2200 G I've
talked about this apu many times before
it's just a great starting out product
because it's only 100 bucks it's a 4
core cpu it doesn't have hyper threading
or as SMT so you only get 4 cores and 4
threads but that's perfectly adequate
for gaming and it's got integrated vedic
vega 8 graphics i did a video on this so
check that out if you want to get an
idea of what kind of performance you can
expect but for 1080 gaming this is an
excellent excellent solution for a
motherboard I have the gigabyte be 450
horas elite
ATX this is an AM 4 motherboard and a
nice thing about boards that are am 4 on
this platform is that you have an
upgrade path you're starting off with a
$100 CPU you could upgrade that to a 6
core or an 8 core in the future via the
risin and risin two offerings AMD has
available so I love having an upgrade
path and I chose this motherboard not
because it's the cheapest because there
are cheaper be 450 boards out there but
it's got solid power delivery a nice
feature set and if you do decide to
upgrade the system in the future then
this you won't need to necessarily
upgrade your motherboard as well so for
ninety bucks that's a great choice I'm
using the same memory kit for pretty
much every single build today and that
is because it's a hundred bucks its ddr4
3000 and you do want faster memory if
you're going with an AMD build in
particular I recommend three thousand or
3200 speed memory this kit will work
with AMD or Intel setups including rise
and set ups and it's only $100 at least
for the next four days so jump on that
while you can
16 gigs 3000 speed memory for a hundred
bucks again that's why I stuck with it
for the entire build for storage we have
a team l5 lights this is just a really
basic entry-level SSD but it's 240 gigs
which is enough for your operating
system in some games you would want to
supplement this with another SSD or a
hard drive so bear that in mind for the
future but for 30 bucks that gets you
off and running and from there you can
choose a case for a case there's lots of
$50 options I chose the Phantom 410
because it's on sale right now this
usually costs a bit more but any $50
full
sighs ATX case should do you just fine
of course there's lots of reviews and
stuff you should check out I like this
case since it's got a side panel viewing
window it's got plenty of ventilation it
comes with some built-in fans so you
have air flow right out of the gates and
again $50 but the case is the place
where I would say there's the many so
many different choices you can you can
choose that's why I'm saying the $50
price is what you want to go for here
and this is just an example of a case
that works for that price but of course
choose any full-size ATX case that you
like the reviews of and like the look of
as well
for a power supply we have a 550 watt 80
plus bronze certified power supply and
again for most single GPU configurations
this will work just fine no need to
upgrade it no need to worry about it in
the future and it's 30 bucks with a $20
meal and rebate from Newegg right now my
requirements for power supplies are one
that they're from a reputable
manufacturer of course there is
definitely that's - I like all black
cables because we don't like the look of
non all-black cable power supplies and
then beyond that if it's got modularity
that's helpful and then we do want at
least 80 plus bronze certification for
efficiency you can of course upgrade to
a gold certified power supply that will
save you a little bit in the long run
when it comes to your power bill so
these six parts are all you'll need to
put the system together the raisa 320
200 G does include a heat sink fan in
there so no need to worry about that and
$400 I think is a great starting out
price for a very capable 1080 gaming PC
but what if you have maybe just a couple
hundred more bucks to spend where would
you go from there for that I have build
number two here which is only $700 but
has some significant upgrades so we've
gone from an APU that has integrated
graphics to a CPU but not just any CPU
the eight core rise in seven 1700 X so
this has eight cores and 16 threads
massive jump up and CPU processing
capability from the hundred dollar 2200
G and this is only 150 dollars it
doesn't come with a heat sink fan though
so I've included the hyper 212 Evo which
isn't the prettiest but it gets the job
done it's only 20 bucks again I'm not
considering aesthetics very much for
these parts lists at all beyond that we
have the highly rated and recommended be
450 tomahawk motherboard from MSI which
he can get for one hundred and two
hundred and ten dollars same kit of
memory same SSD we've added a gtx 1066
gig
thanks to the glut of inventory that
nvidia is suffering through right now
you can get these for actually $200 for
a six gig version of a 1060 that's a
great deal they're same case and then
same power supply as well and that gives
our total to six hundred eighty eight
dollars and forty six cents if you deal
with all the mail and rebates of course
so sub $700 for this build and I just
I'm so happy that AMD has done what
they've known us rising because an
eight-core sixteen thread processor for
a hundred and fifty bucks it's just ah
that's that's so awesome this is a great
deal even though it's not
second-generation like the twenty seven
hundred and twenty seven hundred ex it
still has a good out of the box
frequency three point four gigahertz and
you can overclock it since these are all
unlocked for overclocking as well we got
to have a cooler so this is the hyper
212 Evo I only chose this because it's
20 bucks there are other coolers you can
get that are gonna be a lot prettier
than this one like there's even a black
version of the hyper 212 Evo but it's
$35 so twenty to thirty five I was like
I'll just stick with this one this will
get the job done just fine for any risin
processor but of course if you want to
spend an extra ten or fifteen or twenty
bucks on something that may cool a
little bit better and look a little bit
better than you're totally welcome to do
that that's the beauty of the
flexibility that's building your own PC
choose your own parts spend your money
where you want to the B 450 tomahawk
motherboard from MSI I've recommended a
few times now it's just got really solid
power delivery for about a hundred bucks
so this is a good sort of entry-level
but also will take you through to the
mid-range and even towards the high end
if you get a higher end CPU and start
dabbling in overclocking four dimm slots
so you can expand your memory in the
future it's got USB 3 and it's even got
a couple MDOT two slots in there as well
so if you decide to add some high-speed
storage you can do that too and then
again the power delivery on this
motherboard is just really solid for the
price so if you get into overclocking
that's something you're going to want to
have graphics card is the geforce gtx
1066 gig from EVGA this is basically the
least expensive gtx 1066 gig that they
have on pc part picker but being $200
when these were selling for 250 to 300
or more just a few months back is a
pretty good price if you ask me of
course they ramped up from there if you
didn't want to get something that has a
bit better cooling solution since this
is the small version that just has the
mini cooler on it but functionally it's
just fine and it's 200 bucks with $20
mil and rebates so there's my choice for
your graphic
card and there is the entire system with
the low low price of $700 I think this
would be a great system for anyone who
wants to get in there get it put
together
of course here as well you'd probably
want to add some additional storage
beyond the 240 gig SSD or you could just
mix and match some of the parts from
these couple higher-end builds that I've
put together here next build is the
$1,075 80 build and this has an 8700 K
and a gtx 1070 total price here is 1070
481 that includes a few mil in rebates
8700 k is my choice right now if you
want to build on the Intel platform and
you want a high end CPU and you don't
want to pay way too much money for it
like you'd have to pay for the 99
hundred K right now the 8700 can get for
340 bucks that's a little bit on the
expensive side when you compare it to
what AMD can get you for six core
processors but this will overclock you
should be able to get at least four
point eight to five gigahertz on this
CPU without too much trouble and it's
going to give you better overall gaming
performance just got better single
thread performance so for people who are
still into the Intel side of things
that's why I included this build as well
but again I paired that up with a cooler
master hyper 212 evil evo just goes for
20 bucks you can't beat the price to
performance and you do need an air
cooler to go along with the CPU beyond
that our motherboard is the EVGA z3 70
for the win this is actually a really
solid motherboard from EVGA used to go
for well over 200 bucks now on sale for
150 it's got three MDOT two slots
it's got surface mounted power and reset
buttons as well as a debug led it's got
a real solid power to power delivery
setup as well so I think for anyone who
just wants a again a motherboard that's
going to get the job done handle
overclocking get you the most
performance out of your 8700 K that you
wants for a hundred fifty bucks I think
you're gonna have a hard time getting a
much better deal than that moving on for
storage I've just upgraded our 240 gig
SSD to afford an 80 gig SSD team on
their l5 light series has some pretty
good deals going on right now but 55
bucks
like I mentioned though there's lots of
SSD sales going on so right now I'm just
looking at SSDs in the 240 gig up to the
one terabyte range and sorting them by
price per gigabytes 11 cents per
gigabyte is what you're getting as far
as the deal on that 480 gig team drive
but you can get anywhere on the 11 250
cent range down here and you can even
get some screaming deals right now in
some one gig drives like this a day to
su 654 a hundred and twenty bucks
Samsung 860 Evo for 130 dollars that's
another great deals well guys what I'm
gonna be doing on Friday when Black
Friday actually hits is another
follow-up video to this and that one
won't be like here are builds I'm just
gonna look at deals that I find that are
really good so I'll be collecting those
and if you find any leave them in the
comment section down below maybe I'll
scoop them up to talk about on Friday
moving on from there though we have our
graphics card the GTX 1078 gig for the
wind this is from EVGA so it's an
aftermarket version of it three hundred
and ten dollars Wow GTX 10 70s thank you
finally it only took like over two years
for your prices to actually get get good
but I'm glad that they're finally
goodness so this is available on new way
again with the $20 man rebate $310 so
that is the option that I chose for this
one but you should very much be
considering especially with this builds
GPU upgrades so for instance on PC part
picker I'm just looking at 10 70s 1070
TI's and 10 80s I would include 1080 T
eyes but stock on those has gone away so
they're really overpriced but 1070 you
can get for three hundred and ten
dollars entry-level 1070 TI
40 bucks more for three hundred and
fifty dollars so if you got 40 more
bucks that's a nice upgrade right there
and finally entry level for our 1080 is
a little little disappointing at $440 I
feel like if you guys keep an eye out in
the next day or two these are gonna be
gone for 400 that's my expectation so
keep an eye out for those as well for
now I think the best bang for your buck
in this range of graphics cards is going
to be a 1070 or a 1070 TI beyond that
though we've got a power supply and here
I've upgraded to an 80 plus gold rated
power supply I would normally have
jumped up to a 650 watt but if you can
get a 750 watt for the same price then
you might as well still 80 plus gold $50
this is a really solid see sonic unit
see sonic makes really good power
supplies and again it meets all the
criteria of all black cables it's
partially modular and 80 plus gold is
kind of the big upgrade here so for 50
bucks I think that's a really solid deal
and there you have it for my rundown of
the just under $1,100
build
here featuring of course the 8700 k and
this system I think again has the most
potential for upgrades so if you wanted
to tack on 40 bucks or 100 bucks
upgrading the graphics card in this
system it will handle no problem but
again if you're looking for bang for the
buck I'd say you can't get too much
better than that right now final system
here is the Black Friday builds full
monty I don't know exactly what to call
this I've been talking about PC gaming
and the things that make PC gaming
desirable and I think those things
include high refresh rate monitors so
going above 60 Hertz high resolution so
going above 1080 and then adaptive
refresh rate so g-sync if you have an
Nvidia graphics card or freesync if you
have an AMD graphics card g-sync
monitors almost always costs a hundred
to two hundred dollars more than free
sync monitors so for that reason and
this build I've gotten with a really
nice assortment of parts that I think
will get you a very nice PC gaming
experience all for about twelve hundred
and fifty dollars twelve twenty three
according to the prices right now
so here I've gone with a risin 526
hundred and this is one hundred and
sixty dollars this is versus the 1700 X
that I used in the second build I talked
about this one will get you a bit higher
frequency out of the box it's two less
cores so it is a trade-off there
although it does come with the heat sink
fan included so all that $460 a good
choice there same motherboard same
memory kit same SS the same case same
power supply so the main differences
here compared to our $700 build is going
to be the different CPU we upgraded the
GPU a little bit and then of course
graphics card and monitor and for the
graphics card we want a fast card that's
capable of doing 2560 by 1440 and it's
got to be an AMD Radeon card so that
gives us the Vega 60 mega 64 or the Vega
56 so right now I'm looking at just Vega
56 and 64 is on PC part picker and I'm
sorting by price and we can find a
really good price on a Vegas 6 Vega 56
right now this is over at new egg and it
is three hundred and forty dollars you
might also note it note that says get
three games with purchase for a limited
offer as well so that adds a little bit
more bonus to you get the free AMD gift
that includes the Division two Resident
Evil 2 and Devil
cry 5 so this is a fantastic deal for a
Vega 56 the one thing you should keep in
mind is that it is a reference design
the blower style design which isn't the
best cooler in the game but for 50 or 60
bucks cheaper than any other comparable
Vega 56 it's worth going with you can
remove this and add an aftermarket
cooler if you want to there are various
solutions for that that's just something
I would keep in mind these aren't
terrible by any stretch but you might
consider something for the cooling
solution in the future or just take a
second look at this list of graphics
cards I'm talking about here and
consider maybe like a Vegas 64 that you
can get for $400 although that's still
lean blower style fan yes it is
here we go you can get an aftermarket
cooler design with the Vegas 64 for five
hundred five dollars still get your free
games but again that's a pretty big jump
up over the three hundred and forty
dollar price so I guess that is really
kind of what you have to do sometimes
when you find a great bargain like that
and maybe that's why they're selling
that for so cheaply then lastly is gonna
be the monitor so using PCP part picker
again just looking at 2560 by 1440
resolution and I have turned on the tick
the tick-box here for free sync support
sorted by price and you can find again
some pretty good deals here's an AOC
model it is a 31 point five inch monitor
which is a really nice size that's
that's quite large reviews on this are
quite good as well so you do get
freesync
refreshed rate goes up to 75 Hertz and
it's got a very large size and the price
is quite reasonable there but you're not
getting the full range I think of like
gaming let the high refresh rate with
this this would be a nice in-between and
also a good bang for the buck choice
I'll link it in the video description
but the one I actually chose to go with
this build is this viewsonic model it's
still 31.5 inches 2560 by 1440 it's
about a hundred bucks more so you are
paying more but it does have a much
higher refresh rate so refresh rate on
this one goes up to 144 Hertz so this
would be my pick to get you kind of all
of the bonus features that you'd want to
have with PC gaming high refresh rate
higher resolution but not necessarily
requiring the graphics horsepower that
you'd need to push a 4k monitor and then
of course free sync and and all that
good stuff
but guys that pretty much is gonna wrap
it up for this video so I want to say a
big thank you for watching and I will
post links to as much of this stuff
I possibly can down in the description
below I will be coming back with another
video on Friday talking about some Black
Friday deals more content coming up
through the weekend as well so hit the
thumbs up button if you enjoyed this
video and subscribe for more of those
videos when they come out thanks again
for watching and we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
