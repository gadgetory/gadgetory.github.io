what's up guys and welcome to my review
of the Google pixel XL I've been using
this for about one month now I don't
review smartphones too often on my
channel so I thought I would use it for
a while before rendering my opinion and
even was able to road test this on my
trip to Thailand which I left for the
day after the phone arrived so that was
convenient timing so if you're
interested in a pixel phone you've
probably already seen or read some
reviews which I will quickly attempt to
summarize for you right now
there's a pixel and a pixel XL I got the
XL version the pixel is smaller with a
5-inch 1920 by 1080 441 PPI AMOLED
screen and a 2770 million power
lithium-ion battery whereas the pixel XL
is larger with a 5.5 inch 2560 by 1440
534 PPI AMOLED screen and a 3450
milliamp hour at lithium-ion battery so
bigger phone gets a bigger battery
beyond that the phones are pretty much
the same so the rest of the video I'm
just gonna be focusing on the XL the
design as many have noted is iPhone like
with a metal slab design curved edges
and a glass panel on the back that's
supposed to help with the wireless
reception for Bluetooth and ear antennas
I found that with no case on the glass
piece also kind of helped me locate the
orientation which way was up on the
phone a little bit more easily so that
was nice I really liked the fingerprint
reader and the placement dead center on
the back of the phone it's easy to take
the phone out find the reader with your
finger and the phone should just unlock
also I will mention that no phone should
have a protruding camera lens on the
back and that is an opinion that the
pixel happily agrees with I don't like
protrude camera lenses this one doesn't
have one the screens themselves are
protected with Corning Gorilla Glass 4
the body is made of aluminum there's a
USB type-c for the plug and you can
choose 32 gigs 120 128 gigs of internal
storage I felt that a 64 gig option in
between would have been nice here
especially since there's no expandable
storage via a micro SD card slots
rounding out the specs internally the
pixel runs on a Qualcomm MSM
996 Snapdragon 820 one chipset which is
a quad-core with two 2.15 gigahertz and
to 1.6 gigahertz cores it has an Adreno
530 GPU and four gigs of ram the OS will
also be the latest version of Android it
shipped with Android 7.1 Google has
already rolled out some updates with
7.1.1
adding lift to wake and tap to wake
functions to the phone so you can
quickly check the time or your
notifications it is Google Bay dream VR
ready as well and my daydream headset
has arrived so let me know in the
comments if you'd like me to do a video
dedicated to just that headset I do like
the fabric exterior it's quite nice and
then of course there is the phone's
camera which according to Google and
many reviewers is the best smartphone
camera available 12 megapixel f 2.0 with
phase detection and laser autofocus dual
LED flash 1.5 5 micron pixel size and
although it doesn't have optical image
stabilization it does talk to the
phone's gyroscope to do some software
stabilization that is not bad at all the
camera does a great job retaining color
in detail and I highly recommend the HDR
plus mode because it is awesome for very
bright or very dark photos and it
doesn't take time to process so when
you're in HDR mode no HDR photo lag
between snaps as it tries to save or
process the image finally there is the
software highlighted by power savings
tweaks and the integration of Google
assistant power savings works and I
don't exactly know how I've noticed the
small things the phone does here and
there such as the screen dimming subtly
and automatically when the ambient light
gets darker for example and I presume
there's a popped amuse a ssin going on
there as well and some other stuff in
the background but the upshot is at the
end of every day I end up with anywhere
from 25 to 40% of my battery life
remaining that's pretty good fast
charging is also there and is nice too
it'll charge the battery to full on the
XL in about an hour and a half Google
assistant is growing on me as well a lot
first it didn't seem too much different
than Google now when you say ok Google
and the functions that were already
there it is beginning to kind of learn
more about me like it learned what my
favorite animal was recently and what my
favorite pizza topping would be I'm sure
none of that can be used against me it's
not incriminating
hey here's an answer from the voice
recognition is great though
as was evidenced just a few moments ago
when it heard me very clearly when I
said ok Google and started to listen it
just did it again maybe maybe it also
looks some of your phones - I apologize
if that was the case but I do like the
ability for Google assistant to have
more of a conversation with it like a
back and forth rather than just saying
do this and then it does that for you to
the best of its ability so let's sum up
my Google pixel excel video and the good
column for this phone is definitely the
battery life power management the
overall speed smoothness and the lag
free experience that you get when you're
using the phone of course the camera not
just the quality of the photos and the
HDR range itself but also the cameras
speed thanks to the soft hardware and
software optimization the camera app
just loads up within a second or two and
you can even easily switch between video
about and photo mode without any delay
which is definitely a big problem for
some phones that might have really nice
cameras that the state takes forever to
load and that always kind of sucks in
the bad column though we do have a few
quibbles the speaker is pretty I don't
say crappy but it's definitely not the
best and it's in a bad spot on the
bottom it sounds ok it's really easy to
cover accidentally though and especially
considering how large the bezels are on
top and below the screen they should
have just put the speaker's there and
had them front facing in stereo that
would have been much better it also has
relatively poor water resistance with an
IP 53 rating so you do have some
resistance to splashes and deaths but
nothing near the IP 68 water resistance
rating of the iPhone 7 or the Samsung
Galaxy s7 wireless charging is also
missing which would have been very nice
to have my biggest gripes personally
though would be the non expandable
storage with no micro SD card slot to be
found and just that it is very expensive
650 to 870 dollars is the range on these
with no contract depending on the model
and storage capacity you get that is a
price that stings even more when you
realize that these pixels have replaced
the Nexus line so there's no more budget
option for people who want the always
up-to-date vanilla Android experience
that I have grown to enjoy so much that
makes me sad one last thing here to
mention is durability while I was
traveling with my pixel XL for 2 weeks I
was very careful with it
but I didn't have a case so nonetheless
I came away with some dings and
scratches to the finish so definitely a
phone case to recover is highly
recommended I've been using Distronic
cases from my past few phones because
they make simple matte-black TPU cases I
am not associated with Distronic at all
but I will post a link to my case in the
description if you guys are interested
in which one I'm using my favorite
things about this phone though are
shining examples of how mastering the
fundamentals of what a smartphone should
be and should do can help minimize any
negatives the battery life is definitely
one big positive I'm all for having a
slightly larger or a thicker phone if
the battery is gonna last all day the
camera as well both than the quality of
photos and the speed with which you can
load up the app to take pictures of
video and of course the overall fast
experience of the phone the pixels
snappiness smooth animations fast app
load time and it also mentioned that
this phone doesn't overheat coming from
a galaxy X s6 edge that I've been using
up till now which was a refurb but did
overheat and would drain the battery all
the time I'm just a big pain in the ass
I couldn't go without mentioning that so
I've been very happy with my pixel XL
thus far and if you can afford one I
think you would be - that is not to say
that there's nowhere to go from here
though as addressing these shortcomings
of the pixel with the next version could
really create a device that aligns with
but the vast majority of people are
looking for in a smartphone that is all
for this video though guys stay tuned
for more videos coming very soon from my
channel also down in the description you
can find links to this phone links to
the case I use links to my store where
you can buy shirts mugs and paint
glasses to get yourself some merch and
help support me
also don't forget hit the like button
and subscribe to my channel if you're
not already for more videos coming very
very soon thanks again for watching and
we'll see you next time we've been
