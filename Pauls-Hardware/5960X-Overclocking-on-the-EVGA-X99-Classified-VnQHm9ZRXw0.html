internet this week you're probably
already aware that intel has launched
their haswell-e line of CPUs including
x99 chipset 4 motherboards like this
EVGA x99 classified i've had the
privilege of having a front row seat for
this launch I've spent a lot of the last
week going over a lot of the new
motherboards that have come out as well
as the CPUs and in fact they have CPU
memory videos already on my channel if
you guys are interested in more than
specs however I still been left feeling
a little bit unfulfilled and I was
trying to figure out why that is and I
realized it's because I really haven't
done that much hands-on actual working
with these new CPUs yet so that's what
today's video is all about I'm actually
going to be overclocking so I'm going to
be showing you guys an overview of this
X 9 and classified motherboard some of
the specs there but I also have a 59 60
X CPU that is installed so I'm going to
be overclocking that as much as I can
today but there is one more thing I have
not just the 59 60 X but I've got a 59
30 K and a 5820k here as well so if you
guys would be so kind as to leave me a
comment in the comment section down
below let me know what types of testing
you're looking to see what these new
processors I know there's a lot of
interest in the 5820k is more of an
entry-level prospect for this platform
so leave me your comments also leave me
a thumbs up if you enjoyed this video
and with that I'm going to move this
little party inside so I can enjoy some
air conditioning while I work and here
it is the EVGA x99 classified
overclocking a intel core i7 59 60 X
as far as aesthetics go the board is
pretty much all black you have some red
here on the e-power logo from the
chipset heatsink which folks may like or
if you don't like that like jays two
cents for example he went ahead and
masked that off and painted over it and
it turned out pretty nice so you do have
options there feel into modding of
course bear in mind that might buoyed
your warranty but moving right along
this is an e ATX motherboard it's a
slightly wider than a typical ATX
motherboard so bear that in mind as far
as your case is concerned another thing
I want to point out as far as case
options for this particular motherboard
is that they've gone with right angled
connectors as you can see here for the
24 pin main power for your SATA of
course but we also have right angled
connectors for things like three pin fan
connectors here as well as along the
bottom edge of the motherboard and a 6
pin PCI Express power right angle
connector for extra power to the PCI
Express Lanes now that's not going to be
necessary in most configurations unless
you're really running like a four-way
configuration that is something to bear
in mind if you have a short case in your
power supplies right below this bottom
edge some of these connectors can't
conflict there so just keep that in mind
and make sure you have a slightly larger
case so you can accommodate for that if
the case size isn't a concern that it
actually does do wonders for cable
management keeping things nice and tidy
in it keeping for it from like really
popping off the motherboard and getting
in the way so that's pretty cool
actually
rounding out the aesthetics EVGA give
you a really nice set of accessories to
go with this board pretty much
everything you could possibly need
including this EVGA x99 bracket cover so
this goes right over the IO panels here
so internally your system will look much
nicer with a bit of brush metal black
EVGA x99 logo there let's talk about
connectivity we have 10 serial ata
revision3 6 gigabits per second ports
all those provided by the x99 chipset we
have six USB 3.0 a couple here from the
header and then four more available in
the back
they've also known a lot more USB 2.0 in
the back so that's great to have I like
having USB 3 and USB 2 apart from that
we have MDOT to support and I've been
pretty finicky actually about my
evaluation of MDOT to placements in
these new mexico motherboards so we have
an MDOT 220 280 slot right here this is
key M so this is going to be
or a key M or M and B M tube drives like
this a data one right here 20 to 80 mins
it's 80 millimeters long so that's going
to fit most of the drives that I've seen
right now but there are different
lengths in the specs so it will have a
nice to see there's twenty to sixty and
twenty to forty two likes in there as
well to provide a little bit more
flexibility they also went ahead and in
an M two key socket over here that's a
little short guy right there and that
one is key e which means you're not
gonna be able to use it for use it for
SSDs but you can easily drop in a nice
like wireless AC card in there and it
being located right here next to the i/o
means it will have easy placement for
those external antennas as well ddr4 of
course is supported across the board on
x99 with the socket 2011 - three CPUs
and for full sized ATX board I will not
accept anything less than eight DIMM
slots so good job EVGA they've included
all eight there so you can start off
with four then you can add four more in
the future if you want to expand your
memory support a little bit more also
supports up to 128 gigabyte memory
configurations right now but really I
think when it comes to extra features on
top of what you basically get with x99
for EVGA s attempts to differentiate
this board they've really pushed towards
overclocking hopefully the rest of this
video will elucidate that a little bit
more so they have an overclocking area
right here including some flip switches
here so you can actually turn off your
PCI Express Lanes extremely extremely
helpful if you're going with a multi
card custom water-cooled configuration
because it can be a real pain in the
butt to remove your cards from that but
you can switch them off here we have a
triple bios switch down here as well so
three separate BIOS sees and you can
just flip the switch to jump back and
forth between those we also have a debug
LED on there which I just like to have
which is also going to show your CPU
temperature when you're in your
operating system got a turbo button
there for automatic overclocking of
course surface mounted power and reset
switches which are super helpful to have
that there's a clear summit CMOS surface
panel on the board as well as one on the
back I owe so nice to have both of those
options and then for the elta tree
points we actually a little breakout
cable that fits on this little header
over here on this side of the board and
that allows for a bunch of individually
connected voltage repoint and then
they've really beefed up the power
delivery so 10 phase all digital power
delivery that's located right up here
for your CPU they've gone so far as to
include two supplemental eight pin CPU
power connectors so that can deliver
up to 600 watts of power to the CPU
which no which no haswell-e processor is
ever going to use but it's there which
means that in dire situations where you
might have voltage drop off you're going
to really eliminate that as a
possibility
another thing that they've done is
they've included 150% of the gold that
you would typically have in the CPU
socket can't see it right now but it is
down there and that is again to help
reduce the resistance and to help
increase connectivity and to basically
give you more stability while you're
overclocking and the last real key
feature of this motherboard the EVGA is
very proud of is their GUI BIOS so
they've updated their UEFI with a new
graphical user interface and hey you
know what I'm gonna have the chance to
test that in just a second alright guys
here's a quick update and I have
everything set up and if anyone earlier
saw the video and went and commented
that I was using a stock heatsink man
and I'm stuck then here is the answer
that it's a swift tech h2 20x it's now
installed and it's doing a great job
also the memory is set to 2666 so I'm
happy to say that the recent BIOS update
for the X and a classified does appear
to be working and I also use that little
overclocking button that they have on
the board or at least apparently I had
it in the overclocking position because
I don't know if you guys can see but I'm
running it for gigahertz right now
across all eight cores and it's just
doing an Ida 64 stress test it's at one
point 1/2 volts on the CPU and I've only
topped out at about well over 60 degrees
Celsius on the core so my CPU appears to
be doing pretty good I'll also put it to
the 125 Hertz traps so that apparently
is what the the overclocking button does
on this EVGA x99 motherboard but let's
see if we can push a little bit further
I don't know how well you guys can see
that but the frequency right there
we're at four point four gigahertz I've
been creeping up from 4.0 kena where I
started it actually wasn't the overclock
button on the motherboard it was the XMP
for some reason that set my my CPU strap
to 125 so I wasn't really sure what that
was but as you can see just from running
for a few minutes here now this seems to
be fairly stable
CPU temperatures have been reasonable
we have topped out it's getting hotter
now so we have seen up to close to 80 on
the max but still pretty comfortable in
the in the mid-60s for the most part so
not too bad
although definitely hotter than
originally I was only getting up to
about 60
alright guys had a fun that night of
overclocking last night actually at some
really excellent results so I wanted to
bring you some of those today right now
here is the overclock that I've pretty
much been able to achieve that's kind of
the maximum now a few things to bear in
mind here one one is that I'm running at
four point seven six gigahertz which is
pretty impressive for this CPU that is
across all eight cores and doing that by
way of the 125 megahertz bus strap
that's available on enthusiast platforms
so that's working out pretty good
memory is at 26 66 so everything's doing
great as far as temperatures and
everything I am running the Ida 64
system stability test I have seen some
maximum temperatures on some of the
cores at just over 90 degrees Celsius
which is a little hot but not terrible
most of the time they're actually
running between about 75 and 85 degrees
Celsius when it's actually under load so
that's that's well within range now a
few things to mention is if I was going
for this four point seven six gigahertz
overclock for full time one thing is
that I would be doing is a lot more
validation and stability testing right
now I've just been using i-264
this has been running for just shy of 15
minutes right now and it's been doing
great but I would want to run that for a
few hours at least I'd also want to run
some other applications some video games
some full system stat tests just to make
sure I hit all different parts of the
CPU and the system to make sure it was
stable that being said what I would
probably do is if I wanted to run this
24/7 is I would back it off a little bit
I wouldn't keep it at 4.76 I probably
back it off to somewhere in the 4.6
range or even a little bit lower just to
keep the temperature down because we
don't really need to be doing that much
also voltage right now is at 1.30 6
which is also about as high as you want
to go I'd say for something more
long-term if you're not using really
exotic or high-end cooling but you guys
are probably interested in how I
achieved this overclock and I did so not
from within the operating system EVGA
does have their elite overclocking
utility however it's still in beta and
the download wasn't working for me so
unfortunately I wasn't able to use that
but I did do everything from within the
BIOS which was very functional and easy
to use and actually also made use of the
three-way switch I was using a couple
different
settings to bounce back and forth to go
back to a stable reboot of Windows 8 for
example but why don't we jump it over
into the BIOS now and I'll show you guys
how I did this so here is the BIOS and
one thing I want to point out by this
version is listed right down here in the
bottom right and I actually switched to
the third BIOS which I have not used at
all all so far that's just to show you
guys that you can do a very easy BIOS
update since it's three distinct biases
on this motherboard it's important that
you go and update each one individually
so I've updated the first two and I
saved this one but it's easy you can do
from within the BIOS you just need a
fat32 formatted USB Drive they'll go
ahead and load this up and reboot okay
so that was a quick digression other
thing I want to point out while this is
loading when I was talking about the
temperatures earlier ambient temperature
in my house right now is about 82
degrees Fahrenheit which is about 27
degrees Celsius so if you guys are
considering my temperature numbers from
a few minutes ago that's something to
bear in mind - ok so switching back to
my overclock - BIOS setting and let's
just take a look at this overall first
off you vga has given you a nice
dashboard up here at the top there are
knots like in advanced in a normal mode
for this this is just the mode that it
boots into which works just fine for me
at the very top you can see your CPU
settings so you can see your bus clock
for example right there you can see the
multiplier right now I'm at 125 on the
on the B clock and 38 on the multiplier
which gives me a four point seven five
gigahertz CPU clock can also see some
stuff appear like this is an eight-core
processor hyper threading is enabled
memory configuration is on the top left
you can see what dims are populated and
how much capacity is in each one so for
4 gigabyte DIMMs total capacity memory
speed right there CPU voltage its
current currently and memory voltage its
current set up PCI Express is in the top
right we have by 16 PCI Express gen3
card installed we have open slots for
the rest of them so you'd be able to see
what's connected there if vrm
temperatures and you see our CPU
temperatures also the actual workspace
is in the lower section here so it
starts you off on the overclock mode by
hitting left and right you can jump back
and forth to overclock memory Advanced
Boot and then for save and exits and
also for you're doing your BIOS updates
but and the overclock setting here
should also point out we have the mouse
that's available mouse and keyboard so
starting off in the overclocking section
we can see again my CPU frequency force
four seven five one megahertz so the
multiplier control just went ahead and
set that to manual and then for the
multiplier here again it's at 38 now I
went with the 125 megahertz beat clock
strap and that is because actually when
I first set the system up I loaded the
XMP profile for the the g.skill ddr4
memory that I have and it automatically
set the the CPU strap 225 which I was
like that's it's kind of weird but when
I put it into the OS I was at 4
gigahertz it was nice and stable that
was like 1.1 2 volts which was actually
pretty good and I was totally like
rock-solid at that so I was like well
that's cool so that's what kind of
inspired me to use that hundred 25
megahertz a B clock strap for that and
that's worked out well for me so bear in
mind that that strap does affect both
the CPU and the memory frequency which
is why the memory is actually set to
2133 right here but with the hundred 25
Hertz strap it boosts it up to 20 60-66
a couple things that they could I think
add here for memory you can do basic
frequency you can set XMP profiles and
you can set the voltages there's no
actual granular controlling over the
timings though so that would be
something that EVGA could possibly add
with the BIOS update in the future
back to the overclock setting though
multiplier setting here is pretty simple
it's pretty much locked in to do all
threads which are all cores which I can
like although you can do individual
limits per core so if you can get a
higher overclock on just one or two
cores for example you can set that up
you can also set the non-turbo ratio
overrides so that will make it so that
when it's not turbo a up to the high
frequency you can change what it will
turbo back down to herbal unter bo2 I
suppose and also do stuff like ring
ratio here's your base clock frequency
settings I have that at 120 5.03 most of
the other stuff I have set to automatic
but for voltage I definitely go for
adaptive voltage you can go ahead and
dial in for example override at first
and set a manual vid that's okay for
setting up but if you're actually
running it for any period of time just
use adaptive it's much much it saves
your power and
sort of thing so you can set your
voltage target right here which I have
at one point two nine seven I bumped it
up a little bit from what I had it last
night and then I actually did at plus
ten offsets to give me just a little bit
more wiggle room which bumps it up to
about one point three one volts total
that I'm running on now the offset
voltage here bare mind is a whole number
but that's actually telling you hundreds
of voltage hundreds of a volt I guess so
plus ten will actually is adding point
one zero volts to this so just just bear
that in mind if you're doing that now
you got some control for like ring
voltage CPU voltage input PCH voltage
and fiber settings it's pretty
straightforward a pretty direct is not a
whole lot of really advanced settings
which I don't mind too much because
that's not something that I I blown a
whole lot I usually go for basic voltage
and an base clock and possibly
multiplier overclocking and advance you
have stuff like CPU PCIe configuration
PCH is where you can go to the state of
configuration for example to see what
drives you have connected you can also
go into PCIe configuration right there
for what drives you have connected for
onboard devices is where you would
control your m dot two sockets bear in
mind you will disable a couple functions
but they do tell you here so for example
if you want to set up your m24s SD slots
it's going to disable USB 3 port 3.0
port 3 which which is it does tell you
that so let's go I also have a hardware
monitoring area right here we can go
over and set up some fan controls
including smart fan control functions
and you can actually go in here and set
it to a few different default fan speeds
at different temperatures so that's cool
they give you a couple different
dividers for that boot of course pretty
straightforward you'd have a quiet boot
and fast food options which I like
there's a lot of speaker beeps that this
thing does when it boots up and being
able to turn those off is kind of nice
and then also there was a cool feature I
wanted to show you right where to go oh
it's an advanced ah onboard device our
ah
oh yeah power management the board has
dark mode enabled which is cool so you
can flip that and that will turn all the
LEDs on the board off if you
want it to be dark and quiet you also
have a RP power savings mode that you
can also turn on which I'm not going to
do because we're not in Europe that's
that's pretty much it for the BIOS and
actually that's that's pretty much it
for this video to guys thank you so much
for watching I know this has been a bit
lengthy er but I really wanted to dive
in and do some hands-on stuff so
hopefully you have enjoyed it this has
been x99 classified motherboard from a
v8 EVGA
I'll put a link in the video description
I've been overclocking the Intel Core i7
59 60 X oh and a big big shout-out to
Swift tech for their work on the h2 20x
they did a fantastic job and it's been
performing like champ like a champ so
far today so leave me a like hit thumbs
up button if you enjoyed it again leave
me comments because I do have two more
CPUs which I haven't even really started
working on yet so I want to know what
you guys want to see me do with those
we'll see you all very very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
