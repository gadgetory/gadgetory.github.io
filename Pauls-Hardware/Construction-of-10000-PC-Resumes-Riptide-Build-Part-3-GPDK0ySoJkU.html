hardware this is my continued video on a
riptide which is my epic $10,000 plus
water-cooled system actually dual system
built in the corsair 1000d case and
actually started this over a month ago
before Computex and i got the system all
set up but then i wanted to water cool
it so I went to Computex visited out the
cool shows a bunch of water cooling
parts they sent them over I have them
all now so it's finally time to put this
thing together the liquid fusion is the
first all-in-one 240 millimeter liquid
CPU cooler fermenter max with
addressable RGB LEDs allowing for unique
lighting effects in the two fans and the
water block the block also has a clear
panel with a flow indicator and there's
an in-line high efficiency ceramic
bearing pump if you're looking for a CPU
cooling upgrade click the local Fusion
sponsor link in the video description
now one of the craziest things about
this build is the amount of hardware
that is gonna be fit inside this case
for an example I have already installed
all of the hardware that you maybe saw
in the initial build video into the case
and I have a complete other set of boxes
with hardware in them here that I'm also
gonna somehow try to also fit inside
this case and who knows if I'll actually
be able to lift the system after that
but before we get started I'm gonna
quickly go over some of the highlight
parts including this cable kit from wise
mods so other than that cable set by
wise mods which was custom designed
specifically for the system and that's
part of the reason I did the initial
system was to get measurements for all
those cables and everything I have a
bunch more coarser ll series fans
hundred and forty millimeters and that's
so we can do push pull up in the top
because it's a very thick radiator and
there's a lot of space up there so we
want to fill it out also got a hundred
and twenty gig MP 500 nvme SSD that is
for the FreeNAS bill at the bottom so
people don't get too mad at me for using
a really nice high-end SSD for the main
boot drive for freenas and other than
that we have all this alpha cool stuff
so to 480 millimeter rads as well as a
420 millimeter radiator you got to Nexis
GPX GPU blocks for the two graphics
cards we have an MDOT two riser card for
the MDOT 2 that's going to go in the
FreeNAS build flexible tubing 16 10
measurements this little pile here which
is all quick disconnects which I'm very
excited about gonna do quick disconnects
for most of this because this is
supposed to be a functional build I've
got the ice block xpx for the cpu with
the thread ripper rack
installer for that we've got the ace
Becker helix 250 reservoirs so two of
those with the white helix in there and
then I got a couple of blue helixes that
we might install depending on how things
look a couple d5 pumps here also from
alpha cool and then if you guys saw the
unboxing video I did with this stuff
plus a lot of the other recent stuff to
drive I was going to try to use the NHL
12s but after reality checking how much
clearance is actually going to be in
there once the graphics cards are
installed I think I'm going to need to
go with this one a low profile and HL 9
a and for cooler and that should give
plenty of cooling as well as plenty of
space for the rest of the hardware
the question is when I turn this on will
it for water hey Mike is is yes you
thinking yes actually if it is working
as a siphon than just dropping that even
without the pump oh my gosh it's working
look at that don't even need the pump
who needs a pump you're using the power
of physics kiss I didn't mention it I'm
flushing the radiators right now it's
always best practice to flush your new
radiators to make sure that any of the
manufacturing stuff gets out of there
I'm flushing with tap water and I'm
going to finish with a flush with
distilled water this is a verified that
our siphon is properly working we'll
just bring out some so I can have this
full tub after you cycling through the
rad I'm not going to turn the pump on
just to be a little bit more
aggressively
it is just sucking the water right
through there
actually it's draining the Supper is
over pretty quickly
now quick flush with distilled water
just using the siphon for this
alright guys we're at the midway point
in the day and it is getting steadily
warmer here in my garage because it's
the middle of the summer but we're gonna
press on even if we're a little sweaty
for now though I've been doing a lot of
kill management - pulling out of the
initial build and reinstalling stuff got
all the wise mods cables installed here
fortunately those were all lengthy
enough that they were able to plug in
where appropriate so that's good I was
able to do a good job measuring those
and of course web mods did a great job
putting the cables together each one of
these cables also has these 3d printed
cable combs on them so you can sort of
push them along of the length of the
sleeping and position and where you want
so they look nicely trained and pretty
also for the FreeNAS system down here I
decided to go with the low profile back
to a cooler for now we're just sticking
with that not too a fan so you guys are
gonna have to deal with the mismatched
coloration there but it's a really good
fan so I'm happy with that I've also got
just enough length on these SATA cables
actually to reach over to the 3.5 inch
hard drives over there and the hard
drive bay but everything here is wired
up and I also made sure to wire up
everything in this lower chamber here
with a 1600 watt power supply is because
now that this is reinstalled like
getting back at those plugs would be a
real pain in the butt
I have decided where our cut-off point
is going to be though today first we're
gonna get the radiators installed with
all of the fans so I'm gonna do push
pull on this 420 millimeter radiator
that's going to go on the top and we're
taking advantage of the Corsair 1000
these removable radiator mounting panels
in case I missed it in the first videos
I do want to point out the front panel
here has two 480 millimeter heads this
panel has a single 1420
but you can't swap those panels and
coursera actually also sells different
ones so if you wanted to do two for 80s
across the top you could as well
I believe they have one with two 200
millimeter mounts on there too but we're
just sticking with what it shipped with
so we're gonna do push-pull here and
then we're going to do just push on the
front we're just quickly demonstrating
that it's important to reality check the
location and orientation of your
radiators before you not the fans
because I mounted all the fans first
didn't realize they were backwards I had
the cables on the round side flip them
we screwed them all back in again there
guys though yeah that's got to go on top
so third time mounting these three fans
to this red
so we ran into a potentially like let's
word I'm looking for here
catastrophic that's good I like it
wasn't the word I've seen enough but
let's go with that so we encountered a
potentially catastrophic conflict here
which is that our top four and twenty
millimeter radiator is barely barely
conflicting with our big fat four
hundred eighty millimeter rads ago on
the front we were able to kind of shift
this back a little bit by loosening the
screws on that the top middle fan here
is no longer actually screwed in because
of that because we offset it enough that
you can't screw it in there really
appreciating the rail systems a lot of
cases have on the top to the lay you a
bit of leeway to move those forward and
back but because this is designed to be
centered and also has separate holes for
the exhaust for all the fans we really
can't shift it too much but we still
went ahead amount of the 40 Reds on the
front bracket here and that actually
took quite a bit of work to get all
those screws lined up and screwed in but
I'm gonna see if this'll mount I'll just
have to wedge it in there let's give it
a shot that's the bottom Wow yeah this
by itself is freakin heavy thanks ooh
that's going
okay then who made it fit all right it's
not hey you know it's definitely gonna
get a grind up there if it needs to be
pushed in and pulled out in the future
but I think it's just barely enough now
a bonus feature both jurors come out
together
kind of
all right guys the GPU blocks have been
installed on our two and eighty eyes and
I think and they're looking pretty nice
wasn't too difficult to install there
were a couple different stages to it but
it's all laid out pretty well in the
instruction manual from alpha cool
there's some thermal pads you gotta put
on there but I do like that this is now
a 2 slot card or maybe even a little bit
less than a 2 slot cards so I think to
finish off this video because it's
already much later in the afternoon than
we were anticipating I'm going to
finally install all my PCI Express stuff
to graphics cards as well as my 10
gigabit NIC as well as my 400 gig and
via me SSD from Corsair
all right guys this has been a very long
day and it's been pretty hot fortunately
the ACS kept up okay so we haven't been
dying in here but as you can see I have
so much hardware installed in the system
now it is looking so good so serious
like it's it's actually here to get some
work done because that's really been my
ultimate goal with this build has been
to make a system that's crazy and over
the top but I actually want to use it I
actually want it to be functional so I
plan to do follow-ups with the system
down the road to say like hey I've been
using it for this this and this here's
how that's been performing finally got
everything installed both graphics card
the NIC got the PCIe 400 gig SSD in
there
I got the waterblock on the thread refer
1950 X all the members installed so
really all that's left is the water
cooling loop I need to figure out
mounting solutions for the two
reservoirs and the two pumps that are
going to be over here
I need to figure out what I'm gonna do
with the terminal connection for the
GPUs out here and the plan is to do one
loop for the CPU that's gonna go up to
the 420 rad on the top and then one loop
for the two GPUs it'll go to the 240
Reds in the front which is obviously way
way more cooling than is actually needed
but again the also goal is for me to be
able to run the fans in the system at
very low rpms but that's all for this
video guys I really hope you've enjoyed
it
this has been part three of the riptides
build and the courser 1000 d and let me
know what you guys think let me know if
you have any suggestions for me moving
forward because this still has some more
work to be done in it but hopefully just
one more video to get the water cooling
stuff in it and that'll be done with the
builds and then we'll do a follow up
after that with some actual performance
testing thank you guys so much for
watching this video though hit the
thumbs up button if you enjoyed it and
of course subscribe if you want to see
the finale of this system build oh and
don't forget I have a little giveaway
going on with the unboxing video I did
just a few days back so check that out
too if you're interested in you haven't
done it already thanks again for
watching guys we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
