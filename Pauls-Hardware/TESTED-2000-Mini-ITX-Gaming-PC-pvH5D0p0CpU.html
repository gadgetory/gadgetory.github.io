description for more information what's
up guys welcome to false hardware and
today's video we're at long last I will
be doing some testing some overclocking
some benchmarks and performance on my
February bill this is a mini ITX system
it's designed to be fairly small not
super compact that's relatively small
its mini ITX build of course and then
it's meant to also be very powerful so
we have a 7700 k also have a gtx 1080 in
there i also have all SSDs as far as the
storage in there and of course i have
this pretty fancy looking lammle pc q 37
case aluminium and tempered glass and of
course i have some stuff to talk about
because if you watched me actually build
this thing it was a time-lapse there was
no talking at all it was all just
pictures in video so why don't we start
with a little bit more feedback on the
build itself i wanted to give you guys a
better idea of the actual size of this
of this thing which is i don't know it's
it's between small and large for a mini
ITX case let's put it that way this is a
fan text m to evolve in the back i'll
set it right here next to the cursor 380
t which is also on the large size for a
mini ITX system you can see it's 380
just a little bit taller and a little
bit fatter but the q 37 here is again
like it's not tiniest for sure like if
you compare it to a note 202 or
something like that but I think the
trade-off is that you can fit full-sized
desktop parts in it so you can fit the
two forty eight to forty rad at the top
there's also a lot more space for cable
management in here than you have in
something like a note 202 and I'd say
for a larger size build something you
want to show off because of course as
you're seeing all the reflections of
tempered glass I think it works pretty
good these are the tiny screws that hold
the tempered glass side panels on and
once those are removed tempered glass
itself releases front piece will kind of
rest in place because it sucks under
this little piece right there but beyond
that they just
Appl oh this is a bit of a has a gray
glass to it so it is sort of slightly
shadowed shadowy whatever tinted I guess
would be the right word for that then of
course once we get that off you can see
right inside like that let me get this
other side off too so this piece here is
more of a challenge to sort of get on I
mean it's not like it's completely
impossible anything it's just a little
bit more difficult I'm sort of holding
just holding it in place right now and
it just sort of sits on the flip at the
bottom and then those four screws all
hold it in place so again it's like not
the best mounting situation for tempered
glass that I've ever seen but you know
once you get it on there it stays in
place okay
speaking of tempered glass on the front
and the side here means a combined with
the fact that we have lovely a brushed
aluminum for the rest of the
construction top panel here inside panel
here means there's no real good way to
like hold this system like if you need
to pick it up or something like that
because at the base here this this sort
of I don't know area at the bottom goes
around the entire bottom so there's
nowhere to kind of get your fingers
under there so I found myself just sort
of putting my finger on my hand on the
corner tilting the case up so I could
get my hand under the bottom and then I
would be able to kind of lift it and
move it however I needed to
so that was getting things done but this
seems like the kind of case you're not
going to be taking on the go with you
you know like a 380 T over here with the
tandel you're going to want to get it
set up put it where you want it to be
and then probably leave it there now you
may have noticed when I introduced all
the parts for the original build video
that I had a different graphics card I
had the icx version of the EVGA 1080 for
the win to swap that with the founder's
edition GTX 1080 because this one is the
length wasn't an issue it was going to
fit lengthwise is actually the width how
wide the PCB and part of the cooler was
on that a VGA card and I don't have that
key right now but I can demonstrate at
least with this gigabyte card which is
that if you have extension right here if
the Y card sticks out this away then
you're probably going to run into some
conflicts with this case because there's
not a ton of clearance when it comes to
that direction that and you're also
going to need to
it's right here fitting it in that was
classic conflict that extended PCB
didn't allow me to tuck the graphics
card back in here and just get it to
seat properly with the motherboard so
yeah go with a smaller graphics card I
guess is the answer to that and just
bear in mind no not that graphics cards
I guess but design Edition is actually a
good choice for a system like this
because it's got sort of an enclosed
cooler I'm just going to eject a lot of
the warm air at the back of the case and
also it's kind of nice because you do
have what would be effectively your
intakes down here at the bottom now
another thing that was pointed out in
that video is that I pretty much have a
completely negative pressure system
going on right here I put these two rear
eighty millimeter fans from Noctua as
exhaust these tops exhaust fans from the
h100 IV to are also set up as exhaust so
basically everything is pushing air out
the top and out the back what that means
is negative pressure so we might
potentially have dust issues in the
future if I ran this long term like
along some of the edges here but it does
also mean that the primary intake which
is going to be down here at the bottom
is hopefully where most of the air is
going to be coming in from so along
these grooves right here and would go in
that way and then pulled up through
there by the negative pressure I did do
a bit of temperature testing with this I
didn't do I wouldn't call it extensive
but some temperatures are just fine and
I think switching these are like
flipping those around could maybe like
equalize the pressure in here a little
bit better but then you'd be looking at
no filter no air filter for these back
here whereas there is an air filter down
here on the bottom which is held on by
magnets so there you go and I would
imagine for maintenance on this thing
you just tip it over like I've done
right now here with probe or dust repair
I click down here at the bottom you can
just pop that off and clean it out a
couple final things to point out for the
build one is where all the pass throughs
are here there's a couple to top there's
a couple on the side there's a couple
more done at the bottom at least
relative to the motherboard tray they
all have these covers on them like this
one right here with a couple Phillips
head screws holding them in place so you
I really try to minimize the number of
those that I actually removed so there's
the main
that I have most of the stuff coming
through for the motor board here and
then I did I removed this one up here to
these at the top are difficult to work
with at least if you have the drive cage
in the drive cage on the opposite side
basically means that the majority of
actually both of these panel covers is
blocked so you kind of have to feed
everything right up to the corner back
there also while it is nice to be able
to individually remove those panels you
know so you can cover the ones you're
not using would be really nice to have
grommets behind them because I'll be
honest when when I'm just looking at
kind of that bear pass-through right
there I mean it doesn't look terrible
it's got it's got a bit of a plastic
ring around edge but it doesn't look the
greatest either and then finally I would
like to give Liam leave some some props
for their panels here at the top and the
rear panel I'm sorry the top panel and
the opposite side panel these are just
incredibly easy to remove it's got a
little lip back there and really just
grab it and tug pops off just like that
now you can see that other desks will
appear on the top as well so there's
your brush metal panel for the top
putting it back in place is easy
pushing back down on it like that and
then the opposite side panel moves in
exactly the same way and that reveals
the opposite side where we can see our
VX 500 as well as our course your SF 600
parts place so tiny so cute Lucas tiny
it is fixed under a power supply but
it's been doing a great job
Carn everything so far perfectly
adequate for a single GPU system with a
GTX 1080 like this one right here and
look it's even got a zero fan mode I
looked at cabling is also all black
which looks pretty nice too and although
this isn't my best cable management work
everything is tidy enough and there's
still plenty of room allowed deck for
airflow
yeah and that pretty much everything
else is installed over here on the front
and I would like to point out that I did
add the USB cable for the course h100 IV
- that's going up there and then around
the back and then plugging in via the
USB 2 port there is USB single USB 2
header on here so that worked out for
that and everything else was connected
so the only other things that I had to
add that weren't in the list of products
that I initially listed off was a couple
fans letters so since this board
they only has a couple for pin fan
headers I did use fan splitters so I
could connect well the the Corsair has
one kind of built-in 9/8 a fan splitter
so I could connect both of these aiding
the limit eighty millimeter Noctua fans
to the same header on the board now
let's move into some actual testing and
what I did was I overclocks the snot out
of the CPU and the GPU and then I ran
benchmark tests so that's pretty
straightforward I don't say over the
clock that's not out of because this is
the 7700 K I've used and several other
builds already and it is a decent
overclocker but it can't really get too
much past about 4.9 gigahertz with
reasonable voltage so that's what I ran
it at actually started off being a
little bit more conservative I had it at
4.8 gigahertz and I did about 30-minute
burn in test and when I did that with I
264 was heading about 80 to 85 C MAX on
the CPU mid to 6:00 mid-60s to maybe low
70s average under load with that
synthetic burnin test so that's like a
worst case scenario for the CPU I
figured I probably had a little bit more
thermal Headroom after that and since
the CPU I knew already could hit 4.9
gigahertz I thought why not try to just
bump up the voltage a little bit because
those initial tests at 4.8 didn't add
any voltage and I was running the fans
at least was the cooler master software
the link software that you can use to
control the H 100 IV - in silent mode
when I jumped up to 4.9 since I had to
add some voltage I also changed the
profile from silent to standard mode on
H 100 IV - which does add a little bit
of noise but also improves the cooling
performance added voltage in the form of
plus 95 millivolts at least according to
the as rocky UEFI using a voltage offset
mode that led to 90 degrees Celsius max
temperatures on the CPU using I 264
synthetic benchmark tests and that was
after about 20 to 25 minutes under load
of course I could have let it run longer
to reach full on thermal saturation
point with the liquid CPU cooler but I
thought that was enough to give me a
ballpark and it's probably not going to
get too much worse than that mid 70s to
low 80s average was what I saw is only
spiking up to about
90c though when it was actually looking
at the running temperatures with the
test on it was in the mid 70s to low 80s
on average range so that's adequate it's
obviously not the best of what you would
expect when you're using a closed-loop
cooler like this one with a larger 240
millimeter radiator but definitely
within range of what I wanted and given
that we're in a smaller form factor
system was not quite as much airflow I
found it to be again perfectly adequate
after that I overclocked the GPU ended
up adding plus 240 megahertz to GPU
clock and plus hundred and 25 megahertz
memory clock maxed out the power targets
and it has a fan profile at standard I
did not add fan speed and that led to
about 60% max fan speed well under load
with my overclock the GPU base clock was
1847 loose clock was 1974 it was peaking
at 2113 which is pretty impressive but
after the temperatures creeps up its
averaged out to about 2025 under load
and that's after thermal saturation
point is reached and the max temperature
was 85 degrees Celsius again a little
bit warmer than what I would what I
would hope for for a 1080 overall but we
are using the founders Edition card
which does have the benefit of ejecting
more of the hot air out of the case and
85 C with an overclocked card is not
terrible and it was not throttling at
all at least once it settled down to
about that 2025 point so all that said
it's performing pretty well so far and
I'm happy to say that the overclocked
I've achieved on the CPU and the GPU
aren't really that much less or even
significantly less at all than what I
was achieving on an open test bed or in
a full-size case so that's pretty cool
next up there's some noise testing
because we have this we want to hear
what this sounds like so let's start
with idle
so I will is obviously pretty quiet
let's move over to the CPU test so this
is with the corsair h 100 IV - doing
everything it can to keep the cpu
temperatures down while running the
i-264 stress test let's listen to that
and then we have a gaming audio test
this is using Unigine heaven to put a
heavy load on the GPU not quite so much
on the GPU and this is of course with
the GPU overclocked as mentioned
so the gaming performance is quite solid
that is what we would expect with the GT
X 1080 paired with a 7700 K especially
when overclocked I wanted to show a
little bit of the SSD performance since
I do have the P 600 nvme SSD in here
from Intel it's going to be faster than
a standard SATA SSD but it's difficult
without setting up a more strict
side-by-side benchmark performance
comparison to give you guys a real idea
it definitely seems a little bit peppier
than a standard SATA SSD does but since
SSDs are already pretty fast as it is
when it just comes to responsiveness I
thought I'd do a quick boot tent since
it does seem to boot pretty fast so I've
shut down this is using Windows 10
hibernate and I just hit power and maybe
there's a maybe I'm timing this or maybe
you guys are timing this at it maybe
you're just watching the video but
hopefully the boot process will happen
it's that that that's pretty fast boot I
got it I got admit that's probably one
of the fastest booting systems and I
want to get even setup fast boot in the
UEFI settings so I could even do that
but let's move on to some final thoughts
obviously being a mini ITX build this is
on the smaller side but it's not as
small as you can go there are some very
small footprint systems that you could
set up that would be significantly
tinier than this however it still fairly
diminutive and it still stays within a
pretty small footprint so if you needed
to move it around or if you needed to
take it on the go with you it's not
terribly difficult to transport and it's
definitely a lot more lightweight than
say a full size system with a bunch of
hard drives in there I like the
diversity and flexibility of the system
not just for gaming with the 77k
overclocked and the 1080 but also the
fact you got 32 gigs of ram and on all
SSD storage array means that you could
easily use this for video editing or
that sort of thing as well
I like the finished product just as far
as the looks goes it's pretty
nice-looking with the tempered glass and
the brushed aluminum
and I thought everything actually worked
very well as far as the color scheme
goes mainly black and silver with a
little bit of accents the GTX logo of
course was always going to stand out on
the side there in green but we did have
just some very light white LED accents
on the Corsair products the Dominator
Platinum's and h100 IV - which I thought
looked nice without being all gaudy and
out there like you know RGB LED systems
like I've got behind me over there I
also wanted to point out the motherboard
here for PA's rock doing a fine job as
rock motherboards you know sometimes
they get a bad rap but this one might
look it's got dual Intel mix got Intel
Wi-Fi it's got a crap ton of USB 3.0 on
the back it's got a ps2 ports which and
I just wanted to point that out but even
when it comes to overclocking I was able
to pretty much achieve the same level of
performance and overclocking to 54.9
gigahertz with this CPU that I was able
to with my Maximus 9 hero full-size
board back there behind me so that's
very cool - so all in all I think it's a
great build for anyone who's looking for
a high end mini ITX gaming system with
advanced capabilities for other things
as well especially if you're gaming
about 1440 maybe if you're considering
ultra-wide like 30 40 by 30 440 by 1440
you can even push it up to 4k depending
on the games that you're playing and the
system settings that you're using or I
mean if you really wanted to juice the
system a little bit more just swap that
1080 out for a 1080 Ti
that's all for this video though guys I
hope you've enjoyed it this has been my
February build of the month although it
is already mid to late March don't worry
my March build is coming also very soon
that's going to be a rise in system I
finally have all the parts for that so
I'm going to be assembling that hits
thumbs up button and let me know if you
enjoyed this video and also links to all
