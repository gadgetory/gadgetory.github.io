you by Corsair enter max deep cool and
cooler master all right guys I don't
know if you can tell from the coolers
behind me but I am now at deep cool so
let's start over here with some
all-in-one liquid coolers this is the
deep cool castle and I actually showed
this to you guys if you watched my
Computex coverage back in June 2018 this
is well received because it's it's got a
cool look it's got sort of a taller pump
/ block right here but so that allows
you to sort of a 3d look looking down
and there beneath the gamer storm logo
to see your addressable RGB lights but
the main upgrade here is that this is a
360 mm meter version so 3 by 120 these
are becoming a lot more popular and more
in demand and I think it's largely
because of the existence of the 99 wk
but this cooler is rated for 280 watts
of heat dissipation and it's also got
support for a 16 point seven million
colours via the addressable RGB x' both
on the pump block as well as on the fans
that are included a couple other nice
things about this cooler is that it has
support for thread Ripper so you pretty
much have support for just about any CPU
you might want to install it onto and
then this version since you might have
lots of maybe addressable RGB devices to
connect up comes with an addressable RGB
splitter basically six devices can be
connected to this it gets power via SATA
so you can take your a RGB signal and
control multiple devices not just the
four included with the castle 360 the
castle 36 the RGB has an MSRP of 170
dollars and it will be available later
this month next is the captain 240 Pro
this is another one that I already
showed you guys back at Computex but
major difference here you'll note that
they are boldly stating that this never
leaks beyond that bold statement you've
got 240 millimeter all in one liquid
cooler duel fans addressable RGB the
captain style pump and block combo unit
the deep cool has direct with a lot of
the different coolers over the years and
I can't tell you guys exactly how this
works but there is a pressure release
valve on the side of the radiator here
so when the liquid inside warms up and
expands or cools down and contracts that
pressure release valve will expand and
contract along with it a lot of the
pressure to release that reduces
pressure on other joints within the
all-in-one loop and that means you
should never have any leaks with this
all in one liquid cooler deep cool
promises over here we have a demo with
the I 999 hundred K you may note that it
is running at 5 gigahertz with a core
voltage of 1.3 for four right up there
which is it's going to generate some
heats it's being
and the temperatures are getting up into
the maybe 70s maybe high 80s heading 90
here and there but what is actually
cooling this device it's running the
i-264 system stability test by the way
also which is gonna make your CPU get
hotter than most applications will and
this set up is being cooled by an air
cooler the Assassin 3 this is a
substantial cooler it's quite large but
it's actually not quite as large as you
might expect because it's only hundred
and sixty-five millimeters tall it's 140
millimeters wide it uses hundred and
sixty-five millimeter fans and these
fans are also custom designed specially
designed to work with this cooler it's
all about air flow and direction to get
the maximum amount of cooling out of the
fins it's got a couple what they're
calling spoilers up on the top and this
is just to take any airflow that's going
over there
keep it moving across the actual fins to
dissipate more heat the fans themselves
are also specially designed to reduce
vibration they've got extra notches
around the edges too actually they're
actually unevenly spaced and that helps
reduce vibration overall they also have
specially designed heat pipes in here
I'm not going to explain how they're
specially designed but they're better
they use they combine to keep heat pipe
technologies into one to make a better
heat pipe and also they're using a
solder reflow technology to actually
connect all of the metal components in
in there and that also helps improve the
heat dissipation and of course was a big
fat air cooler like this you might be
concerned about RAM clearance you can
actually fit 30 millimeter high ram in
there so right now they're using Crucial
Ballistix stick which is a pretty
standard memory if you're not putting
RGB lights or anything like that on top
of it you can actually have 55
millimeters of high clearance and that's
because of they made a little notch cut
out right there for you
finally you're gonna get a gamer storm
badge which I can't show you but I can't
show you this specialized screwdriver
that's also included because you might
need a screwdriver of a specific length
to mount this cooler that's not uncommon
but this is a nice quality screwdriver
now again if you watch my Computex
coverage you might have seen the matrix
55 there's a new version of that over
there and that's been a very popular
case because it is a very functional
case and it's not all that expensive the
new ones only 65 bucks but more on that
in just a second they're upgrading and
making a new version with the Matrix 70
which is right here MSRP for this one is
$70 it's gonna be available in April
2019 and bear in mind that the fans you
see included in all these cases here are
not included with the case that's part
of the way they're keeping the cost down
but that lets you choose your own fans
to use they will ship what they sing
120-millimeter non RGB fans so you have
some airflow out of the box and this
case actually has some pretty cool
features for a seventy dollar case for
example the front three fans here are
mounted to a bracket you can remove that
bracket individually so that's going to
help you either just mount the fans up
themselves especially if you have a
bunch of addressable RGB cables to plug
in but then of course you can also
remove that if you're going to mount a
radiator that's a very convenient
solution to have this case supports 340
millimeter fans in the front 340
millimeter fans in the top or if you're
gonna do radiators it can do 360 rads
and either of those positions and then
if you look on the side here you might
notice that the power supply shroud is
kind of unique it's hard to see from
here because the graphic scribe we're
using isn't lit up down there but this
power supply shroud is actually tempered
glass
so it'll provide some reflection for the
RGB bling that might be on your graphics
card which is kind of nice but then it
also can just be removed so that'll give
you access down to the cable management
and also this to drive bay Kage that's
down there the drive bay Kage can be
shifted forward or backward it can
actually fit 220 millimeter fans for
intakes down at the very bottom
optionally of course and that's gonna
depend on clearance from your cables
from your power supply and everything
but I give you that option and then if
you do include fans down there for
intake you can remove this tempered
glass piece and that will actually allow
the air to go through
we have dust filters included as well
there's one on the back of that's a
front fan bracket there's one included
on the top these are magnetic so they
can just pull off and put them back on
the power supply is also handled with
the dust filter at the back and then you
might have noticed this very unique
graphics card sag reducer thing here
that's what I'm calling it deep cool
calls it the GH 0-1 RGB it's only 15
bucks it's gonna be available next month
and if you're looking for a GPU sag
combating solution that also lights up
RGB well they've got you covered so it
just has a stand down there at the
bottom just above eeeh the thumb screw
right there
lines up with your graphics card and
also provides some cover for the cables
so if you're very embarrassed of your
powers like if you got ketchup and
mustard cables going up to your graphics
card or something I'll cover it up and
give you some RGB accents you guys may
have seen the deep cool MF 120 fans
before those are also RGB and you can
control them but you have to use an
and deep cool got some flack for that so
they've came out with this one the MF
120s which you can sink and plug in
directly to your motherboard so you have
a computer control lights on it with
that these are already available so you
can buy them now next up is mokuba this
is actually the magic cube in the cube
for shorts this is the mokuba 550 and
it's available in a couple different
varieties we have a black finished one
over there they have a white finish one
over here that's gonna be a hundred and
ten dollars for the black version and
120 dollars for the white version so if
you can't sell deep cools going for a
much more minimalist look with this case
so you have a very clean front and a
very clean top the side panel also I
think is unmount Abul and replaceable in
a very good way
it has magnets at the top and a little
aluminum bar across there so you can
grab that pull it out lift it off very
good mounting and dismounting method for
a side panel especially tempered glass
and there are some subtle accents when
it comes to branding so you've got a
gamer storm logo at the very bottom
there but it's white on white so you can
only just barely see it also a gamer
storm on the aluminum crossbar here as
well so overall a very clean looking
case though and you get tons of support
for fan mounts here too because not only
can you mount fans to the front here and
it does actually have a decent amount of
gap there to allow air through they said
it's only about a 25% reduction in air
flow but this panel versus having no
panel on there at all but since the top
is blocked off by that flat top panel
you actually have some perforations on
the other side I really like how they
look they're kind of little squares or
diamonds however you look at it but
that's gonna allow air to flow out that
direction and for that reason you can
have a 420 mm o meter radiator mounted
right here and a 360 millimeter radiator
mounted to the front I don't believe you
can do both of those at the same time
but you should be happy either way
you've also got a 120 or 140 available
in the back here's a look at the black
version of the mcubed
550 I also wanted to point out these are
made with 0.8 millimeter
SACC steel so they're very sturdy even
though these are just hands all of these
by the way are just hand assembled
models so they're not going to have the
exact fit and finish that you would get
from the factory so a few things here
and there haven't been fitting together
quite well but they've also included
some pretty flexible Drive trays here
for 3.5 inch drives so if you want a ton
of 3.5 inch drives in your system each
of these trays will actually support to
2 mats on the top and then you can mount
one inside there as well so here you can
see where those cages might mount
is mounted down here and they actually
just mount up 220 millimeter fan bracket
so obviously it's a bit of a trade-off
if you mount to drive there you're gonna
lose the ability to mount a fan and have
the air flow but you know pick your
poison and go one way or the other also
they're using all metal for the 2.5 inch
drive mounts and you can see one of
those method but actually two of those
mounts are back here and then you can
mount one up on the front on top of the
power supply shroud and finally here's
the ever-popular Matrix 55 now available
in white and this one is also now going
to come with a included hundred and
twenty millimeter fan not RGB but then
this still has the addressable RGB strip
going down the front and since this was
a very popular case for deep cool over
the past year they got a lot of demand
for having a white version as well so
they have done that it's available in
February and it's gonna cost $65 so guys
that's gonna wrap it up for my coverage
