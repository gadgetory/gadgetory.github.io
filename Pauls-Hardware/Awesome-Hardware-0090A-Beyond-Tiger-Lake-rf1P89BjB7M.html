to twitch and YouTube the same time
every one time everyone gets an equal
shot of watching so let's begin the show
as we always do in a perfectly normal
fashion and nothing is out of the
ordinary at all yeah all right good see
we're live everything's fine whoo
everything is perfectly fine I'm gonna
be hey everyone and welcome to awesome
hardware the show that can i do every
friday evening Oh every Tuesday wow he's
already had one beer I can confirm he
has had he's unless his first beer this
is yeah I've had three he's had three
quarters of beer cheers to you guys
thanks for being here he did a bunch of
other stuff right before I came over no
justjust heroin it was all the meth all
right so hi YouTube and thanks for being
here this is awesome hardware live show
Callen I tuesday evenings five-thirty
p.m. pacific time twitch.tv / awesome
hardware youtube Paul's hardware bit wit
buy stuff at our stores if you want to
help support us that's not that's not
our store that's Kyle Storer bit with
tech / doors I'm left by spend more
money I get some money off also my store
Paul's Harbor nets by things if you want
to all right you'll get a job drinking
some beer yes you can take care to drink
responsibly kyle is drinking old
rasputin mm-hmm I am about to start oh
god hurry mmm I got it I got it how
about start a boddingtons like every
time you crack open a bottle tens it's
basically screaming chug me Johnny now
you have like it's a 2.5 second gap yeah
didn't want a shotgun me a pusher all
right so anyway it's a very abrasive
beer if you've never opened it from a
can it just gets abrasive gets right up
in your face right up in your grill it's
like I'm comin I came early are you
trying to put it into the mic so people
can hear it what is it here the fizzing
fizzing oh I thump the mic I'm sorry it
sounds like can she's gonna let that
build right there the sound LLL be
the bottom okay um it's not all head the
head is I can hear the ocean that is
right here right that's the head this is
the part that's building down there and
if you can look at it up close it looks
really cool it's like a waterfall mmm
I'm gonna upload a video that it's gonna
do fabulous all right uh fair warning
today's shows not very well plans
usually we do have a pretty you know
decently planned out show but I have a
little bit a few things to talk about my
half spine down there John pals half is
planned out I can divert got some Intel
news about their far in the future stuff
in 2019 and 2020 and then we're also
going to grieve the loss of Carrie
Fisher who passed away today
unfortunately yes we're all very sad
about that bummer ah talk a little bit
about hopefully the next year to come
maybe maybe try to have a rosy outlook
if we can and that's about all now we're
going to do some Q&amp;amp;A so it'll be lovely
good stuff if you happen to do a
donation in the gaming youtube com
version of this live show that is very
welcome of course and I believe our good
friend cell who does the moderations in
there is going to be gathering those and
that will address those when we get to
the Q&amp;amp;A session yes so cool dude I'm
right so let's let's go into that that
Intel news and start with news now how
reliable degree this whole article but
how reliable is this rumor how reliable
is this room as far as rumors can go I
don't know I mean it's early stuff it's
it's got that wrong but it's got the air
of you know credibility to some degree
but I mean it as wccftech so lots of
salts or grains grains of salt grains of
salt our boy whose bumper Dada she's in
here reporting about Intel's reportedly
working on a brand new implementation of
the x86 architecture yep one that is
much leaner and faster um so yeah there
it is the I thought I had notes for this
oh I did but I never faces I never
pasted them in hang FFP useful I like to
keep all my notes in separate places
exactly exactly right so
anyway the website this originates from
is bits and chips IT it's and chips
which is I mean dot I t-that's Italy so
actually I mainly relying on the
wccftech article yeah this is this is
definitely for all the things i know
this is Italian so anyway if you're if
you're if you're Italian one of our old
school Italian viewers let us know in
the comments how reputable this website
is yep um but yeah so there what do you
what do they mean by brand new x86
architecture will and I mean they've
been building on x86 architecture ever
since Intel embedded it a long time ago
I don't know what year that was was in
the 80s late 80s Early 90s I'm like that
before i was born i'm probably wrong but
there's been certain elements of it
because they have to build a specific
parts of the architecture for specific
like instruction sets that have gotten a
little bloated i mean i guess you have
to kind of be a cpu architect to really
be able to look at something like that
and say like oh it's bloated or whatever
but they have support for legacy stuff
that's existed there so that takes up
room on the die and potentially you know
can generate more heat or be less
efficient or that kind of thing so the
article here is effectively accusing
intel to some degree of you know not
doing a whole lot of innovation on top
of this architecture I mean intel has
been very cyclical in their updates ever
since they started tick tock which they
did as a response to AMD dominating with
their FX series that was in like in the
two thousand five six seven time frame
and then intel kind of petered out AMD
kind of petered out with their with
their CPU architecture development until
sort of plotted along but there's
definitely stuff that could be done to
make it better so the core legacy it
will come to an end according to this
article when they switch over to this
new x8 new version of x86 I mean that's
as far as it describes it actually comes
out so that would be that mean the end
of core series and the end of the core
naming system
sad potentially I mean again this is all
rumor and all that kind of stuff but I I
don't I I'm kind of happy about that
actually what are they gonna replace it
with I don't know what could they have
everyone tell us in chat what which
instead of intel core i7 what should
Intel call their new processors tries
ensure tries and bra shreyas falls in
know uh risin I mean obviously you're
playing off of horizon with the shopping
sometime it better summit ridge schemidt
bridge architecture better than rising
uh the head it's the hens risin risin
pro i have a mustache yes you do so do i
it's a delicious head on the beer okay
um so anyway other than the core naming
system ending oh we have shat shayzon j
series intel Jason's the thread Intel
ripoff I helium processor just a picture
of jo√£o Intel bot seven jade is a chase
the Jays two cents the series the
nucleus techno scope suggest it's
actually not bed it sounds cool nucleus
uh the crater haha okay the proton all
right the ricin actually that's also
techno scope you should go into
marketing yep because those are actually
both pretty decent suggestions there
nugget the nugget until the muck it up
introducing but you'll nugget next 8800
like that one hypercore it's the core
core late core ultra what's your barrier
ultra there was a cyber Corps x says it
was the fictional name that my
brother-in-law brother-in-law and I were
like saying like if we ever made a case
we have to be like cyber Corps and then
we're like no way it's missing something
cyber ogres it needs an exit the end all
right Gaming Association some great
suggestions I hope until is watching the
show they always do ok that they do we
can't get enough um so yeah the funny
thing that they are
recall also points out is that Intel of
course originally invented the x86
architecture AMD was it the one who
created the x8 airside the 64-bit
version of x86 the x86 underscore 64
extension Intel had the license that
from AMD in order to create 64-bit
processors whereas AMD has to license
x86 sort of core architecture there nut
cores and the brand core but to begin
anyway all right yeah so there's kind of
it there's cross-licensing both ways
from both companies but whenever we talk
about new Intel Architecture the such as
tik tok in the past but now p AO
processor process architecture
optimization which is a bad i shrink new
architecture on that on the smaller die
and then optimization of that
architecture but they've been
essentially using the same x86 stuff
underneath just expanded with new
features and new new features every
adoration for the first time at this
rumor turns out to be true Intel might
introduce an x86 architecture that is
truly different and they say x86 out of
diets where backward compatibility is no
longer assured no more backward
compatibility so yeah but has new
processors and you can't use any
software that exists right now that's
not really true that's completely false
okay good okay so the reason this would
help is guys already kind of previously
mentioned they could remove legacy
support stuff like SSE extensions errors
SX and streaming SIMD extensions is what
SS e is s SIMD is single instruction
multiple data but anyway there's lots of
there's been lots of the operation there
have been many different versions of SSE
that they've sort of each different
version has new features and stuff like
that like you'll it's listed in the
specs when you look at like an Intel
processor like support for sse2 or
whatever the heck they're called most of
the stuff people ignore but this is very
important when you're developing
software because the software ties in
with these extensions in order to
a process efficiently right that's yeah
I think that's reasonably explained I
hope anyway that will suffice phone app
yes so the the question of like oh no
legacy support for older ones that's not
really a big deal because you can
emulate and software the older sse
versions with newer sse versions mmm
malaysian emulations it's the future
okay um I know it's probably that's the
most attempted explanation it that cpu
architecture I should attempt right now
does it say did you did you mention when
this would be coming otay you're like in
2019 yes got it yes so um two years away
yeah that's one of the things I was let
me see if I can if I can find this right
now I'm going to Google something on the
fly Kyle what to fill time for 20 hello
my baby hello my darling hello
um let's see uh someone just so auto mod
we enabled auto mod for Jack good and so
i keep getting like every once in a
while I'll uh I'll get it I'll get a
pop-up that's like hey would you want to
improve or deny this message we're
holding it for you well it pauses it
it'll pause before you okay and then I
think she'll just did it but it just
said someone just said bitch cruncher
bitch cruncher the bitch Crutcher 9 has
an auto mod was like that's a little
Shady I don't know what a bitch cruncher
is but it doesn't sound I'll get it
through I don't know no he denied it he
denied it yeah I would've uh maybe she's
a bitch cruncher on a live stream yeah
that's true that's true it's up I
know I mean uh like I'd ever do that
like a dildo and dance with it anyway
where's mother not that kind of show we
picked at all hold on you never got
reprimanded by twitch for dancing with a
dildo to dance is also from WCC Eric
this is from july but it has a picture
of the road map this is what i was
trying to find all right so 2016 right
now where is guy like or scott like was
2016 this this is 2017 which shows kb
lake and then they have all the
processors kind of skewed down here so
these are this does not include the
desktop by the way okay just just
pointing that out this only goes up to
the TDP 45 to 35 watt versions which is
H you another you and why why hui hui is
what thats bills Oh Phooey okay be like
in 2017 is gonna pretty pretty much what
they have coffee and also by the way
this also isn't including enthusiast
class stuffs like skylake x yeah and kb
like exits also been talked about this
isn't on here but then after after that
we have coffee like I heard of coffee
like before yeah I don't rememeber seen
it's here it's just one of their code
names they're getting they're running
out of ideas canim lake is probably what
you've heard more so like will be built
on the 10 nanometer process coffee and
all that stuff after cannon lake comes
ice lake and Tiger link yeah okay I
fancy I've even heard of those i missed
coffee like
okay so isolating Tiger legs supposed to
be 20 18 20 19 so whatever this
mysterious new like updated exit x86
architecture version or whatever that
they're working on would potentially
then come after that in 20 20 yeah 20 22
thousand vegan make it make a bunch of
eyesight jokes that you say wow I can
attract my vision will be perfectly
clear yes 20 20th yeah and then after
2020 you'll be able to look buell be
able to be like remember like last year
2020 would be like well hindsight is
2020 hahaha see I've already ruined it
things were so much clearer back then I
know I know you got out these you gotta
have these terrible puns planned way in
advance though thank you just to be to
be thorough no I'm not Swedish what
people in chat sanctum Swedish I don't
know why they're going with so many
lakes they do seem to be really hung up
on the lakes right now with the sky lake
and the kb lake and nice sleek and the
yeah bring back the bridges like from my
understanding at it i mean i have no
idea if there's been any like internal
edicts sent out and intel anything like
that but for my understandings of dicks
yes it i don't know if any dixit intel
have changed anything but for my
understanding the basic premise of the
code naming system is that it has to be
on a map like right at all so it would
be a road it could be a lake which
they're stuck on or really could be an
Islander you know but if I have to an
island then that'd be like they'd be
really overlapping with AMD there okay
yes cause a fight it's weird because
there's so many options they can choose
from on the on planet early living yet
they're just there they're obsessed
they're fascinated with lakes they can't
branch out of lakes about a forced like
you know the seaweed Nestor look like
the Yellowstone core i7 Yellowstone or
like the Philippines about building the
Philippines architecture new Philippines
architecture yeah why not
I'm gonna talk to talk to them i'm at
i'm gonna email them personally and say
hey what about the philippines and
they'll be like well there's lots of the
philippines is like thousands of
violence so there's lots of different
islands in the Philippines but if I said
yeah if it has to be on a map that's
really requirement and why why can't I
just be they could America or the new
Intel America processor knew that would
start wars Intel's working on there
that's a very very mysterious new seven
animator architecture codenamed earth
just spitballin here yeah ocean bridge
everything should open up to the
universe now they still that's
superfluous they need to get out of
lakes first they're still stuck on legs
anyway yeah yeah you did maybe maybe d
maybe god damn it maybe AMD's reisen
launch will finally light the fire under
intel's ass yeah just to switch off of
the lake code names right that's what
we've really been waiting for okay
they're gonna go to ponds next is wish
to pause or rivers um what was I going
to say oh well I wasn't able that it is
though coincidental again assuming this
is as any truth to it that we're hearing
about this right now right as AMD is on
the verge of finally like like offering
a product for sale based on Zen which
andy has said will happen in q1 which is
in the next three months within the next
three months yeah could be within the
next week don't do you sit side AMD
black dildo know that the Intel nudist
beach hahaha who can't wait for their
new nudist beach 5 nanometer chip it's
gonna have 16 cores and a special h 266
but it'll be running threadless yeah
especially like it's got a special
encoder built into it for like 3d porn
or so
like that it's like the new quick sync
but it just does porn yeah yeah it's so
insane way for that interesting Keisha
music is a children's show yeah totally
by the way that's why we don't blame him
adult language I feel like I have a
heaven feeling though like we should put
a like a disclaimer at the beginning of
the show for that like there's gonna be
debauchery did I tell you at the holiday
party that I was with my in-laws that
Heather's family like one of her like a
couple of her uncle's had watched the
the VR horror reaction uh yeah we're
she's like swearing like a sailor and
like super super nice with super
conservative family like oh I didn't
know she was like okay I was like ah
true true colors come Shannon through
when you finish stuck in the world of VR
monsters creeping I was like will you
try it I brought VR up for the weekend
this past weekend we went up to my
parents little cabin and I set up VR
there and had quite a few of my family
members try it and it was it was quite
humorous yeah at various times quite a
few of them were would you have them
play I didn't have that much down that
was a problem I'd I was really rushed to
get it all set up and brought up there
so I didn't have very much loaded in the
sister I used that that system i built
with the handle oh you ATT and so we
just had a space pirate trainer a second
one that's a good one to show people
hollow points of course yeah and then
the lab and I think that was pretty much
Ellen and and tilt brush that's a good
intro yeah it's are like all the the
basics are some fundamentals and again
that we had like a about three down and
about point eight up there I know he's
semi sweet I did I did yeah I uploaded a
4k video it literally took more than 24
hours I knew it probably did because I
saw your tweet and I checked the next
day like his video still not up and
still must be out like I kind of put it
up on Christmas but I don't know
just I was no yeah i wasn't i felt like
Christmas morning is like who's gonna be
wanting to look I mean I've known people
that not everyone so vicious was of
course but right yeah no I did the same
thing as like wearing any views then I
realize it's because YouTube unsubbed
everyone for my channel that's like a
completely dense also problematic yeah I
want to talk about that on my a pleasure
but it I feel like it's kind of old news
and I don't want to just be like no
one's watching my video I am nodding but
i'm not from germany i don't know why
people are asking if i'm from germany i
am i'm swedish now in your german well
that's more believable with you i am
like half german but I am NOT from
Germany I'm there I've never actually
visited the motherland we should do the
wooden we should do those ancestry tests
like the ancestry com or they like you
send the your DNA and they tell you
exactly what you are we should unbox our
results on monastery that's a bad idea
cuz but you just have an infinite level
of racial slurs and thrown at us seven
every Senate some of this past secret
what are you ashamed of your watch what
I don't know um but really my white
German there's nothing in my yeah I'm
not saying that at all but it's true i'm
just i'm pretty sure i have no idea my
dad does have a family tree that goes
back to like the 1500s in germany that's
pretty awesome actually fun fact since
we really don't have much planned for
the show and we can just go off and
random tangents whatever we want dr.
Heimlich recently died yeah dr. henry
pen I believe it's Henry Heimlich on
inventor of the Heimlich maneuver he has
the same last name as me my last name is
also Heimlich right Paul Heimlich I
don't use my last name but it's not a
secret either anyone who yeah you google
newegg Paul for the past eight years
they're my LinkedIn profiles anyway rad
huh and he wants to do some background
feels good get it off your chest um
point being I hell is me I am i real
Heimlich and we have a family tree that
goes way way back into intellect fifteen
hundreds in germany or something like
that and i believe dr. Heimlich much
respect to him he saved many lives but i
believe that his family assumed the name
when they when they came to the US
you know children I don't really have
much to back that up right although I do
we do have the family tree I guess so
i'm trying to say huh i always wonder
does it get any relation like when i
first like heard your name know even
touch sure that is that is the most
common question I get when people hear
my last name yeah it's about it and
that's always the story I tell them when
they ask about it all right well wasn't
that fun that was let's move on to the
next segment which I don't have a lower
thirds four hours i'm just we're calling
this so the idea for this segment is
completely based on this Ars Technica
article where they aired their 2016 tech
grievances to celebrate festivus
festivus came from Seinfeld George's dad
celebrates festivus it's on on December
23rd I believe is a fictional it's a
fictional holiday that was made up just
respect it's like the anti holiday for
the holiday time ok ever got it anyway
so this already cool if you guys are
interested on the description and all of
the writers at ARS technica each listed
their tech grievance for the years so
yeah in the spirit of festivus i thought
we might also air our grievances and
airing of grievances if you will so yeah
if you guys in chat have any grievances
to air yep from this year feel free to
do so and perhaps perhaps we'll read
some of those and in the meantime we
will also air some of our grievances and
I think the biggest one for any of us
who are recently in England who are fans
of Star Wars or any of her well that's
relative yeah she's the first of the
three big stars and that franchise to
pass away cuz the other other two were
Mark Hamill and console uh what's his
name Harrison Ford third like they're
the big three she I can't I'm out
honestly shocked that she was the first
one to go I thought mark hamill's gonna
kick the bucket for all of them but
she's apparently had some kind of stuff
I mean she had
some back in the day right like
wasn't all not to be too specific not to
not to be too specific but I mean Carrie
Fisher passed away today very
unfortunately she had a heart attack on
a plane flight to Los Angeles I believe
two or three days ago that most everyone
was very concerned for her there was a
lot of hope that she was going to
recover but she did not she is an
actress of course very most well known
for her role as Princess Leia in the
Star Wars original Star Wars trilogy as
well as reprising her role as general
Organa in the force awakens she's also
though an author and a screenwriter and
and she's very well known for just being
like grit as it says in the article here
I mean she yeah she had she had she was
very I don't know she had an air about
her especially in the original series
you know the way she would kind of
interact with with Harrison Ford and
Mark Hamill and everything was just like
she was a badass yeah she was pretty bad
at it wasn't a damsel in distress she
was like very much a power powerful
woman she was like that in life as well
she um oh I know she had bipolar
disorder firsthand oh yes so she she did
suffer from mental illness herself but
she was very outspoken about it and very
blunt about it and she addressed it very
directly and she was a proponent of
speaking about and and normalizing
talking about mental illness and so
she's very beloved for a wide range of
things and screw you 2016 for taking her
away yeah I'll very sad it's really
stupid it's really shitty there was an
image floating around the internet of
like all the celebrities or famous
people that have died in 2016 and I was
astounded by how many of them and like
many of them weren't just like you know
people you would never recognize a lot
of more like oh yeah that person died
that burn well my god that person that
was all this year it claimed like like
50 big celebrities it was insane yeah
look at that picture really seen who's
like usually there's you know whenever
you watch like the Oscars or whatever
and they do that you know that
remembering last year I mean not to say
that only actors and everything in the
ones who get remembered i'm just using
this is exam
pull something that happens every year I
knew that I don't know that just seems
like this year was very disproportionate
there was a lot of beloved people not
just in film but television and
entertainers people who made music
people who who who died Muhammad Ali
boxing elites athletes and athletes
anyways um and of course you're on bein
and Harambee um most importantly all
right so do you have any idea so apart
from all that um have your CD I mean do
it let's let's let's see tone it down a
notch think of something petty like some
just something stupid and petty it's a
you could you could like a real first
world problem yeah I Alan Alan Rickman
yeah oh yeah oh yeah Alan Rickman we
have like who's your like which
celebrity were you the status that had
passed away um I don't know Alan Rickman
definitely yeah I bad when Alan Rickman
died my wife put on I forget I think
it's is it the sixth of the seventh it's
detecting celebrities and it's the 3d
model Lebanese a died in 2016
auto-filled and um Wow yes napes sniffs
the spoiler spoiler Harry Potter spoiler
Harry Potter spoiler yep so my wife put
on the part at the end of harry potter
if i don't know is his movie six or
movie seven deathly hallows part one or
two where Snape dies and has the reveal
and Harry sees his memories and
everything and yeah I mean Harry Potter
I mean he's in so many other things too
he's an amazing actor yeah oh yeah
George Michael died recently George
Michael oh yeah just like the christmas
day or the day before christmas eve or
something like that yeah i think the two
that shocked me a lot were um
what's-his-name here aunt anton yelchin
the guy from Star Trek the younger guy
from Star oh yeah who died in a freak
accident he was so young I think those
are the most shocking too because they
are
you know like really young still and
then christina Grimmie which was a
musical artist up-and-coming person who
I didn't really even know of before this
whole thing happened but she was
probably in her 20s like mid to early
20s and she got killed by a deranged fan
during a meet and greet oh yeah that was
that freakin stupid is strikes insane
huh it's ridiculous just
you 2016 Prince of course you
Prince um Marie from Everybody Loves
Raymond geez Robin Williams oh my god
Robin Williams slowly course was that
wasn't 2015 was it or 2016 was it 2016
and I'm not sure damn seems so recent
yeah even Bowie freaking crazy ash all
right so anyway we're sad about all that
crap um people who people who create
things that that we connect with or that
are impactful culturally you know the
remember everybody dies I guess
everybody dies I mean I guess I think if
we have if we can console ourselves in
any way it's that we do have access to
like the internet and sources now we're
like we can sort of bring them back and
look at the material that they created
whoever might happen to be talking about
yeah Robin losses in 2014 while it seems
so he seems so recent August 2014 big
and as that was so sad they had a Robin
Williams marathon going on at the hotel
I was a close with family in Newport
Beach yesterday and they were doing like
a Robin Williams marathon they had um
hook followed by Jumanji doing wildest
on repeat oh yeah I remember watching
jumanji yesterday just in bed hungover
like this isn't me off so he was so good
it was just he made so many good movies
and he was such a good actor yeah and
hilarious very sad well alright so there
to any it does anyone else have any
airing of grievances is I guess it's
mainly just the the other people all the
people who were sad who are no longer
with us um I do have a couple tech
grievances or not greatest but I have
like kind of a list on my half where
it's like the best in were
stoptech it's more of a discussion
between you and I and the audience more
so than like a list that I've compiled I
can I have some ideas there that I could
belt out when the time comes and stuff
all right I never want to like actually
make a list like Dimitri's brave
cuz he made like a best in worst cases
of the year video he doesn't every year
I was a really good video it was a river
very good van I always really well done
had some laugh-out-loud moments too yeah
I don't yeah it's the EVGA case one that
would that had Ron no no no the big ass
from the DG one every 97 or yeah yes vga
this really why does your case look like
a rear projection television good video
go check it out on harvard connect the
winner if you if you're curious yes of
course go to Harvard connects and watch
his video in the best cases of 2016 more
the case of words I don't know what he
calls it uh yeah but the winner was the
be quiet dark base 900 yeah did you ever
do anything did you build in that I did
and I can see exactly why he gave it
that award do you still have it you get
rid of it I was a giveaway build okay
yeah out of them no it was a great case
one of them was over yeah I never
actually I never actually worked with
that one and I don't think I watched his
video on it any of the videos on it when
it came out either yeah but I can see
why he gave it the best case of the year
yeah very very cool design the only
thing I was bummed about it was that it
didn't have a power supply shroud they
would have been practically perfect if
it did yeah but other than that
everything was on point okay why did why
are people still saying that I look
Swedish how is that how is this a
recurring conversation chat I don't even
know what's smooze people look like
isn't PewDiePie Swedish I looked nothing
like yeah okay great yeah the hell we'd
there look like I work at IKEA like what
okay
anyway oh all right let's move on to a
very very brief bout of a sword fight
yeah yes indeed yah we have one single
question for all of you folks at home
and we're going to argue it here looking
forward to 2017 and the question to
answer is like is it gonna suck or not
like is it or at least compared to this
year at least compared to this year and
you know maybe yeah probably yeah we'll
2017 be better or worse better worse or
option three um but what do you what do
you think how you're gonna optimist here
or the pessimist pessimist option i'm
gonna say it's gonna get better it's
gonna get better okay then can I argue
first yes all right this is you've
already thought this through simply well
I'm just I want to turn the show around
like I know we've been talking about
some sadder stuff and I want to so I
wanted to get I want to do the band-aid
first yeah I'm talk about the negative
stuff okay but it's probably not gonna
help at all because as you might already
know because I'm answering the question
the way I'm answering it 20-17 is
actually going to suck think at the
bottom of the barrel now we actually
still have a lot further down to drop
doing not only are more people going to
die in 2017 but they're gonna die faster
that's what that's what I was going to
say yeah what do you mean or no they're
gonna die slower it's going to hurt more
that's what I was gonna say um like also
the let's say all die of paper cuts the
the Galactic Empire will bring the death
star here and they're not going to blow
up the earth but they'll probably
they'll do it like what they did jetta
and just do like you know the single
City exposure exploder thing boiler
alerts but
they don't know that that's not even
like a real City but key thing just
stills but tend to Japanese in the movie
I said spoiler alert earlier in the show
that's a blanket spoiler alert all right
and so for everything we're gonna
everyone's getting triggered in chat oh
god no sorry no that's Paul's being
really negative tonight good girl I'm
trying to get it all out we have to we
have to we have to remove all of this at
the beginning is human guys okay we're
just too stupid hosts also for some
reason i didn't i didn't like build
myself an argument for uh for the worse
argument here for some reason so i don't
really have a whole whole lot of stuff
to talk about right the other thing the
other reason 2017 is going to suck is
this probably gonna be like solar flares
and soul and life as we know it will
come to an end that's MIT that's my
theory so basically less people will die
but life will come to an end and it says
more people will die oh i thought you
said not it well you know you said not
as many people will die but will die
slower now I said more people using
money and you know that I've cares that
said I was gonna say faster path ends
gonna say knows it needs to be crappier
so slow okay slower would be better all
right well compelling argument Paul
however i think the 2017 will be better
than this year because liar no i agree i
agree i think people are going like
everyone's gonna die i think it's gonna
be slower so you know we're gonna
probably just wither away from lake well
i'll probably up my death like I'll
probably die of like silk worms
silkworms will just slowly eat my body
like I'll decompose while I'm still
alive it'll be war they would wrap you
in silk first so we're at me and I've
got a silk mummification and then all my
insides we get sucked out by like a big
giant spider wait I able to feel
everything I said it's gonna be better I
I I am I haven't
haven't finished oh ok sorry Sarah Frank
so I agree with you that everything's
gonna be horrible but it's still gonna
be a better year than this year because
then we will have opening Zen so
even if I die a slow and painful death
that i will feel every inch of I'm still
gonna be able to get the hottest CPU
that AMD has ever released on planet
earth it's gonna not metallurgy
metaphorically hot MIT no no the TDP I'm
fairly confident that's more
metaphorically than metaphorical than it
is literal and I have high hopes for the
chip I think we all do we're all rootin
for it I think it's gonna be a game
changer and we're going to be able to
experience that come 2017 which
automatically just dis mrs. everyone
else in the world died I mean there's
not even a comparison so so if any of
our friends at AMD you're watching and
there wasn't already a lot riding on xen
launching now it's just like the fate of
the world I mean or like I call that
they can use little motivation yeah just
like the global a little bit the global
mood and you know like everyone everyone
being positive or negative will rest on
the success or failure of Zen yeah so so
then our inevitable human extinction
just way those mm so let's see what you
guys thought though good stuff I'm sure
you all agree this is this is the
crappiest show what we've ever intended
that's that the best we're ending 2016
one day oh look at that better oh it can
I get win by one by oh wow this is
really clear look thirty-seven percent
say worse so basically lady eight
percent say like four more people could
vote right now and swing this big time
whoa big time whoa sorry I heaven wide
to their comments well meant I didn't
I'd never notice comments I don't know
there could be comments oh my god to
stay away comments Trump Harambee okay
well that's tied up of course now it's
tires well it's tight percentage wise
but um right now 30 said Oh guys with
what I just said no everyone wants to
change and a bratwurst oughta go now
we're stuck over or something refresh
here so where's kandi I all right well
144 145 everyone's like I must upset the
vote this means but hey that means I win
no it's not it's it's whatever open a
tie vote it's when you open the link
especially once we show the results it's
all skewed at that point people just
vote on whatever you know whatever is
lys dish back out there just trying to
pick the winning horse it's a man who I
can think it is I thought the I thought
it was going to be shitty first before
anything before originally I don't know
so um Wow but I was trying to end this
on a brighter note but I guess we'll
have to wait for Kyle's half of the show
to do that yeah good luck in the
meantime we should potentially answer
some of these wonderful questions that
have come in for people throughout the
show yes glorious wonderful people who
have donated money and are great people
uh you know what there was a i saw one
pound donation go through there at one
point found it but you found it no i
said pound it yeah i saw one pound one
go through there but maybe i might have
been missed that's okay we do a few
other though that are fat that are
fabulous cool let me ain't nothing
anymore 14 dollar donation from Wilkins
Wilkins Rojas nice round number you guys

feel like it can only go downhill yeah
you guys are great and I have gotten and
have gotten great feedback off your
videos in choosing and building my own
and friends pcs nice I love that I love
you and I love your donation ends your
question because it's not a question
it's a compliment I'm we and it's just a
compliment and we read it and it makes
us feel good yeah it benefits us
financially and we don't have to think
right to formulate a response it's the
best thing you could have at this is
probably one of the this is it has to be
in the top
three donations we've ever gotten top
two maybe yeah at least huh well you get
I mean when Adolf Hitler donated like
four thousand dollars to kids yeah yeah
it was Adolf Hitler but so much money
for kids I almost forgive him for
everything else after that this is a
dark show this really very dark show i
really hope i really hope your ship Oh
Pepe Hall is much more positive than
this one so you can get this Christmas
and now it's like trying to stay
positive here through Christmas and you
know it's just as the season and
everything will dial up and now it's
over and it's like all right just all of
any any hatred that we've had to
suppress is all losing out today slowly
but surely all right jab Rhino donates
five dollars thank you so much Kyle
would you be able to do a side-by-side
comparison benchmark of the gigabytes

Filipino I'm not Filipino what it is or
Mexican i hate you all damn it jab thank

the the node 202 bill that i have um

CES hopefully shortly after okay uh
twenty dollars from Graham a thank you
so much Graham for your twenty dollar
donation hey dudes i just got an e KW b
kit and one of the bags comes to this
little phone boom round thing what's
that for and i refuse to read the
instructions i will figure this out oh
you've done the right thing by figuring
it out in the most convoluted way
possible by messaging two guys who do a
live text show very far well I assume
very far for me i don't know maybe maybe
you're close to us but it doesn't matter
um the point do you know what is for ya
do you have the phone yeah yeah for the
rest rights for the reservoir and it's
to keep it from a swirly from making a
swirly because if it creates a vortex or
like a cyclone in there then it can suck
air down into the pump and and you don't
want that so typically they'll either
give you like a phone bid or something
that in there aur EK also some they have
like has like a vertical thing that
stands up in there and that's also kind
of does that function my little icon
yeah or logo yeah little logo I've never
actually used that phone thing here but
um and I've not really noticed any
problems not using yeah so you're
probably ok just not even using it but
if you do notice like you know vortex
pull an air and do your into your pump
then then you can toss that in there you
know all right five pound donation from

few different colors and then Mitchell
thank you so much Mitchell for getting
one of them organic cotton beanies knows
i got beanies on there now great for the

all I can tell you but it's about some
of the stuff they have coming up and he
brought me some nice gifts he actually
brought me JJ's from Asus by the way
yeah JJ for Macy's um drop me this thing
say face have it it's just money look
this is a it's called a vault card alt
card it is a cult is this that you day
long creates the cage of interference
it's like some force field or something
a force centimeter diameter around the
vault card protects it from like RFID or
n IC skimmers says Kickstarter on it uh
yeah it was originally a Kickstarter I
don't see why didn't you talk about this
on fund or not fun I don't know this
seems pretty badass I have some like
RFID blocker things like for like my
passport and stuff like that if you
travel i mean it's it's a useful thing
to have especially if you're in crowded
metropolitan areas i guess yeah this
though is just a card and you put it in
the wallet and then it like protects
everything around it so right you know
you don't have to be limited to the
unfashionable selection of rfid-blocking
wallets you can use any wallet so
basically he gave you a abusive
cutting-edge technology and you gave him
a beanie I can see why inorganic you so
again it's organic okay sure we have had
two more donations come in hold on hold

another three months I feel like and it
might even be shorter than that to wait
