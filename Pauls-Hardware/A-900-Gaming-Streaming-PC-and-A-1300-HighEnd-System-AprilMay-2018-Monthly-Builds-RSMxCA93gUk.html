the description what's up guys welcome
back to Pauls hardware I am bringing
back my monthly build series which has
been on hiatus for a couple months but
the basic premise is that I go over
parts lists for computers to help you
guys choose the best parts to build a PC
with since the first step of building
new computers of course choosing which
parts you want to build with now just to
clarify I'm not gonna be actually
assembling anything today so check out
my builds playlist linked in the
description if you actually want to see
me put a system together and of course I
do want your feedback for next month as
well so check the description for a
straw poll question that you might be
able to give me some help with what
builds do you want to see in June I have
a few options here so check those out
and let me know what you think I haven't
forgotten the February straw poll and
actually a couple of my builds are based
on the popular answers from this one but
I made the builds before I saw this was
the number one response the worst build
max price minimum performance so I'm not
gonna do this today but this might
deserve its own video in and of itself
so vote for that for next month's if you
want to see a little bit more of it for
this month though my idea was that I
have to theoretical customers in my
brain and one customer wants to play
video games and maybe kick off a
streaming his career on Twitch so you
want to be able to game and stream at
the same time maybe do some video
editing as well but budget is definitely
a concern and for that I have a $900 at
level build there's a second customer
who's more focused on gaming it has a
little bit more money to spare and for
that we're gonna go with an Intel
platform and that's more of a $1,300
build and of course all these builds and
their parts are linked in the video
description if you want to check them
out I'm using PC part picker as usual to
go over these parts lists so let's start
with that $900 AMD low rounded gaming PC
and for this I'm using the 2600 X which
was what I recommended the upgrade to
with my entry-level build that I did
last month 2600 X is a very powerful
processor 6 cores 12 threads and the
at the X versus the gist of 2600 is
although it's $30 more expensive you get
a better cooler with it the race fire
rather than the Wraith stealth and it is
gonna run at a higher frequency out of
the box than the 2600 so if you're not
comfortable with overclocking right now
then you can still run the CPU and you
will get a little bit better performance
out of it
now beyond that I went with an X 470
motherboard 16 gigs of memory a 240 gig
SSD graphics card you do need a discrete
graphics card with this processor and
I'll get more into how it shows that
when I get down to it and then we got a
case that's about 60 or 70 bucks and
then a 80 plus bronze rated 550 watt
power supply so this power supply should
be able to handle GPU upgrade in the
future I would be satisfied with this
power supply with anything else like a
GTX 1080 of course if you're planning on
doing a lot more additions to your
system in the future maybe consider a
slightly higher higher wattage power
supply but let's get into the
motherboard selection since we already
know what our CPU is now X 470 is a good
way to go with this just because you
know all x4 70 motherboards are going to
be updated and compatible with the rise
in 2000 series processors you can get a
B 350 or an X 370 motherboard that will
be compatible but might need a BIOS
update and if you don't want to deal
with that potential hassle there are X
470 boards that are available they're
not even that expensive and they do
typically tend to overclock if you're
doing higher-end overclocking a little
bit better than those B series
motherboards for a hundred and forty
bucks there's actually options from
gigabyte asrock and msi for 20 bucks
more than that you can go with the AC
stuff I compared the 340 dollar boards
and they're all very similar so for
instance if you definitely need Wi-Fi
consider that as rock because it
includes a tow 2.11 AC Wi-Fi beyond that
specs are really similar between them so
choose which one looks pretty
I want the MSI one for this build
because we're going with black and red
aesthetic speaking of motherboards once
you've chosen your motherboard whatever
it happens to be go to the motherboard
manufacturers website go to the support
page and look at the qvl lists qualified
vendors lists and you will find memory
that they have specifically tested so
for the X or 70 gaming plus you can
actually see CPU compatibility memory
and then you can see original Rison
thousand series CPUs these are the APS
and then you can look specifically at
what they've
with the 2000 series CPUs like 2,600
2,600 and so on there's tons of options
here and MSI has actually done a really
good job with their memory validations
so I went down this list and I was just
randomly choosing because I could not
cross-check all these but I like the
actual product name search for it so if
you can find that exact memory kit for
sale because then you'll know you can
plug it in and it will be compatible my
choice was this a data kit didn't it's
an XP GG Amex kit 16 gigs 2 by 8 gig and
162 dollars which is still expensive for
16 gigs of memory but since memory was
more in the towards $200 range for a 16
gig kit recently it's actually starting
to come down a little bit you get an
added bonus that this memory is black
and red so it should match with the
motherboard choice that I've gone with
as well as the case and then of course
ddr4 3000 it might run at 29 33 or 3,000
speed once you plug in the XMP setting
on your motherboard but I would be
satisfied with that now let's talk about
video cards and video cards of course
really expensive and overpriced right
now if you've been watching my channel
you're probably familiar with that but
so I didn't was looked at all the
graphics cards that are available for
sale right now compared them to the MSRP
and found that you're still going to be
paying 40 to $100 extra on top of the
MSRP to get a graphics card right now if
you're buying new that goes up if you're
looking at something like a 1080i or GTX
1080
but the slightly more reasonably priced
GPU option that I've found is a 1050 Ti
you should be able to get these for
about 140 or 150 dollars each they're
selling 490 to 200 to 210 ish dollars
but there are options and it's not that
much more money since you need a
discreet graphics card for this build
this is what I would recommend going
with it's perfectly adequate for 1080
gaming and probably a viable upgrade
path in the future now if you're looking
at this build and you're like yeah this
looks good I want to do some streaming 6
cores and 12 threads it's great for that
want to do maybe some video editing or
some other heavy lifting with my
computer it's all a build for that for
900 bucks there is a secondary option
here that you should check out you're
gonna end up with slightly older
hardware but you will get a better
graphics card that is the AMD Krait
bundle this is the only one that's
available right now but it's $550 and
get you this gives you three of your
main components for your system
it's a be 350 Tom hockey and for
motherboard from MSI so it's a slightly
older motherboard and it's not as high
quality as the one from with my build
it's arisin 5 1600 cpu it's still six
cores and twelve threads just not quite
as fast as the 2600 X and finally you
get an MSI Radeon rx 580 graphics card
this is actually an 8 gig version as
well they should sell for about $250 so
you're actually getting it close to MSRP
if you calculate the price of all of
these things again you're just going to
be dealing with slightly older hardware
so that's a secondary option if you get
this exact setup it will slot in with
all of the other parts I've chosen on
this list so you can be happy and move
forward with that rounding out the list
though again I've just chosen a 240 gig
SSD and you should be able to find that
for 60 or 70 bucks right now
the 1050 Ti of course I chose the NZXT
s340 black and red case if you want to
choose a different case just make sure
it's full-size ATX this one is a good
case I've worked with it color scheme
matches but cases where you have a wide
variety of choices so pick one that you
think looks good just double check the
reviews and use you want full-size ATX
so it'll fit the hardware finally that
power supply 550 watt the CX series from
2017 has nice all-black cabling too so
it looks pretty clean and there you have
it a solid all-around build for $900 and
probably due for an upgrade once
graphics card prices come down now for
that second customer who's really
focused on gaming maybe not as much
interest in video editing or streaming I
have a Intel build and I'm happy to do
an Intel build because I feel like I've
been doing lots of AMD builds I want to
share the love but hey I like the a m4
platform because of the upgrade pass but
that's not to say the z3 70 has no place
so this build is based out of 80 600k
have to add an air cooler there because
it doesn't come with a cooler z3 70
motherboard also 16 gigs of memory 240
gig SSD 1070 Ti so that's the big
upgrade here with this build is the
graphics card roughly the same case and
a 650 watt power supply which was
carried over from an older bill because
it's a 80 plus gold so you're paying a
little bit more for the power supply
there you could save a little bit of
money by going with an 80 plus bronze
option
but here's the CPU it's only six cores
you don't get hyper-threading so you
don't get twelve threads and it's a
little bit more money and you don't get
an air cooler so this is why I've leaned
towards the AMD CPUs but if you test in
CPU limited situations 280 600 K should
give you a little bit more performance
out of your graphics cards especially
something like a 10-7 ATI then you would
get out of the rise in platform so
that's why we're going with this here
for the motherboard I got the ACC 370 -
a only 150 bucks
140 if you count the mail in rebate card
a little bit of RGB accents going on
there and a solid all-around motherboard
from Asus I think anyone who gets this
board would be pretty happy with it it's
missing some bells and whistles like a
surface mounted LED readout or I think
it does have it's got a memo K and a
power button mounted so I do appreciate
that this is probably the area where AMD
and Intel are kind of on the most equal
footing if you're looking for a solid
mid-range 150 H dollar motherboard there
are good choices on either side for the
memory kit for a little bit less than I
chose for that for our Rison build I
have a team T force Delta to RGB series
same speed ddr4 3000 and it's RGB so you
know RGB is fun as actually looking at
Kitson I don't really care about RGB
with these types of builds because my
focus is less on aesthetics and more on
performance but for roughly the same
price why not go with RGB this is going
to be a pretty nice looking build
aesthetically and RGB accents are are
pretty nice and you can control it if
you want a single color or turn it off
or that kind of thing - moving on
to storage and here is where I just
wanted to show you that I'm using a
parametric filter from PC part picker
basically I've chosen the capacity range
it'll give us about a 250 gig capacity
SSD sorted by lowest price but I do
recommend that you kind of reality check
HERE the SSDs that are recommended
because whereas most SATA SSDs will get
you kind of in the same ballpark in
performance there are some that are
slightly better than others and if it's
a difference of 5 or 10 bucks you might
consider something that's a little bit
more well known or recognized the
crucial MX 500 for example is a good
option but at 75 bucks instead of 60 so
there you go guys those are all the
parts I would choose right now for a
just under $1,300 ish build
depending on whether or not you're
counting mail-in rebate prices I did
want to quickly go over the GPU prices
right now so here's the 1070 TI sorted
by lowest price I don't know what that
mess RP is for the 1070 TI because it
came out after the GPU prices had gone
up but it should be less than 500 so
it's still I feel like a 50 $60 premium
over its MSRP but closer to the price
you should actually be paying and
actually relatively close to the price
you would pay for a 1080 at least if the
1080s were selling for retail 10 70s for
their part are selling for close to five
hundred bucks there is this gigabyte one
listed right here for 470 but my feeling
is if you're going to be paying close to
500 for a 1070 you might as well just
claw your way up to a 1070 TI if
anyone's wondering why I haven't been
including AMD GPUs well here's here's
the Vega 56 supposedly the more
affordable Vega 635 dollars is the
cheapest still ridiculously overpriced
especially when you consider that you
can get a 1080 for that much and the
1080 will out performance here's the rx
580 a four gig rx 580 it's three hundred
and fifteen dollars at its cheapest that
should be 200 the 8 gig rx 580 should be
250 so you're paying like $100 plus for
a 4 gig 580 and you're paying maybe 75
80 $90 plus for a 8 gig 580 it's a good
card I would recommend it if the prices
were reasonable here's what 10 80s are
going for right now $600 so that's about
$100 premium over what you should be
paying and finally here's probably my
second most viable card if you're
looking for something mid-range DTX 1066
gig you can get for just under $300
still again paying 40 50 $60 extra
beyond what you should for that so if
you're looking for an upgrade from the
1050 Ti this is probably where I would
point you of course this gets into the
range of competition with the 588 gig so
it's up to you make you make your choice
there depending on what your gonna do
now this higher-end build is geared
towards somebody who's focusing on PC
gaming and the benefits and wonderful
things about PC gaming so I definitely
recommend pairing it with a 2560 by 1440
monitor preferably preferably one that
supports Jesus
if you've got a Nvidia graphics card
freesync if you've got an AMD graphics
card and I got a couple options here
just I wanted to show you guys this
one's about 500 bucks for a Dell 27-inch
2560 by 1440 g-sync panel the juicing
panels do cost more than precincts so if
you're considering that rx 580 and
you're getting a monitor at the same
time definitely keep that in mind that
you're gonna pay more for the g-sync
monitor here's also the asus rog swift
PT 2 7 8 q r 27-inch similar class to
that one it's a little bit more
expensive but you do get a few
additional bonus features and I believe
this one actually has a bit better color
depth as well I actually have a third
customer who I was thinking about this
morning and that customer is me I am
building a new computer and I am teasing
I'm teasing just a few of the parts I'm
choosing so far this computer is gonna
be built in collaboration with Corsair
and Asus so you might notice I'm using a
lot of their components but I wanted to
at least give you guys an idea of what I
have in mind the build is going to be
called Riptide and see if you can figure
out why it is a thread Ripper build so
the threat Ripper 1950 x16 core
processor with 32 threads this was on
sale for like 750 or 720 bucks the other
day a pretty good deal for that much
money bear in mind there's
incompatibilities in these parts lists
these aren't fully completed yet so
please don't try to build a system off
of this like the cooler is not
compatible with dread Ripper and I got
to talk to Corsair about that but they
trumpet the eye is their newest high-end
almond look the cooler
rtz they've seen it's extreme
motherboard 128 gig memory kit oh my
gosh
some Corsair SSDs including the MP 500
MB me1 and then we got a couple gtx
980ti s as well as a 1600 watt corsair
power supply this isn't even a completed
parts list let me know if you can tell
what's missing and actually that's not
even the whole build there's second part
of it right here I'm including a FreeNAS
built in here as well based on some
discussions I had with Windell I'm
actually gonna be going with that AMD
APU in this one the horizon 520 400 G
going with this new asus motherboard
this is the RG Strix x4 70 - I gaming so
AM for Mini ITX motherboard since it's a
dual system builds
and my goal here is for this to be a
FreeNAS build so I wanted a motherboard
that was compatible with ECC memory I'm
hoping to slap a 32 gig kid in there a 2
by 16 gig kit but I need to double-check
compatibility and I'm working with asus
on that this kit has not been tested but
kingston does have a 32 gig ECC ddr4
memory kit only $440 super reasonable
for storage i got a force le SSD just to
give me a little bit more stability you
can run FreeNAS off of like a USB drive
but when i did that last year the USB
drive died and that kind of sucked but
for a storage mass storage I got WD red
8 terabyte drives I haven't ordered
these yet so I got to figure that out
for sure but 4 8 terabyte drives it's 32
terabytes which matches well with the 32
gigabytes it's good to have about 1 gig
of memory per terabyte of storage with
FreeNAS and finally in Corsair SFX
80 plus gold rated modular power supply
so there's still some questions that
need to be answered about that build but
it's gonna be pretty awesome pretty epic
and I'm looking forward to and hopefully
we'll be getting started on that in the
next couple weeks so that will be my
build for the month of May and I will of
course like I usually do build that
system and then test it and show you
guys what happens and the performance
and all that good stuff so stay tuned
for that and if you have any questions
or theories about the mysterious things
that I did not clarify for sure then
leave those in the comment section down
below because I like when you guys
comment on my videos I also like when
you hit the like button or the thumbs up
button as it is also commonly known so
feel free to do that for me as well on
the way out thank you guys so much for
watching this video and we'll see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
