hardware this is probing Paul episode
number five
that's my Q&amp;amp;A segment that I do every
month and this is the one for June I
actually skipped May because I was a
Computex oh sorry I fam miss Tia I have
questions going back to the last episode
though which was probing Paul number
four there it is there's actually all
the probing Paul's going back to the
first one and of course the origination
of probing Paul when Kyle first added
those words unyoked anyway I'm just
gonna dive right into it and get to the
first question which is from Chevy
monsoon whore monsoon whore first of all
I'm a big fan of your channel Paul
favorite you're my favorite youtuber
thank you thank you very much a question
is I got an ass Rock b85 with the Xeon
e3 12:20 v3 CPU running and a gtx 970
let's see key of putting a 240 or 250
gig SSD in the machine is it worth it
how can I make my 2 terabyte hard drive
work together with it he's never used an
SSD before great choice to go with an
SSD I definitely think you should given
the specs of the rest of your machine
you'll find it really improves the
responsiveness and you should have a
good time with it
240 or 250 gig you can get for a really
reasonable price right now like 40 to 60
bucks depending on where you're looking
about 20 cents per gigabyte though is
what you would want to go for and I
would definitely take a look at 580 gig
or 512 gig drives as well because those
are also coming way down in price I
would just take the new SSD unplug your
old drive put the new SSD in do a fresh
install windows on that get it all set
up
then reconnect your old hard drive pull
stuff off of it that you want to save
and then format your old Drive and then
just set it up as an additional storage
on your machine next question from Zaire
NEX are you more excited for augmented
reality or virtual reality advancements
I would say definitely kind of both
augmented reality seems pretty cool and
that's actually one that I haven't
really tried yet but even on top of both
of those I was reading an article the
other day was from Wired so I'll show it
to you I'll link this in the description
too but this is about a company called
magic leap and they're working with
mixed
so um they have a special lens that
they're developing and stuff and I guess
they're getting a lot of investment
money right now but it seems like a
pretty cool thing mixed reality because
it's like taking augmented reality to
the next level and look at that fancy
thing that that dudes looking into
that's pretty that's pretty cool and
mixed reality is like if you think of
augmented reality is like you're looking
at a table and your headset or your
goggles can like draw things on top of
that mixed reality is actually it knows
that there's a table there not just as a
flat surface but it knows what's like
the layout of the entire room is so it
can like put stuff behind the table and
like draw stuff around things so you can
have much more sort of mixture between
what's really around you and stuff that
can go on top of that so definitely
augmented reality seems pretty cool mix
reality I think even more so I'm
definitely still like just kind of
getting my feet wet wet with VR though
so I'm still pretty excited about that -
all around it's all around very exciting
but thank you for the question
next up is tech showdown thank you for
another question do you still enjoy
making tech videos the same way you did
when you first started or has some of
the fun faded I would say 98% I think I
still enjoy it just as much as I used to
there's continually new challenges for
me like making videos as compared to
what I used to do when I was working
like for a company on a team versus now
making them on my own like where I do
pretty much everything except for I do
have an editor now who's helping me out
that's probably the most tedious thing
for me is the editing it just it takes a
while to kind of go from vision to
reality so yeah that's part is probably
among my lesser favorite parts I just
wish I had more time to do it
but everything else like I still really
enjoy like I mean being able to work
with all the awesome technology and
being able to use the computers that I
build to actually do my work and edit
videos and all that kind of stuff it's
all it's all very much a lot of fun so
yeah I still like it
next question from Kane wolf do you even
lift bro I need to know how you look so
sexy thank you Kane wolf for your I
appreciate that you're appreciating you
know what I got going on here no I
lift actually I'm probably being in
shape is probably what's getting the
least amount of attention when it comes
to the stuff that I spend my time on
like like benchmarking has been taking
up most of my time just recently I need
to like pull a go team J thing or
something like that and like you know
just start doing some new workout
activity that I can track and get me
into better shape because it's
definitely really easy doing what I do
to just end up sitting out here working
or filming or that kind of thing and
just completely forget about like oh
yeah I should actually like walk around
or like you know go to the park or that
kind of thing walking the dogs does does
definitely help with that but um but
yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna get in better
shape very soon very soon I promise
Gabriel has the next question he says
awesome video Paul of York thank you
questions upgrading arctic panther for
the cpu would I go for the Newman
Silverado well II or the new AMD Zen FX
or for the GPU same kind of question and
video Pascal GPUs or AMD Polaris GPUs
based on all the hype and all that kind
of stuff so yes instance arctic panther
kind of represents the epitome of my
enthusiast tech of my channel will I
stick with what I got or kind of go the
other route well I will say this Gabriel
because I got the Polaris GPU right here
I got the 480 just started working with
that also of course at least when we're
talking GPUs we got the 1080 when it
comes to the arctic panther this is a
$200 GPU this is a six or $700 plus GPU
depending on how you look at it right
now I would go with this if AMD comes
out with their Vega GPUs that are gonna
have like eh be m2 and all that kind of
stuff and probably be a much more
different kind of story so right now I
would go with the 1080 in the near
future who knows if it's later this year
I don't know what I'm actually gonna do
this rebuild but hopefully sooner rather
than later I do already have my
motherboard lined up though right right
here Asus x99 deluxe 2 which I think MIT
is a suitable successor since arctic
panther uses the x99 deluxe this one has
RGB LEDs of course and some really cool
other features as well so I will be
using that and then for the CPU
since it's an X 99 board 6950 X is the
obvious go-to choice
I only only I had I'm fortunate enough
to have a 69 50 X and I definitely am
looking into getting at least one more
broad well II processor so that will
it'll kinda depend how that plays out
but obviously if I have that motherboard
I'll go with a broad well II processor
again if Zen comes out which I really
want it to that would totally change
things up but for now that's what I
would go with thank you for the question
then DBZ n media asks Paul being that
you've worked with a lot of tech in a
wide variety of companies is there one
product you haven't had a chance to get
your hands on that I really want to try
I kind of going back to the last
question
Zen like the Zen CPUs are probably the
thing that I'm most interested in trying
out just because I kind of already know
what's going on what's going on on the
Intel side and the Zen CPUs have a huge
potential to first hopefully infuse some
more competition in the marketplace but
also just for the future of like DIY
desktop socketed CPUs and that kind of
thing in the future like it's a really
important launch so I'm super interested
in getting my hands on it granted that's
not out yet so other than that I mean
like I have you know like I already
showed you that got the 1080 and I got
the 4r x 480 and and 6950 x and stuff so
I'm very lucky to fortunately have
access to a lot of the really high-end
stuff that I would definitely be
interested in checking out if I wasn't
already I would say though apart from
that since it is still tech and related
to what I do higher end cameras is
something that I'm definitely like I I
kind of I'm getting to know cameras
better and I'm just checking out some of
the really high-end ones like these are
black magics there's a Ursa and there
are some mini which each cost three year
or five grand depending which one you go
with red of course also if you're going
more towards professional level although
still I was about to say reasonably
priced they're very expensive but for
professional cameras there they're very
reasonably priced
oh yeah checking out some some of those
that would be super sweet I would say
maybe I'll maybe I'll hit up brandon and
i'll be--i'll doing an internship with
him
- Media Group and just be his like I'll
be his his gaffer his wait is it a
gaffer grip shoot I always get those
mixed up anyway next question is from
dizzy kipper and dizzy kipper asks can
you do more content on capture cards
let's look for in a card now that kind
of thing as well as the software a very
good question and since this is from two
months ago when I did my last probing
Paul you probably were not aware that I
was going to post this video which is on
the razor ripsaw USB 3 capture card
which I reviewed and I have also been
using since then it's actually plugged
in right there although I'm not using it
to capture what you're seeing right now
I'm using black magic for that but um
yeah razor ripsaw is a very nice card
granted they're all like 170 hundred 80
ish bucks but the it's external USB 3
cuts way down on the latency so like
kind of what you see is what you get
there's a little bit of lag so but I'm
you can use it like I can use it to
directly control like a computer even
though I'm just watching the the capture
screen unlike OBS or something like that
which is pretty nice there's also the
Elgato Game Capture HD 60s which I don't
have but I might be trying out I
actually need to follow up with them
which is kind of my bad but I've been
busy lately there's lots of graphics
cards coming out and that kind of thing
as far as software OBS definitely OBS
studio is really cool and that I use and
I will maybe do a video on I'm still
kind of getting to know it myself so
there's that and then of course there's
xsplit which is a very nice piece of
software you do got to pay for the good
one though for the broadcaster thank you
for the question though the mono Turner
asks Paul what inspired you and Kyle to
start awesome hardware he shows up late
to the party and maybe miss the start of
the inception I don't think we have a
really like good inception story but
awesome hardware we have now done 127
videos of that I think that I think that
would actually mean 66 yeah yeah we just
did episode 66 I should look at the
episode number Paul that would make
sense
yeah we've just done our 66th episode of
awesome hardware they keep getting more
views people seem to like him
it's sort of inception well I have I
definitely to give
to Linus because he's the one who
started the wind show and Kenneth was
the first person to start doing the live
tech show thing so definitely I mean we
tried not to rip him off entirely but
it's hard to when you're like we're
gonna do a live tech show we try to
differentiate ours a little bit though
of course we have the alcohol drinking
which we just said that will make it
more fun for us well yeah we try to have
fun and it came about because we wanted
to have one a place where we could talk
more broadly about lots of different
tech topics since there's so many things
that happen each given week and we can
only really cover one of the two of them
if we're doing dedicated videos like as
far as reviews or that kind of thing and
then the other reason was just to have
more interaction with fans because we've
got the live streams and the feeds going
and we do look at chat from time to time
occasionally we read chat and we answer
it and stuff so that's a great reason
that we do it as well okay I think we
just get thank you for that question as
well 16db asks hey Paul if I send you a
plate of Norwegian chocolate it's
supposed to be some of the best in the
world would you and Kyle give it a score
and an episode of awesome hardware I can
hypothetically send you some Norwegian
brewed beer as well to try called what
is this Aetna Aetna this is like a
Norwegian symbol this it means empty set
to me so this is Aetna empty set L is
the type of beer if we want to try it
out and give it a score or rate them 16
VV if that is how your name is
pronounced yes absolutely if you want to
send Norwegian chocolate or beer send it
right here Paul's hardware appeal box
for three to five Diamond Bar California
nine one seven six five and we will we
will gladly try it out provided you know
that you're on the up-and-up and
everything which I have to assume you
are being Norwegian but anyway guys
that's all for this episode of probing
Paul I hope you've enjoyed it if you did
hit the thumbs up button leave me more
questions down in the questions section
down below cuz I had such good ones last
time I didn't even end up reaching out
for Twitter - Twitter or anything this
time so sorry people on Twitter maybe
next time I'll leave you back with
another one of these next month's and of
course I've got tons of awesome new tech
videos like that msi gtx 1070 they're
two-way SLI video coming out this
weekend of
the RX 480 at an indeterminate point in
the future which you can probably figure
out if you read the Internet and even
more 1080 stuff come in as well so yeah
stay tuned subscribe thank you for
watching we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
