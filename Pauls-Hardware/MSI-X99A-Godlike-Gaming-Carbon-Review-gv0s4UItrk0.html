heard the term godlike was back in the
dark days of my Diablo 2 addiction as
gaming parlance evolved the quest for
the proper hyperbolic terminology to
describe gaming itself became ever more
difficult after all how does one outdo
preeminent superlatives such as ultimate
uber epic and extreme whether you're
talking about randomly generated stats
on a grand matron bow or in this case
the best damn x99 motherboard the msi
can engineer godlike just seems
appropriate this is the msi x99s gaming
carbon
it supports Intel's enthusiast line of
haswell-e socket 2011 - lead processors
and features a neutral black color
scheme to provide better flexibility for
the built in RGB lighting it also costs
$600 so as you can see I've already been
playing with this board and I've
assembled a bit of a test build to
showcase the looks and the lighting
let's start from the top though with a
rundown of features and specifications
starting with a quick unboxing you get a
very premium feeling package LOL with
the godlike gaming carbon and not a bad
set of accessories either a door hanger
and a fold-out color motherboard layout
guide say to labeling stickers and a
driver DVD three manuals for the
hardware the software and a Quick Start
Guide no less than ten black SATA cables
half of them with 90 degree angled
connectors two sizable antenna for the
built-in 800 2011 killer Wi-Fi these
have magnetic bases on them too for easy
positioning which is nice a black and
red IO shield that is unchanged from the
black and red version of the x99
god-like that launched last year
it is a nice IO shield though and for
ribbon style SLI bridges that should
accommodate you for most two three and
four white SLI configs although I would
say it would be nice to have gotten a
rigid PCB version for maybe three and
four waking things you also get voltage
check leads a G series case badge a
metal sheath eight gig on the go USB
Drive with Type C and micro beat
connectors that has drivers and software
on it I would love to see this become a
trend for all motherboards over optical
discs with drivers by the way you get a
turbo you with you dot to card which is
an m2 - u - mini SAS adapter for drives
like until 750 series and it thankfully
also has a PCB that matches the
motherboard since this would be very
visible in most systems and finally your
M connectors for front panel
and a quarter-inch to eighth inch
adapter for the big headphone plug on
the rear i/o the x99 a god-like gaming
carbon motherboard itself is dat ex and
just screams high-end @u thanks to its
significant heft the black carbon fiber
accents and the attention to detail in
the design of course thanks to the LGA
2011 - 3 socket and x99 chipset this
motherboard supports existing haswell-e
processors like the 8 core 59 60 X and
although it's too early to officially
confirm I would be very very extremely
surprised if this board it doesn't also
support Broadwell ECP use like the
promised 10 core 69 50 X which is
rumored to launch in the next few months
while pure gamers might opt for Intel's
less expensive skylake platform for
those who want to work and play on their
computer there's just no substitute for
the raw CPU horsepower available on this
enthusiast platform beyond that you've
got 8 DIMM slots for quad-channel ddr4
memory up to 16 gigs for dim now for up
to hundred and twenty eight gigs total
and MSI has validated kits going up to
3400 speed
also note the steel-reinforced DIMM
slots not that ddr4 sticks are super
heavy or anything but they do look
pretty badass they provide some emi
shielding and they match the PCIe slots
down below quite nicely speaking of
which you get five full-sized PCI
Express gen3 by 16 slots giving you the
flexibility of triple slot spacing with
a couple GPUs or a three-way and
four-way SLI or crossfire support if
you're using a 40 PCIe Lane CPU like a
59 30 K or 59 60 X my build here has a
5820k in it right now which has 28 PCIe
lanes and should never be used with this
motherboard so sorry if you bought this
board and if at da 20k return them get a
$300 x99 board and a 59 30k for about
$100 less these PCIe slots also have
that steel-reinforced design though
which continues to look quite badass and
also provides more support for heady
heavy graphics card as well as that emi
shielding for fan support you get five
total headers two for CPU and three for
system fans all are for pin PWM but on a
board this size is a couple more would
have been nice to be honest along the
bottom of the gaming carbon you've got a
debug LED one of two USB 3.1 headers
front panel connectors a switch for the
dual BIOS a couple system fan headers a
couple USB 2.0 headers a slow mode
switch for exotic cooling clear CMOS
jumper and an odd
which to choose between front panel
audio and the ESS supported quarter-inch
headphone jack on the rear i/o for
storage options there's the single key
mm to slot between those last two PCIe
connectors which supports SATA or nvme
connections you dot two via that riser
card in the accessories or standard m2
drives at forty to sixty and eighty
millimeters in length it's in a good
spot as it won't be blocked by most
single or - a GPU configurations
although it does share bandwidth with
the SATA Express connector on the board
so you can't use both at once you get 10
total SATA rf3 ports on the board one
through six have raid support and five
and six have the aforementioned
SATA Express option there's plenty of
connectivity here for storage although
I'm inclined to wish for another MDOT
two slots that would have taken some
PCIe lanes away though and I think MSI
wanted to leave the sport wide open for
choreographic scard setups moving up the
right side of the board we have the
other USB 3.1 header that supports
supercharging as well 24 pin main power
connection third system fan header and
voltage read points next to those are
the power reset and OC Genie surface
mounted buttons OC Genie being MSI's
automatic overclocking feature there's
also an OC switch with an LED when the
LED is in the blue position OC Genie
will overclock some and when it's in the
red position OC Genie will be more
aggressive and overclock more now let's
take a look at the CPU socket flanked on
both sides by those ddr4 memory slots
it's a turbo socket meaning it's
actually got extra pins totalling 2036
connections instead of the standard 2011
which can help with high end over
overclocking particularly if you're
overclocking the cache MSI has also
taken steps to clear this area as much
as possible from other components that's
to make room for ln2 pots that are used
for exotic cooling despite that you
might run into some space conflicts if
you're using a tower style air cooler
and a GPU in the top slot so bear that
in mind actually originally set the
system up with an inner max air cooler
but I had to rotate at 90 degrees in
order to make it fit and I didn't like
how it looks so I grabbed the Corsair h
110 and installed that instead for power
delivery you have a 12 phase design with
55 amp dr. mas MOSFETs 60 amp Super
ferrite chokes and tantalum capacitors
to provide smooth reliable power for
overclocking the V RMS have two
dedicated heat sinks with the heat pipe
connecting them and supplemental CPU
power is delivered via eight pin and
four pink connectors at the top of the
board you should have no need for a
discreet sound card thanks to the audio
boost three pro configuration on the god
light gaming carbon powered by Anna
hemic and supporting both 7.1 channel
surround and high impedance headphones
via the quarter inch rear Jack MS I went
with chemi-con audio capacitors
independent Texas Instruments amps for
each audio pathway and another ESS saver
es nine zero one eight DAC for the big
headphone jack it supports up to 600 ohm
impedance headphones all these audio
components are EMI shielded and can be
further tweaked and tuned using the
naheem ik software on two rear pedal io
on the left or a ps2 combo port and a
couple USB 2.0 ports next to that is a
clear CMOS button and then your fastest
invest is USB 3.1 gen2 ports in type a
and type C trim which are controlled by
an as media asm1 142 chip to the right
of that our dual killer a 2400 Gigabit
rj45 LAN ports and four more USB 3.1
type-a connectors you can effectively
combine these killer NIC ports with the
killer 800 2.11 AC Wi-Fi card right next
to it for two thousand eight hundred and
sixty-seven megabits per second of
theoretical throughput using MSI's
killer doubleshot x3 pro software which
kind of combines them all together it
also does packet prioritization so your
gaming packets get priority over say
your windows update packets for example
the 802 dot eleven AC Wi-Fi is dual band
and it also supports miracast finally
you've got your gold plated audio
connections this big quarter-inch jack
for headphones and eighth inch jacks for
Mike in 7.1 channel surround out or an
optical Toslink s/pdif connection is
that all no not quite
let's take a look at the UEFI and then
we will wrap things up with an RGB LED
mystic light demo guys I am now
tapping delete so I can jump into the
BIOS here and give you guys at least a
quick walkthrough to show you kind of
what to expect I'm not going to go into
detail with all the different things but
hopefully at least you know give you a
better idea and hey first off on a point
out you got full mouse and keyboard
support the mouse was even plug and play
I boot it up without it plugged in and
and I just plugged it in and it worked -
at least I did that early what I was
kind of browsing through here at first
anyway you'll notice that you got x99 a
got like gaming carbon with even the
carbon version of the Buy
they block that everything here you know
it's kind of cool at the top you got
sort of a quick view of different things
like your CPU temperature what's
installed with the a 20k current memory
configuration and what it's all set to
as well as a boot device priority and
you can drag and drop stuff right here
if you want to change up your boot
devices you also have quick access to
buttons like OC Genie so you can
activate that here rather than going
through the pushing the actual button on
the motherboard
there's also an X MP button you can use
that to quickly enable XMP mode for your
memory
yeah and that some shortcuts in the top
right let you take a screenshot for
example add things to favorites or
there's even a drop-down here for
different languages settings tab over
here is going to have access to some
basic stuff like system status advanced
this also get you your boot priority
this has more boot options than any
motherboard I've ever different there's
actually 13 different food options in
the boot prior to here it's a lot anyway
also some security options if you want
to add an admin password or save and
exit here's your overclocking area this
is what probably a lot of you interested
in i've already switched this over to
advanced mode it's in simple mode by
defaults but here you can access well
lots of the stuff you guys are probably
familiar with if you've done much
overclocking on x99 again i'm not going
to explain what all these are but i will
say that if you mouse over each one the
area over here on the right side will
sort of give you a little rundown of
what what it all is and give you a
little bit better idea of what you're
doing as you're making adjustments to
all these digital power delivery ringing
bus voltage all all that good stuff you
know you play with all these settings
and that's how you overclock it's a
simplest explanation
whatever clock you've ever seen anyway
CPU specs down here as well as memory
and CPU features the EM flash function
is available right here this will allow
you to easily update the BIOS from a USB
Drive then if you mess all over to the
right here you've got an actual pop out
that comes out so slow light access
profiles so you can easily save to
profile you can even load them onto a
USB or recover them from a USB Hardware
monitor will access the hardware monitor
function which takes a little moment to
load but then you get access to CPU and
system temperatures at the top you can
access all of the fans and here I really
like what they've done with a smart fan
mode gives you four different points of
intonation or I don't know what these
are there's a term for that but then you
can drag these around so you can give
yourself a nice
easy fan curve so you know your fan
stays pretty quiet until things actually
start to get warm or that kind of thing
you do have that also available for your
system fan so I only have one system fan
plugged in but by default you just have
a single guy you can drag around here or
you can turn on smart fan mode and that
will again give you that fan ramp-up
option which is really really nice to
have actually really like what MSI has
done with the fan control see finally
you've got the board Explorer and this
is just a board Explorer it will show
you actually pretty accurately as you
mouse over different things what
everything is and what's installed if
you mouse over the SATA for example you
get sort of a blow-up look at the SATA
ports if you mouse over something where
something's connected like the CPU it
will tell you that you have a 5820k
installed or whatever CPU you haven't
have installed same goes with your
memory slots you can even get a close-up
of the i/o and what's currently plugged
into the i/o like the mouse and keyboard
anyway that's that's pretty handy -
moving right along to an LED lighting
demo and I can I get things situated
here the first thing that I did actually
was go back into the UEFI BIOS and I
disabled the LEDs on the board because
this board has several LEDs other than
the five points of lighting that you get
right out of the gate it's got some LEDs
on the rear i/o and the NIC slots back
there that are red it's got some more
LEDs down here like a blue one and you
can go into the UEFI BIOS and you can
disable all of those it will also
disable your surface mounted power reset
buttons up there the one thing it does
not turn off is a debug led LED down
here in the lower right I wish you could
do that too so MSI make that happen in
the future maybe I'm loading up the
mystic light app there's actually two
ways to control the LEDs on this board
if you're not running the app or you're
not booted up into Windows and running
the software directly from MSI
everything will be read kind of like you
see it right now if you get the app you
can load it up and it connects directly
via bluetooth there's a Bluetooth
actually an add-on mini PCIe chip on
this board it's kind of hidden
underneath the shroud but it is there
and then you can use mystic lights so
mystic light is is pretty full-featured
actually they've had this since about
last year so first off you can just
bring up the color wheel and it can kind
of tap wherever you want on the wheel
it'll tell you what color you choose
down there in the middle and I have what
I like about this board is none of the
LEDs shine right right out at you
they're actually all directed down onto
the board so you'll notice there's a
bank down here on the lower left kind of
near the sound there's a small light
that's in the chipset which kind of
shoots out to the side that one's really
a lot less visible than the others but
it is still there you would be able to
see more of it up above if the graphics
card wasn't blocking it by the way if
you're wondering why I'm using a GTX 970
in this build it's because it's the only
card I could find it didn't light up on
its own and didn't really conflict for
the color scheme I put a black piece of
tape over the blue on it so everything
else would stand out a little bit better
and there beyond that there's another
Bank of lights that's up here just below
the CPU socket that's kind of right
where the just it's right where the
heatsink is and it's just north of where
the GPU is then lastly at two more sets
one is up up by the power delivery very
top of the board and then there's
another set that is just to the left of
the memory slot kind of between the rear
i/o and the memory which is also a
little bit more difficult to see but
gives gives a pretty cool effect down in
there anyway moving on aside from just
choosing you know between different what
different colors that you might want to
put on there there's also some functions
on here so there's a gaming function
that you can enable and that will
actually actively interact with games
that you might be playing in various
ways I didn't try that out too much
there's a breathing function of course
that you can do so
yeah flashing which gives kind of kind
of makes it look like old like
lightnings going off and this will also
cycle between colors so it's kind of
cool now you have snack which allows you
to stack some different functions so
this is this kind of it's kind of wild
you know it just kind of jumps between a
bunch of different things again it's
cycling between colors it's flashing we
have the wave function that I kind of
like so this will kind of cycle through
a wave different colors across the board
of course if you really want you can
just turn them all off and then they
only only DS you're left with is debug
led down there which which is still
fairly useful there's one other function
you can do in here and that's in the Far
rate this is on the app again and you
can hit play and you can load up a song
and you can have it go along with music
so this is a this is a Ben princey album
I hope
guys can't hear very well because I
don't wanna get flagged anyway he did
the FTL soundtrack and everyone should
go check out his stuff I'm not going to
play too much of this because as you can
maybe tell it's kind of cycling through
along with the music so that's a pretty
cool function too anyway a very
full-featured
app and there's a lot of cool things you
can do with it I'm pretty impressed so
in conclusion the things that I like
about this motherboard are one that MSI
listened to fans such as myself last
year when we said that we wanted a
blacked out version of this board
instead of the original red highlighted
version two would be that the LED
options and Bluetooth control of the LED
options are very well implemented and
very flexible just a lot of fun to play
with and three would be of course the
extreme cooling and overclocking
features that have already been put to
good use on the non-carbon version of
this board with some really really
extreme overclocks as for cons I would
have liked to see maybe another fan
header or two and although the LEDs are
awesome I was really hoping to see an
RGB header on the board itself I
probably wouldn't mention this if I
hadn't recently reviewed the ASUS
Maximus 8 formula which allows you to
add more lights to the case and have
them also controlled by the board lastly
it's just really expensive at $600 MSRP
is $50 more even than the original x99 a
goblet gaming that launched in 2015 so
to sum up this is a niche motherboard
that is probably out of the price range
for most people that said it certainly
lives up to the godlike moniker thanks
to the build quality and features and
for those who can afford it it will
certainly be the centerpiece of future
epic gaming and workstation desktop
builds I personally can't wait to see
the first monstrous build the feature
this board a 69 50 X and a 4-way
next-gen GPU configuration assuming of
course that all the rumors about those
things turn out to be true that's all
for this review though if you enjoyed it
then you can help me out by supporting
my cause ways to do this include hitting
that like button right down there

I've also still got hoodies mugs and
pint glasses so get them too while
they're hot and finally you can
subscribe to my channel if you're not
already and as always
I probably wouldn't mention this if I
hadn't recently reviewed the ASUS
Maximus 8 formula which allows you to
add more lights to the case and have a
