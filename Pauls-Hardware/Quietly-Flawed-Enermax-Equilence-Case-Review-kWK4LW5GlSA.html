description and get inspired for your
next project what's up guys welcome back
to Pauls hardware today's video is a
case video this is the enter max
equal ins silent case the model is EC a
three five one zero so I'm going to set
up the system in here give you guys some
feedback on what I think of it now the
price right now for this case if you
look at Amazon and Newegg it's about a
hundred and ten dollars so it was a
hundred and six dollars on new ache for
some reason and enter max has tried to
cram some high-end features in here
including a backlit LED panel a four
millimeter panoramic tempered glass
providing panoramic views triple
radiator support a power supply shroud
of course which has become standard in
modern cases and some silence features
some silent features I guess I should
say including sound dampening but let's
begin by of course taking it out of the
box
let's get in here for a quick closer
look and oh my gosh the reflections many
many reflections from this case now it's
made of a steel frame with the pretty
typical ATX layout you have a single
tempered glass panel on this side which
is a fairly dark smoked tempered glass
piece it's held on by four a little
metal thumb screws they do have Phillips
heads in them and these two screws are
used not just there but there also
holding on the opposite side panel as
well this side panel will just kind of
pop out from the side I'll show you that
in just a minute
on the front you actually have an
extruded acrylic piece so even though it
is not tempered glass as you can
probably see right here very reflective
on both but actually has a pretty nice
matching look you have an inner max logo
on the here on the side that will light
up I believe in red once we system
turned on and here friend IO we got a
big old power button reset button this
is a three position fan controller that
will be indicated by the lights right
there and then a strange addition of
plugs on all these ports here but these
are protective plugs I don't know if you
want to keep them in all the time to
keep dust out maybe possibly but a
couple USB 3.0 ports mic and headphone
jack yes these are Jack's not buttons
they also have little plugs in them and
then a couple USB 2.0 ports there as
well no type-c and no 3.1 gen2
unfortunately but at least a full layout
and I do like having four ports up here
rather than just a couple USB 3 tempered
glass side piece again is held on by
four thumb screws and it is just a
single piece of tempered glass with four
holes in it this has been pretty
standard for 2017 but we've just been
shown like the define are six recently
that has at least sort of an enhanced
tempered glass piece so I'm starting to
feel like this is getting a little bit
less desirable but again a fairly dark
tint on that as well
that will actually let you see the
inside of the case enter Mac's logo down
here at the bottom and then we've got
standard ATX layout pre-installed
motherboard standoffs which is nice not
a lot of rubber grommets in here for
cable management there's a couple up
here for peace for you
Oh supplemental power and possible fans
and that kind of thing then over here on
the right side there's a bracket you can
use this to mount hard drive so you can
use this to actually mount fans they
have set it up so you could set up a
radiator here although I feel like that
would be kind of weird because there's
no pastor on the back here for the air
to flow out of and that said though
let's get this side panel off as well
and here you can see with those two
screws off it'll just kind of fold out
just a little bit reminds me a little
bit of cooler masters recent master box
series of cases the side panel itself
does have a sound dampening material on
the other side fairly reasonably sturdy
steel and then this catch lifts down at
the bottom which is what allows you to
position it on the side of the case and
what's it kind of hanging there like so
leave this off for now at the back of
the case here we can see our exhaust fan
120 or 140 millimeter mount there and
not yet for the rear panel IO you have a
total of seven expansion slots no
vertical GPU mount there and this is one
of the types of cases that is flush in
the back with the GPU mounting solution
so there's this sort of pop-out piece
back here and that is where you actually
screw in your graphics cards or other
expansion cards that you might put in
there at the bottom is our power supply
shroud and our max logo on the side of
that and I thought it's interesting that
they again to say to put a couple
grommets there at the back for routing
up probably HD audio and USB connections
but no grommet here and this little
pass-through which would be the most
visible one and that's where cables
would come up probably for your graphics
cards so I would like to see a grommet
right there to be perfectly honest
there's another look at that rear
bracket on the back again mounts for 3.5
inch hard drives mounts for 120
millimeter fans so you can actually put
a couple of those right there and that
would actually help to block some of the
visibility of the cables going back
behind this piece because that is one of
the complaints from a couple of the
reviews that I sort of did some research
on before doing this video as you can
really get a good look at all the cables
back through those brackets and right
here we can see the pre-installed cables
with USB HD audio USB 3 USB 2 front
panel connectors are all black cabling
so that is a nice idea the bits of
rainbow blah
on the USB to an HD audio which is a
little disappointing but those are
pretty common to see in computer cases
and then beyond that down here you got a
total of six three pin fan headers and
that is to connect up up to six fans to
your three position fan controller Brett
the fans that are included our inter max
well there's a 140 at the back and then
two 120 is included in the front and
they do have dual use cables so you can
connect them to a three pin motherboard
connector or you can just plug them in
straight to molex I don't recommend just
plugging in the molex so because that
will join the fans at full speed beyond
that fair amounts of cable tie down
points back here know clearly defines
sort of vertical running position for
your main 24 pin cables so that's
another thing I would like to see and
you can kind of tuck them in here but
again they'll be fairly visible from the
front of the case I've got a couple SSD
trace here held on by more of these same
thumb screws that the side panels are
held on with would've liked to have seen
these be captive thumb screws they are
not but the SSD trace our all-metal
point can be removed like so and you can
position a couple of them back there for
some additional storage here at the
bottom there are two more little drive
trays which have some plastic mounts in
them the accessories are included in
this one again these will support a 2.5
inch or 3.5 inch drives here's a look at
the accessories that come in the box you
get a product manual one long velcro
strap and one short velcro strap very
specifically three zip ties they do give
you a speaker which is these are nice to
have if you don't have one I guess some
longer screws here for mounting
radiators and that kind of thing you get
a couple enter max magnets these are
refrigerator magnets there you go just
leave them on there I would be right
under underneath the 8-bit levar burton
and then of course extra screws for
everything else and they do include a
metal nut here for tightening your
motherboard standoffs also a nice thing
to have so I'd say a good selection of
accessories from an ER max
alright the power supply mounts right
down here at the bottom and over down
here take a look at those feet this is
some interesting
feat design yeah they're made of plastic
but there's some ribbon underneath them
and the power supply does have a hole
dust filter here which is not the
easiest to get out okay dust filter not
a decent dust filter but not very easy
to actually remove it just it locks in
there and then cuz the feet go all the
way across the bottom it's it's like you
really need two hands or yeah but I'd
rather have the dust filter than that
attempting to remove our front panel
here to take a look at some outing
points for the radiators now their
precip tied in here you're definitely
not gonna leave them that way you're
gonna want to release all these and
everything also the front panel is
permanently connected to the front i/o
which means if you want to pull it all
the way off you're gonna need to plug
all that tada
there is our front panel it's all the
connections up in there and we can also
see a little bit more sound dampening on
here but again another one of the cases
for 2017 that has completely solid front
piece right there so all of your airflow
in the front is going to be coming in
through these vents on the side and the
small gap at the bottom which is also
there so you can grab the front panel to
pull it off if you want to so I'm
probably not gonna be the best airflow
especially depending on where you mount
these fans it comes with two pre-mounted
hundred and twenty millimeter fans there
at the front you can do up to three and
you can do a 360 millimeter radiator up
here one thing I might consider doing
just out of the box if you're not going
to install radiator up there is move
these fans from the outside here to the
inside mount them right there if you're
not gonna have anything else that might
conflict with them mounted over here on
the crossbeam piece that would give a
little bit more space underneath this
panel just for airflow so that those
fans could possibly be a little bit more
effective and I thought there's another
dust filter up here that's part I
haven't really talked about yet is up
here on top and here you have a
removable panel so I got some more sound
dampening on that so if you're less
concerned about airflow pop that on top
magnets hold it in place
reason
well and remove it if you would like to
let more air at the top or get a couple
more months up here so you can do up to
three sixty millimeter radiator up here
or to 140 fans or eight order an 80
millimeter radiator of course that's all
going to be very dependent on the
motherboard you have installed here how
large the heat sinks and whatnot are on
there and how thick your radiator is as
far as support there goes but good to
have support on both the front and the
top for a couple configurations like
that it's really missing anything I'd
say it's maybe a secure location or a
pre installed location for a pump
because there's a bit of space here up
at the front of the system but no no
pre-drilled mounts are anything like
that all that said let's go ahead and
get a system installed so after some
further explanation I just wanted to
demonstrate sort of the quirkiness and
maybe some missed potential here for
this crossbeam support section that they
have at the back now first off I thought
these were 3.5 inch mounts on that they
actually are not they're 2.5 inch mounts
so they're the bottom mounts for the SSD
and you could put one right there and
then you can put another one down here
now bear in mind this would put the
business end where you put the plugs on
on the left side here which would
probably not be ideal you'd have to wrap
them around to go back behind there to
get behind in the cable management area
you could flip it of course and go this
way over here but if you have fans in
the front and as you can see I've
switched these hundred twenty millimeter
fans over to the inside of the case so
that they have a little bit more
breathing room inside the front panel
it's just it's just doesn't seem quite
ideal also you could easily have fit
three or maybe even four 2.5 inch drive
mounts along here I feel like if this
was designed a little bit differently
finally again there's hundred and twenty
millimeter fan mounts that are kind of
slot space so you can shift them up and
down a little bit there and I think
that's meant so you can take some flashy
fans and put them there that maybe light
up or something like that but again just
a very impractical position for it
because behind that you just have a
solid flat wall of the other side panel
of the case so you're not going to be
pulling air from or pushing air to
anywhere especially if you were
considering mounting a radiator or
something like that at least not without
modding the rear side panel to provide
some additional ventilation so it seems
like there could have been a lot more
done
this piece right here to provide
additional mounting points for SSDs or
just ignore the fan mounts right there
that really is not necessary I can't get
the system installed in here in case
you're wondering this is the same system
that I installed recently in the Defiant
r6 and I'll put links to the various
components in the description down below
it is an Intel based system and I'm just
going to power this on right now and
that will give us our first look for
example at the accent lighting in red
the enter max logo on the side here as
well as there's some back lighting on
the ports up there for USB and mic and
headphone jack I will say it's actually
blending in quite nicely right now
simply because the gigabytes Z 370
motherboard that we're using also has
some red accents on it I will point out
though that this is just a single color
for the accent lights on the case itself
so for anyone who's interested in RGB
theme or something like that you are
stuck with red there so you're gonna
need to pick colors that match with that
or complimentary to it now as far as
silence goes I will say this gets an
initial thumbs-up from me simply because
the included fans of the three of them
to 120s in the front and the 140 in the
back I've routed and connected all up to
the 3 position fan controller and right
now that is in full speed mode or the
fastest fan mode for those so even with
that it's very quiet and I can even turn
it down further to make this a really
silent running system I will say again
that I was glad that I moved these two
front fans from the initial position
they were in inside the case just to
provide a little bit more airflow intake
to them through this front panel here
and even with them position there it
does look like you might still have
enough room for the fans and a radiator
if you are using a slim version now the
biggest shortcoming practically speaking
of this case I think is just something
that I've kind of come to take for
granted with cases and that is dust
filtration and there is no dust filter
on the front intake of this case I think
that's a pretty significant miss and
also something that enter max probably
could have accounted for just by simply
including a magnetic mesh dust filter
that can go over the 240 or even all the
way down to the 360 millimeter fan
configuration that is potentially
available up there with the fans moved
back here that's definitely something
that you could easily pop on there and
those are sold separately so if
you are interested in this case that's
something I would definitely recommend
getting as an add-on item just put the
fans like I've done here
pop a mesh mesh dust filter on there at
the front and you will be in a much
better situation in three months or six
months when it comes to the dust buildup
in your system so to sum up the cons for
the inter max excellence case I think
would be definitely this rear panel back
here just little bits lacking when it
comes to what you can mount there and
also a little bit to open and when it
comes to actually providing some
protection for the cables that you might
have routed back there second would be
the front intake up here first off it's
blocked off by the solid front panel I
would like to see a little bit more
airflow there and then of course the
lack of a dust filter is one that really
stands out to me third is just gonna be
the price at one hundred and ten dollars
I feel like the feature set that you get
with this case is good but there's
definitely competitive options in the SE
eighty dollar range when you look at
stuff like fractals mess with mesh if I
see for example or some of the higher
ends NZXT s340 cases not a bad case by
any stretch but I would like to see the
price coming down a little bit overall
the build quality is really solid really
silent operation out of the box thanks
to some extra foam padding as well as
some pretty decent fans that they've
included in there that pair up nicely
with the fan controller and then overall
I think it's a pretty good-looking case
I like that the acrylic on the front
matches with a tempered glass side panel
and as you can see with the system I've
set up here pretty quickly you can get
yourself a nice looking build without
too much effort so I'd like to say thank
you to enter max you're sending the
excellence case over for me to take a
look at if you guys enjoyed this video
definitely hit the thumbs up button let
me know in the comments if this is a
case that you would consider or if
there's other cases that stand out to
you that you feel would be a better
option thanks again for watching guys
and we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
