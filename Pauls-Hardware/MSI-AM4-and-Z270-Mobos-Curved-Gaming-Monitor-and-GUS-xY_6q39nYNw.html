coverage I want to start off of course
by thanking my sponsors for this event
which are gigabytes deep cool as well as
ocz a Toshiba company thanks to all
those guys looks for them or didn't the
description below i'm an msi right now
though and i'm gonna talk first about
the motherboards that are here behind me
a bunch of z2 70 stuff they also have a
new external GPU dock and they also have
a monitor that they're showing up now
finally i am for motherboards so
starting with these motherboards here
you might notice they're arranged in
series is so they've done this to help
you more easily determine what
motherboard you might need pro series
personal series performance gaming
series and the enthusiast gaming series
the pro series over here is made more
for professionals so they're a little
bit more subdued a little bit more low
profile they have silver accents on the
motherboards themselves this one is
labeled g2 70 pc mate and the pc mate
ones are usually much more reasonably
priced as well they have a little inny
ATX version down there that's a be 250 i
pro so it's a business grade chipset but
those are often perfectly adequate for
gaming your multi-purpose systems as
well so there's a quick look at the pro
series the arsenal' gaming series i
thought was kind of cool they were with
more I mean definitely like aimed at
gamers type aesthetic for the design
there's two tomahawk boards and also a
mortar board they're essentially the
same except for colors and size of
course so the the design that they
actually have printed on the back of the
PCB there
these actually meant it looked like a
tank tread so it's like your motherboard
was ran over by a tank or something
which is just super exciting they also
have it available in white right here so
if you want to do a white build you can
do that as well these are all going to
course support the features that MSI has
in lots of those 8270 boards so support
for cable like support for like MDOT -
I'm noticing all these boards have at
least 2 m dot two slots that one there
has two m dot - this one here has two
him that - the mortar down at the bottom
also has the m dot - and this one has
the same visual
as the full-size tomahawk so there's a
few of those next up moving into the
performance gaming series and these are
the board's that you're gonna want if
you want higher end gaming features and
also if you want RGB LED supports
because our GB LEDs are what all gamers
want as we all know this is a gaming Pro
carbon ZT 70 actually have this
motherboard at home right now so perhaps
I can bring you some more information on
it in the future again go with like lots
of them that to support there's a couple
on that one in the middle and down down
towards the bottom and RGB LEDs both on
the chipset heatsink up here in the
corner on the vrm cover and the i/o
cover and then there's also RGB LEDs
going down the right side of the board
here's the Krait gaming the kraits
series has been typically black and
whites or black and white color scheme
this one has like the zebra stripe or
Claus or something like that going
across the top they've also had a nice
detail here in the PCI Express slots
these aren't lining up right because
it's a demo board but those are actually
plasti dipped which is kind of cool and
then of course a couple m2 s KB leg
supports and all the goodness that comes
along with Z 270 finally at the bottom
is e 270 I gaming Pro carbon AC this is
a tiny little Mike Mini ITX board again
this one has RGB LEDs but other than
that the color scheme is fairly neutral
thank you for that MSI got a bit of
carbon-fiber accents and folk folk
carbon-fiber accents down the sides and
then again there would be an RGB strip
going up the side here if there was
power running to the board right now
this is the z2 70 X bar gaming titanium
this features like gain boost option
which you can press a red button there
and it will automatically just reduce
your processor and overclock at the 5
points in gigahertz provided of course
you have the adequate cooling installed
there this one also has 3 m dot two
slots as well as au dot to know you
can't use those all at the same time and
yes there is some limitation on like
raid 0 and that two configurations due
to the chipset but hopefully I'll come
back to that in the future and give it
give it another look and maybe do some
raid m dot 2 performance testing this
board right here honestly is probably
one of my top favorites z2 70 boards
that have launched now RGB LEDs are
first there they're there
there but that's not really my favorite
feature my favorite feature is just
everything that they wedged under this
board which includes again three m dot
two slots
au dot two down down there a couple USB
3.0 headers this USB 3.1 header that's
right there
the board is just it's just stacked of
course you got features that you would
expect on a higher end gaming board like
surface mount a power reset and all that
good stuff and and I mean it looks
pretty cool too
and again a fairly neutral color scheme
to go along with the RGB LED lighting I
just said LED lighting which is
redundant here is a quick look at MSI's
LED configuration they have it going on
right here in the system next to this
computer now RGB LEDs I mean love them
or hate them they're here right now and
they have been developing the
capabilities of them for quite some time
so here everything is just going crazy
that that's because people have been
messing around with the different
options over here so you can select
pretty much any component in here that
has RGB lighting like the hyper extend
support froze or XL msi clutch GM 70 MSI
bigger gk7 TT kale the this is for like
the keyboard and all the stuff that's
connected so you can control those all
from the same centralized software
location and then that gives you the
ability to change the lighting and
colors and stuff like that so I just
changed the HyperX dims to green look at
that did you even know that HyperX made
RGB LEDs did ddr4 memory you know now
there they are we can kind of cool
anyway so that's available and
configurable in the MSI app for control
that's in the gaming app I should say in
the LED section so check it out and if
you already have an MSI product with RGB
LED lighting download the app because
they've been updating it now if you
hadn't already noticed all of these
monitors that they have on display here
are MSI monitors MSI is entering the
monitor space they're starting off at
this one here which is kind of an every
man's gaming monitor is what I'll say
it's a 1080 resolution display but it is
curved ever so slightly and in what I
would say is a decent level of curvature
and curved displays are okay if you're
using it as a monitor TVs is bad
it's okay other than that has 144 Hertz
refresh rate it is a TN panel in there
and they say they're going to bring this
to market for somewhere in the 250 to
300 dollar range which is pretty good
for those specs and and what you get out
of that now I'm curious if it's going to
have support for such a free sink or G
sink that was not really stated so far
they're still working on this it's not
going to be available soon but perhaps
in the first half of this year we might
see an MSI monitor so keep an eye out
for it down here though is Gus yeah
that's Gus
say hi to Gus everyone Gus actually
stands for the gaming upgrade wait
gaming GPU upgrade system I believe
that's what it is basically it's an
external Thunderbolt 3 GPU dock it
includes a 500 watt 80 plus gold power
supply if you have a device that's
capable of thunders - Thunderbolts 3
connectivity you can just plug it in
here and then you can use an external
GPU so great for something like a very
tiny mini PC or something like that or
if you have a laptop and you want to
plug in the laptop and game on it in the
future
pretty interesting design here it's very
asymmetrical I was noticing but
all-metal you know plenty of ventilation
going on there up on the front is a USB
3.0 port that does support quick charge
there inside they have an MSI GPU which
I have to assume is the GTX 1080 and
then it also has a couple USB 3.0 type-a
in the rear and a couple USB 3.0 type-c
and and and it should be less money than
the Razer core we're told
although we're not sure how much it's
going to cost so far and over here we
have I think in my opinion the most
exciting products that's MSI has on
display
look two motherboards for Rison that is
an AM 4 socket right there which is
which is very exciting this is a be 350
tomahawk we're looking at first MSR I'm
sorry AMD has now informed us that they
have a few chipsets because they're
going to have a wide range of products
on a m4 including high-end desktop parts
with no integrated GPU as far as we know
as well as ap news that do have
integrated cheap GPUs that are probably
going to be lower
that kind of thing so the be 350
tomahawk over here as far as what we
know so far as ddr4 dual channel ddr3
four dimm slots for that turbo m2 so you
do get an MDOT two port right there just
one on this board because maybe that's
something to do with the chipset we're
really not sure yet
easy debug LEDs audio boost they have a
bit higher quality audio components in
here and eight USB 3.1 gen2 USB 2.0 so
tons of USB connectivity on there that's
that's nice you have to be 3.1 as well
supersuites this one over here is the X
370 X power gaming titanium there's a
few X's in that name again better
quality audio audio boost for detects
and outputs high five great audio at the
right impedance so that's kind of cool
means if you have a higher impedance
headset you plug it in it will
automatically detect it supports rise
and of course seventh gen APU series
processors which I guess they're
probably further further off this year
according to AMD 2-way and video sli
3-way AMD crossfire three pcie 3.0 slots
a couple turbo m dot two's that are
located right down there and then again
three USB 3.1 gen2 eight USB 3.1 gen2
van USB 2.0 that's a again a lot of
connectivity let's let's take a look at
that over here look at that that is that
is some sexy oh right there
it looks like one of those connectors at
least is Type C as well and honestly
these are the first am for motherboards
that I've seen that aren't like green
like engineering sample prototype things
so I'm excited you guys should be
excited to guys that's gonna wrap it up
for my coverage here at MSI they of
course have more stuff here than what I
was able to talk about so behind me is a
row of desktop computers because MSI
does make full complete desktop systems
as well as the laptops further down the
end including the GS 83 GT Titan SLI VR
it's got a it's it's got like Cherry MX
switches and RGB lighting and all that
good stuff but Kyle's going to talk
about that stuff so I'll direct you over
to Kyle's channel bit wits because he
has another video just on those things
if you want to hear some more
information anyway thanks for watching
this video leave me a comment to the
section if you want to tell me things
like how much you love CES 2017 coverage
I'll be back more with with more stuff
from CES big thinking my sponsors once
again gigabytes ocz as well as deep cool
and we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
