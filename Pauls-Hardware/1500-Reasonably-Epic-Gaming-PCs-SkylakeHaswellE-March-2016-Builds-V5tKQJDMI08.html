hydride this is my monthly builds video
for March 2016 I do this video every
month well not this video but a new
video like this every month because
choosing parts for new PC can be
confusing sometimes so each month I
create a couple couple computer build
parts lists these are both based on your
votes and your feedback and I also build
them sometimes too so if you guys want
to check it out I have my builds
playlist link down in the description so
you can check out fabulous builds that
I've done in the past like my my parents
new system and a few other builds that
I've done recently apart from that I am
also streaming this live to twitch so
hello and welcome anyone who's watching
this live on Twitch I appreciate you
guys being here apart from that this is
this does involve some interaction I
should also remember how to speak part
of doing this interaction which is via a
straw poll and that straw poll is linked
in the description down below if you're
watching this on YouTube and the straw
poll for last month for my March builds
was which of these five systems do you
guys want to see and you all voted on
the $1500 reasonably epic gaming system
so that's kind of what I'm going to be
doing I'm actually going to be doing two
$1500 reasonably epic gaming systems if
you guys want to vote for next month's
because I will be doing this again next
month and I will post this in chat for
you guys if you wanna vote right now
get a head start on everyone else
I have a VR bill the Nashville to video
editing build full gaming setup
including system monitor and peripherals
for $1,000 or what I'm calling the
potential PC which is a very low budget
system but with a lot of upgrade
potential so maybe that could be fun too
what else my forgetting to say today
again I'm gonna be doing the $1500
reasonably epic gaming system I'm gonna
do it two different ways the first way
is gonna be based on the mainstream
skylake LGA 1151 platform and then the
second way is gonna be based on the
enthusiast haswell-e
LGA 2011 - three platform both of these
are Intel platforms sorry to any of you
AMD fans out there it's just getting to
be that point where I have a really hard
time recommending AMD I did an 8350
build last month and that was my last
ever and 3 plus platform build if
look into AMD I highly recommend holding
off and waiting until their next
generation platform watches sometime
this year and four and all that good
stuff so a few more notes before we dive
in first what is it the cost I'm
listening here is just for the system
that doesn't include monitor or
peripherals or Windows for example
though you can get Windows for 20 bucks
as I've recently mentioned over on
kinguin net I'm also gonna be using PC
part picker for this because it's a
fabulous website where you can use
compatibility filters to narrow down all
of your choices and get everything lined
up um if you guys check it out I have a
saved parts list as well for all the old
builds going back from March February
don't go back too far cuz they tend to
get a little bit out of dates but let's
kick it off actually now I said it
backwards but we're gonna actually start
off with the 5820 build and the 5820
build I think is a very reasonable one
so again both of these are $1500 both of
them share some some remarkable
similarities in there for instance their
storage configuration and their memory
configuration but the 5820k build is
more CPU powerful and a little bit less
GPU powerful although both of these are
still going to make excellent gaming
systems here you can see all the parts
as listed even get star wars battlefront
right
when you get that r9 fury cuz they're
people still playing that game anyway
this one's coming in at just under $1500
and let's just get started right into it
with the CPU which is the 5820k this
one's actually very similar to my
entry-level x99 system but I'm glad to
say that since a few months have passed
since I did that build this one is eat
well it's more powerful and it's about
the same amount of money so starting
with 5820k which is super awesome and
yeah I don't know what else to say about
it that's the CPU you should get if
you're jumping in here it's available on
super MS there's super buys or whatever
that is for three hundred and seventy
seven dollars which isn't too bad that's
actually just about the same price as
the 6700 K also if you hear rumbling in
the background it's a train I can do
nothing about it that's alright for a
cooler since these CPUs don't come with
coolers the the high-end Intel
enthusiast ones I've got the new cooler
master hyper 212 X this one's it's like
the hyper 212 Evo but there's an X on
the end which makes it much
better primarily the difference here is
the fan that's included which is no
longer as sort of a I didn't like the
see-through fan they had before this
one's a little bit nicer I think and
they have upgraded the bought the base
of it a little bit with the copper
contacts
anyway it's 40 bucks as opposed to 30 to
25 that you can get the hyper 212 Evo
for but you know it's new and I think
you do get a little bit more value with
the fan that's included here it is much
better PWM I'm sorry much much better
static pressure performance your
motherboard we're going with the msi
x99s is a budget x99 board and this
definitely where you're gonna have to
spend more money if you're going with
the x99 platform is all the motherboards
so they kind of start off at like 170 to
180 and that's for the budget end
whereas with z170 which we're gonna be
talking about in a minute you're gonna
have to pay a bit more for that so I
like the x99 Raider because I don't know
it's got a decent amount of features for
it it's got you know all eight DIMM
slots so you can start out with a four
dimm configuration for memory and then
you can add four more in the future if
you want to it's got that kind of brown
PCB which isn't quite as nice as some of
the black PCBs but you know it gets the
job done and then apart from that you
might notice that some of the reviews
here where I was looking at this as I
was choosing this board and some of them
were kind of like so so most of these
complaints were about enabling XMP and
the memory performance memory
performance is often highly dependent on
your CPU just in case you guys didn't
know so if you try to enable X like XMP
for a 3000 speed memory kit and like it
doesn't work don't blame your
motherboard blame your CPU that's an
overclocked memory speed and you know
that's not the same motherboards can't
have like you know defective memory
channels or anything like that but just
something to keep in mind anyway this is
available for a hundred and ninety
dollars at Newegg but I believe there's
some other places that have it cheaper
so yeah Amazon has it for 188 out of the
right out of the box or if you go to
outlet PC you can get it for 190 and
then minus a $20 man rebate
I usually don't include mail-in rebates
and my PC part picker lists but they are
there and available for people who want
them but yeah featured sellers get out
of there okay next up is memory I
basically used the PC part picker
filters to narrow down a 16 gig memory
kit 4x4 gigs
I didn't go with superfast memory
because it's really not going to make
that much of a difference and I chose
this team elites kit because it's pretty
much all black that's kind of like a
little bit of gold on there I guess a
little blingy it's also low profile
I appreciate low profile memory kits
because they're gonna give you a better
future compatibility with CPU coolers
and that kind of thing for storage I
have a single 480 gig SSD I was gonna
try to add in some some like a 2
terabyte hard drive here as well but I
did not do that mainly because I I ran
out of money but a 480 gig for an SSD is
pretty good to start off with also there
is an m dot 2 slot on this motherboard
but I didn't go with that one because
those are more expensive but I feel like
starting off with a 4 turn 80 gig drive
like this is gonna give you plenty of
space for an operating system and some
games and stuff drop in an old
mechanical hard drive or something like
that to give yourself some additional
storage if you need it and then maybe
consider upgrading to an m2 card in the
future alright this one for the graphics
card I went with the sapphire r9 fury
the r9 fury is like if your ex but it's
air-cooled and still pretty awesome
this one's from sapphire this one has
very good reviews
what's up sapphire Edie if you're
watching I doubt you are but hey it
looks pretty nice too it also has that
kind of subtle black look with maybe
just a little bit of kind of copper or
gold colors on it which I think will
kind of blend them with the rest this
and you can now get a fury 4-5 little
over $500 if you're in the US which is
super nice lastly you know not lastly
but rounding out the rest of the parts
we have the NZXT h4 40
I figured if every single case that was
in Kyle's recent let's what's Kyle's new
bit that he's doing booted in Kyle's
booted season one every single case that
that was in the finals was built in an
h4 40 so this is a very well-respected
case from NZXT it's 100 bucks it's got
it's got all the room you could need
it's got all the features you could need
you might need to remove a hard drive
tray to fit in that longer graphics card
and that's about it
finally for the power supply I've really
been like an EVGA power supplies because
they just seem to have the feature set
that most I most look for which is I
want a highly rated one so I want 80
plus
Golder better I want it to have a decent
amount of power that this is 750 watts
and I want the cables to be all black so
we don't have any of the catch ketchup
and mustard garbage and that is what's
EVGA has been doing with theirs they
also have these flat ribbon cables which
I find are pretty convenient for cable
management so there you go there's the
power supply and there yeah there's
there's our first build let you guys
think $1,500 reasonably epic gaming
system I like the $1500 price point for
for a computer build especially for a
gaming builder like a gaming slash
workstation because even though like if
you younger and you don't have as much
money or you know you're just trying to
get into building your own PC it's
difficult to say I'm gonna drop 1500 but
if you you know if you can save up that
much or just kind of hit that that price
point you can really get yourself into
the upper tiers of what's available
especially when it comes to GPUs and
CPUs and you will get a lot more
lifespan I think out of you're out of it
build if you're spending this much
alright let's move on to the second
build which is right here also a $1500
build and this time I went with the
other platform which is Intel's most
recent skylake LGA 1151 is the socket
the there's a bunch of chipsets but the
one we're going to be using here is e170
since we have a 6700 K and for this one
you have more GPU horsepower with a 980
TI which will outperform the fury
dependend in most situations right now
okay if you can see all the parts right
here
you might notice I actually came in just
a little bit over one thousand five
hundred and fourteen dollars so this is
this is just a little bit a little bit
too much and not too much it's just a
little bit over but the reason for that
is because I was originally actually
putting this together with 6600 K so if
you want to cut 130 to 140 dollars off
of the price of this build get a 6600 K
but when I came up with everything and I
was about at about 1400 I was like well
I think the best next the best thing to
do beyond this like to get more power
practically is to jump up to the 6700 K
and it's not as overpriced as it was a
few months ago it's down to about 375
360 depending where you get it NCIX US
has it for three six
- although apparently it's out of stock
but whatever outlet PC has it for 375
though cool but yeah still pretty
expensive also I'm hungry it's lunch
time but anyway I wanted to pair that up
with a nice CPU cooler and as much as I
am a big fan of the hyper 212 the Evo
and the the hyper 212 X that
coolermaster just came out with I'm like
I want to find some other alternatives
for that so this is the fantex pH TC 1
to DX underscore BK
she's just brilliantly named but anyway
don't buy this a new egg because it's 70
bucks buy it at a NCIX it's 50 bucks
there so about ten dollars more than the
hyper 212 X and it looks a lot cooler
it's got a black you know anodized
finish down there comes with two fans
instead of one and according to reviews
and all it's very quiet and it does a
very good job at you know keep keeping
your CPU nice and cool so there you go
fantex cooler which they need to come up
with a better name for and that will
keep your 67 or k nice and chilly for
your motherboard we got the Asus z170a I
was looking at some MSI crate editions
cuz this after I chose that cooler I was
like this is gonna be a black and white
build the MSI crate Edition is nice but
I like to z170a from Asus just a little
bit better they make some damn good
motherboards and I think this one is no
exception it also has some features like
USB type-c and USB 3.1 which I
definitely appreciate I also have the
new egg page for this so I could show
you up more up close has even got a PCI
slot because backwards compatibility
right but yeah other than that it's got
that nice black and white finish that
Asus has come out what's kind of like
the x99 deluxe it's in the Arctic
Panther back there and to pair that up
with some nice color matching memory of
some Kingston HyperX fury 16 gig kits so
I have the same amount of memory on both
of these build 16 gigs got the same
amount of storage as well with about 480
gigs this is the a data Premier SP 550 I
keep using this because when I keep
going to the PC part picker list and I
and I drill down stuff and I'm looking
at storage the a data Premier SP 550
comes up in the like lowest price by 5
or 10 bucks compared to a lot of the
copper
options and again it's not the fastest
of the fast when it comes to your SSDs
that are out there but it will do a very
good job next is a graphics card and
here I was very happy to be able to drop
in a 980 TI this is a nice 980 TI as
well it's from gigabytes the 980 TI
windforce 3x which you can get for 600
bucks right now at Amazon by the way if
you're not in the US and you're on PC
part picker you can use this drop-down
on the top right to access other other
locations for different pricing and
stuff and I'm sorry that stuff is
inexpensive in the US we've paid for it
with our manufacturing anyway I'm
getting inside check Amazon has this
video card for $600 which is about 50 60
bucks cheaper than the list price and
it's a very nice card it's got the three
X cooler on it stays nice and chilly and
you'd probably be able to get a pretty
nice overclock out of that as well again
this will outperform that fury in by and
large most situations which is why
you're going to get more
GPU power with this build you'll get
more cpu power with the other build
alright for a case I just went with the
fractal define s reasonably reasonably
price reasonably priced case that looks
pretty nice and it's got that window on
the side so you can see your beautiful
black and white theme to build and
that's another reason why I chose this
case was because I already have black
and white parts and fractal kind of has
that black and white thing locked down
so nice little case I've talked about it
before finally we have the power supply
which is the EVGA 650 watt 80 plus gold
certified this is the same exact power
supplies 650 GQ as I showed you guys in
the first build I just I didn't want to
be too much over so I cut it down to 650
watts which is still perfectly fine for
the system as long as you don't add a
second graphics card then you're totally
good with 650 Watson a 980 TI and again
this has those nice all-black cables
which are just super beautiful and will
blend in nicely with your build so when
you're looking at it through that window
on the define S you will be able to see
everything it will be pretty but that is
all for this video guys I really
appreciate you watching it if you're
interested in links to any of the stuff
