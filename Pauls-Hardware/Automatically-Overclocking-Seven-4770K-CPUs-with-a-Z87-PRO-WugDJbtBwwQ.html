back to Pauls hardware today i have a
sort of a different kind of video if you
guys recall perhaps recently I did a
couple videos unboxing the Sabre to the
87 and these 87 pro both motherboards
from Asus z7 chipset 1150 socket for
Intel's Haswell processors now I asked
y'all for some advice or some
suggestions for what type of coverage
you might want to see with these
motherboards and I will say there was
lots of requests for a build that's what
I'm going to be saving the sabre-tooth
z87 for so this is going to go in a full
system build which I have yet to part
out that's a future video so I'm going
to set this one aside for now today's
video is all about this one this is the
87 pro now another request I got a lot
of requests for was overclocking of
course because that's a hugely popular
subject particularly when it comes to
building computers building your own
computers building a high-end computer
all you really need is a case cube
processor from Intel right now for as
well you got the 46 70 K which is the
four core no hyper threading or you have
the 4770k which is four cores with
hyper-threading so 4 physical cores and
8 logical course yeah okay so the z87
pro from asus features there are four
way optimizations so this is that's
that's what this is right here dual
intelligent processors it's their TPU
chip and their epu chip TPU chip handles
some overclocking algorithms and presets
and it can auto tune your your
motherboard for example you use for
energy saving four-way optimization goes
through TPU e pu fan expert and then
there's one last one which I will
correct myself on in just a moment but
it does all that stuff and you click one
button and it goes to an automatically
tunes it all now I view this from kind
of a couple different perspectives the
the enthusiast in me says well that's
cool and all but I don't want some
automatic overclock I want to get in
there and adjust the settings myself the
pragmatist in me says that's awesome
it's really easy you click one button
and then you have an overclock now I
have been doing some testing with this
already so I can't tell you guys the
overclocking features
the TPU chip are quite effective they
might not be as fine-grained as a lot of
you might consider especially if you've
done overclocking yourself in the past
but if you want to really quickly dial
in a pretty high-end overclock it's a
very effective means of doing it so with
that long intro out of the way this
video is going to be all about the 4770k
and overclocking using four-way
optimization from Asus but more
specifically I'm actually looking to get
a little bit of benefit out of this
myself if nothing less than to help me
out with my work over at new ITV
to that end we have a set of 4770k CPUs
in right now which are going to be used
for a variety of purposes but primarily
for builds and maybe some giveaways and
I I was like hey I wonder how these
perform because I've heard there's a
huge variance in 4770k s or maybe not
huge but there's a pretty big variance
you might get a chip that can overclock
a little bit and maybe you can get a
little bit of memory overclock you might
have other chips that can do both like
really high-end getting one that can do
both seems to be a bit harder to come by
but there seems to be like you might get
a chip that can only clock to like 4.3
or 4.4 and then you get others it can do
4.8 and then you might have different
memory frequencies that they accept in
between there so I'm going to be using
dual intelligent 4 processors and the
four-way optimization features of this
board to test one two three four five
six and seven in sell cry 74770 KS
so with that said I guess so let's just
take a dive in we'll take a look first
at the test bed and my methodology for
running these overclocking tests so here
is a look at the test bed it's a Leanne
Lee T 60 B that's the testament itself
of course motherboard the asus z87 pro
as we've been looking at and for the
processor of course the intel core i7
4770k
seven of them in total and I'll be
swapping them out throughout the course
of this test for cooling we have the
thermal take water 2.0 extreme which
does a fine job for memory I actually
have a couple kits one is a corsair low
profile 4x4 gig ddr3 1600 kit and I used
that for my initial set of overclocking
let's four-way optimization and then I
also have a g.skill trend an X kit
that's for also by four by four gigs
ddr3 and that's a twenty six sixty six
and the four way optimization will
overclock that to twenty four hundred
speed for video card just got a ZOTAC
GeForce GTX 550 ti in there so that the
processor won't also be pushing GPU
duties for storage of course Aaron
Neutron GTX 240 gig I'm running Windows
8 and for power and an tech hiker
high-current pro 1200 watt as far as
testing methodology first off if anyone
is planning on doing this I definitely
recommend saving a stock configuration
profile it's an option in the UEFI BIOS
just go ahead and do optimize defaults
and then save that so you can jump back
to it whenever necessary so basically
after each CPU is installed I'm just
doing a quick 30 minute I'd s-64 burnin
as well as a rest period and then of
course starting out for the corsair 1600
speed ramp after that I've run the
forward optimisation test and log the
results and that's basically seeing how
far the CPU can overclock while the
memory stays capped at 1600 I then am
running past mark as a stability test if
you're wondering why I'm not running I
264 something like prime95 it's because
those types of programs apply an
additional amount of voltage to the
fourth generation has well processors
which you will never see in any other
test anyway after that I jump in and
install these g-scale 2666 speedram
around four-way optimization again and
that will put the memory at 2400 speed
with the CPUs if the CPU stable at that
speed I go ahead and set the memory to
2666 the top speed it can go and then I
run past mark again if it hits all of
these points then I run an Ida 64 burnin
test just for five minutes because again
these aren't my CPUs but I do want to
see if they will maintain stability and
there we see some pretty high
temperatures depending on the overclock
we also see additional voltage that you
won't see with any other tests except
something like Ida 64 or prime95 let's
take a look at CPU number one now this
is my engineering sample CPU and this
was described to me as a middle of the
road when it
to overclocking CPU when it was lending
to me pretty much as expected it hit
about it hit 4.4 gigahertz on the
initial overclock and 4.3 gigahertz on
all four cores so you'll notice when
it's doing the forward optimization
it'll go for a higher overclock using
just two cores and then if it achieves
that it will go for that overclock with
all four cores so sometimes we'll see
all four cords at the same frequency
sometimes we'll see two cores at a
higher frequency and all four cores at a
lower frequency the voltage was at about
one point two seven after that I went
ahead and ran past mark got a score of
4728 on the voltage again one point two
seven three on this one with the four
point four gigahertz overclock so pretty
decent performance there next up I went
ahead and I ran the g.skill memory so
that got a 2400 speed again 4.4
gigahertz and 4.3 gigahertz with that
configuration past mark test actually
dropped a little bit I'm not sure why
that's allowed four thousand six hundred
and eighty two but apart from that we
also set the memory to 2666 was also
successful there so that passed mark
rating was four thousand nine hundred
and forty three point six and pretty
much a nice decent overclocking cpu this
engineering sample 4.4 gigahertz on two
cores 4.3 gigahertz on four cores and it
did also survived the I 264 burnin test
although the vid did jump up to 1.3
eight CPU number two was an individual
CPU it didn't come in a group like CPU
number three through seven and this one
was actually the lowest performing and
also a bit of an anomaly with this one
first off when it did the initial
overclock which for the for baptism
optimization is 4.3 gigahertz on one and
2 cores 4.2 gigahertz on three cores and
4.1 gigahertz on four cores it wasn't
actually even able to remain stable at
that speed so I got several blue screens
after the initial restarts once the test
ran I actually had to jump into the BIOS
and I applied an additional voltage
offset of point zero seven five which
wasn't that
but it did stabilize the overclock and
actually after doing that it was able to
overclock up to four point four
gigahertz and four point three gigahertz
which is again a decent overclock kind
of like the engineering sample it was
stable at that speed I got a pass mark
score four thousand eight hundred and
fifty four however it did maintain
instability when I popped in the G scale
memory so at 2400 speed I was able to
run through the pass mark test and I got
my score four thousand seven hundred and
thirty-four however there was
instability there so due to that I did
not go and run the additional tests at
2666 so again this was the lowest
performing the CPUs and without some
additional help from an additional
voltage it actually only hit four point
three gigahertz
next set I'm going to go through a bit
more more quickly because the next five
CPUs are the five that all came in one
big batch so they were all CPUs right
next to each other and as a result they
held her for Mary very similarly so
starting with CPU number three this was
the first one I popped in and I my job
just kind of dropped because it just
kept going I went to 4.5 4.6 4.7 and
eventually hits 4.8 gigahertz on two
cores 4.7 gigahertz on four cores and
when I went it with 2400 speed memory it
did need to drop it down to 4.7
gigahertz on two cores and 4.6 gigahertz
on four cores but again still past past
mark with that five thousand five five
thousand 53 was a score and then that
with the 2666 bead memory hit 5133 which
was very nice the luck did continue with
CPU number four that one hits not quite
as high for point six and four point
five right off the bat but it was able
to maintain that even with the 2400
speed memory and again very nicely
performing CPU and you might notice here
again the voltage still just hitting
about one point two seven that seems to
be the theme than the voltage amount
that asus is going with pretty
frequently with the
there there forward optimization
software I did run through this all the
way and do the i-264 burnin test so even
at 4.6 gigahertz on two cores four point
five gigahertz on four course with the
2666 speed memory and I had a 64 burn
and tests did pass so a nice solid CPU
their CPU number five was a big hit once
again and was another one of our four
point eight contenders so four point
eight and four point seven was the
initial results for four two and four
cores respectively had a really nice
score of five thousand forty which I
think was one of the higher scores for
the eight hundred frequency memory with
the twenty four hundred speed memory I
did drop down to four point seven and
four point six and then when I did drop
in the twenty six sixty six feet memory
it did still may maintain stability
there however with the Ida 64 burnin
test the vid jumped up to one point
three three two it did get very hot in
fact I had a hundred degrees Celsius on
three of the four cores and so CPU
throttling did take place as a results
maximum was only eight percent but still
it was getting a bit too hot so that's
another example where some system
testing does just play a part and I
definitely would have backed off the
overclock on that again this was only
using the Ida 64 test it was just fine
using the other tests but and that was
also with the 2660 speed sixty six speed
memory CPU number six dropped just a bit
four point seven and four point six was
the initial testing after that we hit
four point seven and four point six with
a 2400 speed memory got a nice past mark
score five thousand one hundred and
twelve and then after that with the 2666
speed memory still passed the pass mark
test and also the Ida 64 system
stability test and finally we have CPU
number 7 CP number seven was a little
bit stranger because initially I got
four point six and four point five with
the initial tests and I went
ahead with that because it's still a
very nice overclock but then when I
jumped up to the 2400 speed memory it
actually the frequency went up as well
so four point seven and four point six
with the 2400 speed memory so I just
said okay let's run with it and try the
2666 speed memory there I did still pass
the pass mark test with a score of 51 27
and I did pass the Ida 64 test however I
did I was hitting about 95 to 100
degrees Celsius on the course so that's
something where I definitely would have
backed it off a bit just if I was going
for a more stable overclock or an
overclock that I wanted to leave for a
longer period of time so in closing I
would have to say that I was actually
very impressed with several things as
throughout the duration of making this
video first off the forward optimization
very very well tuned I must say the
voltage was not it seemed a little bit
more standard to me it didn't seem like
though it was making voltage adjustments
too much but they were putting in what
seemed like a safe voltage and then they
were seeing what kind of frequencies the
CPUs could get up to after that honestly
I didn't have that much time to play
around with each configuration when the
CPU was installed because I was trying
to get through them all so I didn't
really have that much chance to go
through and try to tweak the other
settings manually on my own but what I
did try I found that the frequency that
the forward optimization was able to get
to was pretty close to the to the peak
frequency I mean I know some some exotic
cooling some higher-end cooling like a
custom liquid cooled loop could probably
get you that further than that or fickle
exotic lowing or something like that or
some really extreme cooling on the VRMs
with fans or something like that you
could probably go higher you can
probably tweak the the voltage a bit
more yourself if you are going to use
this that's one thing I'm going to try
to do is see the lowest voltage I can
get with some of these overclocks but at
least from a quick and simple way to
take your UK skew processor click a
button see what kind of overclocking get
and for this purpose it was extremely
effective at seeing the peak frequencies
a lot of these processors processors
were able to hit
a couple more closing remarks I am
absolutely stoked by the group of CPUs
that we got they they came to us in a
batch of five and those as you might
have noticed they're all from the same
batch so chances are those are all from
the same wafer so the ones we were
getting for point eight four point seven
on those are all grouped kind of close
together
the other two CPU number one and CPU
number two one was an engineering sample
number one was and CPU number two was
from a different batch so wasn't
performing quite as well I also need to
point out that this is a very very small
sample size when it comes to the total
number of 4770k s that are out there so
please don't take this to be a blanket
like you know to 70% to 4770k should be
able to hit four point seven or four
point eight right out of the gate that's
probably not going to be the case but
I'm really happy to say that we have
some nice overclocking chips here that
we can try out ourselves for future
benchmarking and stuff like that over on
nuoc TV so more of that I'm sure will be
coming as soon as we can get the videos
created but I had better sign off for
now once again we've been taking a
closer look at the N cell 4770k and its
overclocking potential its potential its
overclocking potential the like button
of course right down there in the lower
left corner go ahead and hammer on that
for me if you guys can and that's gonna
wrap it up for this one guys thanks for
watching we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
