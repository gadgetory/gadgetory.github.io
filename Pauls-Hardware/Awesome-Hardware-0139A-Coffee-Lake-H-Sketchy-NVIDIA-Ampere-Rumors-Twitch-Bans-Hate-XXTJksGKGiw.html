just stop you live now says we're live
okay hi everyone and welcome this is
awesome hardware it's a live show
we talk about technology computers and
that kind of thing we also have a good
time with your few beers so quick
warning to those of you guys who are
just joining us might use some foul
language on the show from time to time
usually nothing too terrible it's
usually warranted in fact most people
would be mad if we didn't occasionally
use bad words but just wanted to point
that out but this show is split into two
halves and this is the first half of
episode number 139 it is February 13th
and we're streaming this half to my
channel Paul's hardware in about an hour
or so we will finish my half and then
we'll switch over and stream the second
half - Kyle's channel which is called
bit wit and the link to that is in the
video's description
excuse me along with links to all the
stories were going to talk about today
so thanks to all you guys for being here
whether you're watching on twitch TV /
awesome hardware or whether you're
watching on youtube we definitely
appreciate you guys being here
weird huh how's everything going what
what it's choppy coffee okay chop-chop
someone's saying
stutter alright hold on we gotta we have
some stutter had to deal with quick
lots of dropped frames it says dropped
it says zero dropped frames on our end
yeah it says zero drop frames - good at
all you guys are all liars
it'll drop two frames we are his pro we
are using a wired Ethernet connection
bit rates decent maybe turn the bitrate
down a little no you would want the
bitrate to be up turn into bitrate up
because we're at 60 frames per second
I guess that uh oh I know I bet I know
what it is I didn't check 60
frames-per-second down here oh and um do
you have to do that anymore you don't
have to do that anymore
yeah when YouTube now that they did it
that's the options not even there so
it's got to be something with the 60fps
cuz we never really stutter and the only
difference is that we're using the
Riverside now at 60 yeah we usually
stream at 30 here when we're at my place
and we've never had any stuttering issue
since the and it also says twitch is
fine but youtube is hot laggy well that
sounds like a YouTube thing it's very
strange
which is good YouTube's dropping well
well shit alright
you can't do any other and encoding
settings right let's uh I'll be right
back YouTube yep it's not even using the
backup server I don't know we should
have we left both once again sorry sorry
for that sorry for that delay guys we
have switched back to 30 frames per
second that's YouTube right yeah yeah
that's fine yeah what's good looks it's
perfect everything's perfect good from
RN everything's fine and everything has
been fine and nothing has gone wrong at
all so thank you guys for being here
knock on wood for sure we are now coming
to you live at 1080 1080 30 30 frames
per second it doesn't matter anymore
yeah I'm gonna talk about should we talk
first about why Kyle is in pain uh okay
yes we can address that briefly sure I
posted something on Twitter on Sunday
after my snowboarding accident where I
basically caught an edge and sort of
face-planted or I guess kind of chest
planted cuz I landed on my rib cage but
I sort of landed my rib cage landed on
my left arm oh that makes sense
you're cushioning the blow to your rib
cage with your arm I wouldn't say
cushioning cuz they both got sort of
messed up that when I sat back up there
was it looked like my bone was kind of
just sticking an inch out of my elbow
but it didn't pierce the skin it was
just like boom like it was protruding
like almost like a pinky had like God
was trying to burst out of my skin about
hunch even like the guy like the medic
guy who is like standing of a staffer
who was right there who like saw it
happen he like you like take your jacket
off let me see it and he's like oh okay
um everything's fine like you could tell
like I was almost like not their spot
yeah he was yeah exactly he was just
like wow he's totally on his league
right now so I was like well that
doesn't look good
and then my ribs started feeling really
bad and I I got an x-ray done and the
x-ray didn't pick up any sort of
fractures or
or breaks in my ribcage but you can
still have like a hairline fracture that
an x-ray wouldn't pick up necessarily
until you unless you go to a specialist
so that may be what what happened at any
rate it hurts to to breathe to inhale
deeply moving any sudden movements or
even like small movements like getting
up out of my chair is kind of tough
right now walking I have to walk really
slow so if I say I'll just randomly
throughout the stream now you guys know
what's going on we have an explanation I
have Tourette's I didn't develop
Tourette's over the weekend or so the
bone that just just probably somehow
just it's slowly like just like it just
slowly went back into place it was this
really obvious deformity that kind of
just corrected itself in a few hours and
by the time we like they took me on a
toboggan down the mountain
toboggan which was not humiliating at
all and then once I was in the patrol
room like a couple hours later I took my
jacket off again it had gone down like
halfway and the guy was like whoa like
that's that's I mean that's weird but
that's good
and then eventually just kind of went
back into place there's still a massive
bruise in it it's really painful to
touch but imagine all things considered
I'm like Wolverine when he heals himself
but not quite as fast yes that's right
see what you can do yeah I'm like I'm
like Wolverines you know reject brother
who didn't get into the Academy
that's awesome Charles Xavier girl just
so everything's good everyone be careful
if you if you participate in the winter
sports yeah
yeah I saw Chloe Kim do it on TV oh yeah
she's easy-peasy she's 17 here's my
back-to-back 1080s
on the way she's from Torrance she yeah
our whole making of a reckon you'd do
movements that might be uncomfortable Oh
beer could you could you grab a couple
more beers I could okay in the meantime
I'm going to quickly plug our stories
help support Kyle and his his pain and
deformation right now by buying stuff at
our stores my store is pulsar Burnett
and I have shirts mugs
pint glasses bottle openers key caps
it's all real nice stuff so check it out
and buy things if you buy stuff during
the show we will shout out your name at
the end of the show along with the word
Johnson
it's glorious CalSTRS bit with that text
live store he's got new CPU cooler dark
gray Heather t-shirts this is that's
right that's right here yep that it was
a really nice plastic smile Engler i've
had i've owned one of those for so long
and I've been wearing it in videos and
stuff people like why can't I find the
gray one on your store like that it's
not inside we don't sell it until now so
it's finally there let the people have
go wild what they want
yeah and these ones are coming soo this
is actually a sample sent to us by or
sent to me by our t-shirt guy John who's
an awesome dude and I don't let me know
what you guys think of this cuz it's
Intel but it's it's logos artist Lee
it's kind of sparkly it's a sort of a
metallic metallic print it's got a sheen
to it a shimmer up close you will see ya
a little shimmery up close but from afar
it doesn't look too bad doesn't look too
glitzy call it the bit whit glitter bit
shirt glitter glitter bit a little bit
little bit this is a glitter bitch I'll
know something I wouldn't say like the
bit with glitter good shirt I'm gonna
tell John to put that as the product I
have I have one with my logo oh thank
you
I've one with my logo in that same
finish so definitely interested in your
feedback you guys do in the meantime
let's go into our first segment which is
I don't have any of these broken well
then our first our first segment though
it's gonna be news juice which I don't
it's not set up so we'll just say good
news all right
Oh Nicky Kyle starting out just so
smoothly hardware is where our first
article comes from and this is a bit of
leaked info it's actually derived from
sighs soft sand rebenchmarking sweets on
the intel core i7 coffee lake each CPU
benchmarks so coffee lake you guys are
probably familiar with these are going
to be new CPUs that are based on the
coffee lake architecture 14 nanometer
plus plus or so the the nomenclature
goes
they're gonna have a basically this is
the specific CPU is called AI 788 58 and
it's gonna have a base clock 2.6
gigahertz boost clock is not known yet
but there's speculation on that later on
9 megabyte l3 cache according to the
actual information while the actual
screenshots that they have here from
South Sandra 4 results here that came in
for a couple of their different tests so
the arithmetic benchmark test on the 6
quarts well that's a big thing about
this 8850 it's a 6 quart 12 thread so
it's similar to 8700 cake yep
but it scored one hundred and fifty nine
point two one compare it to the four
core eight thread previous generation
mobile part 7820 HQ which is can be like
that squared 117 so 117 up to 159 but
here we're looking we're looking at kind
of a similar thing when you looked at
like a 7700 K to an 8700 K in that a lot
of the gains come from the fact that you
got two more cores and four more threads
to work with but there's also a bit
that's a slight improvement when it
comes to actual per thread performance
with coffee lake so that's good to have
and this chips only gonna have a 45 watt
TDP so that's cool so probably gonna see
it integrated into notebooks laptops
perhaps also like all-in-one monitors or
like like the all-in-one units that uses
like a slim monitor frame but also puts
the the PC in it and that kind of thing
like an iMac like a PC iMac yeah one of
those because yeah apparently people
like those
I mean there been some cool ones like
the the 34:40 by 1440 you know
widescreen 34 inch widescreen they take
one of those and then like build a
computer under there I like the
upgradable ones yes so you can sort of
access the parts and stuff and you could
potentially see something like this
being integrated onto a custom
motherboard that still has an upgradable
graphics card for example mm-hmm this is
a mobile part so it's probably gonna be
BGA yeah I don't see yeah I mean it's
definitely unbe BGA the other benchmark
is the processor multimedia benchmark
and the 88 58 scored 373 on that
compared to the 78 20 HQ which scored
347 347 373 it's also rumored that the
1850 H is gonna have an integrated u HD
graphics 630 which is the you know an
upgrade from the last generation but
still you're not gonna expect a huge
amount of performance out of that its
Intel integrated graphics but
potentially could have turbo up to 4
gigahertz on all six cores as well as a
4.3 gigahertz single core turbo so it's
pretty nice yeah I mean really
impressive specs especially considering
its a 45 watt TDP mobile chip and for
higher-end laptops especially if you
need to do video editing on the go or
something like that I probably some it's
pretty cool computers pair pair pretty
nicely with the discrete GPU in there
yeah and Intel if they're being more
competitive when it comes to the mobile
space it probably has a little bit to do
with the fact that AMD is actually
starting to be more competitive there
too because they're starting to
integrate Rison CPUs and Vega GPUs onto
various chips in various configurations
including the Intel chip with the Vega
graphics on it
yeah moving on wah wah whee-wah whee-wah
wave is fun I was one of those cell
phone brands that I'm never quite
positive how to pronounce Huawei though
did a little promotional thing to try to
get some feedback on their presale for
their upcoming flagship phone the mate
10 Pro it is currently available for
pre-order in the United States this
article's from the verge
the original report came from nine to
five Google and they spotted fake
reviews for the mate ten Pro on Best
Buy's website fake reviews from huawei
themselves no no no no they but they're
actually from people it's and it's
probably it's pretty much for sure
because of this promotion that they ran
on their Facebook page January 31st they
did a Facebook contest acts asking
people to leave comments on the best buy
pre sale page the pre sale page for the
for the mate 10 Pro and in exchange they
got a chance to beta test one of them
but people went a little bit overboard
and there's some actual screenshots and
the 9 to 5 Google article on this and
started posting actual like some of them
were honest some of them were like hey I
don't actually have this but 5 stars
right you know based on Yahweh's
reputation or I had an honor 8fo and
then it was cool so looking forward to
this one or some people were just like
hey I'm posting this because I want to
get a you know part of the beta test
program right every this guy says he's
had one but he got it for a fat up for
free for a photographer views so Huawei
wasn't even telling them to write
reviews they were telling them
specifically to go to this landing page
and comment in this other unrelated
field yeah people just took it upon
themselves like maybe maybe some people
think well if I give them a five-star
review
maybe it'll increase my odds of yeah
getting slow there's definitely been
plenty of accusations and a lot of it
accurate and and warranted against like
fake reviews and stuff this doesn't seem
to be necessarily you know there's not a
Lynne tent here right I don't think
because they were just asking for
comments on the pre-sale page yeah which
is a good way of getting like buzz and
whatever you might you know sure may get
better index by Google or something if
people are traveling there a lot but
point being people wouldn't post it the
reviews on actual phone and now you have
a phone that's not available for sale
and it has really good fuses that's a
little sketchy do you know if Best Buy
trying to like take those down
they have interview
so the reviews have been removed by best
by the Facebook group that they posted
that continental things who had 60,000
members so some of them were overzealous
and when posted yeah all right
by the way windows keeps bugging me so
you guys get to watch Windows Update in
the background wow that's exciting okay
alright let's let's preface this next
article very interesting things to talk
about what we are about to talk about
but very much in the category of rumor
rumor speculation probably not true
could be true but we have no real reason
to believe it's true grain of salt
it's on wucf tech and whenever we talk
about a WCC of tech article we always
say a grain of salt and everything like
that but I want to give credit where
credit is due
they're very upfront about that too he
says very clearly let me begin this is
nothing but a rumor at this point it's
not even a leak
it's not coming from one of their
trusted sources or anything like that
this is from a website called 3d Center
and it's a post on the 3d Center forums
and 3d Center is a German website where
they talk about technology and that kind
of thing so yeah 3d center.org I should
say basically the rumor states that the
next gen NVIDIA GPU lineup will not be
based on volta as has been expected for
some time if you look at any of the
Nvidia roadmaps and everything there's
there's Pascal and then there's Volta up
above it they will instead be based on a
new name that they've inserted ampere so
the ampere architecture also again if
the rumor is to be believed the GP 102
which is the code name for the GPU that
the 1080 Ti and the Titan X and the
techn XP is based on the big Pascal
basically has already been transitioned
to end-of-life and will soon be replaced
with the GA series so GP GeForce Pascal
series 102 is the biggest one and then
they have 104 which is like what the
1080 is based on and then
but 106 and 107 and anyways so GA would
be g-force and peer when they come out
with Volta stuff to code and it will be
GV and there's already some GV based
stuff and the and the in the enterprise
space and supposedly a ga 104 a ga 104
based GPU launched April 12th possibly
the GTX 2080 or gtx 2070 you would
expect the next version of the 104 so
right now like you said GP 104 is with
the 1080 is based on so if they make AG
a 104 it would probably probably be
based v what they would use for the 1080
equivalents and we could assume that
they would make it 1070 equivalents as
well we don't we have no idea if they're
going to continue this again this naming
scheme that they've been using so 20 80
20 70 I felt like when they did 1080
everyone's like are they really going to
do a 1080 because it sounds like like
1920 by 1080 right it's really for 4k
and stuff this is more like 20 80 20 70
like this just difficult to say yeah
it's it's challenging that how many
syllables in your mouth yeah but anyway
they would be unveiling in March and
launching it in April on April 12 the
I'm know it's kind of confusing here is
to talking about end-of-life of the GP
102 which is what the 1080 CI is based
on and it seems a little weird that they
would end of life that well at the same
time potentially bringing out products
that are a step below but we could maybe
assume that that means that whatever the
GTX 2080 might be might be on the
equivalent performance level as a 1080
Ti yeah that's a possibility yeah wonder
how pricing will be yeah of course
pricing is a huge question and pricing
as in what they tell us the MSRP is
versus what they actually sell for I
mean there was plenty of that even when
the even when the 1080 first launched
and the 1070 and what I mean 1070 MSRP
was originally supposed to be 3 370
yeah and they were never really
available for that I mean they were kind
of Canada but the blower style yeah you
know adding board partner versions so if
this is if this happened rumour Rumour
maybe whatever it would be a second
quarter 2018 launch so that'll be
exactly two years since they launched GP
104 based ten eighty and ten seventy two
years ago in twenty sixteen two years
ago also adding to the potential
viability of this rumor is the fact that
GDC and GTC are both held in March so
that's the Game Developers Conference as
well as GeForce Technology Conference
game developers conference is more of an
industry-wide thing GPS technologies
conference is more of a Nvidia based
thing but both potentially venues where
they might what are you doing yeah so
potential venues for an announcement for
something like this and that's pretty
much all there is to it article if you
guys do want to read it as a little bit
more if you guys want some of the other
details and speculation everything but
again we were murdered speculation and
all that good stuff
it would appear if again if this is true
that ampere if it is actually a thing is
like it's another 16 nanometer
refinements so like Pascal refines my
scale architecture refine I doubt this
is something that's actually ten
nanometer which is what Volta is
supposed to be based on and also not
sure what this means for Volta in the
mainstream consumer space and how that
might affect that but all things said
you know companies like Nvidia need to
continue releasing products we didn't
see much in 2017 because there wasn't
much to compete with that they needed to
launch to compete with we saw that 210
70 TI towards the end of the year which
is really kind of a like really weird
product for them to come out with yeah
but they can't do that forever they
can't just keep being like well we're
still not seeing a lot of competition so
we'll just still stick with 1080i and
everything they need to do something so
this is
a possible then you know way they could
go
hopefully that I mean yields would be
really good since there's still be using
the same manufacturing process and that
kind of thing yeah but if there is any
actual viability or truth to this
hopefully we can bring you more on its
soon or at some points in the future we
get some juicy details or rumors even on
AMD cards in the near future too yeah
all right let's talk about Equifax we've
talked about it several times here on
the show because it's a it's a hack that
happened last year Equifax lost the
personal information of about a hundred
and twelve one hundred forty five point
five million Americans as well as other
people around around the world that's
but if you participated in the American
credit system then chances are your data
was stolen and we bring it back up
because we talked about it last week
because they they decided that they're
not going to pursue investigation of
this at least the Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau isn't going to do that
and we just brought that up because it
was kind of crappy I don't know why this
video isn't playing but whatever
this article is over on TechRepublic if
you guys want to check it out more to
the point though it's now been revealed
that it's worse than originally thought
yes that is true
Oh JA Equifax for their part as this new
information is coming to light said hey
we never when we told you hey we lost
all this data and everything we never
said by the way that's everything we
never clarified then this is the
beginning and end of it so we were under
no obligation to tell you about all this
extra stuff that happened to they've
known about this not telling us the full
truth is the same as lying this is not
the fact this is not stuff that was like
we only just discovered it they knew it
was missing they knew the data was
stolen
they just didn't tell everyone all those
details about it so that's super sweet
of them never has been revealed that tax
identification numbers email addresses
and driver's license information has
also been stolen making it yet that much
more simple for someone to impersonate
you and you know buy stuff with your
creditors or that kind of thing this is
on top of all the original stuff that
was stolen in the hack names Social
Security numbers dates of birth current
and former address
is the new information seems to have
been revealed just after the that see
that Consumer Financial Protection
Bureau stuff was just announced which
was like a week week and a half ago but
I do want to point out there's a
follow-up article here that I found um
Wall Street Journal which is to say that
the chief of the CFPB who is Mike
McMullen II says that it's not actually
true he says there has been no change in
the position from the previous
leadership of the CFPB regarding Equifax
so according to him and this articles
from today they are still looking into
it who knows but do want to point out
that the FTC is it has had and continues
to have an ongoing independent
investigation of the breach so I'm sure
they will be brought to justice and the
people responsible will be forced to
apologize to each and every one of us
always happens yeah anyway its crappy
but everyone keep an eye on your credits
and if you're able to then freeze your
credit that's the best way to keep
because in my opinion like at this point
like the credit system in the u.s. it's
like it's really a failing on their part
and I'm like why do I even want to
participate in this anymore
can I just opt out of the system you
can't yeah cuz they've already got you I
don't remember opting in where that
matter that's true they just kind of
start collecting your information and
creating a profile on you and that kind
of thing which is which is you don't
really need to opt in for anything these
days to actually be in it yeah so they
kind of just do whatever they want with
your information the world we live in
it's frustrating but information age has
turned against us it's the type of thing
I feel like shouldn't we shouldn't stop
talking about so I'll getting it up from
time to time hopefully absolutely some
things I concur stories are published
upon lines all right twitch is gonna ban
users for heat but not just on twitch
that's right if you're a twitch streamer
and you're like you know what on twitch
I'm really nice to people and you know
that's really cool and twitches like my
home base and everything but then on
other platforms like on on Twitter or on
YouTube or other social media platforms
you're like a dick and you like cuss
people out and you're racist and and
tell women that they're inferior and
stuff like that then you could still be
banned from twitch that's good yeah oh
they're expanding their policy basically
to include other venues other than
twitch so abuse taking place on other
platforms can contribute to a suspension
this includes hate or harassment conduct
that twitch deems hateful on any
platform will result in an immediate
indefinite suspension sexual conduct
rules have also been changed to consider
the context of a stream and this is
because there's sort of a really fine
line that twitch has to has to ride
between the popularity of some streamers
due to their let's say looks versus
people who are exploiting viewership
with their looks because obviously
twitch doesnt want to be a platform
where you know people are distributed
but your hand girls pieces cam dude I'm
the boobie streamer category obviously
that I mean that's it that's the thing
with the term it's referenced in the
story and I really yes because there's a
streamer can occur because there's
there's Sabha the better phrasing look I
don't know if there's a male version of
the boobie streamer as well why not or
something like that bad boobs this
accusation is that they're there and
they wear you know low you know low-cut
tops with lots of cleavage and
everything yeah and their image is
really big on the screen versus whatever
game they're playing and now that
there's IRL category as well there's
like reverse there's like their boobs
are fullscreen and then they're yeah
then the game the bottom right so since
which has to say alright on the one
hands you know views are views and the
more people viewing our
contents the better because that's how
they grow they're their platform and
everything like that on the other on the
other hand they have advertising
partnerships that they that they set up
and advertisers want to make sure and
this is of course been affected been
something we've talked about with
YouTube as well advertisers want to make
sure that if they're putting their ad in
front of something that that thing that
ads going in front of is wholesome or at
least enough that the people are going
to get offended and be like why are you
supporting this right with your ad
money's or whatever so twitch was
careful here to indicate that one the
sexual conduct rules have been changed
to consider the context which provides
them a bit of leeway in how they assess
streams so some streams might be more
okay than others so clutch it's gonna be
like oh that girls like some girls are
just feel attractive you know right and
if you're just a really strictly Bo and
you get lots of viewers I mean you're
not doing anything wrong welcome to
advertising but ever and ever in the
world that's it but you're not
necessarily exploiting it or whatever
you just happen to be attractive and
have lots of users you know there's
nothing inherently wrong with that
someone who's actively trying to push
the limits of you know sexuality and you
know going towards erotic or something
like that
is something that they want to be able
to cut down on at the same time they're
watching for abuse of this rule they say
we will not tolerate using this policy
as a basis to harass streamers on or off
twitch
so they're saying you can't go and
report someone for this if they are not
actually abusing the rule right so but
it's sort of a gray area too because
it's sort of subjective it is whether or
not someone exploiting you know that's
why they say can disappear and
considering context exactly yeah if so
that's the tricky part if someone is an
IRL or something like that and and
you're doing work you know but if people
do stay stream workouts or whatever
right yeah from very suspicious angles
or you know like or or maybe it's just
to work out and people work out in
spandex you know that's very common yeah
all right it's a girl streaming at home
and she's just wearing yoga pants but
she's somehow for some reason needs to
every three minutes to like turn her
back to the camera
yeah like get another glass of water for
the eighth time and that is issue that
is where that word context becomes so
important of course because and and
that's where you need an actual person
to go and watch that and see what's
being streamed and seeing if it's over
the line or if it's just somebody who's
you know doing their thing and then and
they happen to have a nice but there's
probably just a new board a new board of
members at twitch called like the but
police or like I mean there has patrols
if they're hiring
I would not a bad deal then again I'd
take the pickup you'd have to deal with
all variety of no anyway more on that or
a minute yep any windows finally updated
excellent let me go back to the desktop
these guidelines will come into effect
February 19th alrighty so you're
wondering so that's six a week week from
yesterday all right so let's move on to
the next segment which is certified so
everything's broken and I can fix this
at least for when we get to your half
hey I'm in a certain fight and I don't
have that setup so I put my effing cat
my PC there whatever we're doing doing
later oh wow okay typical Windows we go
again about here ready to go
all right so we both did videos on the
launch that just happens of the new AMD
APU so 2200 G 24 to G nice little
products yeah I like them I dig them I
like them I think they're very well
positioned right now because graphics
cards are so expensive and we need them
badly but even that's the thing that
sucks like even with not needing to buy
a graphics card because memory is so
expensive you part out something with
one of these ap use it's still like a
$600 system yeah I need to look at it
look
get it again it depends on what memory
you're going with but you know you want
to get some decently fast memory so
right and capacity matters too yeah so
and since you're using some of the
system memory as part of as the GPU
memory because the APU is got the
built-in graphics built in Vega GPU but
that doesn't have memory on it so it
uses your system memory for the graphics
memory and that cuts into your available
sit overall system memory so whereas
before a budget system with an eight
gigs of memory would probably get you by
just fine you know with it if you had a
discrete graphics card now you're
looking at all right eight gigs minus
one one gig for the GPU plus if you want
to increase the available amount for the
GPU can do that as well so yeah there's
still some dilemmas to get past but good
products but anyway yeah were you did
you look at all over the weekend and see
any of the stuff that son of a tech
posted no okay so a set of the tech is a
tech tech channel okay
he has 26,000 subscribers okay and I
can't figure out his name because he
says his name really fast at the
beginning of the videos but anyway his
channel is called son of a Tech this
video is linked down in the description
he basically went and ordered from
Amazon one of the 24 hundred G's on
Friday ok and they shipped it to him and
it arrives Saturday morning so he spent
all day Saturday
did a 10 hour livestream of just testing
the 2400 g playing games and doing some
overclocking and stuff like that ok I
kind of caught a little bit about it
because I saw a couple people tweeting
about it here and there and then on
Sunday he actually posted his review
which he called the world's first risin
for 2400 G Raven review now since his
heart fight and in sword fight we have
to argue about something I'll bring up
the argument point here okay I caught a
little bit of a little bit back and
forth between him and Joker
we know Joker from poker reviews yep and
Joker was a little bit he wasn't happy
but son of a tech because
Joker like us working directly with AMD
received samples of these two CPUs from
AMD right and when you do that you have
to agree to an a review embargo right
which means you say until this specific
date and time I will not post any
content about this sure any reviews or
anything like that and he was basically
saying that son of a Tech should not
have done this that he was he was it was
underhanded underhanded and sneaky and
that he should have abided by the review
embargo right so that's what we're gonna
argue here and you guys please go ahead
and let us know by voting on this drop
whole what you think was it okay for set
of a text to post this pre embargo
content about the rise in 520 400 G no I
can't speak for certain as to how
familiar he is with like I mean I'm sure
he knew there was an embargo he knew
this is an upcoming product right they
went up for pre-sale so that's how he
was able to order it right I don't know
he if he was aware of the specific date
and time of the embargo I don't know if
he worked with anyone in order to get
like any drivers for like the Vega for
the Vega graphics or anything like that
sure so you know I don't wanna make any
assumptions about that but basically we
have two options you got no you should
have waited or yes he can cuz he bought
it and he can do do what he wants with
it so okay I'll let you I'll give you
the honors here and if you guys have
never seen us do do do a swordfight
before our our mission is to argue for
our side regardless of what we actually
actually thinks um I just want to point
that out and thank you for linking that
in chat cell and Kyle indeed um okay so
do I go first yeah you can go first okay
um I'm gonna say I think yes I'll say
yes it was okay for him to do it okay
for it I think the issue is really
between AMD and and
because I feel like if Amazon sent him a
sample early or a product early and
Amazon was aware that AMD had this NDA
or embargo that they were trying to
adhere to that Amazon as a retailer I
would think would seek approval or
permission from AMD and ask this is okay
to send this sample or to sell the
sample early to this tech channel
because I don't know this guy might not
even have a connection to AMD he might
be struck I mean if he's going through
Amazon for his sample I mean that tells
you right there he probably didn't
doesn't have a close enough relationship
to the vendor to to acquire the sample
directly so maybe that means he probably
didn't get the press deck or the
reviewers guide or anything from anyone
at AMD that said you can't post any
content about this until this time on
this date so whether or not and yeah
it's debatable because maybe he did know
that the embargo was gonna lift 6 a.m.
Pacific time on Monday but without any
sort of contractual contract contract or
agreement I don't think he's legally at
fault here I think you know the person
who gave it to him is which would be
Amazon now of course you could argue
that you know from an ethical standpoint
maybe he should have not not done that
10 hour stream you know a day or two
before launch anyway if he knew himself
deep down that he wasn't supposed to but
again you're talking death achill versus
lawful and that's that sort of that's my
argument that's all I got
tell me why I'm wrong Paul so tell me
about your prevaricate infertility
salesman oh I seems like you just tried
to sell me a load of bullshit Wow that's
what that was a clever it was very good
I think you didn't have to argue your
point now I know that was a knife way
too long to just come up that alright so
just just argue the opposite side here
sun protection should have waited here
it was disrespectful I think when it
comes down to is his respect for the
community of reviewers who get free
stuff sent to them all the time by
manufacturers because obviously you know
when people when the reviewers get those
products they're all held to an embargo
agreements and there's a there's a level
of respect for the other people that you
work with in the Revere community
because the embargo agreements if
someone breaks it they are taking
advantage of everyone else in that
circle they're breaking the circle of
trust and you never want to break the
circle of trust now a set of attack
obviously you know he's a youtuber he's
got a channel he's building the channel
and when you build a channel with
technology on YouTube you know you you
you want to make sure that you
ingratiate yourself so the others who
are already part of that community
because they're obviously all very
respectable honorable good people very
intelligence handsome and extremely well
endowed and I would want to make sure
that those people had a good opinion of
me all the time and pulling something
like this is just it's it's just it's
the height of disrespect this grace
can't I can't
disgraceful I mean I I am I am ashamed
to even repeat the name of his channel
son of a tech and I would never at all
encourage people to go to a channel like
that especially by putting a link to his
video in my video description that would
be a bad idea
that'd be a terrible idea I would never
do it and son of a Tech shame on you you
are a son of a tech okay as your name
suggests let's move on no let's let's
not move on alright let's never move on
let's never let's stay here forever all
right let's see what do you guys think
about this results everyone agrees with
Kyle yay 82% so you were definitely
taking the underdog approach yeah
underdogs standpoint so I figured that
would be the the majority as a lot of
you guys mentioned in chat and NDA it is
something that you have to agree to
between the reviewer
and said you know corporation or company
and since the guy never really agreed to
anything he's not contractually
obligated yes and um and I will say
having you know I was laying my sarcasm
on there pretty pretty thick this I
would mainly agree with everything with
everything cattle said in his argument I
think there is some gray area depending
on how much you do work directly with
with the manufacturers and that kind of
thing but in this specific situation I
think he did what I would have done in
his situation which is when that package
arrives Saturday morning realize wow
this is an opportunity to get some
eyeballs on this and be the first and
being first yeah is version price why
people like to be first I can't say if I
was in his exact position I wouldn't do
the same yeah that's you I said I
probably was at 26 K subs I mean you're
trying to like how do you stand out you
know against and he and I believe I
believe I don't have the the threat
pulled up or anything like that but I
believe he said that he actually did
communicate with AMD as well an AMD in
that situation they might have asked him
say like hey can you take this down or
whatever but he was under no obligation
to write and I don't think that from
what I heard
oh he's in here hey sign of attack oh
hey how's it going what up thanks for
being here yeah it's a good thing to
talk about and maybe a perspective that
not everyone everyone gets if you're a
viewer of the tech youtubes versus
someone who's creating content or that
kind of thing yeah all right it's uh I
would I did not break thread repair
embargo rules I had an email that told
me it was okay to do that I just didn't
see the follow up email that said they
changed their mind wow that was that
what Wow
Kent I can't trust you anytime hey if
someone tells you it's okay to do
something and you go ahead and do that
thing what's what's the problem oh yeah
I see no problem right
alright let's say let's continue
discussion we talked about twitch a
little bit and some of their updated
rules YouTube also has been dealing
with ongoing issues a lot of this is
fallout from the whole Logan Paul thing
there's an article on this over on
TechCrunch they are now saying and have
stated very clearly and forcefully that
they will potentially take action they
announced a more formal and wider set of
sanctions they're prepared to level at
any creator that starts to post that
posts videos that are harmful to viewers
or others in the YouTube community or
advertisers because I think they
probably in their heart of hearts
advertisers would have been first on
that list but yeah but you got it you
know you got to include everyone sure so
yeah they've actually already done this
to look and Paul twice and I want to try
never to say his name again
it will remove monetization options on
the videos so access to the advertising
programs at YouTube has and they also
may remove a channels eligibility to be
to be recommended on YouTube such as
appearing on the home page trending tab
or watch next and monetization may or
may not be a big deal to a youtuber has
a huge following and already has lots of
money because there's a certain point
when you get to a certain level of
viewership there's there's so many views
coming in then so much ad revenue that
money probably becomes less of an issue
right but if people can't find your
videos to watch them and suddenly your
popularity tanks and suddenly your
videos aren't getting views anymore that
might be a bigger deal so this might be
a consequence that that actually has
effects who knows we'll have to have to
wait and see how people actually respond
to this or a few tube actually goes
ahead and enforces it anywhere so
obviously our days are numbered that's
really what it comes down to here Kyle
and I we don't we don't really have high
standards and better jump on that float
plane soon Paul yeah I know I'm still
waiting for my my gilded invitation low
well we're still waiting for the site to
be delivered by Luke in it what Saul
just let's all just like go to Luke and
be like you're not working hard enough
Luke wait wait were you slacking so much
what are you suck breath I just I feel
like Luke Lucas needs to roll up and go
in a limo with like you know like the
really like nice three-piece suit like
opens it up slice wimps come on over
here and then like I get in there's like
you know surprise some models were there
and we all have champagne or something
like that just like Linus and Etzel and
in like a bikini oh yeah yeah and it's
all very tasteful of course and the
models are paid well mr. respectful but
then then he's like let me show you what
float what float plane is all about what
flood plane really is and I can't I
can't continue beyond there because
because you don't know I'll tell you
tell you Paul once you get inside that
limo yeah you're never the same so all
this being said the next question that
we'd like to argue and have you guys
answer and let us know what you think
this is really I'm doing some research
here we totally find what profession
should Kyle and I start looking into a
little bit you know we have we have some
overlap time here where we can get some
kind of on-the-job training so to speak
we could maybe we could maybe get
ourselves set up I suppose so that Thank
You self for posting Lincoln chat I was
on it we have a wide variety of options
here assassin of course we got
professional arm flailing competitive
chef all our reality TV
I got a construction worker sexy the
pool boy sexier assistant to the
regional manager sexiest and accounting
exotic dancing commercial airline pilot
and then of course hardcore porn actor
or behind the scenes yeah which I mean I
just I know people I can also notice our
lower core and I feel like there was
there's too much too many obvious
potential jobs that would just fit you
know they'd just be the right fit it
would just be the right fit yeah so
actor obviously in front of the camera
behind the scenes behind so you got your
fluffer you got your director DP yeah
you know there's a
see what you did there as well so uh
what do you think here actually no you
went first last time I'm gonna yeah you
go all right uh I'm gonna go with what
do I want to do though I want to do the
most hmm you know I know I don't feel
like I could go back into the hardcore
porn world I just it's been it's been
too long that's where that soul patch
was first forged it's the flavor savor
it
still still got some flavor so sounds so
wrong in that context all right I'm
gonna go I'm gonna go for accounting I
feel like at this point I just want
something stable something reasonable
something where you know things just add
up and I can make counting yeah out of
all the things you picked literally you
picked the most boring option I know who
boy would have been more exciting cuz
pool boy that ties it right back into
hardcore porn actor you know I mean how
many times does a pool boy get lucky
compared to the accountant look
accountants Oh accountants they make
decent money you know usually you've got
benefits oh that's very exciting with it
and it's like that you all that you left
all behind we look at we've resigned
from new hey I really feel I want to go
back I really feel like I'd like to
spend more time working with Excel I
think is what it comes down to and and
you know I think that's really why it's
really where my passion is I only want
to take up golf to or something well I
don't know the kazoo I mean maybe I'm
maybe crook
maybe I'm free maybe you should just
start crocheting maybe I'm playing the
long game here maybe maybe never mind
never mind for that I don't want an
instability I don't want to say too much
so what about you what do you think I am
I will be an assassin and I will I will
hold you at gunpoint I will hold you at
gunpoint until you agree to leave your
accounting days behind because I will
not stand around and watch you waste
your life and potential and
talent as a lowly accountant swine so
all right I mean that's that's what I
will use my assassin it's very
reasonable my assassin abilities you
know you know make it challenging to be
an assassin also being a porn actor
would be a video where you announce to
people that you're gonna be an assassin
I don't think if you really wanted to be
an assassin that you'd probably be
interested in a cover for that maybe
something that was unassuming that
people wouldn't possibly think hey maybe
that accountants actually an assassin
but I'll leave it to you that makes your
own choice that's how good of an
assassin I would be is I could be in the
public eye in front of millions of
people and they'd still never see me
coming
just like a hardcore porn actor sorry
that was terrible feeling you like
another beer sure sure why not all right
let's see what you guys think with it
I'm really we have to go with whatever
people say all right court Wow hardcore
porn taking the lion's share of the vote
but it looks like most more people want
us to stay on camera I think that's
really what we should what we should
derive from this I think that's people
want to see our faces definitely not our
possibly other parts of us now - yeah
well I keep that in mind okay but you
know behind the scenes - is also
possible professional arm flailing
though a close second although seconds
of the work in the adult adult film
industry arm flailing Kumbi oh wow
construction worker is the only one that
I was trying to choose the the one that
would get the fewest votes but
construction worker came in just behind
accounting no one assassin only got 38
votes right man right dammit that that
that straw poll will still be in the
video description if you guys happen to
be watching there the upload of this on
youtube so feel free to go and vote it
will make a huge difference in our lives
you all right I'm gonna save my mail
time for okay the end of your half and
I'll open it well we do your Q&amp;amp;A yeah
sounds good
actually as we go into the Q&amp;amp;A segment
here we're gonna answer some questions
people have asked in chat donation
comments we would also well I don't I
don't say we me I've thought I've
thought about this but I haven't talked
to you about it yet I feel like we
should try to shrink this end sake
section down it takes over like becoming
a little alert of the show you big of a
chunk of the show I agree so for now
we'll go ahead as is but in the future
we might be um trying to reduce this
just a little bit again just like a
limit like a dollar limit or something
like that
just be respectful of everyone's time
few people with feedback on that but do
like a hundred dollar limit or something
alright so let's try to run through
these really quick donation comments
thank you guys for your donations mordom
says with the ten dollar donation
says it looks like the NBA's actually
give light gaming another option over
going consoles options are always a good
thing yes they absolutely do they're
great option for that we just need the
memory prices to come down to make it
like a really nice budget like $400 you
know more competitive with the console
prices no visiting formance yeah Scott
Dilbeck 666 didn't get to catch a show

brewing Anaheim brewery or if you go
from Irvine CA Irvine has like the the
spectrum the spectrum and there's a lot
of restaurants there some of them are
more like the big bigger chains and that
kind of thing
you like looking up Yelp or whatever you
go to the spectrum and look on Yelp
if you drive out to Laguna Beach which
is just like you go south from Irvine
and it's not that far there's a
restaurant called lumber lumberyard that

thank you thank you greet Oh Jose Gomez
with the $5 donation question is does
YouTube read to help you guys even if
it's not monetized for that video love
the work you guys are doing keep up the
good work
I'm actually not positive how that works
if you have youtube bread I think the
video does have to be monetized in order
for you to bread to give money but I'm
not positive I don't
that's probably in the fine print
somewhere yeah I haven't checked it out
don't know the answer to that's but
thank you for your donation David
Bullock
5canadian will either of you ever create
some content about the vintage about
vintage or retrocomputing I'd love to
see some attempted Pentium 2 or Pentium
3 windows 98 builds and gaming oh my
gosh
just like her mind kind of a cool I mean
yeah it'd be fun to dabble into I
definitely have some old hardware lying
around I just feel like I have so many
current projects that getting into that
old stuff would be be challenging also
there's like so many things you forget
about like little quirks and stuff like
going back to the penny on to pinion 3
days but hey you never know David
perhaps perhaps yeah okay he's now $10
hey guys and I how to ask this but could
I bounce some questions off one or both
of you for some guidance starting a
channel possibly a p.m. on Twitter if
not that's cool
Ethan we get those requests all the time
we have given generic advice for that
from time to time but I I'm not sure how
exactly I could tell you to directly
contact us just make sure that you are
starting a channel because it's
something you enjoy doing and not
because you want to make lots of money
off of it right
stay consistence make sure you're
posting with some consistency listen to
your audience don't worry about numbers
don't worry about getting lots of views
but cherish the views that you do get
and respond to people and make sure that
even as you're responding to people and
adjusting your content to match your
audience that you're still staying true
to doing stuff that you enjoy doing at
the same time and be prepared to not to
make less than minimun a minimum wage
for like the first year yeah and hope it
helps if it's a side job hobby or
passion projects for the first couple
years at least yep
all right Justin Parrish five dollar
donation will we ever see another Nvidia
card like these 690 dual GPU single slot
card given the increase in bandwidth and
next generation PCI Express Lanes it
seems like nvidia has decided no that
that's not something that they need to
do and that dual card solutions is more
viable than that they've gone more with
like the single big chip
you know titan type cards that they can
they can do and I feel like they've been
doing pretty decently with that yeah
dual GPU is naturally had some
challenges when it comes to driver
support and that kind of thing so I
don't know I mean it's not another
question but I don't I don't see it
happening any time soon yeah Philip CD
with five pounds I bought a Strix rx 580
for 250 pounds in November and sold it
yesterday for 420 pounds got an EVGA for
the win 1074 450 pounds
Verizon 516 1600 X at 3.8 the pub G
doesn't use a hundred percent
huggbees terribly optimized and you will
not get all of the performance out of
your hardware that you can who knows
what they'll fix that in the future
really nice flip though on that I mean
no kidding for people who do have GPUs
especially anyone who bought like a 5
and 500 series
Radeon card like back when they were
normal price like you can get some
pretty pretty nice hardware upgrades
from that so get on you Philips well
then wishbone $5 donation are you gonna
do more testing on the Vega ap use see
if they can do any crossfire with an AMD
Vega 56 I don't think that's gonna
happen wishbone is it possible or just a
dream probably not yeah probably not
just know that yeah I don't see that
happening and he did some some sort of
like crossfire stuff with their
integrated GPU stuff several years back
with the earlier like the FM 1 and FM 2
platforms but the GPUs that you had to
pair the AP use up with we're so low end
and so crappy right that it really made
more sense just to spend a hunt you know
20 bucks more on like a slightly better
exact low-end graphics card and then you
can get better performance than both of
them combined sales right it's a I think
it's very challenging to do something
like that so chances are if you get a
big at 56 it's just gonna be a big of 56
