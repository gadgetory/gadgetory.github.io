probing Paul episode number four this is
my monthly Q&amp;amp;A series I do every month
towards the end of the month so for
April these are the questions that you
asked and my answers to them true to
form this is the history of probing Paul
going all the way back to Episode one as
well as the inception of the name of the
title which came from Kyle bless his
heart
let's jump into it with question number
one though this is from Sid from last
month's video and he asks how do you
earn a living doing this and I have to
assume that he's asking about how do I
earn a living making YouTube videos
that's that's what I do full-time job
the answer is three primary ways I have
three main sources of income one is
directly from YouTube that's what the
ads that get served up at the beginning
of the videos as they are monetized if
you guys see an ad then I get a few
cents I don't know how much I get when
you guys watch an ad but it's a little
bit YouTube bread falls into that
category as well if you subscribe to
YouTube bread and you watch my videos
then I get a little cut of that so
that's kind of the the main source of
income secondary source but also very
important so that I probably can get by
without would be Amazon affiliates as
well as other affiliate sites that are
out there so if you click on one of my
Amazon links and you go to Amazon and
then you buy something Amazon credits me
as having directed the traffic over
there now there's a thank you to me they
give me a little cut depending on what
you bought the cut can be bigger or
smaller to that kind of thing there's a
third primary way and I've actually been
doing that less this year which is for
me to actually sell ads that I
personally put within the videos for
that I'll work with vendors I've worked
with like gigabyte and fractal and
Coolermaster before and that's just
direct sponsorship for me which is a
good way to do it and I try to keep
those shortened and straightforward and
at the beginning of the videos and get
them out of the way quick so you guys
can you know spot a product if you're
interested but then move on and get to
the video if that's what you're
interested in anyway that's that's
pretty much how I make my money it's
definitely not something that you could
do easily starting out with a brand new
channel but more on that with the next
question did I did I put these in the
right order I think I kind of did all
right from phantasm gaming a two-part
question which is what advice do you
have a con
for a content creator who wants to get
into tech reviews and doing PC builds so
the questions this month had a lot to do
not necessarily with the tech directly
but with how to do YouTube tech stuff so
you know I'm answering them anyway what
advice for a content creator who wants
to get into doing what I do tech reviews
and PC builds secondary question is how
do you get companies to send you
products to put in builds and reviews
both are very good questions the first
advice I would give you is not to
attempt to start a brand new channel
right now especially in tech and expects
to immediately or even in the near
future make about a lot of money off of
it or make that your full-time job I
find that the mentality that you go
forward with with something like this is
very very important and just staying
positive all the time is like the
primary thing so if you say alright I'm
going to start a YouTube channel and
it's going to be my job that's what I'm
gonna do no matter how passionate you
are no matter how good your videos are
out of the gates there's a long lead-up
time I've been doing this for eight or
nine years now my channel less than that
four or five years but I did Newegg TV
before this so I already had a bit of a
following some people who knew who I was
and that really helped me get going also
there's just a lot more people making
this type of content now so it's a
little bit harder to get recognized that
said my big my biggest thing that the
most important piece of advice is do it
because you enjoy it do it because you
love it and don't do it with the
expectation that it's gonna make you
money second question which is how do
you get vendors or companies to send
products to you that is a tricky one the
main thing to do is to have lots of
subscribers and many viewers but since
chances are you don't necessarily have
that right out of the gate there are a
few other ways to go about it you can
sign up for something like the Amazon
vine program that gives you you know
free samples that you can use sometimes
you keep them sometimes you send them
back that's a great way to do it try to
find companies that are looking for
smaller creators that they want to seed
products to a lot of companies have kind
of a a list of the reviewers that they
like to work with and they'll send them
products all the time and it'll be
harder hard to kind of break into that
inner circle of who they work with but
there are companies who actively want
new and fresh faces looking at the
products so like
I know AMD RTP is just a one that comes
to my mind red team plus and they work
with a lot of content creators and and
people who do reviews who you know they
have websites they have YouTube channels
but you know they don't have huge
followings and ambi wanted to work with
people who were maybe a little bit less
experienced a little fresher maybe a
fresh perspective I guess would be the
best way to put that the other thing I
would suggest is just as far as getting
products would be not to rely too
heavily on getting them directly from an
manufacturer seriously consider
something like the vine program that I
already mentioned there's other
retailers that have I think Newegg has a
program that's similar like that egg
expert one last thing would be to
consider buying products and returning
them as long as the company you're
buying it from has a return policy
sometimes you'll be stuck with a 15%
restocking fee but then you'll have a
product to do a video on versus not
having a product to do a video on and
that's where I would go with that
actually one last suggestion try to find
a local a local like CPU repair or Hart
a local computer repair shop and see if
you can work with them and you know get
products to borrow or something like
that there's lots of different ways to
go about it but yeah definitely having
this something to do a video on is very
important so stick with that all right
here's not a question but I included it
anyway this is from Siddharth Sharma and
he says I really like your channel your
videos are very thorough and critical
about stuff and I think you're very
honest and giving your views about the
products and thanks for making them and
keep them coming
I included this to make myself feel
better because you know everyone can use
a pick-me-up from time to time but also
kind of a follow-up to the previous two
questions when it comes to making videos
on YouTube making tech videos and I like
the way I make videos is to hopefully
get responses like this
I guess that's that's what I'm trying to
say I like that that Siddharth was so
complimentary of course you know you can
never argue with that but he likes that
I was critical and thorough and those
are the things that I try to do in my
videos too you know hopefully make him
stand out from something that's just you
know maybe a little not as in-depth I
like to take the product use it as much
as I can you know do do everything I can
to use it in different ways and give you
guys my real announced opinions so I
guess going back to the previous
questions that's another thing that
maybe you could focus on is you know try
to be honest trying to be upfront
and don't try to like I never try to be
overly showy about anything or get
really excited like oh this is awesome
because I'm bad at getting excited
anyway but done alright enough for that
let's move on to probably the tech iasts
question that I have for today's episode
this is from flippin Fred he says okay
so Paul why haven't you done any reviews
on any fan text cases I'm sure you're
gonna say cuz Kyle is taking care of
those but I was trying to see if you had
comments of your own on them let me know
your take all right fan ticks cases I
like and though I have not done what I
would call directly a review on one I
have done a build in one the fan text
into pro I've actually done two builds
in it now because I took the first build
out of it and I did this build in it
which is behind me that I did for the
msi xin god-like gaming motherboard
review I really like fan tax cases they
do a crap ton of accessories in them I
like the design and the style of a lot
of them the look feels you know it's a
good look without feeling like it's
ripped off from somebody else or like
it's to just you know like a box that's
sitting there and that kind of thing I
will say that having worked with lots of
different cases before I can sometimes
see where fantex cuts their costs when
it comes to certain things like you know
how thick the steel is that you use in a
case a manufacturer by making that you
know just just ever so slightly thinner
can save a bunch of money over the
entire run of cases that they produce it
seems to me like the fantex cases while
they have are very rich on features the
build quality is not always theirs
especially when you compare it to
something like you look Coolermaster
cases which are built like tanks most of
the time I will actually give you a
working example right now if you can
hear this
you guys hear that
okay if you can't tell that's the side
panel and the side panels on and it's
got a thumb screw in it in the back but
it still rattles it doesn't sit flush
and you know it's not the end of the
world when the case is just sitting
there it's no big deal a lot of people
can deal with you know slightly thinner
gauge steel on everything and I do not
by any means mean to say don't buy
fantex cases I just wanted to point out
in my experience working with them since
you asked that's the sort of trade-off
you get tons of features but maybe not
the top tier build quality but still
very well-made and still very viable
cases and I've recommend them
recommended than many times before the
yak has done more review on the reviews
on them than I have must be rolling in
that fantex money okay
next apparently my keyboard just stopped
working next questions from William
build in 55 Burgoon he says can someone
please tell me how he switches between
the computer screen and the camera and I
will actually show you that right now
William because I'm using OBS and
although I got to shrink the screen down
look there's OBS right there in the
middle it's capturing you can see what
I'm doing and I've set it up with the
shortcut keys so I can hit 2f keys and
jumping back and forth between them of
course ideally I don't have OBS visible
on the screen that I'm capturing and
okay now that I've moved it off I can
show you one other thing that I like to
do with it
now that I have the capability which is
I use another capture card so right now
my camera is capturing straight to the
computer via Blackmagic intensity Pro
card I've also got this L got two elgato
game capture hd60 which is an external
card so this I can connect up to say a
little computer you can't see this
computer there's a little computer right
here and I did this when I was
benchmarking this system so I could be
running benchmarks on the on the system
passing that through this capture and
then to the monitor where I can see it
this is capturing over to the system my
capture system and then I can capture
exactly what I'm doing while I'm running
benchmarks without affecting the
performance of the system that I'm
benchmarking at all I was able to use
this method to show you like MSI
combustor running at the same time as a
full CPU load test and show you
real-time
temperatures and reporting on the screen
and that kind of thing which I would not
be comfortable doing and saying here's
the results if I was also capturing
straight from the system so I find that
to be quite handy and yeah OBS is great
software I'm not even using the there's
a new version that has like a fancier UI
that's supposed to be easier to work
with but I haven't even tried it yet but
really like OBS I use xsplit to here's
another kind of production oriented
question from gentes jente Stewie 1 2 3
what lens though this is a follow-up to
the when I was talking last month about
my camera which I use a gh4 and I just
got a second gh4 he's asking what lens
do I use 12 35 2.8 is so expensive and
that's what I have right here also think
about 25 millimeter 1.7 the primes are
harder to work with he's doing video
could I share what kind of lenses I use
I understand your pain
considering prime lenses prime lenses
that you can adjust the focal length so
you can't zoom in or out basically you
get a fixed thing and that means that in
order to get closer or further away you
have to move the entire camera unless
the camera is on a tripod and you're
shooting video well that can be kind of
a pain in the ass so here's the lenses I
use and also please bear in mind that I
have a second gh4 so I got this GH for
another gh forever the gh for that I'm
using right now dude for that I'm using
right now is using canon EF lens that's
the lens that I got for my 5d mark ii
back when I first started doing YouTube
channels or my own YouTube channel I
really liked that lens it's an L series
17 to 40 millimeter so it's wide angle
f/4 I think is as fast as it gets so I
really like that lens and I decided I
wanted to keep using it even though I
have sold my 5d mark ii so for that lens
I have a Panasonic or a Micro Four
Thirds mount to EF mount adapter it's
made by my Metta booms
it's an active adapter but it's not a
speed booster they do have a speed
booster for it as well but it's like 200
bucks more so I didn't get that anyway
so that's the lens that you're viewing
me through right now I also have this
which is the aforementioned fairly
expensive 12 to 35 Panasonic lens that's
made specifically for the Micro Four
Thirds mount and the gh4 other lenses
that I got because I do like having
other lens
this is a macro lens I got this still
when I was using my Canon camera this is
made by Tamron and this basically has
the mixture of features in that it is an
EF mount lens it is a macro lens which
is made for focusing really really close
in on things like that that would be a
good thing to get them use a macro lens
for and I wanted super close-ups of you
know parts of motherboards or you know
keyboard switches or that kind of thing
so I needed the F EF mount and I need
you to not be terribly expensive so this
does a good job for me it's also kind of
funny when you move all the way it
extends quite a bit it's a grower not a
shower anyway that's my that's my macro
lens for getting extreme close-ups and
this is my brand new lens that I
literally have not even used yet I have
used this lens but not personally I got
this because it is the YouTuber lens
this is a extremely an extremely popular
configuration for youtubers so if you
want to do YouTube and you want to do 4k
and you have somewhere in the two
thousand dollar range to spend on a
camera and the lens solution I highly
recommend going for this and you know
what I didn't even bring the adapter all
right
this requires a meta bones adapter the
meta bone speed booster and this is a
different lens mount than EF so I'm
actually rocking three different types
of lenses when it comes to the mount
which isn't that great but this being
the YouTuber lens and me having seen
many people use it and also reading some
articles on it recently that explained
all the all the reasons why this lens
works so well particularly in
conjunction with the meta bone speed
booster and the Lumix gh4 because the
the way that the just the light coming
through the speed booster hits the
sensor it hits it at a really ideal
point so you don't it doesn't crop as
much even as a standard lenses and it
turns out really nice this goes to F 1.8
and I believe what the speed booster it
gets down to like F 1.2 this is the
Sigma 18 to 35 pro art lens and it's
really nice this was about
this goes for 800 I got it from about
650 bucks on eBay because I think it's
an international version I don't know if
my us warranty will work with it but hey
you know I'm 50 bucks off right sure I'm
sure it will be fine a couple more quick
questions this one's from Zhi Hao Yu Zhi
Hao Yu I'm sorry if I'm pronouncing your
name wrong
what kind of desk you're using in most
of your videos is it a DIY solution it
is a Kia hammer countertop birch is the
finish there are three of them they're
the eight foot long versions and yes
it's kind of DIY look at my garage work
log series and you can see when I
installed all of these I'm using the
IKEA table legs that you can just buy
and I installed them in various places
to give it both support and allow me to
scoot in to the desk when I needed to
and sit down comfortably and everything
do you often search for things that are
directly in front of you says asks Viper
tail 78 yes yes I do actually constantly
it's really sad sometimes getting down
to the end max Patera asks a very nice
question you know Paul I work at
hinterland brewery in Green Bay what up
what up Green Bay Wisconsin
hypothetically if I were to send you
some beer to try it would you a I'll
drink it on awesome hardware I would say
max yes I'd be happy to drink your beer
on awesome hardware I'd be more than
happy in fact here's my p.o box
Paul's Hardware Apia box for three to
five and you can ship me stuff there if
you are going to ship me anything that
is edible I would prefer that it was
sealed just for anyone who has any ideas
out there but you know got to be safe
and everything since I'm publishing APO
box a shipping address on the web but
yeah we already got some fudge that came
all the way from Devon in the UK and it
was absolutely delicious so I'd be happy
to taste some Wisconsin beer as well
that would be amazing
but guys that is all for probing Paul
this week no this month I hope you have
enjoyed it I know I rambled a bit but
you know ask me questions and I just
start talking stay tuned for another
video coming up this weekend's actually
a garage work log is what I have in
store for you if you hadn't noticed
there's new and colorful lights going on
behind me I I've managed to do lighting
along this top row here and the bottom
row and I also painted I did painting
underneath there and other manual-labor
things and I did a garage work log out
of that so stay tuned for that hit the
thumbs up button on this video if you
enjoyed it leave me comments in the
comment section below because that is
generally where I have been going to
grab the questions for next month and if
you want to buy stuff and help support
my cause oh you know what I totally
forgot to even say that when I was
talking about ways I make money on
YouTube that's the other way I make
money on YouTube is merchandising so if
you want to help me out with the
merchandising I have mugs plank glasses
as well as shirts on store pulsar
Burnett you can buy them there and get
yourself some swag and then you will
also help me you know eat food and pay
the mortgage and all that kind of stuff
