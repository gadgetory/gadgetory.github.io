learn more welcome everyone to part 4 of
my Riptide build series Riptide is my
absolutely massive system actually 2
systems building the corsair 1000d case
featuring the AMD 1950 x thread ripper
processor and it's water-cooled hence
the name Riptide also has a small system
down in there in the bottom that suck at
a m4 with an AMD 2400 g processor that's
going to be a FreeNAS build with 32 gigs
of hard drive storage down there as well
there's a ton of stuff in this system so
if you haven't already check out the
initial build videos where I put it
together as well as one where I started
to work on the water cooling stuff it
was just posted a few days ago for today
though we are continuing that water
cooling experience we already have the
blocks installed today where you're
going to be installing the pumps as well
as the reservoirs as well as the tubing
and I am doing soft tubing for this
build supplemented by these little alpha
cool quick-release connectors because I
want this system to not just be a crazy
over-the-top system with dual 1080p eyes
and everything but I want it to be
functional I want to be able to take it
apart when I need to I want to be able
to upgrade it if I need to and I don't
want to have to worry about completely
disassembling a hard-line water cooling
loop if I'm doing that now there are
still some decisions to be made today
the main ones are gonna be how and where
specifically am I going to be mounting
my 2 D 5 pumps as well as these alpha
cool reservoirs with the helix inserts
also should I go with both blue helix
inserts both white helix inserts or one
blue and one white I will probably
decide that one way or another by the
end of this video but if you're watching
right now go ahead and leave me with
comments in the comments and let me know
which of these color combinations for
the helix inserts you prefer
for starters Here I am installing the
ice block HDX - - from alpha cool this
is an MDOT - riser card as already
mentioned and this is going to go in the
lower system the FreeNAS build and I
can't use the MDOT two on the back of
this board because of the CPM using the
2400 G
so the HD x2 is installed and I'm liking
how it looks it matches very nice with
the finish on the GPX and coolers on the
GPUs and I also want to clarify
something here I mentioned this 120 gig
Corsair &amp;amp; p500
SSD was going to be the boot drive
that's not true I'm actually gonna be
using this as a cache drive under here
is the Intel obtain 32 gig drive and
that is what I'm using as a boot drive
so 32 gig boot drive 120 gig cache for
the 30 2 terabytes 3.5 inch hard drive
array
so at that point the builds where you
just got to kind of stare at it and try
to figure out exactly what's position
orientation and direction the loop is
going to go if I didn't already
mentioned in this video the top right
here is gonna be for the CPU two front
rads are gonna be for the graphics cards
and then I have two pumps and two
reservoirs so I need to position these
all in here the pumps are separate from
the reservoir so I'm gonna need to have
the reservoirs up and above them and the
reservoirs come with two different
brackets here this one's plastic and I
can grip it in the middle which is a
little bit more flexible because you can
move it up or down I don't really like
the finish on this though it is just
black plastic and it doesn't really
match quite as nicely with the finish on
the rest of the system in general now
these are metal and actually shipped
with brackets that are made to be able
to mount on hundred and twenty or
hundred and forty millimeter fans so if
you already have a radiator setup you
can mount these on that mount this to
your radiator and you're pretty much
good to go
I could even mount one of these to the
front grab but I want them to be
side-by-side there and look a little bit
more symmetrical so these actually just
go on the top and bottom of each
reservoir like that and it does look
like this bottom piece can be removed so
I'm gonna see if I can just take this
little circular mount part remove this
larger bracket and mount each one to the
back to position them on that back wall
which should be easier on the right side
because it's got all these cutouts for
drilling through on the left side I have
a bunch of grommets so I might need to
drill some holes there we'll see how
things laugh
so here's where we're at right now we
spent a decent amount of time figuring
out how to get these pumps mounted on
this little bracket here the brackets
convenient because with just a couple of
thumbscrews right here you can remove
the whole thing so the pumps should have
been easy to mount to that because
there's a bunch of rails down in here
however they're all kind of offset and
staggered so I found that they were
actually mounting and they'd be a little
bit sideways so eventually we tried
different methods here and then Joe
suggested mounting one of the brackets
on the back so that's what we actually
did when they were side-by-side with the
brackets on either one they were pushing
each other apart and that wasn't working
so now we have just one on the side of
this one and then one on the back that's
mounted to both of them that is holding
this whole unit together and from there
it was just a matter of getting these
reservoirs mounted up here so right now
these are just held on by these two
fittings right here with just little
90-degree rotaries and we had a rough
time kind of trying to figure out a
mounting method for the top of it there
are these little brackets that come with
it and they have different mounting
pieces on the back we were trying to
hack one of those together we had
various whole things like this going on
and eventually it just really didn't
work out and I decided you know it even
though these are slightly loose on the
top there resting very well on the base
down here so I think it's gonna be okay
I'm gonna go without brackets on the top
and I'll just have fittings up there
going off with tubing so those set up on
there it was time to figure out how my
actual loop was gonna go so here's how
it's gonna go the left pump here is
gonna be for the CPU I'm gonna go
vertically up on this one with one of
these quick disconnects and actually
need more little male-to-male fittings
to actually connect this on so not gonna
be able to finish today I have more of
those in the mail though so quick
disconnect from there and then the
tubing is just going to go up to the
pump out from there and into the top
reservoir and I have a quick disconnect
on that right there so I'll be able to
disconnect two CPU block if I want to
and then at the back here I've got a
couple fittings coming down and this
tubing is just gonna go straight across
here and then back into the reservoir
for the pump down there that's pretty
much the whole loop I will do one more
quick disconnect back there and I might
tie it down somehow or figure out how I
can get it to actually rest up there but
I'll figure that out in the future and
then for the second
for the GPUs the out is gonna come out
right here and that's just gonna just
kind of kind of loop down and hang down
a little bit with quick disconnect right
there in the middle and back up to the
inlet there it'll come out of that and
it crosses back to the inlet here then
out of that and then another kind of
loop down here also into the first front
front reservoir and then out of that and
into it again and then out of that and
all the way up to the inlet on there and
then that is the second loop so I got my
soft tubing ready to go and fortunately
even though I need more of those
male-to-male fittings I do have plenty
of these just little simple 90-degree
ones actually one of these boxes was all
90-degree fittings and then one of them
here is also all Murray 45s those are
two very important types of fittings for
this type of work
so I got my first tube installed I'm
happy about that this is nice to have
flexible tubing it's a little bit easier
to work with in the hardline stuff but
I'm actually kind of liking the blue
sort of frosty blue look of the tubing
too I think it'll look okay here but I'm
sure there will be
aesthetic opinions on that speaking of
aesthetic opinions I got lots of
feedback on the brown noctua fan that's
on top of the NHL 9a that's right there
so I've decided to upgrade that or it's
more of a sigh grade or maybe even
slightly a downgrade when it comes to
performance but it's at least still a
knock to a fan this is the NFB 9 it's
part of the Redux series which means it
is gray and darker grey and - won't
stand out like that Brown fan I - it was
nice enough to also include long
mounting screws with the cooler so I
need to probably pull this whole thing
out - and I've been dreading doing that
because I'm gonna need to probably even
remove one of these graphics cards to do
that nothing's actually plumbed up with
tubing down here yet so I need to do
that probably sooner than later also
I've had the ECC memory 16 gig dims
arrive I am not sure if this is actually
gonna work in ECC mode on this
motherboard it's kind of a shot in the
dark but I wanted to get something that
I could test with so that's a maybe to
preserve aesthetics for now I'm going to
stick with the Corsair kit that I have
in there because I have determined even
though it's not that easy I can reach
back here to unclip the memory so I can
swap that out even with stuff installed
right there so even though I'm excited
to do some more tubing right now I think
I need to pull that out and get that fan
swapped in first and then I can proceed
so I managed to get the new fan swapped
in I only had to sort of slightly remove
this power supply shroud / motherboard
tray at the bottom to get at that and
while I'm here an important thing that
I've realized as I've been looking at
this whole system the main system here
is actually going to be off most of the
time I'm only going to turn that on for
gaming and video editing the lower
system will be on all the time however
and it has four eight terabyte hard
drives there at the front I need to have
some air flow in here when this main
system is not connected so I think I'm
going to take just the fan sides of just
a couple of the front intakes and then
maybe one or even both of these rear
exhausts here and connect it up to the
mini ITX board there's only two other
fan headers on here though and they're
all tucked way back here kind of the
CPUs there and then there's a couple
case fan headers back there so I'm going
to use this little splitter just a
little few but PWM splitter position it
back behind the motherboard tray and
that way
I'll have a much easier way of plugging
and additional fans to make sure I get
some airflow for the mini ITX system
when the main rig is turned off
well guys I realize just a few minutes
ago that I need to end this video it is
Saturday it is once again getting
incredibly hot in my garage and I'm way
past the point where I should have
finished to this week's video and I just
realized thanks to this reservoir right
here I guess both of them technically I
cannot continue right now without a few
more pieces now I still haven't gotten
the mail to mail extension bits that I
need to finish off just a few of the
connection points for some of the quick
disconnects but needless to say there
have been tons of things that have gone
wrong during this video there is a
trouble with the mounting of the pumps
fortunately we were able to get around
that there was the trouble getting at
this down here there was a bit that I
didn't even show you with regards to the
wire and cable management back here with
getting this out and put back in and
lining up the actual screws on that
screw back in that was kind of painted
of a pain in the butt but I was really
excited to actually put water in at
least one of the loops I thought the CPU
loop was gonna be not too difficult and
after doing this first one I was like
alright quick run across the top to get
over to the reservoir and then just this
little blooper right here and then that
will be one of the loops all done but
fortunately I flipped the reservoir over
and actually took a closer look at the
bottom which I hadn't really done yet I
guess and realize there's three more
outlets on the bottom just like there's
three and let's on the top that means
that all of these need caps and all the
caps I have add at least a millimeter
and a half or two millimeters of space
so that means that this can no longer
sit flat on the pump right here it also
means that there's not enough clearance
for this a 90 degree Bend at the top
which is kind of necessary 90-degree
bends at the top actually doesn't even
have enough clearance even without that
spacer there so that's a problem
in and of itself but basically I don't
have enough space for everything I need
you now Dave showed me some flush caps
that he had at Computex and I don't know
if that's a new product that's still in
development or what but I need to get
some of those I need to get a few other
pieces still it's obvious so point being
I cannot finish for right now the good
news though is that at least the FreeNAS
system down at the bottom is pretty much
good to go and I've even got the memory
which I
swap in without too much difficulty so I
can get moving with a video on that so
I'm gonna follow up this one with a
video on that and then I will have to do
a part five of the build itself where I
finish off the actual water cooling loop
hey guys thank you for bearing with me I
agree with all of you guys out there who
are like oh my gosh that's cool but it's
so insane and so much work in so much
trouble
and it's a stupid idea and Paul's stupid
for doing it I agree with you you're
totally right but regardless hit the
thumbs up button if you enjoyed this
video and I'll be back next week with
more content thanks again for watching
guys and we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
