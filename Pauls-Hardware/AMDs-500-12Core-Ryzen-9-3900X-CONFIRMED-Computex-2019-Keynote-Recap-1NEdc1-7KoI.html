year but that is not going to stop me
from doing Computex coverage so this is
my first Computex video because Lisa sue
just finished AMD's first Computex
keynote ever it's not their first time
visiting Computex just their first time
doing it keynote and I have good news
and bad news the good news is we have
some great new info and release dates
for third gen Rison the bad news is when
it comes to Navi news the news was a
little bit slimmer there's just a single
demo that they shared as well as some
architecture and naming updates so I'm
going to structure this video by doing
the important stuff first we have three
upcoming products based on 3rd gen rise
and that have been announced and
confirmed we have a rise in 730 700 X
which is an 8 core 16 thread CPU for 329
dollars it has 36 megabytes of cache a
4.4 gigahertz boost and 3.6 gigahertz
based and only a 65 watt TDP that sounds
like a pretty nice chip for 330 dollars
they followed that up with the arisin
730 800 X which is an 8 core 16 thread
chip as well but this time it'll boost
up to 4 point 5 gigahertz with a 3.6
gigahertz base clock and a 105 watt TDP
so we have a 40 watt TDP increase for
the 3800 X for a 100 megahertz boost to
its top speed that's kind of weird but
moving on the hugest news I think is
that we now have confirmation that we
have a risin 9 series coming at us
they've only shared the 3900 X so far
which is a 12 core and 24 thread CPU we
do have news that there's probably going
to be 16 core versions as well but more
on that in just a second this one's
going to sell for 499 dollars MSRP was
70 Meg's of cash a 4.6 gigahertz boost
clock and a 3.8 gigahertz base and still
a 105 watt TDP so the 3900 X 12 core is
gonna be 500 bucks and they did that
demo it actually had a few demos and for
that test they tested it against the 99
20x which sells for $1200 right now but
I'm getting ahead of myself but one
random thing I wanted to mention really
quickly is that AMD accidentally pre
streamed some of this information they
were the stream was live and they were
doing a rehearsal so some of this
information actually leaked out pretty
early I think tweaked em picked it up as
well as a few other news sources but
going back to sort of the fundamental
of Rison three arisin third-generation
Rison 3000 series CPUs and what it is we
found out all this information at CES
but there based on the seven nanometer
manufacturing process is going to be put
together by TSM C so these are Xen two
cores which are based on the second
generation Xen architecture as opposed
to the sort of in-between Zen plus that
they did last year with the 12 nanometer
launch of the rise in 2000 series still
using socket a.m. for motherboards so
we're gonna have some backwards
compatibility but we are going to have
some new motherboards coming out as well
and then yes PCI Express Gen 4 support
now it comes to the CPU core they did
some comparisons and these are just AMD
numbers but looking at Zen plus 12
nanometer versus Zen 2 7 nanometer
they say they're getting 2 times the
floating-point performance they have
doubled the cache size and this is
specifically to reduce memory latency
which should be very helpful for gaming
and then they said that we're aiming for
about an 8% IPC improvement but they
actually hit 15% again according to
AMD's numbers but if that is true and if
that maintains being true then that's
pretty good news for AMD pretty good
news for anyone who's looking to buy one
of these CPUs and probably pretty bad
news for insel because that was one of
their biggest selling points for their
current generation of processors but I
don't want to get too ahead of myself
there either they did run some demos
that I wanted to share with you
Cinebench r20 was the demo that they ran
for the 3,700 X so the entry-level as
far as what they've shown us so far
versus a 9700 case or going an a core 16
thread CPU versus an 8 core 8 thread CPU
and I wasn't able to see the final
scores but according to Robert Halleck
who never lies it was about 30% faster
the 3700 X which you would hopefully
expect since we're dealing with a lot
more threads but the second demo they
ran was pub G gaming demo this was with
a 3,800 X versus a 9900 case so trying
to show of the best gaming performance
that Intel can provide what is AMD now
able to put up against it again this was
sort of an AMD centric test because it's
a test that they put together but with
pub G they were getting about the same
performance 145 to 150 fps so if they
can maintain equivalent performance when
it comes to graphics with these new CPUs
especially compared to in Intel's best
then that's pretty good news because
again that is an area where Intel has
formerly had
a lead but we'll see if they can hang on
to that the final demo was for the high
end ship and this was using blender
testing the $1200 99 20x which is on
their high-end desktop platform with the
x2 99 chipset that got 38 seconds in the
blender render versus the 3900 X's 32
seconds so about 18% faster and
according to them this was a core to
core test although we can't exactly
verify that both of these chips were
running at the same frequency across all
cores so we should take this with a
grain of salt until we can see some
independent third-party testing but it
does look promising
the final demo that they shared was a
sort of full demo with their entire
ecosystem since AMD makes processors as
well as graphics cards with their Radeon
division we did the 3800 X so the $400
eight core 16 thread CPU in a Navi demo
with the new Radeon rx 5700 from the rx
5000 series which was going to be what
Navi is manifested as and they were
testing that against the system with a
9900 K and a 20 atti which should be
pretty much the best possible gaming
system you can put together right now
the tests they ran though was a 3d mark
feature set test so this is really
focused on like how much potential there
is with the system setup so they're
really testing PCI Express gen for
bandwidth versus Gen 3 and so it was 69%
more bandwidth available with the new
system with PCI Express Gen 4 I don't
think they were specifically trying to
say that a Radeon rx 5700 and a 3800 X
will be tan 9900 K at 2080 TI and pure
gaming but if that's the impression you
walked away with then I'm sure AMD
marketing is like yes we're doing our
job well what they're talking about is
that you get more bandwidth with PCI
Express Gen 4 but I don't think that
will immediately equate to better
performance in gaming we'll have to wait
and see it should just be a slight
difference because most graphics cards
don't even use the bandwidth that's
available to PCI Express gen3 a few
other things that I noted though one was
that when they finally said yes we have
a rise in nine family we're going beyond
eight cores and 16 threads on the
mainstream platform Lisa brought outs
phase into chip or basically a substrate
with the chips on it and yes we are
confirmed that we have two Xen two chip
le'ts on it so the blank space that we
sort of pointed out
I can see us with like hey why they
design it like that it seems like maybe
they're thinking about putting two of
those on there yes that is confirmed
that is what they did so we were right
and we were very smart pat on the back
also a sue stopped by to say hi and just
to give a little bit of a further
preview of their X 570 boards they
showed an X 570 Pro and said that they
have 30 more designs that Asus is
working on for this platform of course
there's gonna be motherboards from
gigabyte and MSI and I'm sure a lot of
those are going to be shown it this week
at Computex there is some more
information that has been floating
around though specifically gamers Nexus
if you didn't already see it in the
recent Harbor news video has said that
they have confirmed with their sources
in the industry that yes there will be
16 core rise in 3000 series CPUs AMD
hasn't confirmed anything beyond that 12
core that they just announced but
hopefully we will see 16 core versions
as well and they said that when
overclocked they're pushing 300 watts
when it comes to power draw which is a
lot but that's overclocked numbers so
just some info I think from some of the
vendor partners who have been testing
with early samples of the chips also the
X 570 chipsets apparently has 11 watt
TDP which is a bit more and that's
because of the PCI Express Gen 4
integration and that is why a lot of the
new motherboards have actual fans on the
chipset heat sinks which I don't really
like usually but hopefully the fans are
using it better than the fans I used
back in the mid-2000s back when they had
to put chipset heat sinks on and they
would get loud and noisy and I hated
them but anyway we also have PCI Express
laying conformation there's still going
to be 16 on the CPU for direct PCI
Express Lane connection and then there
will still be the four dedicated for an
extra m2 slot I'm guessing that also
means they're gonna have four more going
over to the chipset for a multiplexing
across there for the peripheral
controller hub and everything and then
Steve also shared some dates which I was
able to then cross compare and confirm
or deny based on what AMD said at this
event
June 10th is the first upcoming date and
that's when they're supposed to have an
announcement at e3 Steve said it was a
rise in 3000 series desktop announcement
but I feel like that's what they just
did so maybe this is going to be navi
because at the event they actually said
June 10th we're gonna have some more
information on Navi and in fact they are
going to have a live stream on June 10th
at 3 p.m. Pacific time so I would say
follow AMD on Twitter if you
maybe you want to find out more info on
that event when they make it available
July first though is when risin 3000
series as well as X 570 motherboards
will be up for pre-order which you
shouldn't do you should always wait for
independent reviews but I suppose you
there's some people are gonna pre-order
anyway but then July 7th 7 7 4 7
nanometre which makes total sense and
has also been predicted for quite some
time is when performance reviews will go
up as well as when actual rise in 3rd
gen products will ship so if you
pre-ordered they probably ship right
away maybe they arrived to you on July
7th maybe you can just go into the store
and buy them on that day so that'll be
that'll be nice everyone should do that
when it comes to Navi though and the GPU
side of things and the Radeon side of
things I mentioned that I was a little
bit disappointed with the information
that they came out with apart from the
announcement of that livestream on June
10th they did confirm that yes na'vi is
based on seven nanometer we already knew
that they're calling this new
architecture our DNA or radeon DNA so it
is not GCN it is a new architecture that
they have built from the ground up with
a similar approach to their Xen CPU
design philosophy they said they focused
on efficiency and increasing IPC
performance on the GPU side they've also
streamlined the graphics engine and they
have some architectural improvements
versus Vega that they listed that we're
a bit vague because their internal AMD
numbers versus Vega but 1.25 X
performance per clock efficiency
improvements and then a 1.5 X
performance per watt improvement but I'm
not a hundred percent sure how they got
those numbers so again they're just sort
of some marketing information for now it
in confirmed that na'vi will use PCI
Express Gen 4 and then Navi products
will be part of the Radeon rx 5000
series family which is 5000 because of
AMD's 50th birthday and not because they
wanted to jump a few generations ahead
of the naming scheme that Nvidia is
currently using for their RT X 2000
series right that's not at all why they
would have done that but Lisa did
actually show an avi die she held it up
she actually mentioned specifically that
it looks small I noticed that there's no
HP m or high bandwidth memory on there
which was kind of expected as well
because that didn't work out very well
for them for Vega but my question since
I mentioned it's small is is there going
to be a bigger version of Navi maybe
that's possible and then they
show an avi gaming demo using strange
Brigade and showing that their Navi chip
which is an Rx 5000 series I'm guessing
it was an Rx 5700 like they used in that
last demo but they're getting one
hundred two hundred and ten frames per
second with the rx 5000 series GPU
versus an RT X 2070 which is getting 90
to 100 frames per second that is about
10% faster for the Navi GPU but I do
want to point out that strange Brigade
is known as being a very AMD friendly
title or a very Radeon friendly title
when it comes to game performance so
again take that with a grain of salt but
guys that is all the information I have
to share with you for right now I hope
you've enjoyed this video just trying to
boil down that hour and a half long
keynote to something that's a bit more
palatable for you guys if the thumbs up
button if you enjoyed it and stay tuned
because I will be doing some more
Computex videos this week not as many
videos as I do when I'm actually at
Computex but I'll just try to pick and
choose the things I think are most
interesting and share that information
with you thanks again for watching and
we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
