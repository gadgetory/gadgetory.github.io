let's let's do some IDF stuff
so guys I'm reporting from my hotel room
and I apologize if this doesn't look her
sound that great but I'm going to press
on because I got a chance to have some
hands-on time with project alloy that
Intel just announced yesterday it's an
all-in-one VR platform basically they're
making it for mixed reality or merged
reality which is combining a virtual 3d
world with the actual physical world
around you now this is a unique even if
you compare it to something like HTC
vive or an oculus rift because it is
completely untethered they've made it
self-contained it includes a head
mounted display a VR capable skylake
based PC that's wedged in there
somewhere and wireless connectivity as
well as a battery that's positioned on
the back for completely untethered VR
experience until leveraging their real
Sense technology which we've seen used
in drones before for example to provide
collision detection and they have six
goals with alloy one is six degrees of
mobility so forward backward left right
up down so of course you're not going to
want a tether if you want full movement
and even the ability to move from room
to room for example integrated tracking
of course so no light boxes or external
sensors are needed all you need is the
unit itself you want natural
manipulation so that's the ability to
see and use your own hands or other
parts of your body or other things that
might actually be physical in the
virtual environment or the mixed reality
environments they also want mobility but
not just mobility as far as not being
tethered but also what Intel calls slam
which is just a badass acronym that
means simultaneous location and mapping
which tracks your position where you are
as well as tracking the position of
things around you they also wanted to
have real-world content so they want to
be able to bring the real world into the
virtual world which is of course kind of
the definition of mixed reality or
merged reality so if your friend walks
up to you while you're wearing this and
you're in a VR environment your friend
should appear there and also be in the
environment with you so I was able to
get some hands-on time with the unit's I
wasn't able to turn it on and use it
unfortunately but I was able to check it
out at least physically it is fairly
large it's a little bulky especially
right up in front but bear in mind this
is a very early demo units and there's
probably lots of different iterations
and refinements to come I did find it to
be heavier than the oculus
but it is a little bit more balanced
since the battery is in the back there's
three sets of sensors up on the front
there's two infrared sensors two fisheye
cameras and then multiple realsense
sensors that can track distance and
depths of objects around you the demo
unit held all of its sensors in a little
aluminum frame which seems to be kind of
a key element to this design it keeps
all the sensors in a fixed location and
you can kind of see how you could use
this little sensor array as well as the
PC guts that are in there somewhere as
well as a battery pack in a third party
design unit that might look completely
different but have the basic same
function and that is definitely Intel's
plan they're planning to open-source to
a low a hardware as well as the
realsense API next year to let third
parties develop their own headsets
there's kind of a ridge across the front
of the unit and the cameras are
positioned on that and kind of pointed
out to provide a little bit wider field
of view and then on the right side there
are two buttons labeled c1 and c2 which
are probably meant to interact with the
operating system since if you haven't
noticed there are no actual controls
there's individual screens per eye I was
able to confirm that although I didn't
get any details on them and that
definitely appears to be specialized
glass lenses as well that you're looking
through when you're actually having the
unit on I was able to try it on with my
glasses in place and it did go on and it
fit okay but I pulled the lioness right
after that night when I was taking it
off and I broke the strap on top and I
felt bad but they said it wasn't a big
deal and they didn't kick me out so
that's cool now they did a live demo on
stage at IDF and have some pretty shaky
camera footage to share with you guys of
that but they were able to show how you
can for example put your hands out in
front of you and actually see them and
use them to interact with things you
don't even need controllers or gloves of
course you can pick up and use objects
from the real world and alloyed will
detect them so now on stage demo they
actually had a dollar bill and who is
using it to reach out in front of him
and shave the gold off of a virtual
lathe in front of him and then they made
a funny joke about that that's pretty
much all it's been revealed as far as
specs and everything goes but I do have
some questions that remain and I'll have
a I have a couple answers for those one
of course is release date second half of
2017 is what they're shooting for with
this early units for developers might go
out by the end of this year but again
it's still not entirely clear whether
Intel's planning to even bring this to
market themselves or whether they're
just planning on
feeding this to third-party developers
to make their own units of I had
questions about the graphics quality of
course what we saw on screen looked
actually pretty clean it didn't seem
like there was any tearing or study
stuttering or anything like that but
granted it was a pretty limited
environment that they were in so I can
imagine that higher end games might be
limited by the graphics quality of this
since they're using what has to be
fairly low-power skylake based hardware
in there with the book we can assume as
an AI GPU that's powering everything and
the granite you enough to sustain 90
frames per second for a virtual reality
world to not make you throw up or
anything like that so I'm kind of
skeptical as far as what we're going to
see out of this as far as actual GPU
performance but trade-off is of course
that's completely untethered battery
life of course is going to be a question
how long you're going to be able to put
it on and where it's how long is it
better going to take the recharge will
they be swappable can you buy a new one
or something like that I'll probably
leave that up to third-party
manufacturers and their own designs it's
a weight and the ease of movement was a
little bit of a concern for me I was
considering especially games that
require a lot of ducking or moving
around like hover Junkers for example it
is a little bit bulkier on your head
than the typical VR head mounted units
that we have right now so if you did
have a lot of movement around I could
see it getting a little wobbly perhaps
or even falling off after actual
interaction with this device they
brought Microsoft out on stage and they
announced a partnership for Microsoft
Windows holographic platform which is
actually an update that's coming to
Windows 10 sometime next year we're told
which will provide holographic
interfaces within Windows 10 giving you
that full-on Minority Report experience
I can imagine so there's a ton of
potential as well with that
collaboration for industry-wide be our
standards which I think will help
everyone as long as they're open again
and everyone can access them
standardization is usually really
helpful for something like this I guess
the last thing is that there is a lot of
potential for it to get much smaller
since again this is a very early unit
that we're working with and there's
still a lot of development to be done
but guys that is Intel's project alloy I
hope you have enjoyed this first time
hands-on look at it if you enjoyed this
video hit the thumbs up button and we'll
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
