hardware and this is my PAX Prime kind
of kick off video I'm doing a what's in
my bag rundown of everything that's
gonna be in my bag for PAX Prime but
there's a couple other reasons I made it
this I made this video actually the
first is going to be to say a huge thank
you to my sponsors for PAX Prime and
that is gigabyte as well as coolermaster
so a huge thank you to them for
supporting me and I mean to go on this
trip to bring some information and share
some experiences with you guys as well
so please say hello to you guys at PAX
Prime if you're going to be there so if
you are gonna be at PAX Prime follow me
on Twitter that's at Paul Hardware and
I'll be tweeting about where I am and
what I'm doing I would be hanging out
with Logan and Tek syndicate crew so
come say hello to us and hopefully I can
say hello and meet you there at PAX
Prime because that's why I like going to
events like this is meeting all of you
guys out there at least the ones are
gonna be there if you're not gonna be
there though
stay tuned to my channel because I'm
gonna do a couple videos kind of giving
you the the PAX Prime experience from my
point of view but that said I'm gonna do
a what's in my bag rundown of all the
stuff I'm BRE not all the stuff but at
least the tech related stuff or one key
reason in particular is that I just got
a new camera this is a Panasonic Lumix
gh4 I got this from Larry Dickerson aka
geeky and nerdy dad so check him out on
Twitter or his youtube channel if you
want to check out some of his stuff this
came used but only lightly so he sent it
to me and just pristine condition and
I've been really happy with it so far
I've got the 12 to 35 lens from
Panasonic on there which is doing a
pretty good job for me so far and yeah
this is item number one but let's go
over the rest of the stuff on the table
here so my goal at events like this is
always to try to travel light and stay
nimble so I'm using what has been my
laptop bag for quite some time this is
made by swiss gear and I've had this for
a couple years now and it does a great
job of storing all my stuff in it so
that's where everything is going to go
and hopefully it will all fit this is
not necessarily a camera bag so I'm
gonna wrap up some of the camera gear
and stuff in there to keep it from
bouncing around too much but there's
that I've also got my you tube water
bottle on the side cuz you know it's got
to stay hydrated here's a closer look at
my new camera this is again as a gh4 and
it's one I'm just super stoked about if
you're under again I'm filming with
right now it's my lx100
these are kind of like siblings lx100 is
the baby brother of the G
for really happy to happen both now and
it's actually been working out really
great for my video production because I
use this one for like kind of my master
shots my wide shots and then the lx100
is great for just picking up and zoom in
and really close cos got good macro and
all that stuff so if my video quality
improves it's hopefully because of this
camera to some degree and maybe even
I'll start kicking it with 4k footage at
some point but not quite yet not quite
yet for now I'm still doing 1080 maybe
1080 60 I tried to keep things grouped
up here so here's my little SD card
collection of course I still have the
Kingston 64 gig one right there this is
what I usually record on but I also like
to have backup so I got on another 64
gig micro right here this is just a
backup for the backup and also since
they have two cameras I'm gonna have one
of these in each camera also I'm
theoretically filming on a memory card
right now to hopefully also I got a
little 2 gig card here that's for the
zoom h1 and then finally to read
everything and transfer it to my kick my
my laptop much faster than USB 2 might
be I have this mobile light g4 from
Kingston which is just a tiny little SD
card reader that's USB 3.0 compatible
even as a little micro SD slot on it
which I find to be right quite useful
really happy to have that in my bag
because for transfering footage and
stuff and trying to get things done
quickly that's super helpful to have all
right audio solutions are over here and
if this video sounds kind of mediocre
it's because I'm using the in-camera mic
because my other mics are right here you
got the zoom h1 I've been using this for
a while I'm gonna be using this in a
different way than I have before cuz I'm
probably just gonna be using it for a
handheld stuff if it's like really
crowded on the show floor apply just
hold this so I can speak into it closely
or maybe if I'm talking to somebody
interviewing them or something like that
you got the windscreen on there cuz it
looks looks funny but yeah this one this
isn't a great job for me this is
actually my second zoom h1 I already
went through one of them and then it
started being a little fickle with me so
I got a new one but yeah does a great
job records I can even if I get an
eighth inch audio cable I can even go
out of this and directly into the gh4
but I probably won't be using for that
I'll probably using this this is the
rode videomic pro
little shotgun mic mounts on top of the
the flash shoe on the camera plugs right
in just runs on a 9-volt battery for the
size and especially considering that
this is several years old now
this does a really good job so for
directional stuff hopefully this is
going to sound pretty decent mounted on
top of the gh4 to record whatever the
heck I'm talking about I also have a
little stand here this is just if we do
something on a tabletop whatever I can
use this with the zoom h1 probably
really go long to a power powered for my
cameras so I have the lx100 has already
mentioned this this is my backup battery
for that that batteries in the camera
right now that I'm using I also got two
batteries for the gh4 and these are
great the gh4 one of the awesome things
about it these batteries last forever so
I should be able to get a full day out
of one of these but if not I got the
backup right here and then of course you
got to bring the charger alone keep them
charged at night and I did also get an
AC adapter this is just one of the cheap
generic ones I think it was like 15 or
20 bucks on Amazon but it works I used
it in our live show yesterday and if I
do need to plug in directly out of both
my batteries run dead or something it's
mainly a backup and I'm bringing it
along I have this little portable camera
bag that I put lx100 in if I'm going on
the go or maybe out in the evening and I
don't wanna bring a whole bag with me
I've got my business cards in there it's
got some nice slots in there for for
memory cards and whatnot and then we
mustn't forget the lens pin that's right
the lens pin it's here to clean your
lens it's got a little brush shooting on
once in one side get this little get on
the other side it does it does a really
great job here you watch see see how
much cleaner the lens is now
theoretically
okay and then did I say business cards I
think I did important to bring business
cards along with you to events like this
alright for like tripods are holding the
camera or whatever I have this little
monoprice multi-use tripod which is you
know one of the kind of rugged ones you
can grip around things or whatever so
I'm probably use this for handheld stuff
in the show floor and I've got the
monoprice tripod right here which is too
big this is too big so I'm gonna do this
note that it says monopod all you got to
do is unscrew this one leg
get yourself a model price oh no bear in
mind that without those other legs it
will tip over alright so this is a
monoprice monopod now I still need to
take the ball head off of the
though and put it on here because this
doesn't come with a ball head but I'm
just gonna use that one that I have and
now I will have their carbon fiber
monopod so really lightweight and you
know just for your walking around the
show floor with the DSLR or something it
can get heavy after a while that maybe
you just want to stabilize your footage
or something like that so I will be
bringing that model monopod and it will
collapse down to make it much smaller
okay so there's my couple of my
monoprice things I have one other
monoprice thing that I wanted to show
you guys if you haven't seen it before
and that's actually just a USB cable
this is just a charging cable USB micro
but it has this little button on it
right so when you plug it in you push
that button and it'll give you a green
light or an amber light the green light
means that you're not communicating data
so if you're plugging into a suspect USB
charger or something or somebody's like
hey charge your phone right here and
you're like you don't trust them you can
do that - just get power to your phone
or whatever device you're charging but
not data so for Security's sake
especially if you're somewhere where
like you don't know people it's a good
thing to have okay I have some rocket
things here these are like the most
useful things I've gotten at a show
convention these are just some earbuds
from rocket I forget the model of these
but they work good they're in here
they're not like super high-end or
anything but some block out noise and I
can use this for monitoring or whatever
have of course my rocket little fan
hoo-wee USB fan I've gotten a lot of use
out of that use that regularly I've got
this isn't for market this is for my
phone this is the fast charger for my
Nexus 6 totally remembering to bring
that that time this time because having
a fast tracker is really good and now
here's a generic section of just a few
things that I think are useful to bring
if you happen to be going to PAX Prime
breath mints bring some breath mints I
mean heck any convention having some
breath mints on you really useful I have
to mention deodorant guys granite packs
brain weird uterine it's not a huge like
epidemic but the few people who forgets
really make it a bad time for the rest
of us got a little more play use like a
screwdriver with multiple tips in there
you know in case I need to disassemble
laptop or something gotta have some
Advil
some kind of painkillers to get a
headache or whatever these are random
little things I forget what convention I
got these at but they light up this is
like attention grabbers look at me so
I don't know I'm gonna throw some of
these in my bag and I'll probably forget
they're there but if I remember like
maybe some go to a party and it's dark
or something you know you're ray these
around your body and then the draws
draws people to you and they start
dancing theoretically all right lastly
I've gotta have an extension power cable
depending on where I'm going I bring
bigger ones I'm gonna be staying with
Logan's so I think that should be fine
just to give me some extra plugs if
needed and then I'm moving over to my
laptop sections so this is what I'll be
using to edit of course this is my Asus
g550 JK laptop and then I've got a
Corsair GTX this is this is a flash
drive but just really like an external
SSD so I use this to have my raw footage
on while I'm editing connected via a USB
3 that's a really good job also it
allows me to copy the raw footage like
to the internal drive here as well as to
that and I have it backed up I can't
forget the power brick of course the
laptop which has fingerprints on it and
then also I have a mouse I have a
mousepad - I don't know where it went I
was supposed to have it out here this is
my Razer DeathAdder old standby this
since I've gotten so much you said of
this that's like my traveling Mouse and
that pretty much does it for like my
whole collection of what's in my bag
stuff here um you know what I should do
I should see if it actually all fits in
my bag there you go guys I managed to
fit everything in I am ready to go
pretty much Rebecca boy I should
probably pack some clothes and stuff too
but that's not really all that important
so I'll see you guys in Seattle really
excited for this trip be sure to hit me
up on Twitter if you're interested in
hanging out while I'm up there and if
you really have zero interest at all
impacts prime well maybe subscribe to my
channel anyway because I still have this
stuff coming up over here near that
build and build all ready to go the NZXT
noctus 450 as well as all these other
skylake parts and look I've even got a
rocket missed but I'm gonna be doing a
video on there soon but stay tuned for
some epic upcoming content from PAX
Prime and until then we'll see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
