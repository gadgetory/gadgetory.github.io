next Paul's hardware garage work log
these videos tend to be a little rough
around the edges so apologies in advance
for that they also generally aren't
quite as popular as my normal tech
videos so if you are here for a tech
video sorry this one's just me working
in the garage but I do have at least a
teaser for that system aisle guy right
there the defined Nano s build because I
do finally have all of the parts on
order and on their way so I will be
following up with some more work on that
very soon so if you've never seen one of
my garage work logs before this is all
the stuff that I've kind of built over
the past few months or yeah I guess year
2 this of course this wraparound desk
that goes all around here with stands at
various points to help provide support
put all these tables I'm sorry these
these shelves up up above on this side
built this really tall um cabinet over
here which which I'm really actually
like then I got some additional shelving
and a little workbench area and all that
kind of stuff over there that I built
for the presentation area over here I
got as far as you know painting this
nice boulder color grey on the walls
which which i think looks quite nice but
you might notice like you know the tops
painted up here but the bottom down here
is still the old gray color which is not
as nice of a gray I also still need to
finish painting along here you need to
figure out the proper positioning for
the dog beds because the dogs just come
out here and pass out and you know they
kind of get in the way here oh he's kind
of snoring anyway this is what is as far
as I got before which is plaster of
Paris along this kind of unfinished edge
along the bottom this was your
irritating me because anytime I had a
downward angled shot it would kind of
get in there and it doesn't look nice at
all of course it doesn't look that great
right now for anyone who's wondering I'm
not really too concerned about the floor
at this point this slab was poured in
the 60s and I know it's been sealed in
the past it doesn't look that great
right now but I'm either going to get a
just an area rug to throw down here
maybe I can just use here oh that could
also be an option or I might go the like
epoxy root or something
but that's that's a large project that
probably wouldn't happen until mid to
late summer anyway I got to finish doing
the plaster of Paris along this side and
I also know that this isn't necessarily
like the ideal solution for this there
are definitely other options than
plaster of Paris this is interior stuff
but I think it's going to work for me
and you can see where I was pained where
last time when I wasn't like feeling
like I was running out of time actually
got a decent finish on there anyway I'll
probably just speed through all this
stuff since it's just spackling ish
stuff and some painting along here and
then I'll get to what is hopefully a
little bit more interesting which is the
installation of these LEDs decided to
just pick up a kit from eBay since
they're available they're in a very wide
variety of colors and lengths these are
actually five meter RGB LED cables and
it's it's a double one so the power unit
here has two connectors and that means
that I can control both this one here
and then there's another one still in
the package with this little remote and
this is a very standard remote that
comes with a lot of the RGB LEDs but I'm
I'm pretty flexible as far as what's is
able to do and with five meters I should
have enough to go from the very edge of
this all the way along the back here and
all the way along the back there I can
also cut these strips just about every
four or five inches which is also very
convenient since I there again a little
bit too long so I probably will need to
cut one of the ends and I'll just be
using some adhesive to put them back
there and that will allow me to I can
delicately step over the dog stop using
this solution which is a power supply
that I turn on connect it to my original
NZXT hue which is what's providing this
lovely kind of turquoise glow back there
which again has been working for now but
I kind of like the option that I have
here with this one just in that I will
be able to turn it on and turn it off
control it and everything without
necessarily needing a computer that is
connected to or a separate power supply
and then of course I can control the
color on all on both really long strips
at the same time so make sure that they
will always match it so that's the plan
guys and since the
this is Tuesday morning I actually have
a limited amount of time before I need
to leave and go over to cattles for
awesome hardware so I'm going to crank
some tunes get to work and let's see how
far I can get
so that was probably just a few quick
minutes of time lapsing for you guys and
sorry if I was hunched over most of the
time in a compromised position but you
know I had to get down underneath the
desk in order to get all this done but
happily it is all completed now so
here's the final tour the final results
right now I have it cycling through all
the different colors but you'll notice
that of course I have the RGB LED strips
which five meters is actually perfect
length to go all the way along this back
shelf and all the way along this shelf
all the way over here to kind of what is
the edge of my presentable set if you
ignore all of the nastiness over there
of course I got it on the lower shelf as
well and now you might maybe get a
better idea of why I really wanted to
finish the painting on the underside
before I did all this and that's just
because these RGB lights shine more
light down on that lower side and I felt
like it was going to be pretty evidence
if it was not painted or at least
looking a little bit better than it used
to now I will show you guys really
quickly how I have this connected up
over here again back it down on the
other side so under here's where all my
cable management is and right now I'm
just using a couple Sigma's underneath
here to kind of keep all the cables tidy
it's not as clean if you're looking
directly at it as some of the other
options I've seen out there especially
since Eid has sort of set the standard
for this but since I do switch things
around quite often I found it it's more
convenient to have those so I can just
pile the cables up in there anyway I
have the power unit for this whole thing
kind of tucked into this little Sigma
unit over here and then it's running
along back to behind my main streaming
system over there that is so I can use
the included remote control right here
and then the sensor is underneath the
desk but I'm I'm still able to point at
it so you know you can switch to red or
green or blue and using the remote here
by the way or you can do silly things
like jump I don't know I feel like I'm
probably mostly going to use a solid
color or the fade I don't mind the fade
the remote wall so you let you speed it
up or slow down or set some custom
and custom colors here just using these
so you can indicate you know how much
red green or blue you want in there you
know it takes a little bit of dialing in
to get exactly what you want but um you
know it's got most of the features that
you'd want right off the bat be cool if
there's a crawling thing that's that
would be one nice thing for the NZXT hue
plus what this would be a few more
features when it comes to what you can
do with the lights
one other thing to point out as far as
how I have it connected up here is that
I did need to get a four pin LED cable
extension so I ordered that because
ahead of time since I knew I would need
it so the two headers that come out of
that unit over there I had to do an
extension to get up here to this upper
shelf in order to get that installed as
well but I'm super happy with how
everything has turned out I even did
some straightening of my sound dampening
panels over here so those are all
vertical granted I did not go around the
entire edge yet but you know we'll save
that for a future garage work log maybe
probably not but we'll see how that goes
last thing I wanted to mention I guess
is this area down here at the bottom and
this did take quite a while putting all
the other plaster-of-paris along this
thing so I could paint it again that's
not like perfect it's there's still some
definite rough spots but it did allow me
to paint that and make it a little bit
more uniform granted the floor itself
still looks pretty horrible but you know
if I decide to epoxy that or something
in the future it's going to be a massive
job so I'll put that on standby for now
and I think I think I might get a carpet
just a something to put out here kind of
tie the room together of course that
would be nice to have anyway though guys
that's all for this video thank you so
much for watching really hope you've
enjoyed it don't forget to hit the
thumbs up button on your way out and
leave me a like leave me a comment let
me know what color you think I should
set these two back here behind me since
I have the whole RGB spectrum at my
command I can dial on something that
will match that feel pretty make
everything look nice anyway thanks again
for watching guys and we'll see you next
time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
