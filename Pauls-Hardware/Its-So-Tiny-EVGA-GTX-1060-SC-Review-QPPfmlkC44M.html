my quick review of the EVGA gtx 1060
superclocked
the 6 gig version mind you not the lowly
3 gig version that shouldn t be called a
1060 but coming in at 260 dollars just
ten dollars more than in videos $250
MSRP this card has some standout
features that make it a great choice in
the mid $200 range if your patience just
click link for it down in the video
description and throw money at the
screen or continue watching as I explain
myself either way if you go down to the
description the like button is down
there too just sayin so let's start with
aesthetics and I'd like to say that this
card looks pretty nice I will say that
this card looks pretty nice it is a dual
slot open cooler with a single fan it's
black with some silver accents and
lettering no LEDs to be seen on the card
which is fine by me and also no
backplate so the 7-inch reference design
PCB is exposed but since it's black it's
not hideous or anything like that since
the 1060 uses the reference PCB but not
the original reference blower cooler the
whole card is just shy of 7 inches long
about 175 millimeters and the 6 pin PCI
Express power connector is down here at
the end of the PCB the only real
difference between this and the
reference PCB design which uses the
reference uses an extension put that out
at the end of the blower cooler anyway
though beyond that we've got identical
specs to all gtx 1066 g8 cards with a
Pascal GP 106 GPU doing the heavy
lifting built on 16 nanometer Pascal
architecture with 4.4 billion
transistors the GP 106 is paired with 6
gigabytes 192 bit gddr5 memory at 8000
megahertz effective clock speed and
rounding out the specs you have 10
streaming multi processors 1280 CUDA
cores 80 texture units 192 gigabytes per
second of memory bandwidth 48 wraps and
a 120 watt TDP sadly there is no SLI
bridge on this card so no traditional
SLI support but that was in videos call
whether you like it or not so deal with
it and video outs finally our three
display ports 1 points fours 1 HDMI 2.0
B and one DVI just like the 1080 and
1070 that came before it for
overclocking I of course used EVGA
precision X utility and ended up tacking
on a 95 mega Hertz GPU clock offsets and
a 250 megahertz bump to the memory clock
and with the power and temp sliders next
at stock the cards base clock is 6
seven and the boost is 1835 but with
that overclock just mentioned it jumped
up to seventy no to base nineteen thirty
boost and twenty one hundred max that
max o'clock can be deceptive those after
temps evened out the stable loose
o'clock was about two thousand thirty
seven to two thousand fifty megahertz on
average which is pretty standard for a
GTX 1060 temperatures were very
reasonable considering how small the
cooler is hitting seventy nine C under
full load so just a little bit cooler
than the reference design that is while
overclocked though and with the fan
speed also will overclocked ranging from
forty to fifty one percent here's some
fan noise testing so you can hear for
yourself we're going to start with idle
here's 45 percent fan speed about the
average I was at while gaming
here's 70 percent fan speed
and here's 100% proving that no one
wants to run their fan 100% all the time
because it's loud
moving on to benchmarks I tested this
card at 1920 by 1080 which is the proper
resolution for this GPU and here are my
results
okay it is conclusion time and I think
the biggest question you'll want to ask
yourself is should you get a gtx 1066
gig or @rx
488 gig and that is a tough choice the
1066 gig is clearly faster right now
when tested across a range of games old
and new but the Ark's 480 has shown some
promising gains and titles to implement
certain DirectX 12 features the
leveraged asynchronous compute
availability is also a concern with my
quick and purely anecdotal look at
current stock levels on new egg this
morning revealing that seven of nine rx
480 models are in stock while just 6 of
13 gtx 1066 gig variants are in stock
with the superclocked model being one of
the unavailable ones all that said if
you want the right now performance of
the gtx 1060 i think this is a very good
choice its small and quiet enough for
HTPC use or small form-factor builds
overclocking was right up there in the
same range with larger moreover built
cards although sustained clocks will
probably be just a little bit lower than
ones with a larger cooling solution and
at $260 again it's just $10 more than
the MSRP whereas other variants of the
1066 gig want 300 bones or more which is
a significant markup at this price I
would love to hear what you guys think
of this card though so leave me your
comments down in the comments section
below links to this card on Amazon and
my Paul's hardware store where you can
buy shirts mugs and pen classes are also

for watching and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
