made it to the Li hua Airport new who
leave we leave away wherever trying to I
don't know how to pronounce this
Wrangler how's it she beautiful because
we're in Hawaii Hawaii to be specific
the oldest islands we just arrived
it's lovely lovely lovely Lea hue
airport and we picked up a rental car
which is a cheap and now I'm driving
over to over by Waimea and I'm going to
put the camera down now because I'm
driving and I shouldn't be driving at
vlogging at the same time
first feel in a way to do the chicken
yes loser chicken it's a new type of
chickens
and then I got I got this which is
noodles chicken got some Kahlua pork and
of course macaroni and rice all right we
had lunch and now we are checked in to
where we're staying this is called
Waimea plantation cottages these are
actually cottages that were formerly I
believe written in sugar plantations and
they relocated them all over here and
now you can rent them out and stay in
them so we got a little kitchenette over
here so we can make some food if we want
to try to save a little bit of money but
we're probably gonna eat out a lot
anyway table a little sitting area with
TV and then the beds right over there
bathrooms over there and through here we
have the beach beaches right out there
shirt walk so if you haven't figured out
already we're on vacation in Hawaii this
is a vacation vlog so we're gonna be
mostly just sitting around and not doing
much this week I was about to be like
what do we have plans but we're on
vacation we're planning as little as
possible we're hopefully gonna go on a
helicopter tour at some point so for you
guys at home here's the game we're gonna
play for the rest of this video trying
to figure out why we decided to come on
vacation here right at this particular
point in time is it because I had a
bunch of frequent flyer miles and I got
our flights for free or something else
you guys will have to figure that out
that's that's our cottage and there's
the beach
nice big green space out in front of
this area plantation kind of just I'll
say trees to one of those she a banyan
tree see the way banyan trees work is
they have roots that grow out from the
limbs and then they grow down to the
ground and if they were to let this grow
all the way down to the ground it would
attach there and make its own roots and
then become another like a big hunk like
thing and that's how the trees gradually
expand until they take over the entire
world
good morning it's time for breakfast
dude I got these big pancakes and then
as keeping a traditional we got spam
rice
lovely we're a big seed now we're gonna
try to take advantage of the fact that
we have a kitchen and snuck up on some
food for the week we're still gonna get
some nice food at restaurants too but
I've never been shopping in Hawaii
grocery shopping so but what's strange
foreign varieties of produce do they
have here oh my God look at this
Lunchables it's crazy crazy what they
eat here in Hawaii this Sweden fridge is
now stocked
we have breakfasts we got this miss taro
bread which I'm really excited about and
over here I have set up a little bit of
an office space cuz I actually had a
video or two to get edited there's me
yes I just got that view going right
there and Danna is gonna go for a walk
can I entrust you with this - perhaps
capture you know exciting footage of the
things you see on your walkins the new
hero 7
it is dinnertime got some tri-tip girls
right over here oh no what will I do
while the grill warms up
this is a perfect place to cook steak or
fish that really well-done one there's
for my wife your dinner we have a taro
bread steak and broccoli all you really
need
we removed the top from the Wrangler
because today we're driving all the way
around Hawaii to go to Hanalei Hanalei
Bay which is where there's a dragon
we're told so road trip
somehow the way Bay's actually out
around that corner I tried to go to a
couple of the beaches down there there's
like highways and there's another one we
tried to get to Queens bath Queens Bass
was closed down in hideaways and no
parking it's actually very very hard to
park over there although all the beaches
on kawaii public if it's a rich area
like over in Pittston they tried to
block you off by saying no you can't
park here
now we're down at a teeny which I'm
perfectly happy with look we got some
shade from the trees over here
music and everything this is the Hanalei
Bay Resort and we actually came here
it's a good to that restaurant right
there which is called Bali Hai which is
good and has a glorious view of the
whole Bay and everything on here there
unfortunately closed for renovations
since it's the offseason but we got here
just in time for happy hour at happy
talk we're gonna get some drinks and
then we'll go see if we can plan the
dragon happier I got wait what is this
this is a Kohler brewing talk story Pale
Ale
vana got a lava flow which is really
really under flow and they it's virgin
the subversion
as mango it's a place is fancy
so that is Hanalei Bay we stopped at the
town which is over in this area yeah we
had we had lunch there it was good I
didn't film that because I feel like
I've got a lot of food to keverage on
this trip look I promised you guys a
dragon puff the magic dragon lived by
the sea frolicked in the autumn mist in
a land called Hana Lee or Hanalei if
you're here and that's the dragon's head
right there he's lying down you're
climbed and now everyone goes singing
Puff the Magic Dragon and break out into
tears because it's such a sad song about
loss of youth only vague references to
drug usage that's not true though it's
not true at all here paula mary said it
wasn't jack I'm losing my core audience
with the Peter Paul Mary references look
at how beautiful this place is look at
the Sarge's we're happy we came up to
this side of the island today because
it's supposed to rain here for the next
few days we're gonna head back around
the North Shore right now we're heading
back to the South Shore West Shore sorry
by way of the Eastern Shore so yesterday
we got a call from Petsmart
they are currently boarding our two
puppies hero and nori hero is a rescue
and he's very well behaved when he's
with us but he can be a challenging dog
and he gets separation anxiety pretty
bad they're having some issues with him
so they asked if anybody could come pick
him up we're limited on resources for
that fortunately my parents are able to
go and pick him up but they can only
keep him for a day so we're having to
cut our Hawaii trip short by about four
days and that means that we're trying to
squeeze in our two main activities that
we're really looking forward to into
today one is a trip up to Waimea Canyon
which starts from actually very close to
where we're staying in Waimea we drive
up a very long and winding road up sort
of a ridge and then off to the side you
can see Waimea Canyon it is sometimes
called the Grand Canyon of the Pacific
it is absolutely amazing gorgeous and
there's a bunch of hiking trails and
stuff out here but you can also drive
all the way up to the top so that's what
we did from there you can get another
really cool view over down to the Napali
coast which is the amazing rugged
terrain on the edge of kawaii which is
where they shot Jurassic Park as well as
a bunch of other movies unfortunately it
is a little cloudy and a little cold and
we were rushed trying to kind of get
everything scheduled this morning with
the helicopter which is the second thing
we're gonna do and this we forgot to
bring any like long-sleeve sweaters or
anything like that we're not expecting
to get a lot of cold weather here in
Hawaii but it is January so we we've
been dealing with it okay so I managed
to get all the way up to the top of the
road and there's a few lookout spots
where we stopped at looking down over
Nepali or at least the southern edge
it's an Impala Coast over here where
we're currently stopped right now is
another look at area where you can
actually look down into Waimea Canyon
where there are waterfalls and just
really steep rocky cliffs that you
wouldn't necessarily expect to see in a
place like Hawaii it's very breathtaking
though we got some really nice pictures
in some video but since we forgot warm
clothes and we're kind of limited on
time here anyway we are going to cheat
later in today and take a helicopter
ride so we're gonna see a lot of the
stuff that we're seeing right now from
the ground from the air and everywhere
you read about kawaii says take a
helicopter ride if you can afford it of
course they're a little bit expensive
but we are going to be going with Blue
Hawaiian highly recommended and I'm
hoping that's pretty exciting for now
though we have a couple more views to
check out
time for lunch
kalua pork hut with pineapple and other
delicious toppings I got the number one
and Diana got the number two ain't bad
now you're part of the establishing shot
there it is
this is the tropical what are they poor
in town any ketchup what kind of cream
it was but just some kind of cream
macadamia ice cream underneath
that's delicious I have to compare this
to the shave ice they have in Taiwan
which is also really good I would say
the flavors here are quite good the the
shave ice itself in Taiwan we shaved a
little bit finer though I think Taiwan
wins mister really good
just had our safety briefing and now I
get to put on our personal floatation
devices just like a fanny pack
well we just got a room all packed up we
are heading out today our 7 8 day Hawaii
trip has turned into a four-day trip
that's on the plus side we have had a
wonderful time and our brief stay here
and we did a lot of cool stuff and why
may have plantation cottages is
refunding us today's we're not going to
be here so that was really cool that
we're saying one last goodbye to our
view out here
goodbye view was very nice we loved
waking up to you in the morning where
your head no house sad kawaii is that
we're leaving the skies are crying they
weep for departure
my parents house to pick up here I don't
believe it's you
they don't believe it's you hi there who
is back home
is this all troublemaker
Noreen's you too so we're now back home
and the dogs are very happy to be here
and we have learned an important lesson
actually back to the point of this whole
video if you guys didn't notice
throughout the video at various times my
wife has a baby bump that's right she's
pregnant we're gonna have a kid in just
a few months so I wanted to let you guys
know about that don't worry my channel
gonna be covering tech and stuff I'm not
switching over to baby coverage but this
guy and his neediness and us having to
come home to take care of him it's
probably a good life lesson because
we're having a kid and our lives will no
longer be our own and no matter what
plans we make to go have a nice trip or
something like that well you might have
things that come up that we have to take
care of because we got to be responsible
parents and everything but guys that is
gonna wrap it up for this video vlog of
our little trip to Hawaii thank you so
much for watching I hope you've enjoyed
it
and I'll be back to regular text content
very soon thanks again for watching hit
the thumbs up button and we'll see you
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
