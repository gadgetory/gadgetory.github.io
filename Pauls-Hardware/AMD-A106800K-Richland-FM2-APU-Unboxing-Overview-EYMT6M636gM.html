hardware it is Computex season which
means there's lots of product launches
come out and whether you're talking your
your haswell's your shields your gtx 780
med or i guess that's what we call AMD
these days but what I actually have is
what AMD has been working on them what
they're releasing well right about now
or at least whenever this video is going
to come out that is their new Richland
series of apu so this is going to be my
first ever apu unboxing and i have the
flagship of the line this is the AMD a10
6800 k so here we go with the apu
unboxing again the 810 6800 k i'm going
to be sort of rambling off some details
about this product as i turn the box
over in my hands and I'm sure eventually
I'll actually take it out of the box as
well but essentially what you have here
from AMD is a quad core $150 MSE MSRP
part and that gives you both CPU and the
GPU on the same little processor and you
can put together a very nice little
system with this I've seen quite a few
implementations whether you're talking
about an HT PC will be talk you about a
gaming system because this can actually
handle games at decently high graphics
levels especially if you're going to be
playing at 1080p or below and the code
name for this is Richland of course as
you might notice in the title you also
might notice it says 680 K on the top of
the Box I'm I'm not really sure why
everyone tells me it's 6800 K but for
some reason the box is 680 K and I don't
have an explanation for that but anyway
it's quad core part code names Richland
this is a refined version of the CPU
architecture that they used in Trinity
and that architecture more specifically
was second-generation bulldozer which is
also known as piledriver and I know Andy
parts tend have a lot of different code
names so to confuse of you a bit more
the AI GPU that's in here is based on
the Cayman GPU architecture which I
believe originally came out in 2010 now
apart from that Richlands refinement
if you're talking about the the
changeover from Trinity to Richland is
going to provide some higher clock
speeds it's also going to provide some
lower power consumption you also notice
you have dual graphics support down
there at the bottom you can pair this up
with an AMD Radeon HD 6000 series
graphics card which I don't really see
being done too often so I don't know
it's it's it's I feel like your your
better bet is going to be to buy a newer
graphics card a 7000 series or maybe an
8000 series one so those are fully
available and that's probably a better
solution for you anyway here's your
certificate of authenticity that you get
in the box along with the processor
actually I never really look at these
when I get them out of the box let's uh
take a look inside and see Wow okay this
has gone back a long ways all the way
back to socket 754 socket 940 just
giving you example to pin layouts of
those which is kind of interesting this
is of course socket FM 2 which is not
backwards compatible with FM 1 just to
throw that out there also included in
the box you do get a heat sink fan this
is a really basic one that's just an
aluminum heatsink you do get the clips
on the side AMD is maintained the same
CPU manic solution for a really long
time which is nice because it's very
Universal I also get some thermal paste
pre-applied there at the bottom aluminum
fins a fairly small fan it looks I think
that's like maybe a 92 millimeter fan
and then you also get a very brightly
colored cable and it's 4 pin connector
so you do have a PWM which is going to
help the fan to always spin up and
maintain reasonable speeds in relation
to the AP use actual temperature but
back to is talking a little bit more
about Richland comparing the 1600 K
Richland with the 5800 K Trinity
the Richland 6800 K is going to have a
four point one gigahertz based CPU clock
4.4 gigahertz max turbo CPU clock also
you get a sticker right there should I
should point that out sticker case bej
put it on your on your case and I'm
distract being distracted again here but
a you might also notice the the plastic
thing that the CPUs in those actually
really really sturdy they design them
very carefully so I feel like somebody
told me at one point that you could run
these over with like a car and the CPU
would be okay I don't recommend trying
that but it is there anyway back to the
clock speeds base clock of 4.1 gigahertz
turbo clock 4.4 GPU clock is 844
megahertz and compared to the 5800 K
that gives you a 3.8 gigahertz base CPU
clock 4.2 gigahertz turbo clock and 800
megahertz GPU so you can see they giving
you about a 6 to 8% clock increase also
one of the nice things is they've given
you official ddr3 2133 support and
actually pairing up an APU with some
really fast memory is a great way to go
so I check out higher speed memory also
100 watt TDP and the K means it's a
black Edition so it's unlocked for
overclocking performance wise this is
going to be compared probably to mostly
to lower end i3 and i-5 Ivy Bridge and
Haswell CPUs and just based on a few
benchmarks I've seen already essentially
if you're looking at a serial benchmark
or more more CPU intensive benchmark
intel's is going to win when you're put
in cpus head-to-head in the same price
category if you're looking at parallel
or GPU intensive benchmarks original is
going to win just about every time
because it does have a much stronger a
GPU and intel for some reason chose not
to include its Intel iris gt3 i GPU and
most of their Haswell desktop parts some
unless that part has an R on the end so
that just basically means that AMD is
going to retain the lead when you're
comparing comparable AP use to Intel's
CPUs when it comes to the AI GPU but
that's going to wrap it up for this
quick unboxing video guys once again
we've been taking a closer look at the
AMD a10 6800 K from their new richland
series of AP use for the FM 2 socket I'm
definitely looking forward to when we
actually returned from Computex I'll be
actually be able to have some time to
play around with this particular APU I
almost called a CPU and see what the
performance is like so stay tuned for
that will probably be covering it on
Newegg TV possibly here as well I'm
really not sure what's going to go on
all I can see right now is Computex if
you'd like to see more videos though be
sure to subscribe to my youtube channel
don't forget to like the video and
we'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
