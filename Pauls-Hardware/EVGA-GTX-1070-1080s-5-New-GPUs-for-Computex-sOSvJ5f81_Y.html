sponsored by fractal design msi and
g.skill EVGA EVGA has not one not two
not three not four but five new path
scale based GPUs here I'm just going to
start talking about them how's that
sound I'm going to start off actually
with this one because this is the very
first GTX 1070 that i have actually laid
hands on and believe it or not it's a
custom design one that's right it does
use the reference PCB for the gtx 1070
but this is the AC x3 point 0 cooler by
EVGA they've done some different design
work from it it's definitely very
distinct from the AC X 2 point 0 that
we've seen in the past but they're a
mean for about ten percent reduction in
thermals as well as about thirty percent
reduction and sound and of course he
still have the feature where the fans
don't spin up if they don't need to and
it's also got some LEDs so you got white
LEDs for the logo on the front you also
have some white LEDs kind of embedded
across the the front of the card here so
if you're looking at it this way or if
you have one of those cases where you
can reposition the card you'll have a
nice view of that other than that except
pretty standard features for a 1070 it
is a super clock edition so it's going
to come overclocked from the factory
from EVGA and it has just the standard
eight pin power connector like the GTX
1070 has so we also have a super clock
version of the GTX 1080 hey that's right
there this one also eight pin power also
has the same cooler also has the LED
effects these are white LEDs but they do
have RGB LEDs in their higher end
versions again pretty much the same
cooler the same look in the same
everything but it's a 1080 and it's
going to be overclocked so that's pretty
cool now evj has been getting some more
recommed reckon recommendations
recognition that's the word I'm looking
for for their hybrid cards so this is a
1080 hybrid so it's got the enclosed
cooler here at the front there the
shroud i should say with a single fendt
keep your VRMs in power delivery cool
this does have a custom PCB they've
added an additional power connector so
you got two 8-pin peg connectors it is
of course all in one loop connected to a
hundred and twenty millimeter radiator
and fan down there which I'm letting
hang down precariously and EVGA is going
to also be making an additional version
of this card which we have a few sort of
a
samples of in the special case that they
made over there that will have quick
disconnects as well so that kind of
means like it's two cards but I'm only
an account as one because we don't have
the other version they do have a
founders edition here but we don't care
about that next up we have the for the
win which I'm not holding right now but
I do have some b-roll of it for you the
for the win upgrades you to a custom PCB
duel 8 pin power connectors of course
and it features RGB LED lighting across
the shroud other than that it does have
the custom PCB so the shroud is a little
bit different it's a little bit larger
it's going to keep things a little bit
cooler and of course the for the wind
versions are typically overclocked a
little bit more now if you've dealt with
EVGA cards in the past after for the
wind comes classified classify is
typically the highest end apart from the
kingpin card we don't have any kingpin
1080s here I don't know if they're
working on one they wouldn't tell me but
the classified does look pretty nice
adding some red accents which makes
things faster red is bread is usually
faster sometimes anyway it's also
featuring the AC x3 point 0 cooler are
very entered thereof and it's gots this
actually funny old connector going on
right here this is what in what is known
as the power adapter basically it's like
a 6-pin or 8 pin peg power extension so
it wraps your power around the side of
the card and puts it there on the back
of it remember we're back when they used
to actually put power connectors on that
like that on graphics cards and we like
well it adds extra link to the card well
you know if you have enough space for it
then you might want to wrap your cables
around and route them a little bit
differently and give yourself just sort
of a cleaner look overall and it adds
you the bonus of giving you an a white
LED backlit EVGA logo to shine forth
proudly as well as the avg a LED logos
that are scattered throughout the rest
of scarred and this one also of course
features RGB LED support next up we got
some high bandwidth SLI bridges these
are the ones that you might have seen at
the nvidia event that we already covered
2-way SLI is what these are supporting
if you guys watch that you know that
Nvidia is only really pushing towards
two-way support now so they not have
they don't currently have plans to make
three way or four way versions of this
they said their old three-way and 4-way
adapters will still work but anyway well
we'll get into that later this does have
a light up
logo here for the EVGA and it also
features a switch down on the bottom so
you switch that switch and you can do
right red green blue or white for
different color options which you know
if you have that prominently displayed
in your case should give you a much
better option for making things look
pretty and match EVGA also showed off a
case they kind of have a hard-on for
cases if you get that joke then you've
know what other cases EVGA has designed
before this is the DG 87 they're
actually coming out with a few different
variants of this one this is the highest
end features a very unique design it's
kind of an asymmetrical look it gives
you a really good look in the side panel
window right now they have it outfitted
with 4-way GTX 1080s and those with I'm
sorry those are for way GTX 980 tis but
they do have the quick disconnects which
we're told they will also be bringing to
the EVGA hybrid cooler as well so that's
pretty exciting it is fully kitted out
of course but there's going to be
different variants of this without a
window without the little LED panel at
the bottom so you'll have options but
between about a hundred and seventy
dollars and two hundred thirty dollars
or the price points of the VG 8786 85
and 84 and I think a lot of people are
going to be interested in this case
because as a very distinct look very
clean it has the feature where the
motherboard is kind of in set from the
back of the case so it gives you the
option to write your cables not out the
back via your motherboard i oh you can
tuck them all down through a little
grommet out the side and again nice
clean cable management management for
your case whether it's up on your desk
or god forbid down on the floor two more
quick items one is the x 99 for the win
k this is a new version of the x 99
motherboard from EVGA it's eatx it's a
little bit bigger it's a little bit
fancier I don't know all the bits and
pieces and details here but I just
wanted to show this to you guys because
broad will eat just launched this is
course is going to be fully compatible
and for anyone who's looking for a new
x99 board for a broad well each ship I
think this might be a very viable option
perhaps perhaps I might consider
reviewing it in the future maybe what if
i don't thing is a they have some new
power supplies on display i found one
that was pretty compelling which is a
thousand-watt gold power supply which is
only 150 millimeters long so 150
millimeters fully modular silverstone is
the only power supply maker who i've
seen who has a really compelling variety
of options in this category and since
EVGA has really been killing it in the
power supply market it's nice to see
this
option presented as well that's all for
the EVGA booth though I want to say one
last quick thank you to my sponsors that
is fractal design msi and g.skill i'll
be right back with more coverage from
computex 2016</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
