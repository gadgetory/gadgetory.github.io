let's get into our first segment let's
do it it is called oh joy oh joy is a
segment where we talk about terrible
things
awful things usually there's no solution
or everything or anything like that for
this week's segment of oh joy I am
focusing on Vega Oh
AMD Vega it gonna be good it is it's
been out for a little bit now it
launched on the 14th and there's been
there was like there was a lot of wait
and see when it first launched and
they're the
and and now there's a bunch of questions
about Vegas actual price and there's a
lot of questions that reviewers have had
as far as the the stock that's available
now and what it's selling for not just
at like your your your you know cut rate
you're not cut rate but your your
third-party marketplace sellers and
Amazon like resellers and everything
like that but actually being sold by
like the likes of Newegg and stuff for
these grossly inflated prices at least
if you're comparing it to the price that
AMD originally told stuff told us stuff
would cost right at lunch so um I have a
few things to talk about related to this
I'm gonna try not to pull any punches
here and be pretty straightforward about
what we know that's going on and what
you guys should be aware of and all that
kind of stuff but let's start out with
one of the things that people really
worried about right from the get-go with
Vega which is that what if all the cards
get sold out to minors and AMD addressed
this directly to reviewers they talked
to us about it and they said the
solution to this was the Radeon packs
that they sell in bundles so you have to
buy a bundle and miners won't buy that
now we're gonna get to the packs where
come we're gonna come back to that but
let's start off by with this I'll bite
my tongue for now this little thing that
slips through this was just after last
week's live stream actually yeah that
AMD has actually launched a beta driver
specifically tuned for cryptocurrency
mining Wow directly after a new product
launches something like Vega when
there's lots of driver work going on you
know there's a ton of work that goes up
to the lot that goes on up to the launch
and then afterwards aim deep I mean they
touted it in some of the slides is like
the AMD fine wine things like we worked
on the drivers and you know there's a
lot of a lot of times in the past
there's a lot of historical precedent
for Andy cards getting better
performance over time with the help of
driver updates which if the focus was
completely on gaming with the graphics
cards do you think the driver updates
will be coming out say within one or two
weeks after the card actually launches
might not be focused on mining
improvements but focused on gaming
improvement but there it is
and the apparently catering to minors to
some degree now I did a Q&amp;amp;A video this
past week where I discussed
cryptocurrency mining and I tried to lay
out there some of my feelings on the
matter and I don't necessarily hate
miners directly for doing what they're
doing they're gonna try to make money
however however they can that's people
are gonna do that that's economics but
when you see the company like AMD who is
previously told you we want gamers to
have our card and we make cards for
gamers doing stuff that seems more
geared towards the minors then it comes
back to like well why did they tell us
their contradictions
why did they give us the statement they
gave if they gave us in the first place
if that's actually what's going on their
actions speak louder than their words
yes so this was a beta a crimson relived
driver it was optimized for blockchain
compute workloads this actually
specifically addressed the problem of
decreasing hash rate performance with a
theory of mining as the dag file size
increases as it does as the mining
difficulty increases over time and that
is a problem that affects Polaris and
Vega specifically and legit reviews
actually did a bit of testing on this so
if you guys are miners and that kind of
thing and it was naked I was Nate Dogg
yeah Nathan did some testing in there
because he's on top of the mining stuff
and he did find that the drivers
improved stuff a bit hash rate with
aetherium went from about 32 to 34 which
is a crazy or anything like that and
certainly not the seventy to a hundred
mega hash rate that was sort of rumored
when Vega was still on the horizon and
not not yet launched so on the plus side
for gamers it's not as good at mining on
the minus side it still works for mining
and it's still a card that's available
and it's still very difficult to get
ahold of so as a result we're seeing a
lot of pricing issues now when it comes
to simply to the pricing issues and we
actually reached out to AMD prior to
last week's episode so we could try to
get some direct information from them
and they gave us some information but
it's the impression I've gotten from
other reviewers and stuff like that who
have also been attempting to contact AMD
to clarify this has been that they're
kind of getting the same line the
which is the official statement and so
you know thank you Andy for making an
official statement I've linked a gamer's
nexus article this is again from close
to a week ago where they talked to AMD
got the statement from AMD which is
specifically right here which is that
Radeon RX Vega continues to exceed
expectations and ease working closely
with its partners to justice demand
initial launch quantities included
standalone radian rxt a go 64 at STP or
suggested retail price of 400 $99 Radeon
rx Vega 64 black packs with SCP $5.99
and radian rxt Vega 64 aqua packs for
$6.99 we're working with our partners to
restock all SKUs of Radeon Vega 64
including the standalone cards and
gaming packs over the next few weeks
should expect quantities of Vega to
start arriving in the coming days now
what they did not answer with that
answer is the question of the price of
the products that are available and if
you're looking at this from like a legal
standpoint as far as what they actually
said legally is that their initial
launch quantities had this price we're
working to bring more cards to stock
they are not specifically saying these
new cards that come in will continue to
be sold at this price right and that is
where a lot of pretty much all of the
the negative flak is coming at is as was
revealed on foreign posts and everything
over the past week we can have that's
retailers were given rebates by Andy to
be able to sell the cards at the
introductory price of 500 bucks flat for
Vega 64 and when they become available
in another week that's about another
week of Vegas 56 should be 400 bucks but
after that does that just go away and if
that's how they're actually pricing it
it is extremely deceptive for reviewers
who have reviewed stuff and in
particularly difficult for I mean like
not to be wham about it but like for us
who make videos like our options are
either to remove the video which is
basically like saying hey that work that
you did last week how about you not get
paid for that
which kind of sucks it's not entirely
like that but it's kind of like that or
likely that's like you can't go back
like you came with a written article and
just like update things or something
like that you can make you comments you
can update the description but it's very
and it makes us look like ass hats it
makes us look misinformed or even
potentially deceptive ourselves because
I'm sure that there are a lot of viewers
who when they heard about this news and
caught wind of it some of them probably
thought that we were in on it that maybe
we knew this information upfront that
AMD told us that there would be sort of
this bait-and-switch pricing scheme that
you know that we already knew what was
going on when in fact we had no idea we
were just we were left in the dark just
as much as any any other consumer but
the implications there is that you know
it looks bad on us it hurts our
reputation or our credibility as
reviewers or whatever you want to call
us and we felt just as deceived I think
as a lot of you guys especially when
we're the ones who are kind of being
looked up to to deliver the news deliver
the truth and and sort of give our
honest opinions about a product if we
have the information jumbled up
ourselves because it was deceptively
given to us by the vendor then it it
sort of makes our our conclusions the
the conclusions that we make in the
videos that we work so so hard to
produce it makes those conclusions
invalid and like kind of like Paul was
saying like we don't really have the
option to edit a YouTube video once it's
been posted of course we could remove
that video and then obviously you know
there's there's there's negatives to
that as well or or we like have to make
like a part to like a follow-up video to
our initial review and sort of retract a
lot of the things that we said about our
initial conclusion and that's that's
kind of why I was glad because I sort of
tested Vega not as best as I could have
initially in my first review video and
some people were complaining about it so
I redid the the benchmarks with proper
overclocking on both sides nvidia and
AMD and that was fortunately after this
whole pricing debacle started so i was
able to address that in the second video
and tell my viewers look
if Vegas 56 for example is going for the
launch price then this is the frames per
dollar that you get and it's probably
you know it's potentially a better buy
or equal of a good buy as a gtx 1070 but
if they're gonna dick you over and
charge you a hundred bucks more for that
after the initial stock is gone then
you're looking at a much lower FPD and
the payoff isn't as great so but you
know it's it's it's stupid it's it's
it's a dick move on on AMD's part they
know what they're doing but for whatever
reason no one in the board meeting when
they were deciding all this stuff raised
their hand and said don't you think this
is kind of shady and this is easily
something that any old average viewer or
consumer can look at and be like this is
super deceptive marketing and you
AMD nobody seemed to speak up or at
least if they did they were not listened
to which is very unfortunate that that's
how AMD marketing at least for this
launch is being run it's it's very it's
very disheartening that's why I can
understand and I personally side with
other reviewers who might who might be
more vocal about this sort of thing than
I am and maybe even boycott certain
product launches from vendors who do
this sort of thing so it's thick bro
yeah not the good kind so yeah I know
the good kind of thick this isn't it so
they carry on
exactly forget lost my train of thought
there alright so I tweeted this earlier
today no because it had actually went to
Newegg to look at something else and I
couldn't help but notice their daily
deal was this Radeon Vegas 64 for 690
dollars listen is like a daily like look
at this bargain there's a new egg flash
deal no it's new it's it's like it's
just their daily deals right is shipped
from and stocked by new eggs so if you
guys aren't familiar with the way
marketplace vendors work with with a
retailer like new egg or like Amazon
there is the actual inventory that is
owned and sold by the retailer in their
own warehouses and then there is
third-party sellers and there's various
sort of in-betweens of doing that
there's third-party sellers that have
called virtual fulfillment where it's
like you list their product and they buy
it from you and then you go and say
alright now send this off and then
there's third-party sellers that are
marketplace sellers which are a little
bit some more separate the marketplace
sellers go on and they list their
products or whatever in Amazon has this
and Newegg also has this so this is I
it's often sort of challenging to look
at something like Newegg listings and
see prices that are way way over what
they should be but no egg has a radio
dial or the little button you can click
that says show me new egg stock only
which is a really smart thing to click
because there's so much crap and garbage
that's just vomited onto there by all
these third-party marketplace sellers so
don't care anything about like well I
can just like spam it with like crap on
this on the site to sell and eventually
someone might click on it and buy it so
the difference is when it shipped from
and sold by Newegg it means it's new egg
stock that was sold to them directly
that they have and that they're selling
to you and in in in the past
historically when you're talking about a
tier one retailer with someone like an
Amazon or a new egg there are certain
restrictions that can be placed on them
in order to prevent selling products for
more than what they're actually supposed
to be sold for so a lot of what what
AMD's statement was all about was like
we can't control these prices we can't
you know we can't tell them what to sell
their product for we made a suggested
retail price it's just a suggestion I
also was sort of confused by the fact
that they were using that term STP
suggested eat a lace versus emma is a
more commonly known MSRP and i have no
idea if there's any legalities
surrounding that when you say something
has an MSRP or anything like that but
just from my history working in
e-commerce there's a very common thing
called map pricing or just minima
advertised price and that was something
I would hear about all the time when I
worked at new again I know it's
something in the industry in general
when something has minimum advertised
price pricing
you can't undercut it you can't sell it
for more or I'm sorry at minimum there
you can't sell it for more than what
elmore for what than what it's supposed
to be okay if it's a minimum price so
that means it's the lowest it can go
right that means it's low askew but okay
it's still a something that can be used
to compel retailers to sell products for
the price that they should be is I mean
point guy then I'm getting at here so it
does become more challenging when you
introduce stuff like marketplace vendors
as well because marketplace vendors
aren't always beholden to the same rules
that the retailers are beholden to but
it is disingenuous I feel like to be to
say like people are just selling these
for what they're selling them for and
there's nothing we can do about it
I think there is something that can be
done for the retailers like Newegg and
like Amazon and the ones that AMD works
with directly they can't stop people
from buying the stock and recent listing
on it on eBay or something like that but
that didn't exactly seem to jibe which
with my understanding of the way online
retail works especially if you think if
you think about like if AMD did offer
these retailers some sort of rebate
which allowed them to sell the cards at
a very attractive price at launch I feel
like those rebates are that's still
information that AMD should make
transparent at least like that it should
have been made transparent if that
rebate was something that was altering
what would be the standard price for the
products yeah exactly yeah then people
were treating it as something else if it
was a special introductory price just
for a few lucky first-time buyers then
that's the way it should be phrased
there are some solutions that I've seen
floated around for like how could AMD
maybe have done this better or
differently solution one is just sell it
for a higher price if they realized at a
certain point that Vega performance
wasn't where it was expected to be
and they were also at least somewhat
aware of the fact that coin mining is a
thing and cryptocurrency mining is a
thing then they should have just listed
it for a higher price and sold it and
you'd still be able to sell the cards
that are selling right now because
obviously they are selling to some
degree at these higher prices and then
you wouldn't have to deal with the
customer flack and negative feedback
from people who were pissed off that
they were told one thing and then
they're seeing another one especially in
the case of temporary rebates
the other suggestion is to just do it
and Vidya did you remember Nvidia yeah
the founders edition little more
expensive had video came out with these
in there like these are gonna be a
hundred bucks more like the reference
model is now a hundred bucks more than
like what the actual MSRP is and of
course we can get into a whole other
argument about that and like the the gtx
1070 and what it was supposed to sell
for like it was supposed to be less than
some four hundred bucks like it's still
difficult to find for that price but the
main point is that there are ways around
this that AMD probably could have sort
of sort of explored a perhaps to have
prevented the flack and the backlash
that they're dealing with you know right
now all right so let's really quickly
take a look at some of these Radeon
packs new I guess a landing page for
them with Vega and the bigot cards
themselves and all that good stuff and
they scroll down you can see that packs
themselves and when these were actually
first pitched to us I felt like the
description of them gave us the
impression that they were gonna be more
flexible pardon me because you know
they're not basically if you want to get
the most deal on your rise in pack you
got to get the four item combo which
includes specific SKUs yeah you're a
hundred dollar discount on the the CPU
and the motherboard and then what's
supposed to be a two hundred dollar
discount on the monitor monitor now
you'll notice here on new egg that every
single one of these Radeon packs is out
of stock however
and let me switch real quick just to
double check this cuz I looked at it
earlier and this was the case but I'm
not sure if it still is I guess it's
still there still there and I forget
where your back button went to you know
on the front still there on the front
page still in stock with Lord
so newegg.com front page daily deals
climate changing it's the first one on
the flip board - how dare that one stock
under deals so if there was the
flexibility as far as the cards that
were that have gone in like this this
card is obviously in stock right now and
yet you can't buy it as part of one of
these really unpacked combos because
they are fixed product they're fixed
combos with fixed items in them so that
that you can't mix and match so the
packs that were supposed to were seeing
these packs that were supposed to deter
the the cryptocurrency miners completely
out of stock and the standalone cards
that AMD feared miners would snatch up
first is in stock goods that they're in
stock okay at $190 more than the price
that was supposed to highly inflated
rate also note that every single one of
these packs like the cheapest pack you
can buy is $1,900 sorry
well 1825 dollars well over be specific
1500 which is a little on the expensive
Simon I get you're getting a monitor
there you're getting a I mean you got
that monitor right when they first
explained this to I was like hey 200
bucks off of monitor that's a good deal
what if it was 200 bucks off of like a
range of monitors and like maybe a
hundred bucks off of cheaper much
cheaper monitor or 200 bucks off of the
more expensive modern yet what what
hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo out there who's spending
two grand on high-end desktop parts is
really gonna be okay with whatever
specific bundles someone else has laid
out for them if you want to be able to
pick and choose yes for two grand I'm
picking to every single part that works
for me best I don't want to be limited
to just one monitor or just you know one
CPU or even like five CPUs like let me
pick out every single thing and
you know still give me a rebate for it
yeah and I agree that I mean like if it
had that kind of flexibility granted
there's a lot there I mean I can
understand explaining challenges there
like working with different vendors like
new AG to something to make this sort of
thing work on their website so you can
pick and choose things and then apply a
discount or something like that that's
challenging that's difficult but to be
fair I mean this was clarified a little
bit more early on and although we were
sort of told that here's the monitor
that you get with the pack but there
might be other ones available I have not
seen any other ones available and one
final comments about this monitor and
this was first pointed out to me or
mentioned I believe by Brad sharkus at
the actual events in LA for Vega and
thread Ripper that we went to prior to
launch he immediately pulled up the
price of this monitor which is the
Samsung CF 791 a 34 inch curved
widescreen freesync monitor hold on
volume lowered huh everyone's going
crazy over audio all the sudden they
just said it got super quiet out of
nowhere how's that possible change we
think we've literally just been sitting
here that's nothing is here is your
sound board dying telling you man
I should be talking so people can hear
if there's any different all right it's
buzzing again but it did get lower stop
the buzz lower its a beam of light
it's the beam of light from the window
what just now no oh gosh perfect it's
just a it's just a mess of of chaos and
chat right now it's very difficult to I
see some people saying it's perfect I
see other people saying their ears are
bleeding and I believe their children
have committed suicide oh boy what
you're not liable alright hello it's
static noise is up but also is volume
volume is up again but more noise than
before
sounds good to me
there is buzzing fake news it's not the
AC and AC is not on changing what but
this one was working right I mean you
didn't change it since then right no I
wouldn't expect it to suddenly fail like
a crappy USB cable not working yeah
this USB cable suddenly going from
working perfectly fine to like not I was
this the USB port on the mixing board
that's faulty that could be it to this I
mean how often do USB cables fail really
I'm not sure do you want me to try
unplugging it and plugging it back in
you want to give them
or you can just mute the mic for a split
second mute the mic and xsplit okay
unplug and replug things back in and
then you can go back guys we're gonna
try to unplug and replug back in so I'm
gonna mute the mic so hopefully you guys
don't go dad
you
hello yes I want you three how's it now
I knew guys hear me Frank the frame rate
drop for a second I believe that was
xsplit doing something in the background
3 FPS yes your believe kinda loud still
background noise rip yay good my ears
that's fun can you get me a beer
background noise any any beers fine I
can hear good still bad
perfect
good enough noise it's fine
most people say it's fine 7 out of 10 it
is such a crazy mashup of various
responses it's very difficult to
determine what exactly see what are we
in right now ok
I wonder is there anything like small
that's vibrating near the system any of
the - how did
maybe it's time for a new sampler
potentially yeah I mean I don't think
it's something that we're gonna fix it
get perfect like here while we're lives
yeah probably just press on
what
someone just said what did he do it slow
again
what
quiet again
I guess so yeah how about now guys is
that any better
somebody said leave it yeah I think
we're okay okay let's go ahead oh sorry
if it's not perfect guys but best we can
do right now live if it's not hanging
there if it's not we can just keep
talking and we'll just be talking to
ourselves and that's fine yep
all right so the point I was trying to
make a few moments ago that the Samsung
nine seven nine one series monitor which
is currently part of this deal to get a
couple hundred bucks off of was had
actually dropped down in price a decent
amount compared to original pricing like
this is 908 hundred bucks and good
around June and July and particularly
from in the middle of July it had gotten
down to as low as $700 oh I'm sorry
seven hundred and twenty dollars was the
lowest price but 750 and now let's back
up to about nine hundred and fifty
dollars so that was one of the things
that kind of bounced back as part of the
issues with with that so anyway let's
move on I think we've covered that
enough there's one last thing for oh joy
Verizon's good unlimited plan is not
three bad unlimited plans and basically
if you have Verizon's a little bit of
plan you can still use it but if you're
signing up for new you are now limited
to three options go unlimited which
starts at seventy-five bucks for a
single line beyond unlimited which is 85
bucks for the first line and then
business unlimited you do have to sign
up for a paper free billing an auto-pay
to enable that otherwise you pay five
bucks more a month but these new plans
go into effect tomorrow on August 23rd
and there are some pretty significant
restrictions with them if you're used to
unlimited the word being unlimited
meaning unlimited it has significant
limitations in particular you could
experience reduced speeds due to network
congestion at any time it's not the type
of thing
where you can use data to where you have
a cap and then and and then and then you
and then you get throttled it can happen
at any time if the if the network is
congested also your video streaming is
very limited and that sucks so
especially for the initial plan the go
unlimited you can only do 480p DVD
quality streaming on smartphones and HD
or 720p video streaming on tablets and
there's no way to watch in high
resolution at all so there's just no way
to get high resolution video streaming
you can get slightly better resolution
on your phone if you go to the beyond
unlimited plan and then you do have some
limitations on hotspots if you're on the
standard plan your hotspots limited to
600 kilobits per second although the
data is unlimited although at that speed
like how you're really gonna use up all
that data so yeah basically they're
they're significant how was that
basically they're significantly reducing
the capabilities of their unlimited
plans and they're still calling them a
little bit of plans and there's a
potential net neutrality issues in there
as well but for now let's just move on
next segment is going to be male time so
let's quickly open up some packages that
have shown up I have them right here
first package male time is from from
Jerry mmm and Bigler Bigler this is from
Bigler big lad let's see what's going on
here big leave this stick that that
looks like alright
yes I intercom dyou yeah you don't want
beer Paul sure I could have another one
yeah one for you okay he has his own his
own logo alright so this is from Jason
he's from Montana
he said I'm trying to browse over this
really quick he has a tuxedo flamingo
shirt that he is sent over which is a
flamingo in a tuxedo which seems very
appropriate since we're gonna do
pimp my pc on cows after the show I
should put that on this is his brand
tuxedo flamingo it's what he's been
working on next he's he's at tuxedo
flamingo on that Twitter if you want to
follow him so wait so is that is it a
tuxedo business or a flamingo business
I'm not sure I would imagine those
desolate you would dabble in both you'd
probably want to have a wide range I'd
be the perfect Manor yeah thank you so
he included some pictures he created a
tuxedo flamingo builds in NZXT amantha
which also looks pretty sweet I can kind
of show you guys but I'm imagining whoa
it's played around with the fluid of it
oh no wait these are different systems I
think this might be an evolution over
time or is this different systems yes I
had read the entire letter I probably
would do that but I am afraid that we're
already running fitty late today so you
have time for all that thank you so much
for sending that shirt over yeah
next up oh um actually we I should
mention the mystery we have a mystery to
solve
right well you have a mystery yes okay
we got a letter from a guy and he cents
a picture that I believe is a printout
that he wanted us to sign and he he
basically wrote a really nice letter
however the actual letter the return
address label got peeled off somehow and
or something like that I think it was a
sticker one and it's not there yep
so if you wrote this if you wrote this
letter to us and you're watching the
show we would like to sign this and send
it back to you however we don't have
your address so tweet to us with your
name and what else you put in this
envelope and we'll get in touch with you
hopefully and be able to sign this and
get it back to you yeah that's the
mystery we need to hope it's all moving
along Nathan from Oregon here we go
or again hey I bet Nathan saw the
Eclipse I imagine he might and had a
good view of the clip that would that's
something it's hard to miss if you're in
that area indeed
I realize during the clip eclipse that I
completely forgot how to build one of
those eclipse
viewer things eclipse viewers Oh Nathan
it looks like a sent a CPU so here we go
what hey pong Cal nothing personal
written so don't worry about reading
this on stream if you'd like before I
get too excited about the CPU it's
completely dead Oh two dead CPU it's not
a t5 board and oh he was overclocking it
but and then it died I guess Oh chip is
dead due to the motherboard he bought is
the 87 M from gigabyte in January which
Etta's a short that killed the CPU and
the motherboard no I'm sorry to hear
that
so 46 70 K anyway so he has sent it over
to us so he can add it to the dead CPU
collection I have the board killed off
two CPUs of his that really sucks geez
46 70 K was OEM he couldn't get a
warranty replacement for it huge fan of
all the contents have one question for
you guys and maybe you can answer why
are there no monitor mounted shotgun
microphones for gaming monitor mounted
shotgun microphones that's a great idea
you should not have told us in the world
about that and you should have brought
it on Shark Tank yeah that's a good idea
eight millions if there's any vendors
watching maybe that's something they can
consider this like the swing arms for
the monitor mounts like for streaming
those
be popular look excuse me something
specifically made to mint on your
monitor to monitor could be pretty cool
so this is and Nathan sets his dead 4670
Kay Thank You Nathan may it rest in
peace Mandy it was a good CPU plate
rendered some good frames alright um we
did have another box that arrived down
here but person asked to sit very
specifically not to do any of it on
screen so let's do it on screen
it's never never an ad or wishes never
put instructions along with your your
pack of your care packages to us because
we will not follow them we do not we're
not the type of people to read the
manual all right final package here for
mealtime comes all the way from jolly
old England England oh there's a smell
to that Oh delicious
I know yet another package what it is
our friend Adrian so this is this is for
me and my wife and I believe that means
this one is for you yeah yeah boy for
Kyle and Heather Thank You Adrian and
this would be fudge yes I love you
Adrian my life is now yo Adrian if Mark
completes oh my god flavor did you get
oh I got two flavors oh and a postcard
go ahead of us today from - Kyle and
Heather from exaggerations on all of
your achievements thank you both for
making me love you no wait
laughs thank you both for making me

dogs I hope you continue to love life at
each other for very many decades to come
we will thank you so much this is roly's
fudge ah I got we got honeycomb here as
well as you vanilla clotted cream
I got honeycomb and the caulking
delicious if you're ever in Exeter check
it's not in Exeter it's it's in no it is
an egg thanks for never saying it's an
anchor so check it out if you're if
you're from the UK oh all right that's
all for mealtime let's finish off my
half of the show with some news
we're gonna start with this a little bit
about Final Fantasy 15 I kind of vaguely
started to play Final Fantasy 15 is your
mouth dead its carrion I tried to get my
wife to play Final Fantasy 15 she kind
of fell off but maybe now that it's
coming to PC I can get her back into it
or something like that probably not but
if you are an RPG fan a RPG fan I guess
more specifically Japanese then perhaps
you might be interested in Final Fantasy
15 it's coming to PC it's gonna support
resolutions up to 8k which is pretty
clear
native 4k all the way up to a K the
gameplay is basically the same so
there's not really much change when it
comes to that however they did vastly
increase the resolution they have not
listed minimum specs they've added a
first-person mode as well so you can
play in first-person mode and there's a
pretty cool trailer and that you guys
can check out via length article one of
the I mean just functionally things that
they've done is they've added Nvidia
hair works and turf effects so there's
grass and then like the these like the
big moose things and whatever they you
think they now have hair they had much
more realistic hair
so that's prepare for many performance
videos you know detailing the yeah I
don't know that I don't know if this
might become something to use for
benchmarking your necks potentially next
up intel has well until his I don't know
this is leaked or what but that's we're
on tech power up and we have some
pictures of the retail boxes for the 8th
generation Intel Core i5 and i7
processors their boxes are getting
uglier that
that they're getting so much uglier
embracing like the 80s vibe thing yeah
right kind of a neon sort of retro
throwback I guess no I'm not sure what's
going on over there Intel fired all
they're all they're all they're artists
quit all the designers well that's I
five what about the i7 that looks
exactly the same except it's a little
Pinker with sort of some warm oranges
going in there as well it's still ugly I
noted I noted in the comments somebody
had inverted it it looks better like
that is there like yeah that looks a lot
it still doesn't look cool but it looks
better I'd take the white one a little
bit better they should have for a
limited you know inverted edition so I
feel like there's a slightly less
enthusiastic reaction to these retail
boxes than the third or four ones but
I'd refer retail boxes I mean I I kind
of see both sides when it comes to like
getting excited about a retail box it's
a little silly but they're dead Ripper
that was there was some things inside it
that made it slightly more interesting
like you know you got a year of torques
tool in there to mount it with and he
get a bracket for a stick there was a
couple extras in there whereas these I'm
imagining at least if they're going to
be case cues they're not even gonna have
heatsink fans in them so it's just a CPU
in a box yeah so yeah nothing to get too
crazy excited about I would say but
there is some information that can be
gleaned from them these are four
fourteen animated coffee Lakes CPUs that
we've been talking about in the past few
weeks and months as they've been rumored
they're gonna have up to six cores they
integrated graphics cores in the CPUs
are now going to be branded branded
Intel u HD graphics 6 X X series of 600
series so the fact that they're saying
UHD could mean that they have hardware
accelerated decoding of newer video
formats for example such as 10 bit vp9
at 4k so that might have something to do
with the integrated video decoder which
has been a very functional part of
Intel's mainstream see if you line up
for quite some time since they started
integrating that which was back in the
Sandy Bridge right I think it might have
an ivy bridge after
anyway but yes that's kind of cool might
also have compatibility with new display
connectors such as HDMI 2.0 and
DisplayPort 1.4 this is specifically
talking about the I GPU capabilities so
you know not quite as exciting for
people who are going to be building a
desktop system but if you're talking
about something like the mobile the
mobile mobile versions of these
processors for which I believe Intel's
like Intel had a thing yesterday during
the during the Eclipse I think it was a
bad idea I don't know I don't know if
there's just personal experience or not
I I know nothing about what they
actually announced yesterday yeah I do I
think it was mostly mobile processors
stuff yeah but isn't even that much of
it like usually like and when I'm
looking up stuff to talk about on the
show there's like whatever big news like
you can find without looking too hard
mm-hmm I didn't really see much about it
but will be more to say much about you
guys it's mobile but yeah it did say
they will require motherboards based on
the Intel 300 series chipset though even
though their socket is still LGA 1151
and I believe we're gonna talk about
that more on cows
side of the show as far as compatibility
with the coffee like CPUs I know not
really
oh we're not no I don't believe that
yeah it appears that all the rumors
horrible rumors are true and yes you
will need a new motherboard for a coffee
like processor yep the 8000 series 14
nanometers stuff from Intel alright
couple of more quick stories to the over
here one just a quick new product that
launched today the Corsair avoid pro RGB
wire lists this is the special edition
ooh that PC perspective actually looked
at this is in yellow so yellow accents
you can also get it in a non special
edition it's just kind of more of black
and silver if that's not your thing
now the Void series of headsets has been
developed by Corsair for quite some time
they expanded it with pro now they have
void Pro Wireless RGB all integrated
into this the review here from PC
perspective I will briefly summarize
although again of course this is all the
stuff to talk about
links in the description if you guys
want to check out the whole thing but
was pretty positive overall solid build
quality very comfortable no plastic
creaking even though there is a
combination of plastic and metal that
it's made out of its got 50 millimeter
neodymium drivers and they compared it
specifically to the Logitech G 433 they
did say that the Logitech headset
offered better clarity and a very
balanced sound but that the Corsair
vapor RGB had more warmth and a bit more
bass so he said he liked the Logitech G
433 but it's a matter of preference if
you like your sound a little darker more
powerful then the signature of the Floyd
Pro might be something that you prefer
there were no complaints as far as I saw
in the article as far as wireless
connectivity and quality so that's just
fine I believe it's a 2.4 gigahertz
spectrum device and the mic they also
mentioned specifically since mics are
becoming a little bit more of something
that you should be concerned about when
it comes to a headset and they did they
were complimentary of the mic
it's unidirectional and noise cancelling
and he said the noise cancelling was
impressive but there's still a full mic
quality to the sound that's pretty
typical of gaming headsets you guys are
probably familiar with that so it's not
like a night and day suddenly you can
replace your you know your your blue
Yeti or something like that with it but
what's that brace a good question
usually I say that and I did not just
caress it I think probably the quiet one
1:21 $129.99 I'm pretty pretty clear the
special edition okay if you just want
the standard is for one hundred hundred
bucks hund on Amazon that's fair and it
did get the coveted PC perspective Gold
Award Oh
all right one last item to talk about
here and I don't have notes for this so
it's gonna be really quickly but Samsung
this is a hex s net article samsung has
launched the world's largest cute LED
gaming monitor it is 49 inches this one
which is seems to be absolutely
monstrous big moly I believe we talked
about this on the show before when it
was more rumored to now it's
a little bit more of an actual thing
yeah 32 by 9 aspect ratio its HDR it has
a maximum refresh rate of 144 Hertz but
it can also do 60 or 120 1800 our
curvature 3840 by 1080 pixel resolution
across the 49 inches and yeah that's
it's a really large ash lord and wide
monitor
the thing about that though is like I
wouldn't want to do anything else on it
other than game yeah I wouldn't even
want to like browse like I'd be annoyed
with the extra space on the sides and I
want to like turn my neck if you're like
let's say you're using a to monitor set
up for work or something like that
you know you wouldn't prefer something
like this and you don't have the bezel
in the middle or anything or do you like
the I like the bezel you like a separate
like that partition that's one one area
where I like ID to be like that sort of
partition when there's two monitors but
teach their own so I might think this is
a godsend this does not appear to be
going to the u.s. it says the Samsung
chg 90 which is the model is available
throughout Europe after games come
because Gamescom is going on right now
no pricing information however is
available it's Austin it's gonna be
expensive it's also kind of lame that
it's 49 inches but still only 34 40 by
1080 yeah I feel like it would have been
it wouldn't they would have sweeten the
deal quite a bit they were they might
have sold me if they increase the
resolution till I give whatever standard
whatever the 1440 yep equivalent is
equivalent to 32 by 9 yeah yeah like 21
by 9 monitors that are 1080 vertical or
give you miss you miss out on some of
that resolution okay
that pretty much wraps it up for my
planned portions of the show we're gonna
really quickly answer some questions
that may have been asked with donations
in the comments so we're gonna try to go
through these quickly yep we've been
getting tons of these and they're taking
a pretty significant amount of time at
the end of the show so I'll polish our
apologies if we can't invest quite as
much time at each one yeah but first off
Tom's brim Smith's with 50 knock what's
your thoughts on HDR for gaming and
would you like try my beer from home
country Latvia yes I would like to try
your beer yep
I think anything that gives you better
image quality is gonna be great for
gaming however of course the question
will be what kind of impact it might
have on performance but yeah I'm stoked
for HDR for gaming yeah me too
that's pretty cool checker tile all ten
dollars ten bucks Callum Paul I bought
an Asus ABI 350 motherboard I'm guessing
okay yeah an Asus up prime Asus Brian D
350 it doesn't support sli I have a 1070
should I sell and buy a Vegas so I can
upgrade to two or net it's Paul's 1070
and Verizon 1600 build if he remembers
it oh yeah I do that bill that's good
bill I would say no hang on to your 1070
cuz your Vega is upgrade options are not
looking super hot right now if you're
gonna upgrade to anything practically
speaking right now upgrading to a 1080i
single GPU would probably be your best
bet and you know your rise in 1600
should still be able to keep up with
that just fine thank you so much for
your donation automatic Matt 10 bucks
thanks automatic match for your
automatic donation hey guys on the road
can only donate on a shitty laptop and
taking my brother's PC I built to him at
college I've got no box and it's got an
all-in-one should I remove both the GPU
AIO for transport a O's are usually okay
the GPU I would recommend pulling out
although if you're bringing it
personally like listen you said I
recommend pulling out yeah you're a guy
who's got a got pull ups it's not a
universally effective method but it's
worked for me um yes
pull the GP out but I mean if you're
delivering it yourself and you know
what's in there and only you are going
to be handling it and you're not like
giving it to some movers who are gonna
like toss it or anything like that then
it's probably fine
Felix Montelongo $15 thank you so much
well Asli 1080 bottleneck is 1600 X I'm
34 40 by 1440 60 Hertz to 100 Hertz
answer there is yes in certain
situations you can almost always get X
GPU to bottleneck on Y CPU depending on
the settings you're using and that kind
of thing however your 1600 X I think
you'll be pretty good with
you there are of course the out there
benchmark II situations where you could
say you know a 7700 K might get you a
few extra frames that kind of thing
but I think for your purposes you'll be
just fine but yeah make sure you have a
Z 370 motherboard cell processing ten
bucks
cell why are you donating don't donate
to stop itself oh hey Paul I love you in
the way a man can love another man but
without the BUTT STUFF public itself so
thank you thank you so much why not I
know stuff I hope cell that you didn't
actually donate you just you just put
that in the doc cuz you could easily
have done that thank you which I and I
would probably I'd respect that a lot
you opened up so thank you thanks dude
automatic Matt again with another five
bucks
also Kyle more Asian words of wisdom on
a Puerto Rican Irish hybrid the you know
what that's weird that's exactly the
accent that I'm currently working on a
Puerto Rican Irish hybrid yep I've been
wanting to nail that one down for so
long Puerto Rican Irish hybrid it's like
it's like my you know it's like my Holy
Grail that's what I would aim for as
well it'll come out when one time's
right all right
Lincoln Thurber with a $20 donation and
no comments so we will say thank you
very much Lincoln for your donation
that's about all we can say there Toby
Wong with five pounds
donation PC games and dot-com with the
actual link vendors are spinning
 because stocks are limited and
they can get away with it he's posting a
link to a PC game Zen article let's see
if I can pull that up after the show and
take a closer look
jujubee's with $5 starting a new project
in November primary use is running Adobe
CC Suites light streaming and gaming
1700 X or 1800 X is it worth plus $100
your one percent female viewer hey
that's awesome
I see I think I'm at 2% just to I'm a to
just clarify that maybe if they have at
2%
jujubee's if you're at all comfortable
with just a little bit of overclocking I
would say stick with that 1,700 X you
still get the XF are they overclocked
just fine it's the same CPU underneath
and you
get pretty much the equivalent
performance to an 1800 X and save a few
bucks in the process and that would be
my recommendation for you and that's a
great use for Adobe Creative Cloud and
some light streaming for sure
Tim Brooks 20 bucks if I'm going to
spend two K at a combo pack why not give
us the option of a thread Ripper CPU
motherboard monitor combo thoughts
um those two premature I think the
Ripper didn't come till after they had
already slight tilt until didn't come
until after AMD had already sort of did
all these deals and stuff with all the
involved vendors like Samsung and stuff
yeah I mean well I mean I guess they
could have done casillas happenes I
think I think just because they really
wanted to keep pushing Rison I think
they probably felt like that was more
attainable for the masses cuz it was
more or less the mainstream platform it
lines up a bit more with the GPUs and
everything cuz they're different they're
not really so there I mean granted there
is a ton of gaming threader for
motherboards and stuff yeah
mother we're manufacturers do they
focused on but it's really yeah Gaming
is really not like you don't need thread
Ripper two games can use it again but I
mean that's interesting if like I feel
like the packs are kind of they've lost
a lot of their viability in general but
you know people might be in into that if
it was something they could set up
easily I'd be interested to see if they
were able to make any sales that way I
guess
Jessica Gifford $5 donation this must if
just if this is actually a Jessica
it might be another part of our issue of
our female yeah hold them
is it safe to run a i/o cooler 24/7 or
is it better to use an air cooler plan
on overclocking and r5 1600 X and an h4
40 or mesh if I see any cooler
suggestions you can run it 24/7
yeah and they're intended to run until
whenever
like they just yeah you're not supposed
to like turn them off or whatever like
they're they should they should a good a
Oh will last you at least at least
that's warranty at least two or three
years yeah a lot of them will run longer
than that just when you're running an AI
Oh long term just listen to it pay
attention to the noise it makes
if you notice it making a significantly
different noise than it's made in the
past for you maybe keep a closer eye on
it and
that your pump might be failing because
of my experience they tend to give sort
of a death rattle when they're on their
way out you check your attempts - yeah
temperatures keep an eye on those as
well but yeah they're fine for 24/7 use
Oh clarify season her in a aged 440 or
mesh if I see any cooler suggestions
like cooler as like for AIO coolers
Corsair EVGA NZXT animax animax
a lot of them are you know ASA tech om
so yeah they're more or less the same
just depends on what kind of unique
features you want between each one some
can be may be moderately quiet or
moderately cooler than others but for
the most part they all perform within a
pretty close margin so Gareth blundell
a-- gamers Nexus recent report on Vega
56 shows a hard limit of 300 Watts do
you think a IV Perkins will increase
this so I can push the overclock higher
Gareth that's a very good question if
that is a specific limitation that AMD
has set because Vega 56 is based on the
exact same GPU die as Vega 64 they might
have done that to prevent a Vega 56 from
suddenly being able to overtake a Vega
64 based on an unlimited overclocking
capability so I think this is probably
not something that we're gonna see
opened up for for people because it's
just they they're gonna cannibalize the
market for their Vega 64 ring which
they've already done a great job putting
a damper on I guess already as we've
discussed in this half of the show but
yeah if that's the way that AMD has
decided that they're going to segment
that chip I don't see that suddenly
being lifted for Adam board versions Ben
Eckert
although gamers Nexus has done some some
bio stacking and that kind of thing
which has been somewhat interesting Ben
Eckert's 10 bucks I am building a 16 50k
rig I have an asus strix gtx 1070 would
like to use or sink any suggestions are
thought on an icy zeus motherboard the
302 Ford and $50 ring what about the
motherboard that you just oh wait no
that's a z2 70 isn't it yeah so I'm
you're gonna want an X 6 to 99
oh no it's
next you get no ex9 thanks why-why-why
is staring you because I was like maybe
they'll figure out an exit it's not next
119 that what it's yeah I know it's 99
Wow it's a night sex thing
let's hang it god damn it I'm not insane
I have a gun crazy sex 99 it's weird
when they bring up like a last
generation part and you have to remember
like all right what chipset does that
belong to
yeah because there have been so many
freaking launches X there's X 3 99 9 all
the chips on X 3 X X 2 99 are the
seventies 7000 series years we're
professionals um Deluxe x9 yeah Alexis
all a choice selects two I would say go
Kristi bucks to over the deluxe one I
think it's got a little bit better
options especially if you're talking
about or a sink and RGB compatibility
and everything there's the saber-tooth
x99 yeah I like c4 two points
yeah the the Strix I believe there's
also an RG version that you might look
into there as well
yeah but either of those depending on
whether you want a dark look or the
black and white stuff the mainstream
series has with the deluxe or the end
not mainstream but just the looks
alright Tony be 5 bucks
hey guys I'm in the process of building
my first stage keep my first PC looking
at it Rison 560 hundred with a 1070 what
be 350 motherboard would you recommend
best bang for the buck I'm sure that
there are many that that will get the
job done no problem the one that I've
had the most experience with is the Asus
prime B 350 plus that seems to be a
pretty solid board I've used it for a
lot of testing in it the BIOS is really
easy to use and it's pretty stable I've
had good luck overclocking you know good
luck with memory has frequent BIOS
updates that sort of thing but again do
your research I'm sure there's plenty of
other be 350 motherboards out there that
are good yeah I've used that one a
decent amount too so that's a good
option but I mean
Asus MSI and gigabyte
it's you know as rock as well I think
they all have some good options in there
so just take a look in that what looks
best to you what matches with the rest
of your stuff take a look at reviews and
see what people are responding with and
everything
and finally Heather Hansen Heather
Heather what why is your wife do is why
piece up god damn house wife has donated
five dollars here's my weekly donation
because Paul is greater than Kyle love
wifey sauce
thank you Jesus Wow damn I feel loved
well I'm happy to year anniversary I
have to buy your wife a drink let me go
to dinner beautiful wife thanks Heather
all right Desiree with a $20 donation
I'll be watching the second half of the
stream should I plan on being able to
hear that half hello love you guys
Google sound Dez take it as I hope I
hope the sound is at least somewhat
legible yeah sorry about that guys here
bull it's okay we metal through somehow
rice and cocoa five bucks I have a case
of brewery beers that's that's pretty
close to here but don't trust shipping
companies with handling a dozen 1.5
liter beers but your p.o box be willing
to hold on to it if we get packages that
are too large at least to my P o box it
still can come in yeah they give me a
little slip and they hold the package
back behind stuff and then I have to
bring them the slip and Sam that's how
they give me things so yeah okay but
yeah make sure you pack those well
especially if they're big beers clinched
flip Oh
$10 he says balls balls I agree yes real
Walker jr. 5 bucks please review this
card the Auris geforce gtx 980ti water
force WB extreme edition 11g no I I mean
I could ask I don't know I feel like
I've reviewed enough 1080p eyes it's
like here's another 1080i then again you
could always use another every 1080p a
mine more 1080 eyes I run short on them
sometimes
Christopher Calvary $5 y'all's videos on
the misha phi c inspired me to build my
first ever PC thoughts on the Deus Ex
aesthetic with the angular black case
and gold are jeebies yes or no
I agree with the angular black case that
that that lines up well are desolated a
sex aesthetic gold RGB so I would think
it'd be a challenge
what do I have large v's mean i mean you
you're talking about RGB LEDs and then
setting them to a gold tacoma yellow or
yeah yellow with yeah you mess around
with that yep yellowish orange tends to
make the the more like more accurate
gold power that can be a challenging
tense to get just make sure that all of
your LEDs are like the same kind of LEDs
so there's no discoloration between them
if you're going for a single color that
can be difficult to hit if you have
multiple kits or that kind of thing yep
sir backstab 10,000 W I've never seen
that I come with 10,000 Big W listen up
all hey guys doing a rise in 1700 X
build with a gtx 1080i next month or
just or two just waiting on my case and
motherboard to release will y'all be
doing a half 500 P and crosshair 6 0
extreme review later South Korea o South
Korean War cool awesome that's pretty
sweet
um I will be doing a half 500 P build
it's about 10 bucks which would be fun
crosshair crosshair six hero
extreme no plans right now but I'll keep
my options open and yeah Congrats on
your build hopefully it goes smoothly
yeah I should have a half 500 coming in
there they have the cosmos as well I
told them no on the cosmos it's too big
I I mean I like literally it's do I have
yeah I'm totally with you now because I
think it's a bad case of course cuz it's
too big it's very big and it have room
for it yep
but my bits five dollars five bucks for
your taco you
thank you so much we gotta go we had
some talk instead of its I'd not want a
good coverage on the other Plex stuff
recently what ten dollars
Paul say Melissa stop playing South Park
already Melissa stop playing South Park
already yeah Melissa I actually that's
the game that I started playing and was
enjoying and then I just kind of stopped
playing I it'd be cool to yeah play that
again
Kid Rock five hundred and twenty rupees
India resumes best wishes from India
what are your expectations of power
consumption on
even Ridge ap use especially mobile chip
of the same wish I had a beer too now
power consumption of the remarriage ap
use particularly has stuff to say it's
using today say completely skip that I
completely skip that oh I thought you
intentionally skipped it no I didn't oh
well that's one of the store right we
better for me better finish my half okay
talking about sex 45 because it's one of
my headlining stories that's true Olli
just totally just skipped over it okay I
suck alright I honestly I noticed that
you skipped and I was like oh he's
probably just remember I belong I did I
opened the link set of orders alright
Raven Ridge thank you for queueing that
that's also the last comments donation
today we can't come in so let's really
quickly talk with our average because it
has been spotted and confirmed as a
curve through I grew of 3d articles it's
this is I'm glad that worked out though
so here's the rise in roll out the anal
circle AMD has been pitching
specifically for the this year 2017 as
well as first half 2018 and you might
notice that on the mobile side for
consumer mobile we've got rise and
listed here as well as mobile rise and
Pro listed over here now desktop side
we're expecting maybe potentially hoping
that they're going to be doing an AP
long APU launch over there as well it
seems like they should because I've done
the I believe Bristol Ridge ap use which
are based on older architecture they
don't have then in them but there it is
anyway there's a couple database entries
that have come up recently on copy bench
and GFX bench that specifically list a
couple AP use that have AMD Radeon Vega
graphics an AMD rise in CPU cores
there's two of them specifically the
rise in five 2500 you that has Vega
eight mobile mobile and then this one
here the rise in 727 are you with Vega
10 mobile and its
there's the other one right there so
yeah it's got Zen zpu it's got a Vega
graphics the Raven Ridge is probably
gonna have a Zen CCX unit and a bigger
graphics core with up to 12 next-gen
compute units that would provide up to
seven hundred and sixtieth stream
processors obviously as shown here this
might be a couple different versions of
it and that would give you up to four
CPU cores since it's got basically half
of what exists in a full-size Verizon
CPU and that's gonna have with SMT up to
eight threads up to eight megabytes of
l3 cache dual-channel ddr2 these specs
that you're already familiar with with
rise and CPUs integrated with an APU
with Vega
just sort of attached and worked in
there the CPU communicates with the Vega
GPU units the Infinity fabric the
standard for communication between both
in in internally in the CPUs themselves
as well as communication across
platforms between CPUs GPUs as well as
memory and early pre-production samples
have already been running up to three to
three point three gigahertz so it would
be interesting to see socketed a.m. for
Raven Ridge rising plus Vega ap use a
pair of pairing them up with like an
inexpensive be 350 motherboard or
something like that it could be a really
cool entry level gaming option and you
know we'll have to see what pricing is
it's difficult to say what's power
consumption is Vega has not Vega is
actually a very efficient chip it's just
it can't be efficient and also run at
speeds that are competitive with Nvidia
and so AMD had to run it at much much
higher frequencies that are much less
efficient like on if you look at the
performance efficiency curve for Vega
it's running way way towards the wrong
end of its where it's not efficient at
all which is why power consumption
numbers and a lot of the testing has
been very different if you underclock
Vega to more reasonable frequencies it's
actually really good at staying power
efficient and all that kind of stuff so
anyway that's is gonna do it for my half
of the show oh thank you guys so much
for watching
Johnson's thumbs up button of course oh
actually
almost forgot Johnson Johnson's Viktor
quickly some Jackie from picking up a
bio slasher shirt and a CPU cooler
shirts as well my friend and we've also
get lunch from John John BIOS flasher
shirt thank you John
Oh John son to you my friend I have one
Johnson a shout-out for Zack Thank You
Zack he got the English pub glass so
thank you so much for grabbing on Zack
much obliged thank you guys for watching
my half the show of course thumbs up
button on the way out of here enjoy it
and we'll be switching over to Cossack
momentarily they link to his half is in
the video's description so check that
out
thanks for watching guys and we'll be
right back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
