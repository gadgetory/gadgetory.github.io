sponsored by fractal design MSI and
g.skill welcome back to Computex 2016
I've done a lot of coverage so far like
video cards cases that kind of thing but
you know you need in order to actually
do some PC gaming you need a monitor so
here are three monitors that I thought
were pretty badass from Computex so
contestant number one for gaming
monitors at Computex this is from our
Isis our friends at ROG this is rog
swift PG 2 for 8q it's a 24 inch 1920 by
1080 display so this is not going to be
as expensive as some of the 1440 or 4k
monitors you don't get the full
resolution but what they're going
forward here is speed because this
actually has a 180 Hertz refresh rate at
least it's overclockable to that as well
as a response time of 1 millisecond
grade of gray so that's going to give
you a really smooth gameplay combine
that with G sync technology of course
variable framerate and you're going to
get you're going to get an excellent
experience you also have something
called game + + game visual technologies
I don't know what that does well but you
have some nice features - tilt swivel
pivot and height adjustments I really
like the stand on this one it's also got
some red LED accents down at the bottom
keeping with the ROG theme and aesthetic
and as far as inputs on the back end and
HDMI and a display port you also get a
USB 3.0 pass-through which is very
convenient and then the controls are
thankfully actual buttons just tucked
away back behind the right side of the
bezel which is very nice as well finally
as for the price of this will monitor
$500 us so you do get to pay a little
bit more for the g-sync module and all
that really high frame rate refresh
goodness but I get three of them for
1500 and then you can get yourself 1080
by 3 surround and the next contestant is
the Acer predator X 30 for PA you guys
might have seen my review he have the X
34
a little while back very nice monitor is
34-inch ultra wide 21 by nine quad HD 34
40 by protein-coding and for the X 30
for P they have made some pretty nice
upgrades first off
they've curbed the monitor more the
curvature radius is 1900 R as compared
to the original X 34 so base we got a
little bit more wrap around that going
on with this one
of course it still supports Nvidia
g-sync and now it ships at a 100 Hertz
refresh rate so you don't have to
overclock it yourself or have the
potential for it not to overclock maybe
quite as much as you expect it to it's
going to just ship it out under Hertz I
asked about overclocking beyond that
they said yeah I probably should I mean
it's your mileage is going to vary a
little bit of course that's the way it
goes with overclocking but you should be
able to hit maybe outer than 20 Hertz
which is pretty nice for an IPS display
as far as the structure and housing
around it they actually proved the stand
of it they're giving you the ability to
swivel now which is actually quite
convenient it's a large bulky stand and
moving it side to side at a desk can be
a little bit of a pain so adding that
little swivel feature quite nice I love
the same control functions they're kind
of tucked away back behind the right
side install the under low light in the
same set of colors so they have real
updated that they have updated the back
of the actual chassis for housing of the
martyr though and thank God they got rid
of the black glossy PLAs
now much much nicer looking sort of
brushed metal finish I like it I think
it looks pretty I mean anything's an
upgrade from black glossy plastic to me
Alice as far as outputs or video outs we
got an HDMI as well as DisplayPort I'd
recommend using DisplayPort for this
option as far as MSRP though the x34
wasn't expensive or shipped for about
$1,100 it's selling for about eleven
hundred dollars actually retail this
one's probably gonna be a little bit
more than that so we're looking at maybe
eleven hundred a thirteen hundred dollar
range they won't tell me the exact price
but that's probably one's going to ship
for so will be an expensive product
excellent for Pete or Mason and here is
contestant number three I was actually
going to go to Ben Q to do a third
monitor but they didn't really have much
of their gaming monitor set up on
display so I came back to Acer this is a
predator Z one series monitor 21 by nine
the model Z 301 C and it is new for the
show it's a 30-inch 2560 by 1080 21 by
nine monitor does still feature and
video g-sync and actually goes up to 200
Hertz refresh rate thanks to of being a
VA panel
it's getting pretty decent color
reproduction from what I can tell here
on the show floor granted it's not quite
as inky black as you get maybe with an
IBS but still looks pretty nice for
millisecond response time on this
function should be great for gaming
right now it's running at 144 Hertz as
you might be able to tell up in that
counter in the top right corner although
granted it's just playing a movie but
hey that works as for the housing and
the stand
well the stance pretty nice got a nice
wide feet on there again you get a
little bit of a swivel action here so
you can swivel a little bit side to side
without moving the whole stand
back just like the Z 34 P is a very very
clean brush metal finish thank God a sir
has given up on the glossy plastic it
seems like at least for now for video
outs you get an HDMI and a DisplayPort
not too bad I kind of would like to see
another display board on some of these
models to be perfectly honest and I did
try to hunt down the price for this one
but they would not sell me some you get
the same sort of effective controls he
gives as e34 P as well you kind of reach
around on the right side you little
joystick controller back there it's not
too bad for navigating through on-screen
displays and that kind of thing you also
have a USB 3.0 hub on this one also just
like the Z 34 so I think there's going
to be maybe a bit more of a budget
oriented option compared to Z 34 P which
is probably going to be again pretty
expensive and hopefully this one's
reasonably priced because when I 560 by
1080 it's a good resolution to game it
again the 30-inch Z 301 C from hey sir
and it's looking pretty nice so there
you go guys let me know what you think
of these monitors down in the comment
section below really wish I could get a
price on that third one but they really
couldn't tell me yet but those two AC
monitors are expected to come out in q3
this year so keep an eye out for them
anyway guys thanks for watching this
video hit the thumbs up if you enjoyed
it a final sponsor shout out to my
sponsors fractal design MSI and g.skill
thanks for watching and we'll see you
soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
