description and get inspired for your
next project what's up guys welcome back
to Pauls hardware today's video just a
disclaimer right from the ego is going
to be about my house and my workspace
and not so much about me building
computers and about technology so just
so you know I'm going to be doing some
cleaning today as well as some
preparation for several projects that
I've had coming down the pipeline for
quite some time so I've had several
people mentioned to me in recent videos
that they've seen a lot of clutter
around and that's a big problem it's
been hurting my efficiency so I need to
clean that up I also have the HTPC
ultimate builds project that's a lot of
people have been asking about the htpc
itself is actually completely functional
and it's sitting down there and working
but I haven't done the wall mounting and
all the stuff that I promised with that
I've also mentioned at least on our live
show a couple times that I am getting
solar installed as well as a tesla
powerwall and along with that we're
hoping to do some actual home
improvement projects a little bit of
remodeling here mainly to get our
kitchen redone and then possibly get
some new floors put in because we've
lived here for about four years now and
none of this stuff like this is all how
the how the house came pretty much
except for like the curtains that we've
put up in that kind of thing so there
are some things we'd like to change but
before getting to any of that I just
need to get stuff cleaned up and
organized and make some new spaces for
some new stuff that has come in over the
past year so we have a single large
living room dining room kind of open
area and I just want to point out before
you guys criticize me for all the
clutter and the other spaces things out
here are in fairly good shape we've kept
them relatively clean part of the
remodeling is probably going to be
getting ready to some of the bookshelves
redoing the center unit here cleaning
things up because it there there can
feel like there's clutter over in that
area to some degree but that's mostly
clean and everything
over in this space is the dining room
and this is the area that I have been
co-opting for much of the summer and
much of this year because I've had to do
an exorbitant amount of benchmarks this
year we had rise in we had Vega we had
thread Ripper
we had sky like X we had coffee like
other stuff in between so I've been
doing most of my benchmarking out here
and that's mainly because we have you
know whole house air conditioning and
it's a lot easier to maintain the
temperatures and the garage gets really
warm later in the day even when I have
the AC cranked up there so this is the
space of co-opted and like you know
that's it's like half the living space
that we have basically I have sort of
just taken and put all of my stuff on
now normally this is okay and I have a
lovely wonderful wife and she's very
very tolerant to this kind of thing
however like see this here there's
actually piles of boxes of mainly
computer hardware and stuff under there
so I first I was confused like is is she
drying sheets off here or something no
she's just covering my crap so she's she
doesn't have to look at it that's a big
warning sign so there's kind of my mess
out here for now this side over here is
dog food and dog stuff for the most part
and right now it's on a folding table so
we're hopefully gonna maybe set up
something over here to be a little bit
more contained for the dog feeding
because we do have to get at that every
day also there's my cornhole board that
Brian Mimi it's over in the corner use
that meanwhile out in the garage things
are a little bit more chaotic this side
of the garage is the actual garage area
laundry garage storage of things I
definitely can clean and reorganize and
make some better storage for that side
it's not very well done at all and
getting stuff is very difficult and then
there's my actual sort of studio area my
main desk and this is where just like
every single project that comes through
I usually have some kind of plan of like
oh once that project is done I'm gonna
clean it up and put stuff away and
whatever it's just not been happening
it's I've been moving from one to the
next so quickly so just have like from
other boards lying out and like oh look
there's all the pieces of the original
arctic panther and there's the new
arctic panther over here is the half
build that I just did piles of stuff
from Matt's we just did awesome Hardware
last night so there's still like stuff
like
from that I did clear up the beer
bottles so that was good new monitor
over here that needs to be put on the
arm mounts that I was frantically trying
to get done before the show and didn't
have time so it's just sitting on the
stand so I got to work on that and then
of course the sort of mess that's all
over there supposed to be kind of my
storage area over there but it's just
it's just piled with stuff so all this
is to say I have lots of work to get
done cleaning is gonna be the first item
on the list because it's gonna also lead
to what's probably gonna be a garage
work log video following up to introduce
some better storage I have some cabinets
and shelves but stuffs just piled in
there I need to create some drawers and
that kind of thing in there but I've
done far too much of an intro already
for this video I'm going to get my
time-lapse camera set up and then I'm
gonna get to work okay guys just
checking in here in the middle of this
cleaning and reorganization project
because Lots has been going on and it's
hard for me to get an idea of what you
guys are seeing because you're seeing
this all happened very fast whereas for
me it's taking a few days it is Sunday
morning now and I've made a lot of
progress and I just wanted to kind of
show you guys what my mo is as far as
all the stuff that's that's you're
seeing moving from place to place or
being piled up now on the table right
now is all of the dog stuff apart from
the dog food and like their bowls this
is this is all of our dog equipment
we're about to go through all this
probably donate a lot of its that we
don't use anymore and consolidate the
rest of it so you keep things a bit more
tidy beyond that over here is in my area
for gathering things that are in their
boxes and they're fully functional and
pretty much good to go and here I'm just
sort of organizing stuff so I can get a
handle on like video cards are there
these are all mostly motherboards
coolers up here I've got some CPUs and
memory and that kind of thing I do have
some plans for a lot of this stuff but
them for myself what I want to do is
just get an assessment of what I have
from each type of products mainly
motherboards I have way too many of
those keep the ones I need for current
generation and make sure I have one of
each prior generation and then hand the
rest down to someone who can possibly
make better use of them than myself over
on this side of the room empty boxes
products currently in use and these I'm
actually going to have a storage rack
for up in the garage so I'm just
gathering all those together there's
more boxes as well as products out in
the garage that I still haven't moved
out here yet but getting everything
cleared apart was going to be the
biggest part these cabinets over here
we're gonna move over against this wall
as well as the remainder of my wife's
old desk or the frame of it there it's
going to go there for now for temporary
and it's going to be our dog area and
then this we're gonna put the table our
dining room table there this is mostly
trash and recycling down here so that's
all going to get cleared out I got this
chair here this chair broke like a year
ago and I've been intending to fix it
hold on let's see if I can fix it
tada chair is now stool
I love fixing things okay so beyond that
I've been doing some stuff out in the
garage but haven't been filming much out
there yet it is still very chaotic out
there for now
gonna get the dog area set up over there
set this area up to be a receptacle for
piling all the stuff that's going to be
cleared out of here and then of course
get prepared to put additional storage
in the garage for these boxes and of
course they're clearing out of the
garage still lots of work to be done
oh yeah and just in case anyone was
wondering how I'm recording these time
lapses GoPro Hero 4 is up here connected
to an AC adapter so it's got power all
the time which is up there and got a
couple camera mount reading things going
on there and that's been doing a great
job so I'm gonna turn this back on and
get back to work
alright guys that seems like it was a
lot of work or at least it should have
been a lot of work provided that my time
lapses were working properly I hope they
did also a gala will dis join it at the
beginning of this video my thought was
you know I got a lot of work to do a lot
of cleaning up a lot of organizing I'm
gonna spend maybe two three days on it
get some footage see how that goes it's
actually been closer to like a week and
a half since I started making this video
and I have made lots of progress of
course there's been lots of distractions
and other things I've been working on
too but I've tried to keep those time
lapses going whenever I could anyway
more to the point um back behind me here
is probably the best example of the
fruits of my labor so let's take a quick
look I hope you guys don't mind here Oh
snoring down there but here is the set
and it's looking pretty clean and
organized especially if you compare it
to the in show now if you're looking
over the left here you might notice that
there's some deeper things that I was
intending to fix that haven't gotten to
yet cuz I really just realized that my
organization as it stands just kind of
needs a refresh I have space here but I
don't have some smaller spaces tucked
away and I really really need to redo
this cupboard because it's functional
for storage but I need to get better
space in there and some drawers and
stuff like that a work table here having
it cleaned off as well as having that
area over there cleaned off is something
that doesn't happen very often combine
that with the fact that this table over
here is also clean for the most part
except for my printer over there it
makes me very happy these are some
building equipments and materials that I
generally do tend to keep here but as I
hopefully improve the storage base back
there I'll have better places to tuck
some of those little things away and I
may or may not cover that organization
project in a future video but main point
is here that everything is looking a
heck of a lot better than it used to I
feel a lot better when things are clean
and a bit more organized and I can
actually make more use of this space
over here as a staging area when I get
products coming coming in but beyond all
that of course is the rest of the garage
where there are more normal garage
things and I still haven't gotten to all
that and I still haven't put up to the
other overhead that I'm planning to do
on the far end up there so yeah more
work to be done over there oh yes the
dining room the air
that I promised I would get cleaned up
so that we could eat dinner on the table
and stuff don't worry this looks a lot
worse than it actually is
so let me start off actually over here
in this corner dog stuff
look we set these up here and we got rid
of that table and we have a little chair
there that I made it into a chair from a
stool or made it into a stool from a
chair and dog food this is my halloween
costume I'm actually gonna be wearing
that tonight that's why that's how also
still got some pieces of other tables
and those are going to be transitioned
outside down here in the ground just
some recycling over here on the right
wall is stuff that I'm not going to keep
and I got to figure out proper ways of
disposing of some of that actually
ignore those cases this those aren't
part of that this stuff all over here
apart from the the cornhole board the
grant Brian made me is all boxes with
hardware that's in use so those are
gonna go up on the upper rack in the
garage once I get that final one
installed table here still has a few
things that need to be disassembled and
whatnot some graphics cards CPUs are
here memories over there these are all
CPU coolers motherboards some graphics
cards over there but things are
organized the piles that they're in are
organized and then all the rest of the
cases are there and then miscellaneous
stuff on the table right there so I'm
gonna be bringing the stuff that I still
need from these piles back into the
garage and then the rest of its will be
set aside and disposed of probably just
an incinerator or something like that
and yeah I dunno looking at all this
comparing my before and my after pics
that um it's maybe not all that
impressive
I swear guys I've really got a lot done
I promise it just the looks clutter this
is an ongoing an ongoing thing and I of
course still have more to do I will say
though that I'm pretty excited about the
progress I've made because I'm gonna
start moving some stuff outside and
working on the stuff out there so garage
work log I think coming up very soon but
for now I hope you guys have at least
gained some entertainment out of
watching this video I always feel
slightly strange when I just post videos
of me cleaning and organizing but um
what the heck I got a lot done so hit
the thumbs up button if you did enjoy it
and if you do have any feedback for me
leave it in the comment section down
below I'll be back very soon with more
videos and we'll see you guys in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
