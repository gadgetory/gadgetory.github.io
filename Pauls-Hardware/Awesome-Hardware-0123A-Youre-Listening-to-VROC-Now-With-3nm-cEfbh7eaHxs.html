hey it is I think we're okay yeah sure
yes we should be live now Wow like a
studio all right hi everyone and welcome
this is awesome hardware it's a live
show about technology we drink some
beers we talk about technology and we
have a good time and we stream it live
every Tuesday evening at 5:30 p.m.
Pacific or sometimes at 5:48 p.m.
Pacific time if it's a little late like
we are today we're keeping expectations
low today though so that's kind of the
theme of today's show but yeah we stream
live to twitch.tv slash awesome awesome
hardware as well as to my channel or to
Kyle's channel on YouTube we do at the
same time twitch in YouTube it's amazing
I'm drawing this out anyway
we'll be streaming on my channel for
about an hour switching over to Kyle's
channel in about an hour after that we
have lots of fun stuff to talk about
today and we're drinking beer so this is
this is my beer its bells I wanted to
show this because it's a beer we were
drinking last week and I forgot to say
what it was
it's a bell amber ale I like that one
from Michigan from Comstock Michigan
quite um so yeah Cheers as you can
combine beers in the lands of Japan it's
known as switching to that sin to Asahi
Asahi is a very rare and obscure beer
I think the hipsters know about this one
Subaru I brought the second one for you
yes I'm gonna open that in just a second
okay first turn Cheers geez thanks guys
for joining us mm-hmm delicious tasty
okay apologies for being late and I were
blaming Kyle for that yep won't go into
details yeah sure it was it was messy
though it was messy there was stuff on
the walls it was go everywhere
but a few a few announcements to start
out the show as usual we are selling
stuff on our stores so check it out
pulsar bread net is my store we're
having a t-shirt design contest
links to that at the top if you want to
enter 300 bucks if we use your full
design hundred
squeeze your idea three homes we have a
new awesome hardware swordfight church
that is right here front and center at
the top of my store as well as stainless
steel bottle openers boom look at that
beautiful that's just like my nvidia
similar one to your NVIDIA GeForce one
but it's way better cuz it's got my logo
on it yeah thumb screw deck super
awesome
so yeah check that stuff out the the the
awesome hardware sure train here guys
you can buy from either of our stores
Kyle and I are splitting the profits
from this so it doesn't matter whose
store you buy it from correct we will
both get money but there it is this is
of I by Brian aka
Marek Marek SOT Matt I still need to get
myrrh accent myrrh exit because we need
to talk to Tim but how is that ice
finesse if I remember critical I think
one time I said it and he's like that's
exactly right how Kyle said it no I
can't believe they first announced right
anyway it's it's on a high quality
tri-blend black so buy those and
hopefully there's two UH two colors
right it's two colors but right now this
is the only color that's going right now
there's gonna be another color what
about that one what it's on your site
well nevermind there's two colors
there's two colors I read them I read
John's emails oh hey maybe I'll check
your email it's us available in the
indigo blue right there yeah they're
cool double flavors and it has awesome
hardware on the back too I actually kind
of really like that tag on the back yeah
it's nice so there you go
do we need finally have awesome harder
merch big thanks to Brian for designing
that he did a great job Kyle's story is
also available bit with tech slash store
also has the awesome harbor truths that
we've just discussed I have a sale going
on the crystal RGB shirts sale get
yourself some cheap crystal $13.99 for
some cheap-ass Christmas Oh Chris looks
lower your standards do they stuff right
there yep fiction spinners and all that
good stuff and yeah hopefully don't buy
stuff during the show if you do we will
shout your name out at the end of the
show and it'll be awesome
and a reminder also that I am giving
away a really really nice computer right
now so that link should be in this
video's description oh can I enter the
giveaway ball you could I'm allowed that
would that would save on shipping for
sure you know I have like three YouTube
accounts that but triple nods yeah enter
with all of those but and this is a main
gear are one razor Edition PC it's like
retail cost is like well over five
thousand dollars this guy out I rise in
eighteen hundred X processor to a GTX
1080s an SLI with a full custom
water-cooled loop 960 a samsung 960
process D and MSI titanium the X 370
gaming titanium motherboard it's a
really really nice system so it's pretty
and it's been sitting in my garage for
several months
that adds to which novelty it's like
it's like storing wine in in special
wine containers Hall may have even
sneezed on it once or twice yeah just
gradually gotten more and more
overclocked on its own just that we
asked them if that can happen it just
gets quieter and cooler
alright we're gonna we're gonna have a
relatively quick show today mainly
because I have done very little research
on the things I'm going to talk about it
hey I have a new segment though it's
called SSDs nuts and I had a really good
idea for a lower segment get it with
SSDs and then that's I'll do it in the
future you guys I think it's hilarious
for now let's do tuned and rip the rumor
mill up there no that was every moment I
actually faced up hey but alright so
we're talking about us as these stuff
lead story here this is from PC
perspective story by Allen Mellon Tom
vrock is Intel's version of raid with
nvme SSDs and they have been sort of
teasing a bit for their ex $2.99
platform but in various ways that have
pissed people off in various ways
because at first it was like oh that's
gonna cost $500 for this add-on little
dongle that you have to plug in in order
to unlock it and it's only gonna work
with Intel SSDs only Intel brand SSDs
none of the other ones I go that's
stupid too but then like the Red River
happened and then V Rock never really
liked that we just never really heard
much more about it so this is the first
kind of furthering of the V Rock story
that I've seen in quite a while so I
wanted to kind of share it here but Alan
basically took V Rock in its current
state very unrefined and untested and
very like conflicting information that
he was getting as he was going through
his testing when it came to like for
instance what Isis was saying in their
documentation for their PCIe riser card
versus what Intel was saying as far as
what was available like you should like
you should be able to do raid zero but
none of the other raids
oh but Intel's said the other thing it's
it's it's really confusing button point
is if you have had say z170 Z 270 or X
99 or X 299 so now you've had the
ability to take several SSDs and nvme
SSDs and plug them in and put them in
raid configuration but those are all
piped through the chipset and the
chipset whether you talkin X 299 or z170
or C 270 only has the DMI 3.0 link
between the chipset and the CPU that's a
four PCIe gen3 lanes basically so it's
kind of like acting like a big switch so
if you were to do that basically you're
not gonna get the full speed out of all
of your SSDs in your raid configuration
because there's just they're going
through a bottleneck of the chipset
vrock promises to offer the ability to
rate up your SSDs direct PCI Express
connection to the to the CPU and make a
bootable array and we're still not sure
by the way the article doesn't really
have an answer for this if it's going to
cost money and what the actual
disposition of that dongle is all the
testing that Alan did at least as far as
I could tell he did without the dongle
and he did just with existing hardware
and everything and and drivers that he
was able to download off the internet
but he clarified some some terminology
like v rock which is virtue
right on see if you vmd which is a
volume management device which is sort
of Intel's nomenclature you can take the
processor will group up to 16 lanes of
storage or 4x4 into a single PCIe
storage domain and you have three VMD
controllers per CPU and then with V rack
you can actually boot off of one of
those but with V rack you can also take
multiple ones of those if you don't need
to boot off of them and start a stitch
them together or address them with
multiple CPUs so as far as the ability
to set up some pretty cool raid
configurations whether you're on the
high end of the consumer side or whether
you're on the sort of entry level or
interested in keep getting cheaper stuff
on the enterprise side it seems fairly
interesting so anyway of course the
article is very much more detail than
all my articles linked in the video's
description so check them out down there
but he have a couple different setups
he's in the ACS hyper M 2 by 16 card a a
little bit of information about here
about PCIe bifurcation which is a must
be supported by the motherboard it's
basically allows you to split C PCIe
Lane subgroups without the need for a PC
plx chip and that's what's is required
for the full amount of bandwidth going
to this card anyway though he goes
through the entire story here and I wish
I had more detailed notes on this so I
could rattle it off for you very quickly
but I don't so are all the PCIe lanes
that V Rock uses straight from the CPU
yes ok yes cuz I heard other random
stuff in the past but you'd like you
said there's a lot of misinformation
going around I had also heard like
depending on what kind of raid array you
were you were creating that would also
determine the price point of the
controller or if you needed a controller
well maybe a zero didn't require a
dongle at all but if you want to do raid
5 or whatever one in five so then you
have to you know pay X amount for a
dongle and you know or I think it was
raid 1 in 10 you had to pay X amount and
then you had to pay Y amount for a raid
5 or something like that
but again that was all very very early
right before the I'm hunting this down
in this story as we as we speak which is
probably riveting entertainment for the
people who are watching sure where did
it go it must be in the last page I'm
enthralled okay until I absolutely see
all right I'd have to be on the first
page I don't even know what the dongle
looks like sir picture I've only seen a
picture of one oh yes that's right let's
go babe even cable around it all right
so here's here I found it I found it
okay confusion and configuration with
the test setup because if you look at
the Intel vrock vac it says for Intel VI
pass-through you don't get raid support
stand-alone nvme based SSDs can
basically connect up to it no problem
until vrock standard right raid 0 110
support and you need a standard hardware
key Intel VR premium 0 1 5 and 10 and
there's a premium key right but then the
Asus says that you don't need the key at
all for raid 0 down here mm-hmm and they
have some pictures of the key and stuff
but then Allen went and he like this you
can also set the the the raid
configuration up at two different ways
you can do it in software from the
operating system using until our ste or
you can do it from the from the yeah the
bio so the the the option ROM as that's
loading once you've switched your your
controller over to RAID mode so he
basically he when he was trying to do
one like he was trying to set it up as a
bootable array and from from the BIOS
environment and it wouldn't let him but
then he went into oh wait no no Intel
says no great sport without a key but
ASA says raid zero is no need but he's
looking at this right here which is a
software setup but basically set allows
him to select raid 1 raid 0 or raid 5 or
raid 10 and he said he can select any of
those and all of them work Oh
with no dongle he says they all create
usable raised that report is bootable
interface is reporting that he's in a
trial mode but everything seems to work
except for boots of
maybe I'm a thing yeah so anyway once v
ark has enabled the bass allows you to
configure is directly notes a pair of
until six enter PS s DS can be selected
while the pair of Samsung 960 pros do
not so this goes goes back to the drive
support thing until stripes are supposed
to be supported samsung drives or not
however when he goes in here he's
actually able to set them up in a raid
configuration so yeah it's it's very
it's very interesting I read over this
article earlier today I actually did
read the article I didn't I didn't put
notes on the article which is why I'm
kind of scattered as far as going over
it right now but I found a fascinating
that's linked in the description you
guys should check it out v Rock is a
thing and it is there and we're not sure
what's happening next with it Allen made
some interesting first steps as far as
just testing out some various
configurations he was testing for
obtained until obtain drives 32 gig
Intel updated drives in and raid
together which were actually destroying
for samsung 960 nvme SSDs when it comes
to AI ops performance which is pretty
crazy so like octane there's like a lot
of really cool stuff behind and it's
like intel had to come out with opted in
memory and react look it's and I says
it's like a hard drive accelerator and
everyone's like no we don't want that
and it's stupid
yeah but the drives themselves are
fairly interesting and exciting and
hopefully we'll see more from them and
hopefully we'll see actual obtain drives
that we can just use anyway though if
you don't want to worry about whatever
is going on with Intel's nvme raid
support why don't you just use
Thunderbird because thread repair today
AMD launched the threader / support for
nvme raid basically in any configuration
you want as long as you have the ability
to connect up the drive to your system
okay yeah so there's there's been a
little bit of early testing on this
you're connecting directly so no DMI
bottlenecking are going to
a chipset or anything like that up to
six drives it says up to six drives with
raid zero one or ten okay up to six
drives with grade zero one or ten that's
pretty good is that's yeah it's not bad
at all yeah so yeah open for seven I was
really hoping you know I could get that
seventh drive in there but well I mean
whatever considering that the options
for adding drives with the riser cards
and you know the fact that you got 64
PCIe lanes with threader Bert yeah I
mean six is like six times four so
that's 24 at that point at that point
the only only limitation is your wallet
yeah so you're only using up like
bottlenecked by my bank account the only
using up like a third of your available
PCIe lanes with six of them right so now
I'm pissed and I missed it AMD Andy how
dare you give this to people for three
for free after they bought your your
stuff you'll never be good you'll never
be great if you don't charge people
money yes so this was we we briefly
talked about this on the show but um
there Bauer who's just becoming more and
more legendary with all the different
things he's accomplishing but he posted
a video about this like fairly early
testing eight nvme m dot two SSDs in
rates so this is also why I thought like
six might be a strange limitation cuz he
did it with eight an X 99 third person
so maybe this was maybe that's why they
made him take it back because well he
posted a video about naked yeah but um
he had eight samsung 960 pro SSDs or pro
M de Ville SSDs I don't know if those
are coming they are for them or what he
had the Asus hyper m dot 2 card and yeah
he gots diameter transfer speeds in
excess of twenty eight thousand three
hundred seventy five megabytes per
second twenty eight twenty eight gigs so
we need gigabytes per second hot damn
transfer speeds
pretty crazy sure yeah I'm sure now that
this is out there's probably gonna be
more more going on as far as people
trying out different raid configurations
connecting it all up and everything like
that but for now that's all that's all
we have to say about that it's pretty
epic though yeah I'd like to see how
that performs like a real world real
world scenario like video editing or
something yeah I mean for for anyone who
exists anyone who works with like 4k and
up video as far as like really really
dense video like that's this is awesome
to have yeah just as far as editing and
everything
um but yeah damn right speeds dimmer
sequential rams so I I would like
several of these I just how about I I'd
like to be de Brouwer let me just wear
his skin see what he sees well I mean he
gets all the phones a lot of this stuff
he gets this is pretty awesome but I
mean like this isn't it isn't too far
out of range
you gotta ain't get hit up a suits maybe
to get those hyper n dot two cards I
don't know if you can just buy those
over the counter yet or if you if you
actually have to get them directly but
yeah in any case all right now is the
middle of the show and in the middle of
the show we're going to do a brief
double segments we're gonna start off
with male I I was gonna have the male
lower thirds on here but you know the
show's chaos today so where is it right
man to man up I'm going up into man real
quick at the same time though kowelska
yes am first in what is that what's in
package number one I don't know who's
that from mmm looks like it's from
Amazon it's a store someone ordered
something from Amazon and had it set to
me meanwhile this is from Brian is it oh
is that mmm
okay this is for Brian this is an Amazon
room Washington I don't think I don't
know if this is the same brand ah got
you balloons oh really because you have
mentioned on stream a pump that use
their pump in there that you have at one
point in your life been a balloon animal
artist or a balloon artist is there
what's the official name for that
balloon is a Balloon Twister blue a blue
balloon it Oh see please make a gift for
you please make all the balloon things
on the next awesome hardware I'm sure
I'm not the only one sending you
balloons a loyal huge fan loved watching
you and Kyle Jerry Whelan thank you very
much Jerry are these two 60s I'm excited
about this gift the most because I don't
have to do anything but I can reap all
the benefits of watching Paul it'll
build a PC out of shyness alright I'll
have to check it out next week on my
half of the show Oh make make eight
different components and then build a
balloon pump there's all native here is
there yeah oh yeah okay so this is for
me or it's a balloon with a boner it's
very solid very solid balloon their
shirts and stuff oh maybe it is it's not
to be happy yeah oh that is him this is
a design yes this is brains okay I
didn't know he was named Brian but now I
can sent this a set of his shirts cray
cray this one this is like right before
we finally came through and started
American tourists but American tourists
awareness every time I do the vlog in
the channel actually just did a vlog in
this accent parsley the whole vlog no
hopefully you're just for like 10
seconds but this is awesome and then
what else is here I like the the what is
this well we had a good better the good
better best improved get better bit with
yeah Tim application line method is good
P method is better and the turd is of
course my trademark application I think
that was first first showcased in a
sales built the cell above the billeted
oh yeah the old turd man in the classic
these are great as well Brian makes
awesome
says it's a commercial sample which
makes me think it was probably sent from
like some merchants will see there's no
real name I don't not be an ad oh oh
they're more balloons from a different
person I don't know
maybe yeah well I think they probably
ordered them together but they that they
ship said ah so extra extra extra
balloons finally from Kelvin from
Wyoming we have one more Calvin Klein
thank you so kind of next time you get
the the Intel packages I I got another
one since then and I you saw the little
tab before I just ripped it open all
those fluffs came out Oh item for
upgrade kit for a cryo rig cooler
it's for your htpc or something for
upgrade kit type see what why would this
be since this looks Type C I think is
for like one of the this is low pro this
is 77 yeah that I what a weird thing to
send me out so you don't have a need for
that there's no inside joke or it inside
no I asked cryo rig just cry rig sent me
one of these for Rachel's built uh-huh
and I used it right I just don't know
why this would show up wait this is this
is is he from Kyrie yeah I think so okay
well I think Kelvin is from crier but
why would but they know my egg why would
this is my P o box I know that's strange
alright thanks Craig for I think I'm
pretty sure I'm pretty much all right
let's move on though nice guy to the
next brief part of this segment which is
our sponsor spot all right whoo that's
right it is getting towards the end of
the year which means a sponsor sponsors
are willing to sponsor even awesome
hardware so late school really knew what
a sponsor for today's show we're gonna
celebrate their there a deep cool
captain IX RGB
with some balloon animals all boxes are
hard here can you push the laptop back
oh wow that's a smidge that is a that is
a glorified penis pump oh I'll get my
actual oh I'm gonna need to go back to
the balloon actually the balloon store
is near here you know of a balloons yes
like is it oh it's like an industrial
party store where you go yeah oh wow
look at that
alright this is captain 240 x RGB white
actually comes in black and light comes
with an LED strip
yeah it's RGB now I know it's I know the
unit's RGB but what yeah there's an RGB
strip does the RGB strip fusion put
anywhere in your case probably well
that's cool is it there's a cable that
comes with it pretty decent paint job on
the radiator and has some pre-applied
Tim action right here one of the most
unique water blocks for sure I like that
you're holding a balloon I'm Bulacan
cool like yeah let's let's compare here
there's definitely reserves liquid cool
bit easier to get hit in the face with a
solid build quality actually I like the
tubing it's fairly flexible not much
kink it that's got it's got some nice
sleeve is leaving there on the tubing
and it's thicker some of the earlier on
one units at very thin tubing I'm pretty
sure that wasn't as I'm pretty sure the
center of the water block has RGB LED as
well if I remember correctly
yeah lights up in the middle is yeah
there's a there's a picture see oh yeah
I always forget to look at the pictures
yeah oh the fans are white too yeah also
right man actually the the frames not
just the blade blades are black
fanfare actually wait pretty nice this
is this is like what I would use for
like a whitetail if I do another white
build I might use one of these because
I'm sorry it saves you the hassle of
having to spray paint all the existing
 white radiators and stuff
nice-looking fans yellow I lacked your
fans and the fans are sleeve the kid the
cable on this fan has a really nice
black sleeping on it so it does cool
some rubber pads on the corners of the
fan I made this for you what is this is
a whoa what did that happen but you did
that so fast I didn't even realize you
were doing things I've been focusing I
would have been paying attention oh my
god this is so cool
you seriously what what these balloons
aren't too bad actually freaking awesome
let's see feel like I feel like there's
a whole side of you Paul that I don't
even know about see if I can remember
how to do a person I'm let's just see
this is why I should everyone oh no no
I'm inviting you to my Knicks birthday
party
why didn't you do this with my birthday
party no cuz oh wait yeah why do you do
this what what you have this ability and
you've not been doing this at my
birthday party every year
because this is why well it's the type
of thing that you don't show people like
yo it's supposed to know this about you
because then they ask you to do it all
the time and then eventually tired of it
because it's awesome that's been a while
well that's why you that's why you
charge them and you rake in the big
bucks I mean there's a price you
you got to value your time phone certain
learn the values you gotta cut things up
like how you can always like how you can
redistribute the air oh this tails all
gone now but if you just give them a
little bit okay see now I'm the opposite
of you when it comes to balloon animals
I will pop them
quickly information I can't even get his
tail back to normal Oh
nasty ass tail it's terrible legs I
start the legs that's ready Jesus Christ
damn it oh my god a snake you are a maze
out Kyle that's not a snake you're so
good yeah you do a snake how did you do
that
it's even got like you know snake tail
I'm sure there's snakes in that that's
how off track I response respond yes no
I mean I think it's fine
yeah yeah we've done the unboxing oh
yeah clearly RGB in the middle very nice
this I should also mention that the
Kevin 40x
custom 240 X also does come in black we
have a black one behind us as well we're
gonna unbox the black gonna my house
look at that a bit more standard I like
the light one I think yeah Salazar used
one of these coolers in this white build
white build a while back it might not
have been the captain 240 X is fairly
new but pop anything else scaring me I
don't like you know there are some
people who are deathly afraid of
balloons right yeah like phobia like
balloons obeah they don't like it
popping or whatever it is they get it no
I think about it but it's like that it's
like that anticipation like waiting for
it oh and the the squeaking noise then
there's just more I talk about it the
more I release I'm like creating my own
balloon phobia right now no it's not a
sweet release
it's just every time I happen to know
god what was that
we're not again what is it is that a
ninja
sure yes is that no that's how you gotta
sell it to the kids it's not a person
it's a ninja it's a ninja and the Kittel
I mean I wouldn't believe it yes anyways
I made you a pink and purple mist
seriously how did you even know how do
you still remember how do that is what
I'm surprised right now yes how do you
remember how to make like the dog I feel
like you've done the dog is very million
times something you'll probably never
forget but this is like I've never even
seen this he like literally there's so
many different like Lynda maybe it has
four limbs and a head and a body like I
can make a motorcycle and make him ride
it
what whoa whoa okay okay you gotta save
some of this for my half the show or
something cause half of the show comes
even got little like Woody's like
flipping me off like a screw you guys
little tendrils are foreign I do what I
want
damn so so is this one balloon or two -
yeah skills yo it's like I was I
remember it kind of how it went and then
I was like we'd know how does it start
yeah you got to start from the bottom
you start making the feet mix of the
Vega 56 or 64
alright well thank you very much deep
cool thanks sponsoring this half of
Awesome hardware we appreciate it
you're gonna go check out their stuff
wonderful peace they make great products
alright let's move on to some some
standard ass tech news standard s check
net secrete second name first off shoes
TSMC the Taiwan Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Corporation is going to
build the world's first three nanometer
fab in Taiwan Taiwan has quite a few
fabs they know they are there it's a
fabulous place it's gonna be built in
the Tianna a Tynan's Science Park I mean
that's in southern Thai
taijuan time an so there's like taipei
is is like north city time man I think
is South City I forget exactly but
anyway but it's potentially gonna be
built in the u.s. due to political
reasons it says however they opted to
keep their production capabilities
clustered in this science park where
they can better leverage their assets
yeah it's at least part of the
manufacturing machines will be provided
by a SML and netherlands-based company
who has recently grown a lot twenty five
percent revenue growth this left this
last year so yeah we don't have any
timelines for three and any of your
production it's probably not gonna
actually be available in products until
about twenty twenty-two
but it does say TSM she does say that
they're 7 nanometre yields are ahead of
schedules so that's good that's good
news ahead of schedule they they have
announced plans to enter insert several
extreme ultraviolet layers EUV layers f7
nanometers they also have a 5 nanometer
roadmap on track for launch in first
quarter of 2019 do we have any
speculation as to what the 3 nanometer
tech will be used for first iPhones
probably no I mean it's
they get all the cool stuff it's it's
it's hard to say there yeah you know
yeah processors of some kind
it's probably an educated guess to be
made there but yeah well we can dream
not today we're still stuck on the day
fourteen scatterbrain and miss okay
moving on AMD's RX vegas 64 better than
the 1080i in one game in four is the
seven better at this one this is so this
is for the seven Rex X 12 so silly
ordered a new game racing game but I
mean beating the 1080 TI by up to 23%
and 407 in one
yeah well good I mean one game but Vega
beating today's yeah in one game that's
why like Leslie at 1920 by 1080 look how
much better the Vegas 64 years than the
1080 TI at 1920 by 1080 even org Vega 56
is better than it in one game why didn't
they lead with that that would have been
more impressive rate that title that's
impressive to look at that look at frame
rate look at the 99th percentile frame
look look kids even behind the fury X is
getting less less and less impressive
yeah the the gap narrows a little bit at
2560 by 1440 so was there any
speculation as to why this happened why
why you do AMD cards I can give you a
really vague like ballpark sort of
explanation it's not very good for K
though 1080i comes roaring back
Dominator roaring back although still
loses so is it like heavily cpu-bound
percent game so is this game super CPU
intensive that wouldn't be my
expectation it's so-so
Vega has it's it's it's proficiencies
and it's proficiencies have a lot to do
with like memory bandwidth as well as
certain parts of the architecture that
I'm not not going to attempt to to
discuss right now but DirectX 12 is not
just it's not like there's just one
thing that DirectX 12 does and like it's
how good the graphics card is if that
one DirectX 12 thing DirectX 12 is a
library there's lots of different
features in DirectX 12 that developers
can implement in the games and some
games implement this feature in some
games implement this feature so what
you're seeing here as far as a7 has
implemented a lot of DirectX 12 features
that are conducive to good performance
with Vega and the benefits that it gets
from for instance having an insane
amount of bandwidth from HBM to memory
so this is a DX 12 game this is DirectX
12 I mean okay I'm not positive because
I don't know enough about it if four is
the seven can also be running direct
eleven that's possibility this might be
prot it probably can I mean if if any
other game from des directx12 is any
indication usually they can they can run
in either mode but um yeah this is
specifically in DirectX well well but it
is one of those things that goes to show
like there is like when you have a when
you have a hardware design that is
working closely with the software
development you know you can get a lot
more performance out of in certain
situations
okay sure that's this as far as I'm
gonna go there uh all right next up
GoPro they're still around they're still
kicking still doing stuff yep the hero
six has been launched today this is not
today this is actually on Thursday or
Friday last week I upon goes yep five
large five hundred dollars the here six
black there it is just shoot like what
eight K hundred and twenty FPS now no
but it can do 4k at 60 frames per second
finally 4k six that's that bet
first-of-its-kind it does two point
seven K at 120 frames per second and can
do 240 super slow-mo shots
240 FPS 1080p which is which is pretty
cool there it is got kind of a great
finish shot dribble that's all I have to
say you gonna get one probably not you
know I've never owned a GoPro I have a
hero for I got when it was on a big time
sale
Black Friday last year how much have you
used it I use it for time lapses fairly
regularly because like doing time lapses
with my more expensive cameras like my
my mirror less cameras and stuff like
that you know it takes a picture every
time it wait so it can wear out the
shutter so yeah doing those time lapses
where it's taking thousands of pictures
I preferred not to do it on that if I
can so alright now that I figured out
how to use the hero4 properly with that
so you just Wi-Fi to it with the camera
with your phone and you know set up the
frame and everything like that it's nice
to be able to have to set up and just go
time lapse then of course your editor
has to use it put it in the goddamn
video that he headed it is a sign aside
about it is this a low-key last year the
video turned for you your video turned
out great in it
it was one of those things where like I
I went through the whole like his when
he had it's when he had its my videos I
tied like he like I take them and I load
them up and then I like I might go
through and like change some things here
and there or whatever yeah I went
through the whole thing and then I was
like wait I never saw the time-lapse
yeah I never used it like it worked just
fine without it and I was like man I
said yeah right rendered it outs like
any time I do that and I import photos
and it's like a whole day time-lapse was
like sixteen thousand photos or whatever
yeah if he's watching this he probably
feels terrible Joe I'm just kidding
totally fine he was talking mad on
you before the show next up USB 3.2 boo
man I just I just getting used to 3.1
gen2 yeah just barely started to come
and do its own and now we've got 3.2
overshadowed by a higher number a higher
sexier number so it's been in
development and discussed some of the
details as far as the expected speeds of
whatnot this is the actual official
announcement by the USC the group of
Huddle's cloaked figures we presume who
my videos I differently that's their
secret chanted like Native American
hey that's the Native American groups
that presides over the USB why can't
they be Native American poem so what's
the problem with what email easy they
wouldn't be I just when I wasn't why do
you want to kill all the Native
Americans all I was picturing more like
it you know a high council in space
somewhere or something like that you
know like a like the Emperor like a
bunch of dudes who look like the Emperor
like around in the day
right that's what I did - and then you
had them then he gave me the the you
know the Indian chanting and I was kind
of like wow that really shows the Rose
left my suddenly they I imagine it yet
suddenly they have feathers maybe they
are in space floating on a satellite a
satellite that's connected to Earth by
only a USB 4.0 cable well that would be
a good way to do it because no one has
no one has that technology yet so no one
would be able to even know what if us
before point out cable looks like that's
true it probably this is visible but he
was performing ableism is invisible it's
fully invisible Wireless it's more you
evening 4.0 cables are wireless that's
why you can't see them yep imagine the
transfer rates that's amazing I gotta
get on the future man this board of
Native America is exciting I am looking
forward to it
alright but now we have to now we have
to settle for shitty USB 3.2 damn it if
you don't talk to a 4.0 someone it's
it's boosted up transfer speeds though -
2 gigabytes per second that so it
actually doubles the the bandwidth it
goes you're going from five gigabits per
to 10 gigabits per second there they're
showing actual throughput versus
whatever I don't care that article can
be confusing this is Tom's Hardware damn
it Tom I'm just so I feel like I feel
like theoretical throughput is usually
listed in bits and bit rate but whatever
um because it's 2 gigabytes it looks
like well I know it's 2 Giga bits right
yeah so Jen won so so so just to give
you a pretty brief history here of the
USB 3.0 because USB 3.0 came out it's
pretty cool and everything it took like
a year and a half to get motherboard
headers for it and then finally they did
and we're like you know that was a long
wait for the crappiest header on the
motherboard but whatever it works
gives you five gigabits per second
that's that's your bandwidth available
then they then they were like we have
USB 3.1 now at have almost 3.1 it was
actually standards updates so there was
like compatibility stuff like that
USB 3.1 so that's USB 3.1 gen2 actually
increase the bandwidth it's still five
gigabits the USB 3.1 gen2 is what
actually doubles the bandwidth mm-hmm
USB 3.1 gen2 there's actually that new
header for the motherboard and stuff
with which is pretty cool
ten gigabits per second there though USB
3.0 is what this is and that's doubling
from 10 to 20 ok so there you go I was
confused because it says 2 gigabits per
second in the notes
that's gigabytes per second oh ok Big B
Big B yes yeah so they're they're
dividing but they're dividing by 8
they're gone and they're also probably
showing an actual through throughput
rates rather than theoretical just
dividing that anyway um so at this rate
we can probably expect 3.1 to make a
scene make it on the scene in what like
3 years based on how similarly say point
1 yeah cuz I mean we still don't have
like I don't I own one USB 3.1 device
maybe two I just feel like it's it's
caught on really slow and so I feel like
there's more so there's more stuff
coming in as this did you see Dimitri's
video on hardware connects
about making your own you know USB flash
drive with it ESP Drive I didn't watch
it but this little m dot 2 slots that
you've just popped into making it a USB
Drive was it a Type C some of them some
of them work so oh he made multiple yeah
you used a few different devices and
compared them in stuff but yeah it's
hopping around coming around but yeah I
was kind of like I mean do you remember
when SSDs first came out and you realize
like oh I can get a say that a USB
adapter with it with an SSD and make a
really fast like flash drive right I
mean like man that's a lot you know an
SSDs were expensively you know I could
32 gig SSD was expensive so it's like
it's a lot to spend on just making an
external drive but then you realize
after a while like no it's actually
really convenient to have something
external that's that fast right so
anyway also they have to keep up and
keep competing with although they have
also crossover with thunder
so anyway there do you go finally last
story for my half of the show before we
move on my show we're happy we're
slightly shorter Habs this for today
partially because there's a big launch
coming up this week and there's a lot of
work going on for that but anyway one
last story here this is from NCI X and
the NCI except tek-tips crew has
apparently been dwindling I was not very
aware of this and now as of today oh
gosh this post to the video and he's
leaving so like there's no one there
anymore wait so who else left before him
like everyone is gone everyone like
Julia Jack yeah Jack yeah I so you can
you can tell when they left by going and
looking at their video history right so
like six days ago you go back one week
here's Jack's video Wow
so this s-someone happen within like a
week but I think it goes back a little
bit further than that cuz I mean like
wheels left a while back he left like
well er year ago it wasn't really on
camera much he was more behind the
scenes yeah so yeah Jack Jack left and
then I guess before that other people
left too so yeah it appears that their
team has been dwindling and now is like
pretty much gone and it Keys kind of
talks about a little bit about what what
what he might be doing in the future and
that he might be doing some videos they
might be posting like one video a week
now on the channel but yeah it's it
sucks for fans of NCIX
did they announce every time somebody
new left or somebody else would leave I
haven't had enough time to go back and
do all that research remember yeah but
my like but um I was reading some
comments and it seemed like Julia left a
while ago but I don't think she did a
signing I'll sign off or anything like
that and that really she
but interesting I'm sure there's more
details behind that that we're not
cheese rivey - but wonder who's gonna
eventually take hold of this you know
over 1 million subscriber channel now
that's pretty crazy yes in saying that
they there's over 1 million subscribers
there and that the challenge is going
away but you know and there might be
there might be more going on with the
company as a whole as far as the
management there and everything but you
know we don't really know any details so
we're not gonna I could say too much on
that but usually I always I was like
that linked to daily it was a mmm that
was punchy well put together yep we
never even attempted to compete with it
back when we were at new egg no never
actually we did we did but yeah that's
all from my half of the show no not
quite
we're almost done with I have the show
we're gonna we're gonna really quickly
go and see if anyone that posted any
comments and donation comments thanks
double thanks to any of you guys who who
did donation comments last week by the
way yeah I don't know if you saw but
later that evening I did the donation to
support Oh Riko
posted that on Twitter and ended up
hella money's ended up there was an
addendum ended up being about like four
hundred seventy five ish bucks that was
was submitted last week in donation
comments and I had promised to match
that so I ended up just rounding it up
and doing and doing a thousand I think
mine was and what you said yours was 475
yeah as writer I was probably around 400
so I think I did 800 total yes
definitely definitely some gains for
Puerto Rico there that helps so thank
you guys for donating to that alright
start with some donations for nb6 7 2000
regular here's 20 bucks his wifey sauce
says that hashtag it's always all his
fault
can't can't argue with that I mean jeez
after after today's show after every
show really
God not every show $20 $20 gets 22 at
least $20 every episode just to put up a
fight
that's the Lisa at least my wife can do
that seems fair
Scott syllabic $16.66 weekly
contribution how has the friendship
between you guys changed since you
kissed Paul did you call Kyle the next
day or make Halloween I didn't you can't
just call the next day seems way too
needy you know and then just then just I
don't think so I felt very just kind of
hung out to dry you know I just kind of
sat there waiting for at least a text at
least a text and it wasn't till like two
days later when you were like hey did
you run those benchmarks like nothing
had happened what I miss on Scott uh-oh
thank you very much Dewayne bond $5 I
have an FX 8320 and I'm thinking of
making it into a server and getting a
rise in 1600 for my main computer what
do you guys think I think that's
fantastic idea yeah if you should do it
you don't need a really fast processor
for making the server and residents 200
be a great upgrade for your personal
assistant see if see if you can
underclock the 8320 because definitely
if you run a little lower voltage if
it's the system that's gonna be on 24/7
might save yourself a little bit of
power yeah good idea
does leave jewelry $20 hey it's my
birthday so I'm spreading cheer happy
birthday guys thanks for the laughs and
info dance happy birthday
yep you're old ha ha joke's on you Fred
ranch ready $5 who kisses better Paul or
wifey sauce lol uh you know they're both
equally bad Vick I should remind people
that that was for that was for a
donation did if you're just joining us
Frederika hall kisses me frequently just
because he loves me that was for the
people
yeah go ahead and watch episode one and
one even one last week know last week
was 122
yeah oh it was last week that you did oh
yeah it was last week yeah this is my
house it just feels like it was so long
ago I know you're right it was 122 is
that good or bad I don't know just watch
that just watch the twitch clip that'll
explain everything yeah it actually
doesn't it's just it takes everything
every exact opposite Judah bees ten
dollars got to asus mg279q 'ls DVI hdmi
displayport but same result for the main
display GTX 970 bottleneck mmm doesn't
sound like that no no no I could do so
if you have both then you've switched
both to the main and it's and the
flicker follows so it's and that's
definitely not in the monitor the
monitor I mean work maybe no it needs
the port no I mean you could try
switching the outputs that you're using
on the card itself
yeah and that's still just kind of weird
I mean if if you're talking about a
flicker that's constant I hope you're
talking about a flicker that's constant
and not just Isis always flicks on and
off so so yeah there we go
I would maybe check your power supplies
going through the monitors to the
computers I've got like an old power
strip you're connected to or something
like that but that is a very strange
truck problem Ajay I think there's
something weird with your graphics card
yeah if it's happening on both monitors
whichever one is the main then I think
something's wrong with your graphics
card and maybe try using the integrated
graphics on your motherboard if you
don't have a spare graphics card to
troubleshoot with and see if that fixes
anything and start there but I really
don't know how to help you much further
until we have more information but good
luck it's just a process of elimination
as much as you can try to try to isolate
one thing and test it in various ways to
see if that's what's causing the problem
when they move on
yeah thanks jujubee's El Jefe reviews
right bucks sup ganas great
rasaan arctic panther oh they are billed
Paul any update on the HTPC of course
also I just swooped one of those sword
fight shirts now whoo
good choice uh CPC thank you thank you
progress is going well I actually really
want to get back to that though I've had
some detour now it's to do some
benchmarks otherwise HTPC updates yes
it's still in the works it's fully
functional right now as soon as arctic
panther has done that is my next project
to move on to and I did just get a digi
fanless and her max power supply to go
in that system so it's pretty much just
good good to go I just yeah I just I
didn't want to be doing that in parallel
with arctic panther and plus and plus
things keep watching hopefully after the
end we'll have a little bit of time
before holidays which is like in a month
right now anyway Omar Oh our five bucks
hi hi hi Omar I back right grant 45
bucks when I throw you my bank thought
someone hacked my account so I was only
able to send you $55 Paul before that
stopped a few weeks ago oh you're I'm
sorry Fred terrible person Fred but
thank you for this is just the kind of
behavior I'd expect from you
I'm disappointed hope you remember what
Kyle says and Kyle's half of the show no
no I love you Fred you're the best mad
sucker ten bucks should you build your
own system on the cheap or pay triple
with a puget build build your own I
would usually say build your own I mean
that's kind of what we advocate here but
you could pay triple if you value your
time more than your money yeah have
enough money to do that yep Grim Reaper
10 85 bucks how much does Tim or thermal
interface material degrade over time
wondering cuz my 4790k runs hotter now
than it did a year ago with dark rock
Pro and mx4 thermal paste depends on the
quality of the Tim but for your
situation I wouldn't worry about it for
a good three three plus years typically
speaking unless you've done like a lot
of crazy thermal cycling like getting
really really hot and then cooling off
but that would probably degrade your CPU
more than it would
Tim yeah I mean a replicating better now
than it did a year ago probably have
more to do with dust build up build up
and in the case and just then we're may
not being as much yeah it's dark Rock
Pro so there might be more stuff in
between the fins and stuff on there
that's keeping it from yeah cooling
quite as efficiently as it did before
give it a good cleaning and reapply the
thermal paste and see what happens
yeah I bet that would help a little
Tom's breads in the brims min Thank You
Tom's for the 55.5 5 Norwegian Norwegian
krone I read you've got a rock forgot to
order some spicy snacks to your peel box
maybe next time next time you know what
just to pro tip maybe send us some spicy
snacks that we could at least somewhat
eat because I feel like that would be
less less of a waste of your awesome
gift and more of a win for our delicate
palates dear finish off that devil's toe
know a little wifey sauce try it she
took a lickin was like that's hot as
 yeah
narcos for the 10 bucks I worked two
jobs so not always able to catch the
live show is there a good 500 dollar
three monitor setup keep up the good
work guys love the show with $500 $500
for three monitors I mean you're looking
at you know 100 150 dollar panels then
so 1080p probably 24-inch on the low end
like maybe 21 point 3 inch 21.5 inch it
can be done yeah sure you can do if
that's your thing
you want smaller modders but you want a
triple setup for 500 bucks but honestly
that I'd rather spend 500 on a large a
larger size I mean ultra wide if you can
get it I'm just saying if you're gone
gone freesync than maybe but yeah I know
this whenever I do like a larger size
screen that's still 16 by 9 but maybe 24
40 by 1440 the supports high refresh
rate and stuff like that I think that's
a better experience than going triple
monitor 1080 Plus game support for
triple monitor isn't always there as
well so something to consider but Dell
Dell sells a 34 inch curved ultrawide
monitor for $600 there you go 100 bucks
out of your price range maybe but
it's pretty close as long as you're not
looking for adaptive refresh rate yeah
if you can look for a precinct that
would be superior of course assuming you
have a ami graphic Scott Dilbeck there
at 10 bucks I'm a man of my word I said
I would donate if Paul made balloon
stuff on awesome hardware well by the
way did we get a total on the Puerto
Rico donation yes Scott it ended up
being a thousand for me are about four
hundred and seventy five ish for what
you guys donated so thank you all for
that and yeah that was sent over about a
week ago you know seven eight hundred
issue for me yep oh dude five dollars
thank you very much coda for your weekly
contribution thank you sir very
consistent sir uh Sharif dear five bucks
hey Paul some kinda love fiber a while
back got to keep it in balance Cheers
balance is the key to everything the
darkest for the five bucks I forgot to
mention Paul HTPC and if you can share
with Kyle for I will not be able to on
his side of the show HTTP see he's
working on it I'm working at or he will
work I'll buy Cala beer later - yes he
will Calvin Klein ten bucks
Oh Calvin is the one that does Evan oh
he did he does not work at grace yeah he
doesn't work okay he's the one who sent
you the bracket though I just got to am
for upgrade kits I mean I seen you might
need one so I set it out you know just
in case
PS would be cool if you forward it to a
fan needs it okay there you go well
alright thank you very very Thank You
Calvin I do have another c7 that's not
being used so now I could potentially
use that mount that on some razzing
and then yeah purple I'll give it to
offense hey purple I've fine but thanks
for hey what do you think of this image
I think you're right
dare I enter it into the URL bar didn't
work
oh wait it's because I think there's
there's a hair to put a space boom some
vapor obsessive ap is this this is nice
what is this me this is me looks like
you this is me vaping what is that this
is me do it blow in some O's where is
this from I don't know it was like your
creepy old videos that I thought I
thought those aren't supposed to be
accessible no they're not it's dangerous
how do they know you get access to that
I don't know
I mean it's just beeping so I like I
don't like that though it's like that's
pretty cool yeah I you're officially my
new creepy stalker congratulations on
that thanks purple I uh but yeah those
are some priests it goes nargis 10 bucks
donation for sale by that man a beer we
will every time we see sell we buy him
beer although we haven't seen it much
recently so it's not good
see yes see it's more visit us Emily
Emily Roland Roland's 50 Canadians
thanks for helping my build my beastly
machine guys couldn't have done it
without you you are very welcome Emily
thank you so much for the donations
Roland's and best I hope everything is
nice and done there in Canada yeah
assuming that's where you're from since
you donating Canadian dollar e-news
jujubes once again five dollars follow
up to my question power supply ax7 sixty
and strip our new tried swapping the
ports it turns on and off and getting
artifacts so he's any mantras getting
artifacts if it's happening on either
monitor but only one at the same time
then it's your graphics card yes it's
really you can be fairly sure that's the
issue most definitely yeah yeah but
that's all for donations on your half
alright thanks thanks for that one could
you be just some quick Johnston's before
I move on to cows have oh yeah do I have
a couple here Brandon Randall like it
thank you very much Trevor paid up a
BIOS flash of shirt I've lots and we've
got one for Daniel day-lewis no Daniel
Davis sorry who CPU cooler for women and
stay positive sure thank you very much

in from California got the 11 ounce mug
that is on sale nice all right what for
bargain thanks all right
andrew from missouri got the 11 ounce
