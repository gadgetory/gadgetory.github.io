Christmas break video I imagine lots of
you guys are on Christmas break right
now and I wanted to join in the fun but
first to clarify I am NOT taking a break
from making videos you should still see
videos for me in the next coming weeks
as December winds down to a close let me
bid farewell to 2018 but in the meantime
I want to do some Christmas break II
type things like playing video games and
then I also have some some gifts that
have been preferred by benders so I'm
gonna do some unboxings of these real
quick no tech in here just some things
that vendors send at the end of the year
to celebrates working together
throughout the year and then of course I
also have this giveaway system so I'm
gonna start out actually by doing a
quick announcement of the winner for
this system which was given away during
the charity livestream that we did about
a week and a half ago now this system
would cost you about a thousand dollars
if you were to buy all the parts and
assemble it yourself and actually did a
video on the Assembly of this so you
guys can check that out with the parts
list as well if you want to potentially
build something similar to it yourselves
but it features a risin 5 1600 X 6 core
processor with 12 threads and asus rog
Strix b 450 - i gaming mini ITX am for
motherboard 16 gigs of Corsair Vengeance
lpx ddr4 3000 memory a Toshiba RC 100
480 gig m2 nvme SSD and EVGA geforce gtx
1070 TI superclocked 8 gig video card
and EVGA 500 BQ 500 watt 80 plus bronze
rated power supply all installed in this
Rio Toro CR 280 Mini ITX computer case
and it's very nice system windows is it
salt on it as well so it's ready to go
for whoever the winner happens to be
let's pick that winner right now by the
way if this winner doesn't respond in 48
hours I will pick a new winner so you
guys can follow up on Twitter where I
will be potentially announcing that new
winner but hopefully this winner
responds quickly drawing winners for
anyone who entered there were twelve
thousand four hundred and fourteen
entries in this giveaway drawing is
happening right now and the winner is
Peter Peter was entrant number four
thousand two hundred and ninety three he
is from Minnesota and he has 48 hours to
respond to the email that I sent him
just moments ago and claim his prize if
he does then Congrats Peter if not I
will pick a new winner and maybe one of
you guys who entered that contest when
it was ongoing has a chance to win let's
move on to my presence though
there
let's start off with this box right here
which I have a sneaking suspicion what
is inside I'll be honest I'm kind of
suspicious that I know what's in most of
these gifts because I've seen a few
other people get them but that doesn't
change the fact that it might be edible
and I'm kind of excited for that there
we go
this is from Asus it says Happy Holidays
2018 from Asus Republic of gamers
there's a card and peanuts so this
actually is an insert from the
chocolates company where this originated
from with cafe au lait and much so it
looks like we've got some green tea and
we got some milk chocolate and we have a
lovely lovely bow Happy Holidays 2018
from Asus oh look at that that's
actually pretty cool so these are all
chocolates from Bella Sophia chocolate
we got hazelnut and chocolate in one and
then we've got matcha green tea I'm
guessing these little egg-shaped ones
are gonna be kind of green tea and
they're really pretty I'm I'm almost
scared to eat these what okay 21 I'll
say Oh save the pointy looks I'm gonna
give one of these a shot up that's the
green tea one definitely green tea right
there although it's very good green tea
can be kind of hit or miss with me but
this is this is actually quite decadent
do you wanna try green tea I mean these
are very nice chocolate Bella Sophia one
more chocolate piece here this is the
milk chocolate before I spoil my lunch
and a big thanks to Asus oh I feel good
Jackie no milk chocolaty but there's
also a hazelnut going on where's your
delicious all right I have put these
away for eat the rest thank you very
much Asus for the lovely Christmas gift
next gift here is from Nvidia and Nvidia
whenever they send you something you're
on their vendor list you get some emails
just say hey you got a shipment coming
from the video and it can often be
something really fun like you know
addition graphics card or something like
that I already again know what this is
because I saw Kyle open his but that's
not at all to detract from the
thoughtfulness of the gift because
NVIDIA has once again sent us a lovely
Christmas ornament
so as curious that this might light up
because Coursera actually sent an RGB
Christmas ornament last year which is
kind of cool
this one doesn't light up but you know
it's keeping things classy we've got the
NVIDIA GeForce r-tx logo on one side and
then sort of a snowflake design on the
other side with with graphics cards
sticking out presumably arc GX graphics
cards and then in between the graphics
cards you actually have a little env
link sli bridges for the next generation
of cards so I'll be hanging this on the
tree adding it to my other Nvidia
Christmas ornament and thank you very
much Nvidia for sending this over well
it will it will be a part of the family
tradition when we decorate the tree for
years to come final vendor gift here I
already opened and I kind of already
broke so I'm sorry I didn't record when
I broke it cuz it would have been at
least you know fun to include in a
failed video or something like that but
this is from MSI and fortunately the
thing that I broke they sent two of them
so I have a backup as well as possibly
the opportunity to fix it with maybe
some superglue but we actually have a
bonus item in here as well let's start
off with this elongated box here Joe
thinks it might be a wand which which
would be cool I mean the magic MSI wand
it's a shot glass sets No so we have a
set of shot glasses
we should I guess maybe we should
integrate these onto the live show these
are featuring all of MSI's new series of
motherboards which are M eg m PG &amp;amp; M ad
so over here on the on the M eg side we
have ma G's mm MSI extreme gaming we got
the godlike as well as the ACE for mpg
which is performance gaming we have just
mpg by itself as well as the edge and
then o we also have the what is that one
ah that's that's gaming plus right there
gaming plus and then finally damn it Joe
sneezing and then finally over here we
have the ma G tomahawk which is actually
a very solid board here
in a slightly less expensive board from
MSI so thank you MSI for the shot
glasses we'll add them to our shot glass
collection and perhaps take drinks out
of them on our live show in the future
and now we have these two which again
are identical as far as I can tell
except for one that is broken thankfully
I chose the unbroken one to open right
now so I can end it like everything was
fine here we have lucky the msi dragon
oh no this one's broken too
oh no this broke off lucky
what an unlucky thing to happen that's
right this can be repaired ok and just
stick it like that there everything's
fine so here's my other lucky dragon and
this this one actually unbox took it out
I was like oh cool then I was putting it
away I had it in this side like that and
then it's got two little horns on the
top and this took a tumble and landed
upside down and then the horns broke off
in cough - it's ok poor Joe Joe's sick
he still came into work today so rip my
lucky dragon phone holders they are
still functional as phone holders though
that's that's really all it's made for
lucky holds your phone like that was a
good job
the only thing I would save functionally
the only downside to these phone holders
is that it would block if your if you
had a connection on the bottom for
charging or whatever it would kind of
block that other than that that was very
cute so yeah I guess I guess he could do
it like that - so he could hold it lucky
could hold the phone for you while you
watch a movie that makes sense and then
plug in from the side
very smart Joe perhaps that's that's
what the way these were designed oh it's
got the outline of it look how
perceptive Joe is taking advantage of
the fact that he can see the bucks is
from his angle I can't putting a fax to
people our next package arrived a little
late and if I look different ignore that
ignore everything but this is from ZOTAC
so I want to say a big thank you to my
friends over at zou tech Ginny and Boo
and I am pretty sure this is something
that I can eat which I am excited about
because
kind of hungry this open packaging is
very confusing
aha there we go so we have happy
holidays from ZOTAC gaming this was made
at the MEC Ultra holiday Factory a
special ZOTAC cookie look at that comes
individually wrap I believe this is an
Archie X series grant yeah one of their
new Archie X graphics cards which which
looks just delicious
Oh cellophane packaging here and there
we have it heizo tech RT X xx atti I
imagine this is an amp edition amp
extreme and triple fan cooling as well
as some RGB lighting going along there
as well but how does it taste
I'd say the only thing that's missing is
a backplate but it does appear to be a
very power efficient model as it has no
supplemental PCI Express power
connectors taste-test though I guess to
sum up my review of this ZOTAC Archie X
xx atti cookie it's very good it's quite
delicious
but I'm hoping that the ray-tracing
performance might improve when they
release a patch in the next month or two
okay guys I have one more package here a
late arrival this one from Corsair and
inside we have several other boxes so
here's what was included in the box it
is a corsair copy kits we have a Happy
Holidays card with the Corsair LL series
fan on the front thank you very much for
the warm holiday greetings we have
coffee
of course the RG bean mix from madrenas
coffee with vanilla dark chocolate and
blueberry this coffee will of course
increase your organic frame rates
improve your natural boot times and is
flavored with sweet sweet RGB you'll
want something to drink out of so we got
a nice Corsair mug with the corsair fan
i've got fans on the side that's pretty
awesome a coffee grinder included since
this is of course whole bean coffee
course there wouldn't you know presume
to send us pre-ground stuffs happens
that would be horrible so we got a
coffee grinder and then this which is a
really awesome coffee press actually
as you can see coffee press inserts
there and it's actually insulated and
everything and it's got the corsair logo
so that is really cool too thanks for
the coffee kit Corsair Merry Christmas
and those are the vendor gifts that I
have been sent this year thus far there
might still be stuff arriving I'm never
100% sure who's gonna send me stuff and
I never expect it but I'm always happy
when it arrives so now I have given a
gift it's kind of with the giveaway
drawing I have received some gifts so
Christmas break videos going quite well
I think there's one more thing that I
want to do on my Christmas break

I'm gonna do when I post this video I am
going to start a live stream on my
twitch channel which is twitch.tv slash
