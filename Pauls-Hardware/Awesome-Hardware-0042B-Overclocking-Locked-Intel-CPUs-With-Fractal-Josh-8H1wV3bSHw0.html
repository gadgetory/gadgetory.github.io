toes we're staring off into the distance
where you got your three feet forward
brick wall okay I think I think we're
life to both hello everyone and welcome
this is awesome hardware this is episode
42 and this is side B second half of the
show so you know sound yeah there's just
muted your mute I might be delayed no
nothing's meet it's okay we should be
good sorry just okay make sure nobody
wants to mute no sound shut up okay if
you want to watch the show muted we

this is again the second half of the
show so if you're watching this in the
future on YouTube then check out Cal's
half the show the first half for you to
- a it's on his channel
awesomesauce news network awesomesauce
network this episode 40 TV so the name
of my channel because I want to tell
people the URL so I switched it so that
it works it'll redirect you if you got
some sauce Network okay
what social club where you spelled your
name right or was that no that's rocks
they don't speak of that okay this is
our weekly show we do it every Tuesday
evening at 5:30 p.m. Pacific time we
stream to twitch TV / awesome hardware
and we've also been streaming directly
to YouTube as well so welcome everyone
who might be watching us whether you're
watching on twitch or you're watching on
youtube fabulous to have you all here
and josh is here in case you didn't
already noticed that yeah I just got the
notifications that we went live oh good
yes we're very live
Josh from fractal is here Thank You Josh
for joining us thank you for having he's
gonna be providing running commentary
and this show sucks no I did the wind
show how much happier I was I think
there's so much more professional yes I
did the wind show before is even the way
each other it was is okay because I was
gonna say is this must have feel
somewhat akin to that cuz you're in the
garage yes where my garage and when a
syndicate we're a little dungeon so it's
still kind of a trap II type of place so
that's part of the charm where was that
what was that does back of the old place
with the red wall background alright
good stuff alright um guys we're gonna
run through some announcements and that
kind of thing first off if you didn't
already know I have a giveaway going on
right now for my 200,000 subscriber mark
on YouTube you can win up gtx 980 that's
over on my channel pulse hardware and
that is always go to you it's not a TI
it's just a 980 but it's still very good
card that's open through through
Thursday at noon so if you guys haven't
already feel free to enter if you didn't
enter Kyle's giveaway he's also doing it
to ana.k subscriber giveaway for an r9
390x that's over that's over Kyle has
already picked the winner usually missed
yeah and he'll be announcing it after
the show right yes after the show so
I'll be tweeting that so correct who
knows maybe you won that maybe maybe
you're a lucky winner anyway we are
still asking for submissions for awesome
hardware logos so if you guys want to
send those in email them to Kyle's
awesome Hardware rules awesome harder
rules at gmail.com I just gonna call
this out real quick and Rizal did bring
up the point that Kimberly will not be
entering your giveaway because it's not
980ti absolutely 980
more she has a higher chance that
everyone else always ordering one of
those clutch purses with LEDs on it that
just says no needy TI lifestyle I bet
you could fit a 980 TI inside when it
was LED purchase overclock that
guys if you would like to support me or
Kyle and what we do we both have stores
where you can purchase some merchandise
t-shirts we also finally have awesome
hardware stuff including an awesome
hardware hooded sweatshirt with the
standard awesome hardware logo we're
gonna be doing a new logo too but this
one has the one that you guys maybe know
and love for
for quite a while that's on Kyle's store
awesomesauce network.com slash store my
store is stored a pulsar net I also have
that hooded sweatshirt for sale I also
have some new stuff with my updated logo
with the thumbscrew on it and everything
so I've got some shirts and hoodies with
that with it and I have some $12 no
they've corrected ok and they have some
sale items that I'm clearing out some
inventory system $12 shirts and some $25
hoodies if you guys are interested in
those there's only a few left
very limited inventory but check that
out and I still think you need to make
your head into a thumbscrew I'm just
gonna keep drilling you with that idea
until you make it happen
drilling keep drilling you there's souls
is watching go ahead and surround you
like drilling you okay thanks so from
now until Christmas if you order stuff
on Kyle alright or my store and you
spend more than 50 bucks uses the code
over 50 on checkout and you'll get 10%
off the senior citizen discount it's you
get a coupon for Denny's you get a free
Grand Slam or moons over my hammy new
you never go to Denny's you end up at
Dennis it's not that was any other
something you default to yes one last
thing to mention is that if you guys are
buying stuff for Christmas and you're in
the u.s. at least if you purchase by the
18th which is Friday December 18th noon
the 18th is on the 18th 18 if you order
before noon it will ship out on the 18th
and you should get it before Christmas
okay enough with the announcements we
are all done with that yay one quick one
person sorry yes said need more zippers
I'm thinking we need to rock that
back to the 80s you need something cost
some hardware parachute pants
parachute pants hmm like the buttons
though I like looks like I like velcro
me a full denim jacket denim shirt
acid-washed jeans I think they were
referring to a zippers on the phones
that were coming out with hang that was
I thought that was just velcro the
thumbs are violating the thumbs are in
development we'll call we're gonna be
we're gonna be doing some real-world use
case scenario testing of the thumbs at
CES I believe stress stuff
I don't want to know how those are
benchmarked no uh screams this doesn't
taste like candy I've lost track of
everything that's going on Cheers
that's what I want to say cheers Julie
guys welcome to the show thanks for
joining us we didn't do a beer trick
here in the first half of the show but
I'm drinking this ballast point to piper
down which was wreckin recommended to me
at BevMo and it's quite good so far
Scottish ale I've got some Fat Tire
always a good choice solid drinking beer
how's drink at that tank Josh is
wreaking a roofie cocktail that I guess
so earlier I've completely closed the
tab that had my all my notes for the
show in it let's just wing this
let's do this friggin if there's gonna
be a fair amount of winging this
stuff happened this week and guess what
we don't give up but news the lower
thirds there should indicate that we're
gonna talk about some tech news here so
let's do that
so it's good when the hosts have to
refer to what's on screen right now okay
yeah that's well no that's that's
charming
it's true oh hey cheers Paul in chat I'm
a propel a bombs also known as living
John cake welcome welcome
I'm jealous of your wife you must need
some delicious food that you cook for
her I see I had to finish that sentence
I was just dropping a bomb on the ball
okay
um Andy Andy made an announcement this
week er was that today I think it was
today which is still this week so we're
good yeah it's still this week GPU open
is aim these answer answer to in videos
game works so there it is indicated by
this little icon here what's not very
open by the famous Gordon hung on PC
world and basically what this is is kind
of the answer or a sponsor an
alternative to videos game works and
videos game works is
I feel like in videos game works there's
there's kind of two sides to the story
one is the side that in video would say
was is like we do game works and we work
with game developers to make sure that
the games when they launched or polished
and you know everything works right now
that kind of stuff at the same time some
people have accused in video game works
of being more exclusive and not perhaps
working with the other side
AMD so that you know sometimes you have
walled off features where like you can
only access this if you have a Nvidia
card or something like that yeah so GPL
weapons gonna be working fair on both
both teams it's supposed to be more open
so that's usually the response that him
that AMD has for Nvidia when NVIDIA has
closed standards like CUDA or something
like that
AMD comes and says like oh we work with
open CL and it's open and you know
anyone can join in there and you don't
have to pay licensing fees with that
sort of things so from the principle of
that I stand behind them right and II of
course has dealt with some some
difficulties lately when it comes to
their market share with GPUs and all
that kind of stuff so they've definitely
have some an uphill battle when it comes
to adoption and stuff but Andy's also an
established company they you know they
have the PlayStation 4 and Xbox one they
work with game developers and that's
this is this is not something that's
like brand new brand new I think this is
something that they're kind of renaming
and relaunching I think to some degree I
think the name GPU open is also like
they're rubbing it in video space a
little definitely yeah definitely I
think this is this is a mindset that's
gone back for quite some time my back
when in between being a system
integrator and doing what I do now I did
Hardware reviews as folks say a lot at
the time on like 3d software and 3d
applications and you know obviously
Nvidia had their 3d vision which was
very I guess proprietary right it was
you know their glasses select monitors
you know yeah they're the drivers all
that sort of stuff certain games and
then AMD had there was AMD HD 3d which
is more of an open sort of platform I
could work with with different things it
didn't have so many restrictions on and
I remember was on conference call to
media I went to they're more closed
proprietary which
they didn't like that terminology they
see it as more of like you dimension a
quality-control thing like you know we
know what pieces go into this we can
control the experience that comes out of
it whereas ambi had kind of gone into
more of a look at adoption fazer I like
more players more options more different
ways to do it so yeah I see that that's
it's been that way for a while and in
videos like that has nothing to do with
money is just about the QA and the
quality we think about that you're
winning yeah and I mean if you want to
if I'll take in video sign just for the
sake of argument here and if you look at
stuff like their development of g-sync
which is a closed standard it's in video
exclusive and you have to have a g-sync
monitor and Nvidia graphics card but
they were able to bring the variable
refresh rate technology your dog is
tweeting my dog your dog has tweeted
that we're all wearing pants everyone go
checked everyone go follow at nori
hardware on Twitter not yet on Instagram
but soon she'll have an Instagram
account very soon we're told she's live
editing the show as we speak
the correction or we were wearing pants
yeah that doors closed for a reason
she's been wrong before
mm-hmm I forget what it was that Segway
scene was the victus seamless uh
yeah Nvidia was able to launch g-sync
far before a pretty significant period
of time before AMD was able looking out
with competing the hardware and the
g-sync experience is a good one so
there's that granny give some pay more
money for it well it might be a little
bit chicken v egg right like a bit you
know inviso got there somewhat closed
version out does AMD really have a play
to come in and do their closed version
people like know if I'm gonna do that
I'm just gonna go with in video whereas
if you're kind of second to the market
do you need to be more open and willing
to work with people to keep that open so
anyway I'm I'll kind of be keeping an
eye on this of course this is gonna give
developers unprecedented access to the
guts of AMD GPUs and the direct access
to the GPU is something that so you're
going to scroll down in the article
something that has
it's apparently a level of access the
developers have had in the past so
that's the way this is subscribed here
amy has similar bits and pieces in
addition to packaging them up is going
one step further and opening them up the
inner workings of the register set of
the GPU that enables developers to do
neat tricks or get a performance boost
and as a stark contrast to the way game
development is traditionally done anyway
so this is still pretty early again this
is just an announcement they're not
supposed to be kicking this out for
launching until 2016 sometime but
somebody keep up with all right indeed
let's move on to the next story which is
this guy again this guy something I
wanted I we talked a few weeks ago about
the wu-tang clan and yeah we talked
about the wu-tang clan and their album
that they that they came out with a
Shaolin or what is it called
could this album's wouldn't mind buying
and shelling a perfect person go ahead
yeah what's fun at Simon Shaolin is a
wu-tang album that they made that nobody
has had access to and instead of
distributing it they decided to make one
copy and sell one copy to the highest
bidder and then that person would get
access to the music they could not
resell it they could play it for people
but for 88 years it's basically locked
down and no one else can can view it
there was a Kickstarter that people try
to funds to to buy it but that failed
and then basically it was bought by this
by this d-bag
Martin shkreli really um she's buy a
vowel um who this old just rolled the
world with his purchase of exclusive
wu-tang album now if you guys don't know
who this guy is there bud
he works he's a pharmaceutical guy he is
fairly notorious even within the
pharmaceutical industry which i think is
quite an accomplishment
ya know you're gonna try for that yeah
but he for instance has been dubbed
demoted
most hated man in America by the BBC
because he price gouged AIDS patients
and kids with kidney disease he is a
hedge fund manager turned comic-book
villain and he took I think he he took
that he bought the rights to that
medicine and then they jacked up the
prices
seven eight thousand yeah it's not a
ridiculous amount his excuses like oh
we're doing that so that we can invest
money in research or whatever but this
guy
Lauren farm douche like someone asked
him to point at the biggest douche in
the world right here my name is
estimation is just a massive d-bag he
does live streaming actually tuned into
his live stream and I first pulled up
the story cuz it was like hey he's like
teasing that on his twitch livestream he
might play the album but then I went
there and like he does live streams and
he talks about like stocks and all that
kind of crap and he's not gonna do it
he's just doing it yeah attention to
himself you're just stupid
I feel bad talking about him but my
apologies to anyone and I remember when
we when we brought the brought up the
story of the shell and album last week
before it had been purchased now we I
remember was like okay the only person
if they're not like a super nerd that's
just like planning on sharing with
everyone as soon as they get it then
it's gonna be like some really rich
prick and just wants it just show off at
whatever parties he hosts and his fancy
pants mansion and everything I said that
week applies is this guy yeah it's like
perfect it's exactly like it's already
written in stone yes now whoo tang for
their part has definitely expressed some
mister some some second thoughts about
how this all went down they did not
don't know think of that they did not
know who he was when they were going
through the finalization of the deal and
whatever that they had to do is to
million dollar deal so you know I'm sure
they don't farm they smoke weed yeah but
they since then they've kind of been
like actually this guy's a dick hole but
there is a way out there is a release an
album of them covering the first album I
mean is that what that would skirt the
contrary here's the thing here's here's
a funny thing from the comical fidelity
injury that exactly I really wanted to
point this out this was tweeted earlier
earlier this week
forget the two million dollars this is
the most interesting part of the whole
deal between I think you've seen this
part alright so although the buying
party may release the album for free or
play at listening parties during that
time the buying party also agrees that
at any time during the stipulated eighty
eight year period the seller made
legally plan and attempts the seller
being mooting planning temperature to
execute one heist or caper to steal back
the once upon a time in shell an album
which if successful would return all
ownership rights to the seller said
hyster caper could only be undertaken by
currently active members of the wu-tang
clan and/or actor bill Murphy with no
legal repercussions hey Wu Tang and Bill
Murray
like we saw what happen in Caddyshack
there's gonna be some explosions oh yeah
I mean you saw what you did with the
Gophers so this is already this is this
was earlier this week and this has
already expanded beyond this here's a
billboard article someone has already
written a script for the wu-tang clan
slash Bill Murray heist movie you know
the Gothic rat that's coming in this
year yeah that's a dedicated wu-tang fan
named Jordan van Deena has penned a
script to try to make that happen his
version of the story a successful heist
is necessary to stop Donald Trump from
becoming president Kim jong-eun Michael
Jordan and Justin Bieber make
appearances Morgan Freeman narrates the
script should pop up here but I'm just
here drinking some tea I would see that
movie hell yeah wu-tang clan and Bill
Murray infiltrate the mansion of some
douche bag and steal the album back
Morgan Freeman narrates Justin Bieber
okay so just a favorite appears and is
instantly killed painfully mmm the
album's rectum exactly together with the
chainsaw
Justin you gotta fit the album your ass
screams no surprise an album sideways or
anyway anyway yep that's all I dig about
Josie yes hey about this is a developing
story we'll we'll bring you guys more
information as as events warrant I
suppose all right directed by Michael
Bay okay
or Justin Lin mmm more than that all
right here's a text about article about
host this week overclocking locked Intel
skylake CPUs is now possible and has
been tested that's right
this was done this is actually the
article I think as far as the pure next
stuff that kind of grab my rock so even
though it's even in asrock motherboard
that they're showing here so as rock yes
via BIOS update has enabled overclocking
with non kaise CPUs so that means that
even if you don't have a G 32:58 you can
you can overclock other CPUs so here for
instance is a CPU Z screenshot of an i3
6100 running at 4.7 nice now please make
note of a very important distinction
here between typical overclocking and
the overclocking they're doing here this
is uh this is base clock or B CLK
overclocking so notice that the bus
speed here is at one twenty seven seven
four three point seven so you can't
overclock as freely as an open it's
really an openly as you could with just
like a pure um whereas the multiplier is
still at the standard three thirty
locked case q processor and there are
some funny things that might go on with
BC okay overclocking as opposed to just
pure multiplier overclocking however
with skylake the BC LK is actually
unlinked from from several of the other
buses within the system so it doesn't
affect as much it will affect your
memory speed for example so your memory
might run at a wonky speed and that can
sometimes lead to instability depending
on what type of memory you have
depending on the IMC and your processor
but upshot any any lock unlock any
locked skylake processor as a vet for
asrock as of this BIOS update can now be
overclock using this method that
includes all the way down to like the
sixty sixty-five dollar Pentium G 4400 G
4500 G 45:20 the i3 6160 363 2060 460
500 and all the non
case cube processors basically and the
results they found from overclocking
that core i3 I think we're pretty
impressive yeah oh yes right I'm right
on part even despite all the the
wonkiness that you described earlier
with like the memory clock speeds and
stuff I think overall the performance
gain you get is pretty much on par if
you were to overclock the multiplier yes
so if you look for example here the
fourth bar down here is the 6100 at
stock speeds giving you a result of 23.1
with sigh soft sandra versus a soft sigh
soft ensued but at 4.7 gigahertz big
surprise there is a massive leap putting
it ahead of the 40 for 30 and the 6100
with even higher frequency memory or
just running the memory faster at 3000
in Cinebench again the single thread
speed is what you should be looking at
here look at this the 60 with how much
does the 6100 cost I don't know off the
top of my head I'll look it up it's
probably in the hundred and 20 to 140
range I'm guessing but single thread
performance is beating the crap out of
like an 83 2125 about 125 yeah and it's
just it's very it's very nice it's
something that I think a lot of people
wish intel had kind of like AMD has kind
of more been forced to do and allowing
overclocking all the way down their
product line and something that Intel
did kind of throw us a bone wits with
the G 32:58 but the G 32:58 is a
dual-core not hyper threaded processor
and really runs into some limitations
when it comes to just games or
applications that require more than two
cores or even something to require four
cores where you can even run it on the G
32:58 so I'm excited about this I kind
of want to grab a 6400 which is the quad
core that's clocked pretty low I think
it's a 2.7 gigahertz or something and
see what kind of performance you can get
cranking that up because I mean saving
50 60 $70 on the cost of a processor but
still being able to get that kind of
performance is pretty compelling yeah oh
yeah and this is even for the high-end
users who are buying like core i7s and
stuff instead of getting a core i5 60
all right instead of getting like the
unlocks Q or
you've locked yeah the unlike you you
could just get the locks you and
potentially get the same performance for
less money so so yeah I don't I have no
idea what Intel thinks about this sort
of thing actually be kind of curious to
know what their official stance is on
this I mean ASIS or as Rock is able to
do it which to me means that all of the
other motherboard manufacturers will
also be doing it within the next few
weeks probably that's that's usually the
case it trickles down like that here's a
thought though I didn't really ever have
any future near future plans to buy an
i3 until this came around so maybe oh
yeah yeah maybe this could be resurgence
oval or yeah perhaps perhaps Intel sees
it as something of a bit of a bargaining
chip for people who are looking for a
lot of danger the Russell's boards Jeff
well it's cuz he's excited about oh
you're lucky not overclocked processors
it's wrong with you know I'm not gonna
GPUs like that well no I mean I think
the you know obviously we've seen stuff
like this before we're also you find
that sweet spot right it's like there's
a surge or a run on that level of
processor so yo obviously there's stuff
Intel could do about it but if it's
moving product right why would they yeah
so that's true anyway we'll keep an eye
on this and I'm sure there's gonna be
lots of people grabbing these and kind
of trying them out and see what kind of
performance you can gets work queue
thank you I just was before he put his
head on my shoulder no see that looks
forced this is a Paul I love you so much
my shoulders naturally jagged and not as
comfortable as cows Jake those spikes I
had surgically implanted terrorists
let's play Deus Ex sorry Oh like world
of warcraft they have these like
shoulder coverings in anyway I'm getting
too far off topic let's move on to our
next topic
dear God brace yourselves bring this up
as a star Star Trek fan hmm and I don't
know if you guys have seen this but this
is the Star Trek beyond trailer which
was posted
yesterday and if you guys haven't watch
this I'm gonna play a little bit of it
here but you're not gonna be able to get
the audio notice do you like to dislike
ratio for free try gives you an
indication for a triple-a movie here
they're like you know a top-tier movie
from Paramount's with an established
series behind it that's a pretty
substantial amount of dislike this is
worse than a second Batman vs. Superman
trailer
Batman's Ben Affleck so if you watch
this preview the whole thing is backed
by sabotage by the Beastie Boys which is
a song that I like but I heard it here
but I don't like it and I even liked it
in the context of the first Star Trek
reboot I feel like it was well used in
there along with some Nokia product
placement which I thought was weird I
don't know how I remember that no Mac I
swear but yeah this this one is just
it's so like the action punching like
like one-liners and and I don't know
there there seems to be a lack of
substance I think is what came from a
lot of people and quit catching on the
franchise yeah part of the reason might
be or what some people are pointing the
finger at here which I feel like comes
up at some point the this is this movie
is produced by JJ Abrams but you might
also know he's been working on start our
Star Wars so it's actually directed by
Justin Lin which is shown really briefly
early and probably probably just so the
director Fester furious and was fast and
furious which indication of what's going
on here it's made almost reeks like
they're trying to make the movie appeal
to a wider audience like Star Trek is
seen as too geeky so they're like hey
let's spice it up and make it yo it's
the minister yeah yeah yeah it's all
edgy and like I was saying it looks
like the trailer for like a new TV
series on the CW yeah it's such a teeny
boppers I think there's actually an oz
bottle in works 8 is like you know they
slam some Red Bull so that works so
that the villains Vin Diesel's they
 hit a Brody going around a plan
 mid knees look comes up he's
like I need a ten-second starship
well he doesn't mist off the whole time
he'll expect where's the best right all
right show of hands here who likes The
Fast and the Furious franchise wait we
should delay that who did it like
earlier oh yeah yeah the last ones gonna
cool crap I mean what is so hope though
haven't even seen the recent one so it
earlier yeah I did ok the first one I
liked
and then everything after that I was
just like yeah I have always really
really disliked the Fast &amp;amp; Furious
franchise part of it is probably because
I'm not a big car person and you're
small or person yeah well I have a small
car person well it's partly - yes I
won't go into the history of why I'm not
a big car version and everything I'll
save that for a future episode but like
I just I've never been a big car person
then I felt like fast in the Furious was
like explosions action and car porn and
but even still it made sense of the
context of that movie this yes pulled so
far out of its normal realm okay if you
want me to dive deeper for my critique
Fast &amp;amp; Furious the original fast and
furious was Point Break Point Break was
also ripped off from a lot of other
movies well you know you know that we
really seem Point Break yeah it's
terrible yeah so the original I saw the
original fast and furious I immediately
hated it I immediately went on rants
with people that Point Break and how
unlike you actually can apply it to
point three anyway so let's not be this
about me hating fast and furious but I
wanted to at least communicate mind I
was surprised when you show this trailer
to me right before we started streaming
and stuff today it was how many like how
they're trying to appeal with humor as
opposed to like the drama or the action
- I mean obviously there's action but it
seems like they're just all the lines
they say like you said they're
one-liners it's like they're like haha
like kinda funny but not cause perfect
yeah where it's like this isn't the Star
Trek even for the reboot that we're
familiar with really and it just I feel
like for a trailer like this when you're
talking about Star Trek or Star Wars it
you trailer should give you goosebumps
and not make you go that was kind of
joke which was all they used the entire
day dad joked the out of these
trailers okay
it just seems it seems so forced like
okay so we slap the Star Trek name on
another movie and sell some more tickets
the things they'll still make money of
course cuz even people that are gonna be
pissed by it are gonna go watch it to be
pissed off and so ya say to their
friends something that we never do so
yeah I I heard some rumblings about this
accident watch this trailer until
earlier today but I immediately saw what
people were saying about it and again
this is this is a trailer this is pretty
early on
so we're jumping to some conclusions of
course but I I don't know I'm less
excited for this movie that I use for
the reboot and even for for the was the
second one called into the darkness
heart of darkness harder and I think JJ
Abrams spindle has creative fluids on
the Star Wars movie that I'm looking at
so close to each other I'm spent
and honestly if we're gonna be fair to
them you know you can make it trailer
look like whatever the hell you want it
to look like maybe this is just one
really poorly edited trailer the sad
thing is maybe this is one of those
trailers like all the best points of the
movie work in this trailer that's the
case like dear God because I've seen
some really good trailers just some
really bad movies so it's like if you
can't pull enough out of the movie to
make a good trailer yeah there's not
enough of a movie then yeah you that
that leads to some probably gonna be
disappointed in the long run anyway
though alright so I wanted to talk about
that a little bit when it the hell is
this alright one more new story this is
the new FAA rules that are requiring
drone owners to register this ordinance
by February 19th this is a survey this
is a survey what does that make me aha
oh sorry face yes
time for sarge find Oh three musketeers
Edition sword fight with three people
and don't know how we're gonna do this
we make it our swords crossed I'll just
tell you guys why you're both wrong okay
there you go josh is gonna be the
ultimate arbiter
so four sword fight then we usually take
a somewhat controversial topic and we
take opposite sides of it we try to
argue those those sides for this one
we're gonna start off by talking about
these new u.s. FAA rules require
requiring drone owners to register their
drones by February 19th in the waive the
fee 30 days oh yes like a five-dollar
fee - right yeah there's a there's a
five-dollar fee involved they're waiving
it for the first 30 days so everyone be
sure to jump on that early any drone
owners who are 13 years of age or older
I required to register and if you're
under 13 years of age you're not you're
not out of the requirements your parents
need to first thing there's gonna be a
bunch of six-year-olds own and pretty
high end drones if all the dad's like no
it's my kids might wonder be sorry
failure to register can result in a
hefty penalty civil fines of up to
twenty seven thousand five hundred
dollars criminal penalties up to 250
grand in three years in prison
they say that they intend to focus the
FAA says they intend to focus on
encouraging compliance through a know
before you know before you fly public
education campaign backed by some
manufacturers retailers and local law
enforcement right put out on PBS on
Saturdays it's new to know what when
when the air time is like the cheapest
and no one is watching
I'm sure so um here's a question for all
of you guys to answer I'm opposed to
some chat uses reverted unfettered
devices yes I did what's wrong with
unfettered nothing's wrong with that
just notice that you used it I like to
have unfettered access to using the word
unfettered okay so this question is
pretty straightforward is any level of
drone registration needed because
because there's different there's
different degrees of this this one is
specifically targeting drones between
the size of five to fifty five pounds I
think you look at these like half a
pound baby Jason yeah from what we saw
earlier it was like the wide roads it
would be under this weight except
the super tiny micro drones that you
could never fly outside because they
couldn't combat the way branches
typically don't have cameras this it's
like a video if it if it runs into a
mosquito in midair they could probably
win okay hmm
so anyway the answers here are yes rules
from the FAA are appropriate
yes but the current rules are an
overreach they're too much maybe we need
something more in between or no everyone
has the right to unfettered access to
drones and drone accessories I think I
misspelled accessories sorry about that
um got unfettered I did have a better
October in properly
all right so um how you want to go first
oh sure I'll go with the obvious choice
because I'm always right in these sword
fights which is yes but the current
rules are too much okay I do agree that
there is some level of restriction that
should be applied to drone users because
what like there are stupid people that
own drones and they ruin it for everyone
so there has to be some way to regulate
the stupid people obviously you can't
just target the stupid people because
it's impractical because if I got them
with drones you could target them with
droves possibly the irony but
essentially you know one bad apple ruins
the bunch right so of course we have to
do this it's like I'm control it's like
you know Josh and I were briefly briefly
talking about this but I think the
degree that they're taking it to is a
bit far I don't know why that they would
I don't know why they'd have to charge
five dollars I mean even if they're
giving you a 30-day grace period or
whatever to actually register your drone
if it's like they're trying to make it
accessible and they want everyone to hop
on board I don't know why there has to
be because they have to pay for all the
people are gonna to hire to track this
year yeah exactly so it's like eating up
more resources and it just seems
impractical the fine i think is pretty
outrageous for not registering i mean
maybe that's that's appropriate if
you're doing stupid with a drone
you get caught or whatever then yeah
three years in prison for sure but just
not registering your drone like let's
say some dude accidentally forgets you
know whatever whatever the circumstance
I think that's pretty harsh with a
twenty seven thousand dollar fine
involved I mean I don't know I think
they're taking it too far there I think
what it is
kind of like they're amping it up to
almost be a scare tactic to just like
really like force and fear people into
signing up and registering their drones
but I think it's a little bit
heavy-handed and yeah I think it's not
that I think it's gonna work anyway okay
yeah Josh do you wanna do you want to
choose one of these and jump in hmm sure
I'll go with the know everyone has a
right to an fettered access you just
drones and drone accessories you know
here's my thought first off how are they
defining a drone is it a remote piloted
vehicle is that to some level autonomy
what's the difference in their
definition between a drone and a
radio-controlled airplane which those
have been around for years there are
already restrictions to a certain agree
with those you know you can't fly I mean
within you know airspace of a you know
an airport things like that I feel that
it's just too much the government
registration and but honestly though I
think that if I'm taking this angle on
it I'm gonna fight the part of like how
they define it it doesn't need to be
this restrictive at all its way too
restrictive I mean half a pound that's
basically everything that's out there
maybe I'll even go a conspiracy theory
okay we got Amazon lobbyists trying to
free up the freakin air space for their
drones to come in and deliver products
it's just honestly it's way too much
overreach I can understand the reasoning
behind it that they've gone way too far
so that's my patent answer not what I
truly believe but that's the stance
I took god damnit that's right well Paul
before you before you go on with yours
again comrade bunny and check if you
click on his link I think it's pretty
amazing what he's showing here although
the drone the net drove yes so he's
saying the Japanese have this already
figured out it's pretty awesome what are
you doing I'm tweeting hey I'm tweeting
you tweet phonetic so I didn't see this
the Japanese are you so yeah a net room
it's actually catching a civilian drone
in midair so the Japanese are using
larger drones to capture smaller drones
right with big Nets I feel like that's
that's pretty badass we're like a big
whale size drone to come in and capture
a bigger drum that comes in and scoops
Tamala
something like that I I think that's
pretty funny just do that let's do that
all right so wait which which which one
am i are you would have to go yes the
rules the FAA rules FAA made up or
propria here's why both you guys are
wrong the drones are dangerous okay
drones can be used for nefarious
purposes and we've already seen them
used to block aircraft when they're like
trying to fight fires we've already seen
them drones popping up everywhere when
there's events like high-speed chases or
something like that or even stuff that
happened recently here in Southern
California which I want to dive into but
I think what we what this really is
about is personal culpability personal
responsibility and forcing people to
register their drones even though the
the repercussions might seem steep as
far as the fines and everything that
they do look at the vines that you get
for like running a stop sign or
something like that fairly minimal
things killing a person yeah telling a
person it's like really really hefty
fines you get for tip why not
kill someone yeah but but they set these
high fines as a deterrence people
because it's like wow that's a pretty
big steep you know fee that I'll have to
pay if I do something like that I think
that the FAA and the circumstance is
just trying to go about their job
they're trying to do their duty to
protect the citizens of the United
States from improper drone use and
without rules and regulations such as
these then we'll have drones everywhere
well counterpoint I say that no we don't
know that yes I am yes I would hell I
want you know the other aspect would
also be it's like these rules will
enforce nothing how are they going to
police this it's only gonna be after
something has already happened right
there's no active kill switch on the
drone there's nothing they can do to
prevent drone issues from happy it's
just once you do it a twenty seven
thousand dollar fine I think it's more
like after the fact if so let's say
there's a fire or something and people
are flying drones up to get aerial
footage to the fire to post on YouTube
or something like that and you know
you're not supposed to do that or you
know sensible people shouldn't do that
because you know you can't fly planes
into new it's just something that we
experienced a lot in the pet over the
summer when it was really hot but if
you're flying your drone up there you
might think to yourself if it's not
registered I'll fly it up there I'll get
some footage if the drone crash
Falls or something like that happens I'm
just gonna book it and you know maybe I
lost my drone but you know I'm okay
whereas if the drones registered and
there's a serial number on it or
something like that something
identifiable and you fly it somewhere
you shouldn't and then it gets shot down
or it gets caught by a Japanese larger
drone with the net or something like
that then they can trace that drone back
to you and say you specifically you
because this drone is registered to you
we're doing this in an area where you
shouldn't and then they can come back
and do whatever is but see what's what's
crazy though is that only applies to
people who are actually in the system
yes because doesn't this also create
like this underground black market now
for drones like where you go on eBay or
you go on you know Craigslist and you
buy like a registered drone to a fake or
you know a fake person or and then now
you can have free range you can do
whatever the you want and no one
can ever trace it back to you or you
just don't register is like register you
know they give you the steep fine for
not registering right it's like the how
the hell are they going to know it was
yours to come after you because you
never registered it right unless they're
getting to the point where it's like
firearms and there's like a background
check in the store has to register your
drone to you yeah in which case fine do
everything at checkout piss everybody
else off okay a kid you know like an 18
year old like hundred bucks to buy a
drone for you
yeah this is gonna kill my drone was
stolen last week
yeah exactly yeah yep so I mean how easy
of an excuse would that be it's like my
drone crashed I couldn't find it so I
still got the remote but somebody else
could just you know pop the frequency
and run it okay um I don't have the
energy to argue further but also wrong
you know we wear you down no you're
wrong it's also because I tend to agree
more with the air equip the points that
you guys took so let's see what what
people thought well we actually play
even in split I'm surprised as many
people said yes the rules are
appropriate you guys must have been in
circumstances where drones caused you
great trauma I think the reality of it
is there are idiots out there it
up for everybody like what yeah what
happens with everything there's morons
out there and those those aren't the
responsible drone owners those aren't
the people that are gonna go out there
and buy some sweet-ass drone and they're
in it for the Hobby it's like your idiot
neighbor who wants
you stupid and crashes it in your
pool party or you know and that and that
kind of creates the face of have
received yeah drone users oh every drone
user is like a reckless team
because this this and this happened no
one ever like reports on the stories of
look at how responsible this drone user
was because if you're responsible and no
one's gonna give a it's not Newseum
exactly there's a guy with a drone out
there who just uses it to help old woman
across the street that's all that they
do with that drone and does the media
report on them no no because of the anti
drone Lobby but you know we need we need
the NDA than the National drone
Association I'm very familiar with the
NDA to to create to have a strong
lobbying influence with our Congress to
prevent any of these drone laws from
going through well if you think about it
like I wonder how much of this is like
it's a Lac lobbying because the drone
markets pretty fractured right much a
smaller startup type companies
especially now there's no I mean the big
guys are like what Boeing Raytheon I've
been doing government contracts on the
commercial space none of those guys are
the money to lobby this type of thing
there's no a collective face that I'm
aware of of the drone community that's
large enough to represent a unified
front so you're right Josh I agree that
drone legislation should be written into
the Constitution so that we all have a
constitutional right to access to drones
bingo the amendment 97 okay we're gonna
leave we're gonna leave the potential
correlation at that and move on to the
next topic before we get ourselves in
trouble all right
here is an article that was posted
earlier this week by Jason of Angelo who
was a he writes for lots of different I
don't know who he writes for these days
Forbes is one of them
Forbes is one of them yes this is a
cliff ski calm article I suppose from
the UK it's titled hi I'm from the games
industry governments please stop us and
this article is written by a game
developer who intentionally and
specifically at the very beginning of
the article says that they the things
that they don't do we don't make
free-to-play games
we don't have micro transactions he also
says that he is a capitalist much like
Josh
he likes making money do you where you
work of your capital exactly play GTA 5
he's not a big fan of government
regulation i'ma get rid of red tape kind
of guy I actually oppose tech tax breaks
for game development and I'm not a
friend of regulation but nevertheless
he's specifically talking well he talks
about star citizen a bit star citizen
being a space game made by someone who
made space came two years ago and
crowdfunded the money to make this one
the game is way behind schedule it's not
finished yet they just passed 100
million in funds raised and they do this
because the individual ships and star
citizen are for sale and even though you
can't buy the game and just play the
game straight up right now you can buy
ships for it as much as you want to so
he goes on to sort of talk about some of
the other online games that are out
there star citizen is a much more
legitimate one from our perspective as
far as it's an actual like PC game with
I mean theoretically of course if it
launches but you can compare it to this
game like ebony with this like chick on
the title that you click on and then
install the game as you started this
article is like whatever and then you
got them rooms are bed and then you got
what's-her-face here from game game of
war i've didn't Kate Upton who did the
game of war thing which cost 40 million
dollars by the way that ad did you know
that that ad campaign with Kate Upton
cost to see this shipped it to like
Mariah Carey that's like a yeah
second-string
Kate Upton decide to go the other way
but they say game of war makes a lot of
money the ad campaign cost of 40 million
but who cares when you make over 1
million dollars per freaking day well
that just is like they wouldn't spend
that much if they didn't see a return
ours yeah that gives you an idea yes so
we've all seen that ad so clearly it's
working basically because of the
gameplay we like to exactly I really
pause that at the end of the university
so big block of text here example of a
game
achievements page and basically what he
wraps up by saying is that game makers
right now particularly the game makers
who are making games that are widely
paid widely played on platforms like
mobile devices which are easily
accessible by lots of people and they go
about getting more people to play the
games by doing stuff like massive ad
campaigns and Kate Upton but also that
they use techniques to get people to
play the games continue playing the
games and also investing techniques
usually it's large to big huge massive
tracts of techniques through your face
yes to get people to play the game but
also to continue playing the game and
also invest in micro transactions and
one of the things that's in research
that they've discovered about these
games it's not necessarily that lots of
people buying little things here and
there is what makes these games money
it's people who have addictive
tendencies one guy drop it a thousand
people who are into gambling who who see
something like this page right here with
all of these got achievements on it who
have OCD or something like that who's
like I need to fill out every single
every one of these needs to be the EP
done or something like however much
money you need until it's a done
you could call much like maybe buying a
shark card to get a yacht I wouldn't do
that anyway I digress yeah yeah it's
pretty nice ok so anyway how does this
all tie back into a certified argument
well let's go ahead and go over and talk
about the actual straw poll here which I
post is a chat for you guys which is
should the government step in that's
kind of what the article is suggesting
as you might have noticed from the title
which is like hey governments you step
in to handle certain things that has
been shown to be detrimental to people
so just never mean such as gambling
which is regulated yep and I think
rightly so I think government regulation
is necessary in some places show you
government step in to prevent this type
of thing from happening
predatory microtransaction based gaming
practices should this just be stopped
not necessarily stopped by people saying
you know what I'm just not going to
that are missin interplay tore anything
but stopped at a level above that where
it's like no you can't do this because
it's against the law this is all so
cleverly positioned against the first
strawpoll sword argument Fah should step
in exactly should really Stephanie we
can't necessarily argue argue all three
points here because the third point is
just joke but yes or no I don't know
does it do either of you have a strong
opinion on this one where they just
rollin just go first since I went first
last gosh you don't know what the
to say yeah okay I think there needs to
be some level of regulation on any type
of commerce in that vein actually if I
may interject really quickly you're
wrong not to say that you're wrong but
did shoot this event I meant to say this
as I was introducing this was that this
also reminded me very closely of what's
going on right now with FanDuel and
draftkings mm-hmm saying online betting
stuff well anybody mine owns unicorn
which doesn't like a lot of the east
bets these sports board eSports betting
words are hard okay yeah I think I don't
know about government involvement I
don't know how much that would really
solve what's going on if anything it
seems like it just makes the practices
more predatory and creepy you know as
people try to find workarounds for
technically I didn't do that
I don't know that that's the answer I
think there should be some level of
oversight whether that's a private
committee or something but again it kind
of comes back to like you can regulate
gambling it doesn't keep people from
gambling if people have addictive
personalities they're still gonna find a
way to gamble it's like how long drugs
hasn't made people stop doing drugs now
that these are direct correlations but I
don't think that the government stepping
in is gonna solve anything okay
and I guess I'll have to argue the
opposites and say yes the government
should definitely keep in our games
instead of stay out you know open our
business yes we we should not be allowed
unfair
access to these predatory
microtransaction based gaming practices
someone needs to step in and I think the
government would do a great job because
honestly gambling is a problem and this
this is essentially gambling in the same
respect that you are you are spending
money for you know a chance to win
something and I think that it is
destructive it's an ongoing problem with
our society and granted I'm not saying
that people should just continue their
gambling practices and let the
government intervene you should find
help yourself or hopefully you have like
a support system or family or friends
that can help you with that
but for those there are lots of gamblers
that have this problem addictive
personalities or OCD that are alone and
they don't have support systems like a
lot of us are fortunate to have so I
think there does need to be some level
of regulation involved in this otherwise
things gets spiraled out of control and
we're gonna see like way too many more
candy crush alternatives pop up and no
one wants that nobody wants that angry I
don't have a side to argue so let's just
go straight to the results top car where
is it stop I think it's time he's read
that so I don't get fat so most of you
say no the government should stay out of
our games few people say yes and a few
people voted for the FAA if it is easy
easy answer they say it was the way
we're handling the drone thing it's like
but but yeah i III feel like this needs
to go a little bit further before action
is taken well and I think one of the
problems is there as far as I know and I
didn't read the full article they're not
really doing anything illegal so that
gives it like a very untenable
legislative ground right like you what
are they doing wrong well it's not wrong
it's just kind of shady yeah well like
okay like they should be nicer okay fine
it shouldn't cost me $3 to get that
ribbon should cost - yeah and the other
thing is you know the government is
supposed to protect its people but to
what extent you know if someone really
wants to do something and what point
have you done enough you know at what
point does somebody have to take
responsibility for their own damned
action right
it is some poor schlub somewhere who's
addicted to something which everybody
has their addictions at some point time
you've got a whole NEX that's only way
you're ever gonna fix that you know
people don't get sober unless they want
to get sober
no matter like when they hit rock bottom
it's like it's rock bottom because then
you finally realize I need to get sober
and with this like preventing it they'll
find something else to do so if you're
doing it for the protection of that
person that becomes a moot point because
that person will find a way to fill
whatever hole they're filling with you
know the addictive personality well said
Josh all right yeah what who said unless
you fight my entire argument beforehand
I I think I don't think there's an easy
answer to this but there was a a comment
in chat that said simpletons are killing
gaming stuff supporting these types of
games we should just stop stupid people
from playing video games or from people
from playing stupid games that's true
all right um that's the khaki that
actually wraps up that actually wraps up
the planned content for my half of the
show but we are gonna open it up for
some questions right now so we're in the
Q&amp;amp;A section women chat so more homework
questions if a train leaves Detroit it's
just like her basic math algebra stuff
like my own she knew because we would
not help at all with that you had a
green tree or maglev or old coal
destroying the environment you socialist
Pig tournament no I like those maglev
trains um beeps headlights move in oh
that's the one we thought it looked like
an FBI agent like oh yeah the FBI is
going downhill just every five minutes
you like it's gonna kind of lids in
nowhere uh what did you have for
breakfast I had oatmeal and coffee I had
room service
canola bar you're Lola bar okay I don't
see any other questions why we want to
know that anyone going to PAX East ooh
asses fire hog it's a good question I am
NOT currently planning to go to pax east

when is PAX East this year last year it
was like the week after
CES as they always have
like chicks before that it was always
like wanted be like on Easter rather be
like a Memorial Day weekend yeah
plus there's packs out this year too
right Austin there was a dream house in
Austin oh is it awesome they're saying
to me other kids might like done I
clicked on Q&amp;amp;A but apparently it's tech
of the day after tomorrow they're Kyle
so you need to you need to eat your ice
cream cone we're so practiced okay hey
here's a little what games we play on
the regular oj5 pretty much is my go-to
right now that I'm still especially with
the DLC cut that dammit dammit not yet
yacht visitation on Thursdays all using
two timeshare look it takes hit time
then pink all people trying to sell it
to them hey how would you like three
online hours I might think that the
arguments you'd have over like where to
move it though it's like 25 grand every
time you repainted it what what
as long as I'm in the hot tub like 50
percent of time you can take it where
the yeah oh thank you we should
make use of it we're about you oh hey we
got a we got a donation from pup
shepherd thank you pup
hey thanks better than that do you think
paying for plugs and YouTube chat is a
good idea
he asks well paying for a plug in
YouTube chat I think it's a it's a great
idea
and everyone should do it we of course
we of course appreciate it when that
happens but it's definitely not
necessary I'm just telling me know
what's a dumbass where's the note to or
to Josh it's a new egg and NCIX they
have stock now they've had it for about
a week if you go to either one of those
sites search node two or two they'll
have it you're outside the US it's
getting to market as quickly as possible
I don't control that so they should be
showing up soon why would you do that
test Josh just to piss you why would you
even you did that on purpose didn't you
yeah you created an angle then reject
price seven thousand percent by wu-tang
to share me h geotech HJ otech also saw
some donation and chat that's him Rizal
is that Henry's oh yeah that's his
youtube geotech Thank You Henry zl-- he
said he's pre-ordering his awesome
hardware thumb police should you advise
him against that well we only provide
top top-tier products through dr. e
roars top-tier OU's all the best
only the best stuff what are you
religious beliefs I know when I into it
hey Dad I don't favorite stress test
shitstorm waiting to happen
favorites residence hall attics next is
a real question what's your favorite
stress test program for testing over
clocks I like a steel bench a lot okay I
think it's a pretty fair program it
doesn't like crank up the voltage on
wanting ly so like like prime95 does yes
and it's a very realistic test as well
aces real bench is a good one I like
throwing on 3d mark just the 3d mark mmm
test cuz it goes through several tests
it also does the CPU test in there oh
crap I'm gonna forget what this is I
can't remember the name right now he's
asking for CPU right yeah or just what
is the software suite that I use it is
64 88 a 68 is 64 burnin tests when it
comes to like full system burnin test I
think is one of the best ones because it
maxes out memory and CPU and a lot of
the other stuff in the system I get two
questions great job yep okay what person
asked if the new corsair their small
form-factor liquid cooler will work in
the node 202
I do not believe so I haven't seen the
exact dimensions on that but looks like
it probably too tall yeah I figured our
website it has the high three strictures
and there were to believe is 56
millimeters in height and I'm pretty
sure that thing is bigger yeah second
question someone asked oh when are we
gonna renew our contract with mega
Mahmood
so he gets more cases into Brazil out of
my area I don't I don't handle South
America or Latin America and last time I
checked we were working with them but
personally me speaking right now a lot
of our products seemed you know we get
the import costs in taxes going into
Brazil was pushing the price up quite a
bit but we're still in good terms with
them so if you want to see it honestly
for anybody in any region if you want to
see a product that's not there the best
thing you can do is hammer the shops you
normally buy for saying that you want to
see it because it all comes down to
supply and demand if your local store
sees 10 people asking for widget a
they're gonna try and find a way to
bring widget a in so if they have a
demonstrated demand they're gonna try
and supply that demand and then they're
gonna come to us or whoever you're
looking to get the product from so it's
honestly the best way you can do it is
just you know I guess I would call it
activism but you know go to the people
you want to they buy stuff from tell
what you want to buy ok question from
our friend sell on twitch chat are you
gonna be streaming to your twitch
channel tonight Josh ah
how many pcs do you have i well I mean
you have quite a few I have a few I
don't know we're gonna go to dinner and
then we're gonna figure out all that
stuff if there's a way yes if not the no
are you want to share are you accepting
reseller applications me personally
since I don't sell anything I personally
have not the best way to to start that
conversation if you do want to go that
route sales at frackle - design.com or
go through our website contact us fill
out your country information everything
they'll write you to the right people to
handle that and they can work out the
particulars with you it's more than I
can really go over here but the team
would be happy to talk to him find out
what you're looking for okay Austin
Pearce dropped a little donation in chat
Thank You Austin for that and he asked
how much would I have to donate to get
Josh to stand and pose with the nearest
non fractal case and take a picture
probably probably more than a dollar
yeah yeah
guessing well I don't want to take your
money like that that's true that's true
I think the nearest non fractal case is
always a m2 pro-pro Bank there which has
been slowly stripped of parts over ten
nations well to be fair people always
expect me to hate
like in other companies cases it's like
there's a few companies I don't care for
that's me personally and it's probably
not the ones everyone's thinking of but
more than anything it's like I'm also
the VP of Marketing so yeah as much as I
want to be explaining that on Monday
morning like why am i pimping out
somebody else's case because again
internet and out of context are
synonymous so yeah I feel like you share
a mentality with George from Coursera
and when it comes to that where it's
like whom I've actually never ever met
really yeah we never met Wow
well he's somebody from Coursera I have
a lot of respect for you
you know he tells it like it is he's
very upfront with stuff and he you know
help talk about other people's cases and
he'll give credit where credit's due
when it's necessary so these days well
it's so visible right like if you try
and act like you're the only game in
town and when I'm screaming or stuff
like that people like some are trolling
me like hey I'm looking to get in the
Corsair blah blah blah what do you think
about that Lee good if that's what works
for you I mean I can't make you like my
case and honestly there's situations
where maybe our case isn't the best fit
for what you want to do you know we
don't have a case the size like say the
900 D or something like that so I'm not
gonna try and talk you into something
smaller if it's not gonna fit all your
gears one of those things like go with
what you like and that goes for graphics
cards power supplies me there's a lot of
there's a lot of elitism on the
internet about you need to have this or
you're not good enough and that's what
pisses me off more anything else is you
know we keep talking about PC
master-race which if you think about it
how stuck up is that but it's like
you know we want to bring more people
into the community and then it's like
the second you hop into a forum you get
10 people trash talk and you're set up
it's not good enough it's like that's
not exactly a welcoming environment if
it if it accomplishes what you need it
to then good if you want to upgrade in
the future good and even like you know
the you know pet my CPC and stuff like
that it's still aimed it like it here's
how you can make it better and you're
submitting yourself to this because you
obviously want to make your system
better but you know at the end of the
day if it works for you use it that
that's the way it should work it
shouldn't have to be you're trying to
satisfy everybody else because you never
ever will I mean ask these guys you
can't make a video that makes everybody
happy you
can I show off a product that makes
everybody happy it doesn't exist so do
what makes you happy
unless it's flying a drone and then stop
registering the wrong and actually
you can you can actually pay for that
registration by donating five dollars to
this stream and all do all the paperwork
for you
Hilbert's drone under his name so yeah I
guarantee it that the previous
procedures in nature here's a question
add some ads ops key any chance this is
for you for Josh any chance they define
s will come in a blackout version or is
this a comment on future yeah okay so I
preface I cannot comment approximately
or may not be a development blah blah
blah blah that being said I have not
seen anything like that and that's not a
comment that's just me thinking however
I can tell you the whole reason that the
original blackout came into being is
because people asked for the same thing
as I say about the resellers go to our
Contact Us page there's a drop down menu
under type and product suggestions is
there if you send in what you want to
see there that goes literally directly
to a product developers so them hearing
it from you is more powerful than them
hearing it from me if I say hey I heard
five guys last night to say that they
wanted this versus five people actually
message him because the reality of it is
any of us go buy something how often do
you write a positive review about
anything online like I know you I'll get
around to you don't do it so more
anything that's seen that someone's
impassionate enough about that take that
extra step to take three minutes go to
the website and send it in you know kind
of echoes like there's 50 people who
probably wanted that and didn't take the
time to do it so you know it also be
cool is like just for me personally if
you guys maybe in some day in the future
if you offered like a blackout kit that
just came out with like all the PC ice
long as you that it so so okay not to
buy a whole new case if you already have
it let's say you want to convert it from
the traditional black and white - just
like blacking it out one day so yeah
another example of that inside the US
Puget systems handles a lot of spare
parts for us they choose to like sell
like extra side panels Drive tray so you
can make a blackout or a whiteout system
if you wanted to and then worldwide we
have one in Germany to handle space in
the rest of the world if you search like
spare parts fractal design
we'll pop up and there you can order
trays and side panels and stuff like
that they don't always have everything
especially on the newer cases they might
not have it but that's the way I do it
or if you email a tech support
department they can probably point you
in a directional place where you can get
that nice cool all right
Shepard yeah one more of those gonna ask
the same one pup Shepard thank you for
the dollar donation by the way take a
pup has nothing to do with why I'm
reading your question to Josh what funny
thing will you make Linus do next
hashtag pie practiced well first of all
probably be working with Linus in the
future he and I broke up about six
months ago oh yeah there's a whole world
of Linus alternatives actually hampered
tech youtubers uh honestly I don't know
um - I have been talking a lot lately
just like via text and stuff like that
as far as immediate plans I don't have
anything off the top of my head
honestly I've been have more fun lately
doing like pretty girls like these guys
and J and and Dimitri just trying to get
some more entertaining stuff out there
so I feel like god dammit if you have to
watch an ad it should least entertain
you if I'm if I want 30 seconds to your
time and I want you to buy my product I
want you to at least get something out
of it as opposed to you know some dry
boring overhyped marketing crap I
thoroughly agree coming from a marketing
VP don't trust marketing unless it's
mine I mean I ever I've grown up sort of
over time developing this like I don't
know this barrier to add natural
aversion like anything I see that's an
ad I'm like that's an that I'm ignoring
it that's an ad I'm ignoring it I just
ignore ads the only time I like really
appreciate an ass like well at least
they gave me a chuckle yeah that's
that's yeah that's what I kind of comes
to that do for me but um well and then
here's the devious part of where I'm a
shady bastard if it's funny you're
probably gonna share it more oh yeah
we're gonna see it but the reality is I
like doing funny but that's good
marketing yeah it's like good marketing
versus Lykes I don't know standard
marketing or spin
yeah so anyway I think we appreciate I
think funny ads are overrated now think
they should ever be made or produced or
shown I like the really traditional you
know just super straight-laced and and
kind of a little chase thing yeah a
little behind the scenes it is when Kyle
sent me the first cut of me throwing
Heather out of the car I watched I
thought it was good he watching he
thought it was good and my wife's like
it looks like she's trying to get away
from me and I'm like what and then I'm
watching like I can't unsee that like we
need to do some voiceover to make it
clear like she talked too much get out
of the car not like oh my god oh yeah so
it's like again it's something where
it's always good to have a few different
lens on it even like back back behind
the scenes like everything that you saw
how they're doing that like none of it
was acting to us all those real pain
that she suffered yeah she was she
didn't know I was filming she actually
hated you after that and that's actually
hated him before that that's part of the
documentary and occurred ongoing legal
battle okay I would love to sit here and
keep answering questions but I am
freaking hungry oh yeah maybe sounds
bomb yeah maybe we'll periscope yeah
not the entire time - maybe what were
they what if all three of us periscopes
at once Steve and I do the dual
periscope we cross our streams well
