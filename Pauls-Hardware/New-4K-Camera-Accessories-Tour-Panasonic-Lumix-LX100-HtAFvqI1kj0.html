five months ago I got this new little 4k
camera the panasonic lumix lx7 to review
it ASAP at the time you can't really
review a camera like this without using
it for a while so I held off at the time
being and the holidays rolled around and
that was a blur
then there was CES right after that
where I actually used this camera pretty
extensively for my CES coverage but
those were other videos not a review on
this camera
then there was February and March where
I'd Emily recall focusing my efforts on
the ongoing arctic panther epic
water-cooled build as well as setting up
a website for myself so I could have a
home base and a store so people could
support me by picking up a high-quality
shirt like this one link in the
description but what now well let's be
honest here I am a self-taught camera
person for the most part especially when
it comes to still photography so if you
want the full treatment I will direct
you to some real reviews of this camera
that I found very helpful in my personal
research so in the description there are
also links to lx100 videos by dave
dugdale the camera store TV and digital
revenue all very good videos today's
video is going to focus on why I chose
the LX 100 how I use the LX 100
specifically for video and I'm also
going to be covering some of the
accessories that I've gathered together
to kind of aid me in my one-man mobile
video production tasks but let's start
with a quick lx100 overview I think of
this as kind of a prosumer pointed shoot
with full manual capabilities for about
800 bucks US street price right now it
is small but it is still larger than
most pointed shoots it's got a producer
lens and it's got quite a bit of heft
this thing just feels really really
solid they've actually wedged a lot of
stuff into this pretty small housing and
it shares a lot with the gh4 it's kind
of big brother in the DSLR space vital
stats include a large 16 megapixel Micro
Four Thirds sensor the same one from the
gh4
although the LX 100 doesn't make quite
as much use of it it only goes up to
about 12 point 7 megapixels there's an
aspect ratio
Oh switch right up here that will crop
the sensor to your desired aspect ratio
but since I primarily shoot in sixteen
by nine
I really haven't used that a whole lot
the lens is fixed which is to be
expected in a camera the small but
you'll find a lot of praise and the
reviews for this configuration many of
the reviewers have compared this lens to
DSLR lenses that cost upwards of a
thousand dollars focal range is 24 to 75
millimetres main it can do pretty wide
angle with a little bit of telephoto
it's not going to do like a super zoom
but it can zoom in a little bit the
aperture can go super wide F 1.7 at 24
millimeters and it only goes onto F 2.8
when you're all the way zoomed into 75
it's really really easy to get a DSLR
comparable image with this camera and
that wide aperture and large sensor
gives you great thin depth of field when
you want it macro capabilities are also
amazing this camera can get in really
close for some nice detailed shots the
Alex 100 as previously mentioned shares
lots of similarities with the gh4 as
well including the Venus engine 4k video
recording at 30 frames per second and a
host of software features like the live
edge detection while recording which
makes focusing on the kind of smallish
3-inch 1024 by 768 LCD display a lot
easier it's also great for shooting 1080
at 60 fps
now that YouTube supports that and I
have done at least one video and people
said whoo it's nice the motion looks
really nice anyway I need to move on
here but there's just so many features
to mention the aperture dial on the lens
feels great it allows for manual control
of your aperture the focus ring which
actually works well and you can adjust
it while one handing the camera in fact
one-handed use of this camera is
surprisingly easy thanks to the
well-placed grips that are on the right
side thumb grip here as well as fingers
grip up in the front you have control of
the shutter speed up at the top here as
well as an exposure compensation dial
and then other controls which you might
not immediately find intuitive if you're
a DSLR user but they're not too tough to
figure out for ISO and all that other
stuff let's see what am I forgetting
it's got a viewfinder right here which
is okay there's are some reprogrammable
buttons here at the back but you can't
reprogram everything that's what a lot
of reviews also mentioned that we're
hoping for a firmware update to this cam
which maybe allows you to reprogram some
of the easy to hit buttons up here on
the top the camera does also have Wi-Fi
built-in with NFC for pairing this with
a tablet or smartphone just hold it up
to the side right here then you can use
your tablet or smartphone with the
Panasonic camera app to control the
camera and you can also do a live view
so if your cell feeing yourself you can
actually see yourself in that live view
since the LCD on the camera doesn't
articulate or swing up or anything like
that up to twenty-five thousand six
hundred ISO range for low-light shooting
built in time-lapse function okay I'm
going to stop now about the camera
overview because the list really goes on
and on so considering this range of
features answering the question of why I
bought this camera sounds pretty
straightforward right first of all I
wanted a portable camera because I'm
always too paranoid to take my Canon 5d
Mark to out on trips lx100 isn't exactly
a pocket camera but it's way way more
compact than a DSLR especially the 5d
mark ii next up I wanted the largest
sensor possible there's really no
substitution for the image quality you
get with a large sensor Micro Four
Thirds it's about as good as you can get
in this size range third the built-in
lens solution on this camera is
absolutely beautiful it has a wide range
of configurations and since I mainly
shoot videos about hardware I don't
really need the telephoto 24 275 is just
fine for me so add in the manual
controls and video mode another feature
that's really hard to come by in compact
point shoot cameras and the 4k shooting
mode which has allowed me to dabble in
higher res stuff and I knew the LX 100
was my camera as mentioned I got this
camera to take on trips and for
on-the-go video but I found it pretty
useful for some other situations as well
the size and the macro capabilities make
it great for grabbing quick close-ups
without having to pull my mark too off
the tripod and I know that I will be
using the time-lapse feature built in
here very very soon I did want to cover
some of the accessories that I picked up
for this camera as well starting with my
awesome 64 gig micro SDXC cards from
Kingston this is model SD CA 3/6 4 GB 64
gigabytes means I can pretty much shoot
all day at 1080 or at least be way less
concerned about space if I'm shooting in
4k I have a new one here because you
know one wasn't enough these are also
great for taking on the go because
they're waterproof shockproof x-ray
proof and temperature proof they have 80
megabytes per second rates which means
that they can handle up to 4k
by 2k recording 19 megabytes per second
reads means fast transfer times when
you're copying from this back to your
computer and the Kingston brand which
means these aren't budget knock-offs so
I can actually trust them with my data
and of course they do come with an
adapter here so if you're using a
standard SD camera you can pop them
right in if anyone has a GoPro our
action camera is similar to it made for
rough-and-tumble type work these are
absolutely perfect for that
also at Kingston's mobile light g4 USB
3.0 card reader which is very portable
and small and it handles just about any
SD card format the USB 3.0 transfer
speeds that means night and day
difference from USB 2.0 for transferring
with video files if you have a laptop
with only a USB 2.0 card reader get one
of these if you do video right you you
will thank me I also wanted to show you
guys version 2.0 of my mobile rig which
I first kind of used at CES I still have
the large flexible tripod from monoprice
down here on the bottom but I've removed
those ghetto zip ties in favor of this
cheese bar which I'm using kind of as an
offset for the camera the connection to
the camera and the tripod at the top and
then my zoom h1 mic fits at the bottom
down here off to the side I've added a
little tiny ball head so that I can
articulate the mic hanging off there to
point at me if I'm narrating or to point
at my subject if I'm shooting someone in
front of the camera and then there's
also a shock mount to reduce handling
noise of course I could have put the mic
on top here using the camera's flash
shoe but I felt that that made it pretty
top-heavy and having it lower down on
the mic allows me to be able to look at
the screen while I'm rambling about
whatever I'm shooting into the mics
right there so it picks me up pretty
well worked or great at CES when my
voice was gone and you could actually
hear me even though there's lots of
ambient noise I find this to be a pretty
fun and unique setup and I really like
it when I'm walking around at events and
I see people with these crazy big camera
rigs and tripods and everything I'm like
oh I just got this I feel like this has
been a very positive video so far and
I'm cool with that honestly but there
are a few disappointments I've
discovered in my time with the lx100
thus far first off there's no discrete
mic input meaning you're limited to the
in-camera mic which is passable but it
picks up a lot of camera hardware noise
if you do anything while you're
recording like zooming in or out or
Juston aperture via the aperture
adjustment ring it's going to pick that
up internally like an eighth inch input
or something would be really nice to
have here this is why record sounds
separately with my zoom h1 and I sync it
up and post I already noted the lack of
an articulating or flip up screen on the
back like Sony's rx100 mark 3 which
would be great for vlogging on the fly
shooting anytime you need to like frame
yourself up and I can't see the screen
the Wi-Fi enabled phone app works around
this but it's just a little bit more
cumbersome and time-consuming to setup
finally since I couldn't find this
information anywhere prior to buying the
camera I was really sad to learn that
there's actually no live HDMI out there
is a micro HDMI port yes but it's only
use right now is for playback of
recorded clips that are saved in the
camera because that's something lots of
people do right you connect your camera
to your TV and watch video straight from
the camera I don't know maybe some
people do that but I sure don't I really
wanted to hook this camera up to a
capture card for live-streaming or
direct to computer video capture but
unless Panasonic or some third-party
develop some new firmware it's just not
currently possible that makes me sad
overall though I am immensely satisfied
with the LX 100 despite some of its
limitations for me it's about the image
quality the fantastic lens the
portability and the next-gen features
like 4k recording now I will be
continuing to use this on my trip to
Computex at the beginning of June so
stay tuned for that coverage
let me know in the comments what you
think of this camera and if you have at
all been considering the jump to 4k as
products like the LX 100 make their way
into the consumer space don't forget
that that like button as well links to
all of this stuff accessories included
are in the video description down below
