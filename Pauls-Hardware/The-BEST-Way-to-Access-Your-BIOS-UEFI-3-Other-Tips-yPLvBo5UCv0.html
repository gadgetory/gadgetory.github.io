hardware today's video is short simple
and to the point I have some Windows 10
tips for you guys these are shortcuts
that I found myself using very
frequently and I'm gonna get straight to
the point
the main shortcut I wanted to share with
you guys today is holding down the shift
button while you press the restart
button so what this does this allows you
to access the advanced startup menu and
there's other ways to do this from
Windows 10 of course but this is just a
quick and easy way to do it and two main
reasons I personally use the advanced
startup options here of course you can
just turn your PC off but you know how
to do that there's other things here but
the troubleshoot menu is the thing you
want to get into here and then Advanced
Options is the one I go for two things
one is you can automatically have the
system reboot into the UEFI from this
and if you have a system that's set up
with an SSD an nvme Drive that has
Windows 10 UEFI mode it might boot so
quickly the hitting delete button as the
system is starting up it doesn't work
and it actually just keeps booting into
Windows this will allow you to just
click this button hit restart it'll
automatically boot into the UEFI and let
you go in there and adjust those
settings or you can click see more
Recovery Options go to startup settings
and then hit restart and this will allow
you to access an advanced startup menu
that will allow you to boot into safe
mode so here's the startup settings
lists number four is the one I usually
use for Safe Mode but you can do some
other options here too if you want and
then it will boot into safe mode so
there's multiple reasons you might want
to boot into safe mode but the one
reason I do most often is to refresh and
reinstall graphics card drivers reboot
into safe mode and then run display
driver uninstaller and I'll post the
link to where you can download that in
the video description that'll clear out
all your graphics drivers and then you
can reboot so if you're swapping between
an AMD and NVIDIA graphics card or even
just between different graphics cards
for benchmarking that's what I use this
most often for but also if you have a
system that you're trying to
troubleshoot if you think you might
potentially have a virus or malware
rebooting into safe mode to run
malwarebytes or an antivirus utility is
also a great way to do things because it
doesn't load up all the drivers and
often it can get you into a clean
environment where you can clean out
malware and viruses and then reboot and
give windows back up and running the way
it should now I'll be honest guys
originally my idea was to keep this
video so laser focused that that was the
only thing I was going to share with you
but let's go into a few more
I have three more to share with you guys
that you might find useful and you might
not know about this is again just
Windows 10 navigation stuff let's talk
about the magic of the center click if
you have a mouse with a left and right
button chances are you also have a
scroll wheel you can click down on that
scroll wheel and that access the 3rd
mouse button also known as Center click
and I use this all the time for one if
you want to open another instance of an
application if you have it tied to your
Start menu down here you can just Center
click and then it will open up another
one rather than reopening or switching
over to that second one this is very
helpful for instance if I'm loading up
gpu-z and I want to monitor my GPU
frequency and I want to have a couple of
them open so I can display those both on
screen Center click over that and it'll
open up another version so you can have
to those side-by-side Joe just asked if
this also applies to file explorer yes
it does if you don't open up another one
just Center click on that you can open
up multiple instances that's also very
helpful and if you're using a browser
and this works in Chrome and Firefox and
I believe Explorer as well you can
Center click on stuff to open it in
another tab so if I wanted to open
Google in another tab Center click on it
I got another tab with Google right
there or if I wanted to open say this
video here in another tab I could Center
click on that and it'll open it up right
over there also you can Center click on
the tab to close it close the tab close
the tab just by Center clicking that way
you don't have to search and find a
little X I find that to be very useful
tip number three is going to be a window
skirt cut to automatically launch any
application that you have down here in
the taskbar or at least the first 9
applications so if you want to pin an
application to the taskbar just you can
right click on it and go to pin to
taskbar and that should appear down
there so you can launch it whenever you
want but you can actually also press the
Windows key + the number to launch one
of these applications so they're just
numbered from the left here so the far
left one is number one 2 3 4 and 5 and
so on so if I wanted to launch gpu-z
which is the fifth application here I
can just press Windows key + 5 and gpu-z
launches actually most often use a
shortcut when I'm trying to do as quick
screencap so I have paint assigned in
position number three here so I can hit
print screen to copy it windows 3 to
load up paint ctrl V to paste and then
ctrl s to save and now I have saved a
screenshots very quickly so that's a
quick little short
for that I final tip is gonna be how to
do an emoji in Windows 10 I've talked
about this a little bit before but it's
just in a Q&amp;amp;A video so I'm gonna bring
it up here again and repeat myself let's
say watching a pulse hardware video and
you decide I like this video and I want
to go and post a comment or something
like that you're down in the comments
section but you're on a Windows computer
and you want to express yourself with an
emoji Windows key and the period windows
key period they're right next to each
other which is kind of handy we'll bring
up an emoji insert list here in Windows
10 you can scroll through them you can
search through them they're actually
sorted just like on your Android or
Apple devices for example you can also
hit the search icon and search for
something like ninja cats and really the
only sad thing about this feature is
that if you tried to do a ninja cat and
you try to post it in an Android
environment there is no in ninja cat
icon it's actually just a ninja and a
cat it's separate so Android and iPhone
really need to up their emoji game and
get the ninja cat going there but guys
that is all for this video I know it has
been short and somewhat different but I
hope some of these tips have helped you
out just little shortcuts that can save
you time and I find that when you find
something that saves you time and it's a
repetitive task you do a lot it adds up
and it can save you a lot of time in the
long run so I hope you've enjoyed this
video and if you have any suggestions
shortcuts that you use with Windows 10
leave those in the comment section down
below don't forget that the thumbs up
button - thanks again for watching this
video guys and we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
