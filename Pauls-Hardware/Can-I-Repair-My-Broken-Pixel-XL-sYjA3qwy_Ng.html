orphaned children hey I am using my
pixel of tell yeah that's my favorite
films best film best one I've ever had
probably will use it forever it's like
the battery needs a church that's better
yeah get all the juice it's such a nice
heavy battery pack
the mastercase h 500 m by coolermaster
sports dual tortor millimeter
addressable RGB fans a USB 3.1 gen2
type-c port and four tempered glass side
panels both sides top and front and the
front can swap out for a mesh panel if
you want maximum airflow it has a
plethora of cable routing covers to keep
things tidy too so click the sponsor
link in the description to learn more
well guys as you can probably tell from
that dramatic reenactment I experienced
a major tragedy and this was actually
just a couple days before I left for a
two-week trip to Europe so it was very
bad timing this is my pixel XL been
using it for the past almost two years
it's been my favorite phone ever and as
I was holding it and charging it with
this pretty beefy Rosewill 10,000
something actually 13,000 milliamp hour
battery I dropped them somehow the pixel
XL landed flat on a hard surface and the
battery landed on the corner directly on
top of it providing this just epic
smashed screen that you can see right
here I tweeted about it and a bunch of
people said oh you should try to fix it
which I am very much interested in doing
I couldn't at the time because I was
about to leave for that trip but since
then I checked on Amazon I found a
couple replacement screens the entire
LCD definitely needs to be replaced here
after being smashed I was just getting a
little bit of image on the screen just a
flat line telling me that the s power
was still working but the screen was
completely unusable and was not
displaying an image and whereas the
pictures I've taken on this phone are
automatically backed up which is part of
the Google pixel sales pitch to you is
that your pictures get automatically
backed up unlimited amount I've actually
been using a screen capture software on
this phone to capture the Tesla apps
that I've been using to monitor my solar
and power wall performance in
anticipation of doing a follow up video
on that which lots of people have been
asking about that stuff is not backed up
so I have captured video on this film
that I would really like to try to save
all that said it's definitely worth my
while to attempt to save this phone and
possibly replace the screen I do not
know if there's further damage to this
phone besides just the screen because
this is a pretty heavy piece of hardware
that fell on top of it and due to the
behavior afterwards I'm just not really
sure so I'm gonna take you guys
through my repair process today I have
purchased this kit from Amazon this is
the no new kit I got it because it was
it had a coupon so it was a five percent
off
I found this work option these are all
around one hundred and twenty two
hundred and twenty five dollar range
this is the one I actually got both of
these kits come with some adhesive as
well as a little tool kit that you can
hopefully use to help disassemble a
phone and these pixel phones are not the
easiest to repair but they're supposed
to be decently easy to repair I believe
that scored a six or a seven from iFixit
apart from the screen replacement kit I
do have my eye fix-it kit here as well
if things get too dire I'll dive into
that and then if you guys are wondering
what I've been using in the meantime
since I smashed my pixel XL a lowly
Samsung Galaxy s6 edge its is actually
one that I got refurbished which is
passable but obviously far inferior all
that said though let's get right into it
and see if I can fix my phone
no instructions included in the box so I
referenced one of the many google pics
luxo repair videos so I already on
YouTube so obviously this video is a
little bit redundant but it's my
experience that's what's important but
we got the replacement screen here with
the ribbon cable that will connect it up
in the back this is an adhesive pad
which is pre-cut so I'm gonna need to
remove some of those put the adhesive on
the back of this once I get the screen
itself off and then they also included a
screen protector maybe a subtle
suggestion to those of us who have
broken our screen to add some additional
protection to it I'm probably not going
to use that it's useless I also got a
small set of little screwdrivers and
some sputters and this will guide to
remove your actual SIM card SIM cards
already been removed from this so no
worries there its first step is gonna be
to loosen the adhesive so for that's I
have my heat gun I'm just gonna fire
this up on low and maybe give a give us
some help
loosening the adhesive around the edges
of the phone next step is to actually
start prying the screen up so we just
need to make a little bit of space in
between the edge for that we will use
our spudger it's really that first first
breach you gotta make that's the hard
one
just break my spudger busting up I fix a
kit already already the correct screen
is coming apart it's fine now take my
guitar pick
there we go
more guitar picks
that's better
thoughtful if I fix it to give you
multiple guitar picks
the heat has helped the adhesive to
loosen a bit more I'm just sliding my
guitar pick collection around the edges
but every time there's a crack like it
doesn't want to pry up again below that
so that's a part of the challenge
a little more heat I think
now when they're replacing the screen
and the screen replacement how-to-videos
it's always like a completely fine like
unbroken screen they're replacing not
like this like this chaos it's like this
corner it doesn't want to come up that's
like the brunt of the impact there but
the OLED behind it is also pretty my
stuff Wow trying to see if the impact
damage and anything beneath this it's
hard to say right there so this this is
a Torx t4 that I'm using which was not
included in the whole set of screws that
they gave us screwdrivers
cool all right and I just need to do
some cleanup around the edges here and
try to get rid of some of the adhesive I
still need to clean some pieces off of
here but there's lots of little mini
glass shards and everything I want to
get rid of those and I also want to make
sure that when I put stuff back on none
of those can be trapped inside so stick
with the vacuum but I've cleared away
anything that might be important that I
might accidently vacuum up
this is a shark rotator vacuum by the
way you guys want me to do a video on it
over the vacuum videos
so I'm feeling more positive about the
viability of this fix now I've managed
to remove all the adhesive in there and
I was particularly V old adhesive in
there it can prevent the new stuff from
sticking down and sitting flush and also
of course along this edge here I wanted
to make sure I got any of those little
shards of Gorilla Glass off of there
because they can't be sharp and we don't
want to leave anything inside here I was
pretty much just using my fingers in
there for the most part rubbing against
the adhesive to get it to ball up and
get off of there scrape some of it off a
little screwdriver and then of course
finished off by vacuuming any of the
excess pieces so next step is going to
be this new adhesive and this is
actually a full piece so I'm going to
need to peel off the adhesive parts that
don't need to go on there so that the
adhesive parts do go on there can go
where they're supposed to because
there's a very thin strip around the
edge that needs to go on and make sure
we have good contact
just like that these last few pieces
where the screws going everything I just
did peel that off and then I can remove
the backing apply it
I I sincerely hope that I have just
repaired my pixel Excel I'm gonna peel
this top screen off looks pretty clean
in there around the edges I think I can
I have much to complain about I guess I
just turned it on
it's already on look at that
it's great it's working wait let's plug
it back into this thing that broke it
which-which after after this destroyed
my pixel xl's
original screen I immediately took it on
there on our trip and used it for the
next two weeks
charging I'm so happy
so I've ever been in a situation where
you had a list of things to do and you
knew you couldn't do thing B C D and E
because you hadn't done thing a first
that's kind of how I've been feeling
with this cell phone situation so I had
no idea at the outset here whether or
not this is going to be successful so I
am incredibly pleased that it is let me
know what I should do with my my battery
backup here if I should banish it to
hate pile or if I should continue using
it since it's still perfectly functional
I'm gonna let this charge up I'm gonna
transfer everything off of it that I
need to transfer off of it and for now I
got my pixel XL back still might do a
pixel three in the future let me know in
the comments section if you guys would
be interested in me doing an update on
transitioning from one phone to the next
but for the time being got my phone back
thank you guys so much for watching this
video I'll put links in the description
to the stuff that I've used whether it's
my I fix a kit or the screen replacement
that I got or just other useful stuff
thanks for watching this video hit the
thumbs up button we'll see you guys next
