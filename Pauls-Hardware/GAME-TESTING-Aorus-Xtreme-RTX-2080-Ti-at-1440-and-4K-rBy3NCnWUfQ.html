coolers are made to keep cool even in
the most thermally challenging
situations with mlpro RGB fans included
to maximize performance with minimal
noise as well as a pump with a thermally
optimized coal plate a low noise design
and dynamic multi zone RGB lighting with
16 individually addressable LEDs find
out more about Corsairs hydro series RGB
platinum coolers via the sponsor link in
the video description what's up guys
how's it going - welcome to Pauls
hardware today's video is gonna be about
this graphics card right here this is
the gigabytes
Oris extreme version of the GeForce art
GX 2080 TI the highest end of invidious
current GPU offerings the RT x indicates
that it supports ray tracing although
there's not a whole lot of ray tracing
stuff we can test it with right now
battlefield 5 is finally out but more to
the point though today I'm going to be
giving you guys an unboxing a closer
look at the card itself and then I'm
going to be testing it by playing games
at 4k and 1440 on the back of the box we
can see some of the key selling features
here they have a custom-designed 300
millimeter fan cooling solution they've
got a custom designed video output
solution so you can do three HDMI outs
or three display ports out different
sections of therefore where you plug
stuff in allows you to connect it in
different ways you also have direct
copper contact heat pipe cooling
solution and we have an included VGA
holder which I will hopefully show you
guys in just a moment let's actually
pull this out of the box box contents
are pretty straightforward it is a fancy
box it is a large box you do get a four
year warranty for this graphics card
which is a little bit longer than
typical graphics cards a bit more
information on the video outs a driver
disk
I don't know when those are gonna go the
way of the dodo a quick guide in
multiple languages for stuff graphics
card itself we'll take a closer look at
in just a second you do get a Horace
case badge with the Falcon logo on it
and this is the actual GPU support
bracket which comes in pieces so there
it is pretty straightforward there's
three pieces so depending on the height
you can have it be this high or taller
if you add the extra little extensions
in there it's got some rubber on the
bottom all the pieces are made of metal
so that's nice and then just got a
little adjuster piece here that you can
tighten down with this little nut and
then your graphics card would sit on
that
alright so first impression the Shroud
is large as the frame is also made of
plastic I do like a metal shroud a
little bit better gigabyte actually my
favorite trads that they made were the
900 series the earlier 900 series
carrots that they did generally would
get back to but more the point the fat
the shroud being plastic doesn't
necessarily affect the cooling in one
way or another it's more just for feel
and durability in my opinion umm but
beyond that we have orange accents but
these are just in all of these
protective caps that they've put on
everything here so we pull these off and
now you can see there are no orange
accents so good job gigabyte thank you
for not putting orange accents on all of
your aura stuff I do appreciate it for a
specific orange in black bill but I
don't always like the orange if you have
the choice to remove it I think that
might be a good option now in the back
here I already mentioned the video outs
but that is something that is distinct
from this graphics card and they've
separated them into zones it's clarified
in that bit of documentation in there
but if you're plugging into one zone you
can't use stuff from the other zone
again it adds more functionality by
allowing you to plug things in
differently
specifically multiple HDMI outputs are
helpful for existing VR setups although
you do not have the type C still as well
so for virtual link headsets that come
out in the future you'll still have
compatibility with that you also still
have your NV link bridge up there for
two-way and V link SLI configurations
you have a Norris logo on the side here
that will light up and that'll probably
be most visible from your case and then
you've also got a Norris logo on the
back of the card that will also light up
I believe all of these are RGB and there
are also some cool RGB logo effects that
you can do there's some rings that
surround the fans there as well which
we'll also take a look at once we get
this card actually plugged in beyond
that it is a fairly weighty card which
is often a good sign for cards like this
it just means there's more actual metal
in there more mass to absorb and help
dissipate heat we got dual eight pin
power delivery connectors there and then
of course we got a backplate which
pretty clean design I would say of
course accented by that logo but you
know nothing too shiny going on I would
say it's a it's a handsome looking
backplate
I've never never described a backplate
as handsome before this is a fairly
unique implementation for RGB LEDs and
the fans is actually an LED that comes
out at the end of one tip of one blade
of each of the three fins so there's one
here there's one here at the end of the
central fan and then there's one here on
this fan and then since the fans are
spinning those lighting up gives a
circular visual impression of the LEDs
this is a custom design version of the
r-tx 28 EPI and by a gigabyte so they've
also updated the PCB and the power
delivery it has a 16 plus 3 phase power
delivery setup to go along with that 4
year warranty and then of course they've
also overclocked it out of the box with
a core boost clock of 1770 megahertz
which is 225 megahertz faster than they
reference cards boost clock of 15 45
minutes all right guys we're jumping
into some gameplay testing here and in
case you haven't noticed we're actually
a few weeks late on this we actually
recorded most of this video a while back
and then we the footage didn't turn out
good the 4k capture stuff so sorry about
that but we are recapturing now we have
updated the driver to version 4 17.2 2
and then for our first game we're
playing fortnight we're in windowed
full-screen mode at 4k 3840 by 2160
we're using epic settings vsync is off
motion blur is on and Joe's gonna do
some game play testing to see how the
system performs again we're using the
9900 K 4.7 to 5 gigahertz all the stats
for the system are in the top left so
you can see the 9900 K the r-tx 20 80 TI
as well as the GPU memory and fan speed
and then of course the all-important
framerate frames per second just
currently hovering around 75 to 80
we're playing early in the day so Jo's
mostly playing against elementary school
kids
he's been practicing for a month it's
compared to kids upon this probably been
playing since they are able to and for
the record I like this game my name
still sucks though jo has loaded up an
ammo he's now engaging the enemy just
full frontal attack
so just to recap guys we're maxing out
at the mid-80s maybe 85 88 frames per
second and then when Jo dies the
framerate drops so no that doesn't
affect the framerate but in low range
we're getting in the 70s which isn't too
bad at 4k if you're going with the 4k 60
Hertz monitor that'd be a good solution
for you next we're gonna try 2560 by
1440 maybe a higher frame rate will
improve Josie no my name is just still
shitty you know what those like come on
killer Joe yeah as you can see my game
is sucks I shoot him in the face to
check in shamefully my aim sucks
yeah all right guys two changes here we
have switched to 2560 by 1440 for the
resolution and we are now in full
full-screen mode instead of window full
screen shouldn't effectively freemake
too much well we've already jumped up to
140 to 150 frames per second Joe is
already getting killed just racking up
the kills hey wish man looking at myself
I know here you see my face I'm Shane
there was up there alright I'm embracing
the fact that I suck this only he can
only get better right you can also edit
out the parts where you suck yeah no
screw it
if I leave the parts will you mess up in
the videos oh and I'll leave myself when
I mess up it's only fair right Paul
that's true and I think it followed a
hard time when these when he makes
mistakes because it's funny I have to
leave that to your discretion and know
how honest you're gonna be about it wait
come on I'm just white damage goes down
to 16 health Joe's dead
Joe forgot he has nine shield pushes oh
yeah she I'm I'm mad now so when I'm mad
at be just as bad
use your hate you ah
I thought I was gonna die from that shot
seriously this football player guy he's
just taunting you it's like you're
aiming the gun at his face and ready to
shoot he's just like here's a wood wall
all right all right football player guy
I'm going after you if I can you just
killed that one guy at least once I'll
be happy
Joe has a mission uh a vision I can see
him already we are getting framerate
dips down into the 110 to 120 s at times
again just kind of depends on what
you're looking at and the complexity of
what's being rendered on screen but by
and large we're staying oh oh there's
down to 108 for a second but if you're
in a variable refresh rate monitor
that's up in the 120 or 140 for its
range
I think you'd be pretty happy with this
especially of course if you have g-sync
going on because that will smooth out
any times you have any dips that go
below the actual refresh rate of your
monitor well there's somebody Jesus
Christ y'all gonna kill ya all right
being on a high note and I started a
streak probably right here in Christ a
streak of shotgunning people in the back
oh this park again
that football guys oh my god there's not
like me football player like it seems
right there let me try get one more kill
just to redeem myself
oh there yes yes porco football player
can't get any better than this
that was a guy was counting me the whole
time well done Joe
alright guys there's a look at for
tonight gameplay at 4k and 2560 by 1440
ru let's move on I'm up to five now
that's your day well I'm up to 5km five
kills okay we're switching over to
system overwatch now I'm going to be
wrecking ball as for setting us we're at
4k 3840 by 2160 for right now vsync is
off these are off primary cap is at 300
and then graphics claudi's at ultra that
under an advanced we are at 100% render
scale I should also roll out to note my
team perhaps overwatch is not as
challenging of a game to render
typically you can achieve higher frame
rates especially if you use that render
scale option so it's really nice at 4k
we're already getting 160 ish 170 ish
frames per second that means for FPS
gamers who want to high frame rate
gaming if you have a really high refresh
rate monitor even a 4k one you should be
able to still handle overwatch I'm gonna
see if I can handle actually playing and
not dying shoot ringing oh oh that's Bob
wait is that Bob no that's a doom fist
and I'm just gonna roll around in a
circle here oh you gotta hit people and
overt nope now I die
uh-huh it's kind of sad for little
hamster kick roses around dead die doom
fist
we're hundred and thirty frames per
second I'm trying to shoot people died
well it's my team doing my team's doing
nothing I have the most eliminations the
most damage done I've only killed the
most objective time I'm a tank is that
how it's supposed to work see they're
all staying here as a team and my team
is just nowhere to be found nowhere to
be found
it's okay though it's okay doesn't
matter we don't you to win that fun I
died all right looks fairly fun I'm
going to attempt getting myself more
frames now alright guys I am going to
switch up the video to 2560 by 1440 here
we go 300 fps is what we're dealing with
them kill I do feel like I'm being more
effective as fara in this game is you
doc well I had a decent run before that
so guys were probably just gonna do a
short bit of gameplay here because
there's not a whole lot of point in
testing overwatch at 2560 by 1440 with
an RT x 28 DTI because we're hitting the
frame rate cap of 300 frames per second
which is good very good
so and kind of to be expected given to
4k performances on so that means you're
gonna stop so I've added as much
probably yes but I can't just yeah you
don't want to get a flag damn right like
yeah I don't to get flagged like Kyle's
account and flagged for leaving matches
earlier whatever all right that's gonna
wrap it up for overwatch let's move on
okay guys we have loaded up battlefield
5 now at this point the to try to tie a
single player so we're currently on
we're at 4k I'm gonna pull up a look I
can pause how useful all right just take
a quick look at video settings full
screen 4k this is our settings for all
this I have left all the fancy effects
from grain and all that stuff on for now
and then in advance
we're in DirectX 12 mode but not
currently using DirectX ray-tracing and
actually thanks to the delay and the
filled footage captured from a week or
two ago we now have the updated driver
and the updated version of battlefield 5
which is supposed to do a pretty nice
boost in DirectX R Atreus performance we
we tested this like a week and a half
ago captured footage didn't work out
unfortunately but the DirectX
performance just tanked horribly when we
turned it on so we're gonna do a quick
test just a 4k without DirectX ray
tracing then we will turn it on with
ultra mode oh by the way we're in the
ultra preset mode as well and then we
will see what happens when we turn it
down a little bit so again no DirectX
ray tracing right now just DirectX 12
mode other than that standard settings
and here's where you can demonstrate
using Jay's methods screen space
reflections Trek over there reflected in
the puddle move over here it's blocked
so you can't see their reflection
anymore it's really nice when J goes and
does that in this area of course there's
plenty of other places where we can show
that as well but moving up here we're
getting a decent framerate eighty FPS
you can try to shoot this as presuming
he's a Nazi I'm not doing a very good
job iron sights a very inaccurate and
World War two Adam also we're still
mentally foggy from a a 12-hour V games
team so that's always why we're not
playing that well right Paul technically
we should be better at games now we had
12 hours of practice yeah brain to wrist
you know just navy net so guys we're in
the mid-70s as far as the framerate goes
with these settings I'm gonna restart
the mission and we'll turn on DirectX
pretty crazy
alright after a quick restart we're back
in the game still 4k and DirectX is on
again down here for graphical quality
settings we're at Ultra so the directrix
retracing reflections are also on Ultra
we'll see how it goes here and then
maybe turn that down if things are too
messy right now we've already dropped
from the 70s down to 39 frames per
second but let's look at the reflection
of this Jeep supply curve it's a stupid
jerk do that it's still there it's
incredible it's much more immersive now
that I can see that reflection Oh see
I'm sitting here admiring the
reflections the DirectX ray tracing
reflections and my brother in arms just
got killed it's horrible revenge revenge
I say now anecdotally because again we
lost two rather the footage we captured
before was not very viable or usable at
all but I'm already seeing it's better I
feel like we were getting less than half
of the framerate when we turned on
DirectX retracing before now we
dropped from the 70s down to mid-40s so
could be worse for sure and what's worse
the IB yes it definitely was worse so it
was like about 15 right or something
glad they brought the game back to what
it's supposed to be stop shooting me
dude yeah that's how we're judges you
want the screen to substrate bill I'm
sorry Matheny did associate you now he
can enjoy the game weren't right racing
if you look at the side of the gun here
and they fire fire is reflecting on the
side of the gun as it should that's
actually kind of cool depending on the
location of the fire it's bouncing up
there so that is one area where ray
tracing is actually showing a visual
difference all right so it's definitely
playable you know if you really like the
eye candy but again in the forty thirty
to forty three frames per second rate is
not that great when it comes to PC
gaming in general so let's go back to
the video settings and let's just switch
those rate traces from ultra down to not
ultra oh look we now have ultra low high
and medium let's just go to low side by
side here flames on the gun does that
look better well I mean it should look
worse it should look low instead of high
now although they are still they frame
rate right wise though we have jumps
maybe 15 15 fps
10 15 up to the 50s from the 40s that's
appreciable so at this point let's see
if you wanted to do this setup but maybe
you just wanted a little bit more frames
per second you could turn down the
actual resolution so we're gonna try
2560 by 1440 at 60 Hertz we have to
restart the game in order to turn
DirectX ray tracing back off so I'm
gonna leave it on for now still have ray
tracing on and we've switched back to
ultra for the raintree's settings so
machete oh yeah I'm just gonna hack him
up with the machete oh geez
that was rough except now I'm being shot
a bunch of times you get a chance
complete I got a challenge completion
you can really see the light reflecting
off of the machete as I stabbed okay
what the retracing effects right so guys
we're getting a much more playable
framerate at this resolution even with
DX are on high were mostly over 60
frames per second
even when I'm shot and there's a big
explosion in front of me alright now
we've dropped down to the 50
but it's still not terrible I shot him
in the ass
all right so low 60s mid to low 60s
sometimes dropping into the 50s I am
going to now change directx ray-tracing
hello
DirectX right racing down to low and
we've again earned 5 to 10 frames per
second maybe a little bit more than
that's up to these 70s now even above
that although we're looking at kind of a
long shot right now it's not a lot of
water in the in the frames there's the
photo right there puddle of water I look
at the clouds I look at that it's the
Sun it's like you wouldn't be able to
see the Sun well I'm getting shot at oh
hi there what are you sure I shot you in
the face that's odd she proved that we
don't completely suck as the game's
fault exactly you and here's our last
battlefield 5 test still 2560 by 1440
just have turned ray-tracing
off so if you don't want ray tracing
this is the performance you would expect
everything else is pretty much the same
we're at Ultra on settings and now we
can run forward and perhaps give
ourselves the best chance at shooting
Nazis in this game although again gosh
look at those reflections look how
unrealistic that is sucking away my
immersion but never mind we're gonna
press forward it's like we're on the
iron sights are you supposed to eat I
assume you want to put the tip of it
right on their head oh well that worked
that work too
and I'm getting all kinds of headshots
it's tough practice practice
it's called Nazis pissing me off so
whereas with DirectX ray-tracing on our
frame rate was maybe starting in the 60s
and then maybe going into the 70s and
the 80s as we turned it down to low and
moved into situations where there was
less water presence
we're not consistently in the hundred
and fifteen hundred and twenty five
frames per second range oh that was
another nice shot suddenly I can aim I
don't know where this is kind of
criminal point being though this is a
better play experience when it comes to
smoothness and fluidity of course just
don't have those rate races I miss I
miss you Ray I like yeah they told me
pops off
yeah you got to get under the helmet
maybe that's why I wasn't shooting him
before I was I was hitting the helmet
nut yeah you're gonna help me not the
leather side of it yeah
after smell a punch punch you yeah am i
dead yeah yeah stick like you Rihanna
comment was like you guys are working on
a crazy pcs but we're not they grabbed
on to spend all our time building the
exact kind of balance man you know it's
like it's all about you know you there's
one of the other had to kill me I'm dead
and so is our time playing vf5 let's
move on all right guys we're on a pub G
now player unknowns battlegrounds
starting off again at 4k 38 40 but 23 a
40 by 2160 everything else is set too
high so Joe is gonna be playing because
he's really good at fortnight now so
that obviously should translate over to
pub G as well is that the exact that's
how it works is it gonna be bad but pub
G is different than for tonight all you
gotta do is like no it's hiding a bit
more it's two people there I'm gonna die
like yesterday I'm just gonna like necks
lying in a swamp
there you go this is ray tracing here to
write no initial 4k frame rates for the
r-tx 20 atti special or sedition
explores extreme edition is 110 other
than 20 inside the house we're getting
in close to hundred and thirty frames
per second is it there's a strategy that
I've seen people using fortnight and
Pub G which is the very first time the
first circle goes down immediately go to
the dead center of the circle don't
worry about looting or anything and to
say that and then just crouched in a
bush and wait see how you could last
it's not it's not as fun so yeah this
game come up walk I shoot your face
kill him Joe kill him was that 89 frames
per second so there's our 4k framerate
dipping a little bit below 100 from time
to time but by-and-large staying in 110
it's 120 frames per second range Joe you
want to try another one yeah of course
2560 by 1440 I'm sure people will enjoy
that there's nobody around me in
surprise well probably because you're
about to land in the water what the no
no I want it Oh apparently there's no
glide and it's no glider spacebar sense
I'll take that up didn't I had well so
yeah you get 155 frames per second huh
zoom in and water it's good good to know
damn it well now after I warmed up
swimming she's on the plus side
apparently swimming through the water is
very challenging in this game because we
were getting in the about 155 frames per
second now that Joe is back on land
we're getting upwards of 200
of cause ball and if some people get
really good with those is they to make
no noise yeah fine so many bolts does it
load with one one bolts one black here's
some gunshots hey fine let's go walk
towards my death yeah you was he screwed
a damn thing don't want it then we're
crossbow no I don't want it no there's a
bridge cool
I can dice I can stop playing his game
just across the bridge oh I'm sure no
one yeah I'm sure nobody's waiting there
that dust random puffs of dust yeah it
goes it's cuz you're being shot at baby
hey yeah and they probably just happy
it's not going yeah come on right here
just fancy them come on come on shoot me
are you sure Jesus Christ running up to
get closer baby
okay sounds like in the arc what are you
Jesus Christ what oh I see now Oh their
thing get him Joe get him here comes the
becomes the her trouble oh no their
bubble hey don't I have a painkiller
here how do you take it and just wait
till it goes all the way oh there you
are
he came back and shot you yeah yeah
exciting alright guys that was that was
puppy it 2560x1440 a low range FPS
around a hundred fifty five ish because
that was mainly swimming through water
everyone 70s to 180s and then it was
actually Gooding above 200 FPS from time
to time but pub G can fluctuate a lot we
got one game less left to play that's
cod blopps for well we wanted to play
black ops for but I guess I guess we
can't right now cuz we can't even
connect or load the game up let's let's
play something else
so here's shadow of the Tomb Raider
replacing Cobb Bluffs for with this
because we can't look cops for right now
so displaying graphics settings for the
time being we are at 4k
just start off DirectX 12 mode is on all
the other settings you see here
including vsync off and then for
graphics we're at the highest presets
for the time being and I am just gonna
play the game here s are currently
getting a mid 60s with mid to high 60s
framerate
this is of course just a walk around and
talk to people area although it is quite
beautiful with all the various lighting
we got la casa may count out over here I
get some Mexican food Paula actually has
good Spanish pronunciation it's funny
character you're like my cousin
McConaughey later I grew up with a lot
of people speaking Spanish in the area
Southern California y'all I used to feel
awkward about trying to pronounce like
Spanish and I just kind of try to go for
it and occasionally people say like hey
that wasn't Ben that raised my
confidence I can't quite roll the
artists dildo all right guys we're going
through a fair amount of exposition and
stuff right now but framerate wise we're
getting in the mid 60's for the most
part going through the bit of actual
gameplay section where I was aiming and
firing and there was more foliage
dipping a little bit below that but I
imagined by lowering the actual quality
settings we could actually get ourselves
a little bit higher if we were trying to
go for a 4k gaming 60 Hertz experience
I'm gonna switch over to 2560 by 1440
just as we have been and we'll see if
this improves our frame rate see if the
game crashes I think Lisa's picking us
up where it left off it's good night
alright so again 2560 by 1440 all the
other settings are pretty much the same
and graphics are still at the highest
presets let's see how do we do now
immediately we've had a nice jump up
into the hundred and tens where's your
boat good question
hey do it do it do it
jump
how odd that's pretty high there oh this
is the fun where you get to wall
climbing it's been a while since I did
some Jim reader wall climbing wow he's
just gonna try it out of our own okay
that's all part of the magic of Tomb
Raider Joe you've never been rappelling
before if it's anything what I see why
now I don't want to I like the scenery
here in the environment
and then I can like swing over to here
oh just barely made it she has her good
fingers should that space Trump we are
deep into kick-ass rats screw rats
you're probably gotta go through here oh
god it ye'll that was creepy I don't
like eels you know no more eels
yeah no no she's stupid eel
the thing is scaredy I was expecting an
eel it could be a go up ah no I said to
push buttons it's a little creepy if you
uh if you're running out of water and
stuff right now water gonna air in the
water come on all right you can do it
come on you're at the spin swing you're
okay yeah you guys it's a good thing
she's in that overweight good thing she
does have the boner again for some
reason now this whole thing is
collapsing she's trapped
break3 get the Pilates son there you go
now a beautiful again is perfect that's
awesome oh yeah the book came back like
and cat a little scary a little scary
and I think that's probably a good time
to stop here guys otherwise we could
just keep playing this game full evah
that has been a little bit of shadow of
the Tomb Raider game play for you guys a
pretty decent performance here with the
horse extreme r-tx 20 atti thanks to Joe
also for donating some of his gameplay
today are you ready to drop like
thirteen hundred bucks on one of these
now maybe
so they have a guys some gameplay
testing with this new graphics card from
gigabytes the Auris extreme version of
nvidia geforce art TX 20 80 TI and i do
enjoy this method of testing and this
type of video because it actually allows
me to play video games I recently did
this with the rx 590 and the feedback
from that was pretty positive this
doesn't mean that I'm always going to
test this way in the future I think
there is still validity to running a
bunch of tests and having the bar charts
up there so you can get better a to be
comparisons between cards but especially
for a GPU that's already launched when
we're just testing a specific version of
the card this is one keep doing because
lets me play games anyway though guys I
hope you've enjoyed this video hit the
thumbs up button if you did and check
out the video's description for a link
to this graphics card as well as links
to other useful stuff like my start
breaking buy shirts and mugs and pie
glasses
thank you again so much for watching and
we'll see you guys next time yeah go
into the Kame or you'll find it oh god I
just died he got prodded by multiple
angles</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
