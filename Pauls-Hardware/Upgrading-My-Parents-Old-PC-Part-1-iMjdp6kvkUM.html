should all go follow her on Twitter
she's nori hardware anyway I'm excited
about today's video not just because I'm
pandering to you guys with my dog but
because I have a bunch of computer parts
all right here ready to go so today is
going to be a build video now I keep
this fairly casual I'm just going to be
assembling all this stuff I will also be
moving out to the garage and in case
you're wondering this is the four
hundred dollar bill that I already
outlined for my parents new computer and
my January builds videos so if you guys
are interested in just me telling you
all the parts go watch that video if not
just keep watching and I'll tell you all
the parts again right now now something
to keep in mind as I go through these is
that you might notice some of these
parts are actually different than the
ones I recommended a few weeks ago when
I did the January builds video so I'm
going to real quick go over all these
and tell you what's the same what's
different and for the purposes of
letting you guys check out these builds
on PC part picker I will have links to
both of them in the description down
below both the original $400 version as
well as the actual parts I'm using here
which is going to be a little bit more
expensive because I did get some much
appreciated sponsorship from
Coolermaster for the build anyway
starting out for the case is a
coolermaster silencio 352 this is from
the review video that I did on this case
so I still had it if you guys want to
check that out I'll post a link to that
as well right now it's a little micro
ATX case and I think it's going to do a
good job for me here's one of the
changes which is just SSD rather than
getting that new SSD from a data which
is about 60 bucks I'm just going to go
with this intel SSD 510 series I've been
using this as an external like device
with this little USB cable for quite a
while it's 250 gigs it's not as fast
it's probably a little bit slower than
that a day to drive but when it comes to
SSD snappiness and everything it's going
to be totally fine for my parents needs
and it's the same capacity so whenever
you use that there and save a little bit
of money by not having to buy another
new SSD the motherboard remains the same
I got this from new egg it's a z97 MDS
3h nice little fairly inexpensive and
fairly small micro ATX board and it'll
fit nicely here's some of the
differences in the parts which is the
power supply and the cooler now as I
already mentioned I reached out to
cooler master and
told them I was doing this build and I
told them that I already or what I
wanted was a hyper 212 and they're 80
plus bronze power supply what they sent
over was the Yemen s 5:24 version 2
which is right there which is more of a
horizontal than a vertical cooler still
a very good performer so I'm you know no
complaints from me here but that is one
thing that's different the guys are into
the hyper 212 it'll still work just fine
and it is a little bit cheaper than this
one but I like this one because it's
pretty quiet and it does have that
orientation that fires a lot of downward
air towards the motherboard and the V
RMS and all that kind of stuff the power
supply again is also slightly different
here it's a V 550 this is 80 plus gold
rated from Coolermaster so this is again
a little bit more expensive than the 80
plus bronze model that I originally put
in the parts list but again I'm not
going to complain because this is an 80
plus gold model so it'll save a little
bit on power and it's fully modular and
stuff and all all those good things the
memory is also a little bit different
than planned this is just this was only
like 2 or 3 dollars more I think than
that kit the Ares G scale areas kit this
is a Myshkin kit it's all black and I
mainly went with this even though it's a
little bit slower speed I think it's
2133 instead of 2400 it's 1.5 volt
instead of 1.65 and I don't know I it's
you can still use one point six five
volts with the G 32:58 but just to be on
the safe side I went with that one point
five and again it's only a couple
dollars difference so there you go and
then finally here's the processor of
course the G 32:58
will dual-core overclockable Intel
Pentium processor and I'm excited to
actually get this installed because I
have like I played with this a little
bit right back when it first launched
but I really haven't in quite some time
so but being a dual core I think it's
going to be perfectly satisfactory for
the needs of this build anyway there
though guys there are all the parts and
I'm just going to go ahead start to
assemble on this little guy and I'll
come back to you towards the end and let
you know how things went oh yeah one
last thing that's not shown here is the
operating system that is I'm going to be
just going for Windows 10 and I'm going
to get that from kinguin net and
hopefully I think I'm just going to try
out they have like a $20 OAM version
that you can get there I think I'm just
going to go for that and see how it
works and all
you guys know anyway I'm at the build
and just like that the build is complete
so as you can see well if you just look
at the outside of the case it just looks
like the case but no everything is
installed as you can see there at the
back let me pop off the side panel and
just do a little bit of commentary on
the build process and some of my
thoughts involved so as you can see it's
not like too crowded in there but I did
definitely have some issues with the
cable management there's just not a
whole lot of space behind the
motherboard tray in this case
fortunately though thanks to the v5 50 s
all black cables and the fact that
they're flat ribbon style cables I was
able to use some zip ties along this
back edge here to kind of take
especially that 24 pin cable and cinch
that down so even though there's a fair
amount of cable showing here I wouldn't
necessarily submit this to fit my PC on
awesome hardware if you know what I mean
everything's still pretty tucked away so
there's still a pretty good amount of
airflow speaking of airflow you might
have noticed during the course of the
build that I actually did initially
replace this rear fan the exhaust fan
with one of the fans that coolermaster
sent over which is the Silencio FP 120
now these are these are more static
pressure optimized fans but um they you
know they're they're also still a little
bit nicer than what comes with the case
the reason I didn't go with it is
because that the fan splitter I have
because there is only one fan head
around the motherboard right in here for
case fans I got the CPU fan plugged into
the CPU fan header the fan header on the
motherboard for case fans I have split
two ways but I only had that three pin
splitter in there and the PWM fans are
PWM they're four pin so I couldn't use
that so I put those back in and
thankfully these fans are still very
quiet that just the default ones that
come with the case apart from that I got
the SSD mounted right here I could have
put it up top here as well and gotten
rid of this cage but there's no work for
me to put the cage anyway I just want to
leave it in there in case I drop in we
might drop in some larger capacity
mechanical drives in here and I do have
some SATA power just kind of on reserve
sitting down there at the bottom so if I
do pop in a three point
five here I can just plug that in pretty
easily I also did some tricky cable
management here with my SATA cable I
just had to kind of loop it back and
forth across itself and then lastly
would be the eight pin eight pin power
for the for the piece for the CPU is
going up the left side of the
motherboard tray right here which again
is not the most ideal situation but
there's no way to pass it through at the
very top of this case behind the
motherboard tray so I did that and again
thanks to the flat cables from this
power supply I'll still be able to push
that down flat and install a graphics
card right there if I need to so but
there it is powered on and I'm just
using an in-camera mic right now but I
still can't hear anything
you get actually my my my streaming
system which is over there is probably
making a little bit more noise than this
but all these fans are super quiet
everything's up and running next step is
going to be to install windows of course
I'm gonna get that OS install going and
then I think I will do a follow-up video
on this system because I am going to be
bringing it over and deliver delivering
it to my parents and I want to do a
side-by-side comparison of their current
PC that I built them I don't know how
many years ago and this and just what
the difference is as far as speed and
usability especially going with an SSD
instead of mechanical drives anyway
though guys if you enjoyed this video
hit the thumbs up button hope you
enjoyed it thanks for watching and we'll
see you next time on Paul's hardware
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
