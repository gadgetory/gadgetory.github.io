you by Corsair enter max deep cool and
Coolermaster if you have a chance to go
by the convention center when you're at
CES you should always go by the big TV
makers the big flatscreen makers because
they're all making curved screens now
and they're all 4k and LED and they
usually have a massive wall of screens
and it's usually just the type of
experience that you can't really see
anywhere else they had sort of a wave
display going on that wrapped from the
ceiling down the sides and then another
wave or two on each side a bunch of
different graphics playing over there
the everyone was just standing and
watching and taking video up so I wanted
to share that with you real quick but LG
had some other cool stuff at their booth
and one of them that was really
impossible to ignore is their rollable
oh le d-- TV they're just calling this
the Signature Series LED TV R and
basically there's what looks like a
surround speaker that would sit like up
in your home theater system and then a
little slot opens at the top and then
out pops a TV and it's not like it's
just flat dropping down and then coming
back up it rolls up into the little
speaker box it's extremely thin maybe
looks like a quarter of an inch or a
little bit more it kind of slats across
the back so you can see that's where the
rolling action happens and then there's
some scissor supports that kind of
expand and widen out to give you a
completely flat o LED display it's only
available in 65 inch and they say
they're gonna start selling this in the
second half of 2019 but no word on price
it's probably going to be really
expensive well it might be a little bit
more up your alley would be LG's
upcoming gaming monitors they're calling
this the ultra gear gaming monitor
series and they have a 27-inch standard
16 by 9 as well as a 37.5 inch ultra
wide the 27-inch monitor is the 2 7 GL 8
50 G it's 27-inch and Q HD so 2560 by
1440 resolution with a 144 Hertz refresh
rate and LG says you could overclock
this to about 160 Hertz this is a nano
IPS display for the actual panel so that
means they're going to get really good
color depth in fact 98% of the DCI p3
color gamut which is very impressive and
I think the highest percentage I've seen
for any of the gaming monitors I looked
at at the show it's got Nvidia g-sync
sphere lighting which is backlighting
behind the monitor so it's going to
illuminate the wall that's directly
behind it and you can just have an RGB
spectrum going on this or you can plug
in via USB to your computer and you'll
have to run a little bit of software to
actually sync that up with what's
displayed on the screen but providing
that ambient lighting on the wall behind
can provide a more immersive gaming
experience and there's also an audio
reactive lighting mode that you can turn
on to finally for the stand I like to
check the stand on the monitors that
come out you have Heights tilt swivel
and yes pivot as well so you can go
portrait or landscape next is the ultra
Gator 3/8 GL 950 G this is a thirty
seven point five inch ultra wide q HD
monitor it is curved just two bits which
is nice for a gaming monitor the
resolution is 38 40 by 1600 which is
kind of an interesting resolution but it
is ultra wide again you have a hundred
and forty four Hertz refresh rate and LG
says you could overclock this monitor to
a hundred and seventy-five Hertz in
their experience it is a nano IPS
display just like the 27 inch so you get
98% coverage for the DCI p3 color gamut
again Nvidia g-sync support that same
sphere lighting 2.0 that you can control
with the application or have it be I do
really or just have it RGB and then this
monitor does not yet have a response I'm
actually neither monitor yet has a
listed response time that is the final
thing that LG is working on they're
going to try to get it as quick as
possible because that's very important
for a gaming monitor but we're not
expecting these until q3 of this year
and we don't have any listed prices yet
I'm hoping these are reasonably priced
they're probably going to be a little
bit more expensive since they're g-sync
monitors but maybe the g-sync freesync
thing will help even things out that
just recently been announced also at CES
2019 but guys that is all the time I
have for this video thank you for
watching my coverage so far this year I
just got a couple more videos left in
the pipeline so stay tuned hit the
thumbs up button subscribe if you're not
already and we'll see you guys in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
