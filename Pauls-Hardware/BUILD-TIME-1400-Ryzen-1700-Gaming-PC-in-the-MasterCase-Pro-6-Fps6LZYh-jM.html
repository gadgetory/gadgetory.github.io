today's build video I am very excited
about today's video for three reasons
one is it's my March build and I'm
building it and it's still March and
that is that's a win right there
honestly if you've been following my
monthly build video series we're getting
caught back up second reason is this is
my first full system built based on
Rison so I will be using the r7 1700 in
this build eight core 16 thrift
processor very excited about that then
the third reason is I definitely tried
to stick a little bit more of a budget
with this build so the system that you
see here is going to cost you about
fourteen hundred dollars but I put a
second variant of the system with just a
few parts changed here and there that
comes in at about twelve hundred dollars
so check the video description if you
want to see links to both of those over
on PC part picker all that said though
let's run down all the parts that I'm
going to be building with today I guess
you could add this as a four threes and
I'm kind of excited for this build this
is a mastercase pro six this is going to
be our case and this is a brand new case
from coolermaster it is part of their
master case series though so it does fit
with their freeform modular system it's
all the accessories and everything that
they sell like the mastercase 5 and 3
and all that stuff are swappable into
this this one has a silent design where
the top panel can pop up and down and
give you either more airflow or a block
a little bit of the internal noise so
that should be a nice spacious case to
build in and I love the quality of
cooler master cases because they're
always built like tanks for the
motherboard we have the asrock X 370
Taichi this motherboard has been getting
a lot of good press I think since Rison
launched because as rack has been pretty
diligently working on updated BIOS ease
for the this board as well as the entire
series of am4 motherboards this one has
a pretty cool black and white design and
I'm hoping we can get a pretty decent
overclock going on this one as well once
it's all installed also uh plenty of
features like in two supports and
high-speed storage as well as
connectivity for storage we have a
single SSD and I'm assume
you're going to want additional storage
in this build and you're building it at
home you're probably going to want to
drop in another mechanical drive or
something like that in the parts list
and a 480 gig version of this sander
sculpture - I'm actually building with a
one terabyte version because that's what
I have on hand right here but that
shouldn't affect speeds or anything like
that it's a very nice fast drive and if
you keep an eye out for you can find it
for very reasonable prices now we have
the CPU and cougar combo so the CPU of
course the rise in 717 hundred in my
opinion this is the price to performance
King when it comes to the recent CPUs
launched by Ryze and if you are willing
to overclock a 1700 you can get it -
very very very close to the type of
performance you get from a 1700 X or an
1800 x8 core 16 thread beast of a
workstation processor handles games just
fine as well and I'm going to be pairing
that with also a new product from cooler
master their master air probe for we're
hoping this will be a worthy successor
to the hyper 212 Evo although the hyper
212 is of course still available this
one I think looks a little bit better
they put a plate on top to give it a
sort of a darker look still has your
direct copper contact heat pipes and all
that so we'll be putting that through
its paces in the follow-up video when I
test performance of course and I'll be
giving you some feedback on that we also
have a coolant master power supply there
be 650 this is very good power supply
all Japanese capacitors five-year
warranty 80 plus gold rated it has all
black cables as well so no ketchup and
mustard going on here and then almost
finally I was about to say finally but I
realized I'm missing a pretty important
piece here we have the memory this is a
Corsair Vengeance lpx ddr4 insanely
popular memory because it's just it just
gets the job done it's low-profile it's
all black and then when it comes to the
AMD stuff the rice and stuff that's just
launched memory compatibility can be
touchy at times but Corsair at least
with this kit has done the widest amount
of validation across a bunch of
different motherboards so we're
confident that it will work and I've at
least run this 29:33 I will see what the
Taichi maybe maybe with the new
motherboard BIOS we can we can run this
at Street 3000 but
and in a 2x8 gig kit and then you might
have noticed in the intro I didn't have
a graphics card set out here and that is
because I basically said get a gtx 1070
for this bill but least that's what I'm
pairing it with and when it comes to GTX
sensitivities I mean pick your flavors
they all kind of perform within the same
relative range of each other as long as
you have like an aftermarket cooler and
you're overclocking a bit this is the
galaxy gtx 1070 x0c which is a pretty
decent overclocker and it's got a nice
little cooler on there as well so that's
what I'm going to be dropping in here
but hey if you find one on PC part
picker or wherever else that you get a
better deal on or anything like that as
long as it says GTX 1070 on it and it's
from a vendor you've heard of before you
know you know Asus MSI gigabyte EVGA
you'll be just fine but Galax I mean
they do a good job - a little harder to
come by in the US but then I already
tested this card and it is solid so
they're all the parts and now begins
ye-olde build time-lapse so wish me luck
and here goes
so what the build all completed and put
together I do have a little bit of
initial feedback on the assembly and
just a few of the quirks and everything
the case the mastercase pro sticks
overall I think it's done a pretty good
job here it's definitely some pros and
cons to it though I do like the look of
it I like to finish it's got sort of a
nice gray finish it's not quite black
but it's it's subtle and I feel like
appropriate there's some quirks to this
case that take a little bit of getting
used to but once you're used to them
you're getting more used to them so for
instance and as all these panels that
pop outs like this front panel I just
pop that and you can see
give it a couple centimeters of space
there the top panel can do that as well
as I just did there it feels a little
awkward at first but once you figure out
how it works you start to think okay
well that's pretty easy to pop up and
then that would just allow more air to
flow in there or floor flow out of there
whatnot so you kind of put yourself in
here flow mode for a better coolie the
top front panel connectors here are
again sort of strange they're kind of
tucked away in this old panel which just
flips it up in them it's got a rubber
piece right that it holds in that puts
all the way back in a magnet holds it in
place
actually magnets hold lots of these
pieces in places place so it makes it
easier to pop them on and off again once
you get used to but there's i/o then
like for the front piece here if you
don't want to put it in airflow mode
like that you can also just remove it by
like lifting all the way out like that
and that kind of pulled the back and
then you can just lift it off which
again it's pretty easy and that gives
you access to the front panel for
cleaning out your desk filters or
whatnot and this this you just grab from
the bottom to pull off so pretty good as
far as airflow and dust filtration goes
it can get a little awkward down around
here at the back though because there's
also a piece back here which also kind
of pops off which I don't know I might
just not use this piece honestly if I
had this case come on the fence about it
because you can imagine if you had all
your cables coming back through here
this would be stuck you couldn't get it
off without removing all those cables
but you need to remove it in order to
get at the thumb screws so it makes
removing the side panels I think a
little bit more complicated than it
needs to be speaking of which let's move
that side man now the side panels have
this cool trick you can do where if you
pull back like that it will just sort of
hang like that which is actually kind of
nice and then again you just lift it off
there's just some kind of catches down
there along the base of that that holds
it in place and then I like that they
have a protective piece over there to
cover your power supply area I thought
that was a nice to have that you don't
always see this is not a tempered glass
piece on here on the side so that is one
thing I feel like was I don't know it
would be interesting to see this case
with just tempered glass
and as is insert instead of just flexi
but then internally you can see
everything you know
it all fits in there thanks thankfully
and I will say that the a.m. for mounts
for the coolest year the master air pro
4 is not too difficult it's pretty much
the same mount situation that you have
with like a hyper 212 the am4 bracket
does not ship with this cooler right now
though they will be doing I believe an
updated version of it that does ship m4
compatible they will send you an AM for
mounting kit which they sent me for my
hyper 212 Evo and since it's the same
mounting solution I was able to just use
that for the master air pro 4 as well
and I do like the look of this - I think
that black cab brush metal plate gives
it a much cleaner finished look and puts
this kind of more inline with some of
the coolers who've been seen from micro
rig and enter max that's it you know do
a good job cooling but also looks pretty
decent as well so I will be coming back
to the system and doing some testing and
benchmarks got to check out some of the
new BIOS updates for the X 370 Tai Chi
from as rack right there see if I can
get some higher memory memory speeds
going and just see what kind of gaming
and workstation performance we get from
this system the 1200 to 1400 dollars
rise and build for March 2017 but thanks
for watching this video guys really hope
you've enjoyed it hit the thumbs up
button if you did I'll be back soon with
more videos on Paul's hardware</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
