and I have been really bad about posting
videos lately so I'm gonna do a really
quick one here this is just a vlog video
and not necessarily tech related but I
know I've been talking a lot about my
new place and the reasons why I haven't
posted much so to show you kind of why I
haven't been posting much as well let's
give you an idea of what might be coming
in the future I thought I'd do a quick
house walkthrough so this is a new house
of my wife and I moved into it's a
little three-bedroom two-bath place
we're really excited about it it's
worked out great for us we're still
moving in although we've been here for
about a month so far but here's a quick
look I'm actually starting in the back
so let me flip around here I can see
what I'm doing alright so this is our
bedroom tada
isn't it nice little we do have a
sliding door that leads out into the
backyard the backyards not much to look
at right now this house was like
unoccupied for a good year before we
moved into it and they did not water the
back lawn so we have a bunch of space
out there but yeah not much going on
there right now that's a much much
further down the road project we do have
an ensuite learn that word recently from
watching house hunters ensuite bathroom
right here so there you go there's our
bathroom also backyard again alright so
there's a here's our bathroom okay
moving right along
you got a hallway so three rooms here at
the back there's another room that's
very dark right now look the light wood
works here's part of the reason why not
a lots been going on because I had to do
some electrical work here in the in the
new house which was fun learning how to
do that this light switch here for
example wasn't connected to anything I
had to pull that off and rewire it and
got that to work here's like the hallway
leading to the front of the house we got
some built-in storage suite we close
this door over here on the left is just
some kind of a coat closet this is the
computer room right now so there's
there's my wife's orange computer if you
guys remember that my wife's a little
work area set up right there
let me get the front of the house sorry
it's really dark in here guys but then
that is like a huge pile of parts
computer and otherwise which I will be
moving out to the garage eventually then
over here if you guys can even see this
that's my computer it's really dark okay
yeah don't necessarily need light in
here when using the computer but my desk
is just a huge mess anyway out on the
hall we have
norine she's she's very cute alright so
here's a like everything so front door
right there of course that's how you get
in there's the kitchen there's kind of
the dining room and it's very open which
we liked so like everything's kind of
opened through from the kitchen into the
living room there's a it had like a
little built-in carpet area so that's
that's the entertainment center if you
guys recognize that from my apartment
tour that I did a while back
everything's all set up I have this
right there which is our cable box also
a little HD PC I might have a project
coming up for that in the future we got
like our World of Warcraft and and star
star trek action figures
and I check that out look this one's
actually some signed by ad by Jordy by
levar burton right there that was cool
also this is my wife's final fantasy 7
your final fantasy 8 guardian force
action figure anyway sweet huh
but yeah so there's there's an
entertainment center here's an awesome
feature of this apartment right there oh
yeah
that's Verizon FiOS fiber-to-the-home
50 down 25 up that's why this video is
gonna upload so quick once I'm done with
it some more curtains say that's another
project we've been working on in past
weekend's putting up some curtains that
was necessary we're kind of Cleaning
today which is why things are a bit kind
of chaotic in here but that's a sword
Inori that scenaries create this is
video equipments we've already been
shooting videos here for New Age TV this
is like our storage area this this pile
here was massive we it's right after we
moved in and we've been sort of chipping
it away at it a bit
time the dining room table is also a
mess again doing some lining of the
shelves all that good stuff here's look
at the kitchen
you got a that that's bacon grease from
this morning's breakfast nice new
appliances right there that's pretty
cool I like the kitchen it's not massive
but it's it's pretty functional although
again the electric whoo whatever
electrician did our electric work in
this house
before I moved in was brain dead or
something we did such a poor job like
the the power outlet behind the
refrigerator just wasn't there there's a
lot of power outlets that just weren't
installed at all and I had to kind of
take the blank panel off like they would
just have a blank panel like that one
right there
I still haven't checked to see what's
behind that one I have to pull that off
and kind of put in an actual outlets and
there's Nuria again should I do a
channel just for nori you guys would you
guys like that lots of videos if air I
could put them up call it Paul dog tips
okay I here's actually the real reason I
wanted to do this video it's right here
this is the door right off the kitchen
this leads into the garage and this is
going to be my workspace and as you can
maybe see right now it's pretty much
just a pile of everything we also got a
washer/dryer that was a fun that was a
fun install actually did some work on
the gas line behind there to get that
set up
but yeah cool new washer/dryer from LG
those are fun do a good job anyway so
yeah as you can probably see out here
just storage but cool things about this
garage first off it's finished
there's drywall and everything all
around the outside so that's pretty cool
helps kill a little bit of the noise
from the outside no garage door opener
right now so that's a manual affair but
you know we'll get to that eventually so
we can see a bunch of moving boxes we
can see a bunch of my hardware this is
my desk that I had in the computer room
at the apartments right now it's being
used as a temporary workbench slash
storage area is my new lawnmower that
was kind of cool
I'm happy with my new lawnmower I get an
electric one which I know maybe isn't
quite as manly or it's hard for as the
gas powered ones but it's supposed to
save power and sorry this big this is
this is just a blanket that's blocking
the way but so yeah you can see there is
some of my test beds and stuff that are
still in their boxes but basically my
plan is and I'm gonna do some work logs
for this to kind of show you guys over
in this corner in the back I'm going to
set up something I want to do some
framing around here and hang some lights
and make a workbench in a work table and
all this stuff and that's what I'm gonna
hopefully get some work done on today I
want to start clearing this area out
well yeah eventually I'm going to start
shooting videos I hear that is the plan
and I really hope I can get it done soon
but that's probably gonna do it for this
video thank you for watching me walk
through my home with my with my camera
this is just my cell phone I've been
shooting this on so I'm sorry if the
audio quality isn't so hot but I really
appreciate you guys bearing with me
through the move and everything I
hopefully have a lot of exciting stuff
still to come and I don't forget to
subscribe we'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
