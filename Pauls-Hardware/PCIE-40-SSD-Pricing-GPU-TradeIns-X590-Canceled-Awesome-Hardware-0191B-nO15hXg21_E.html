he may post in that dough have access to
the show no I think he sent it to
Heather maybe and she put here and
that's amazing
so I'm wondering if okay so we'll follow
up on anyone who has already donated we
did go through there's some new ones are
there some new ones in there any ones
here so crafty okay all right so you're
on porn bot detail crafty you'll be on
donation detail we're good thanks
alright yep so anyone who happened to
donate on my half that didn't get a
shout out or their comment read we will
be doing that during the after party so
that sounds like a great idea
thanks crafty thanks for taking over for
so speaking of porn bots hello everyone
and welcome to awesome Hardware perfect
segue this is a live show we talk about
technology we have a few drinks
occasionally we use adult language so
watch out for that don't watch the show
if you don't like an occasional curse
word or some some light drinking of
course today's show is episode number
191 and we already did half of the show

stuff and I should put my links in my
description you should that be used very
good at that I mean I point that I try
to point that out every time it it has
absolutely nothing to do with me feeling
a sense of superiority because no that's
not there at all and you know it's
working because every time you say it I
do feel inferior and like oh god I
didn't do it again really doing that I
have like kind of a a method no you did
I go through yeah I'm gonna do the show
and that's just always kind of been part
of it is just taking that drop
you're don't thing is stronger than not
really just a matter of survey of
integrating that into your standard
procedure yes of course the subliminal
messaging is oh my god zero chance is
watching from the future that was
amazing what zero chance
yeah who's that just watch it for the
future okay we'll find out we'll find
out eventually it's not creepy it's the
point if you guys like our shows or the
content we make or you just want to buy
some super-sweet merchandise to check
out our stores Walt's heart bred net for
mine shirts mugs pint glasses they're
all real nice we have never I've really
never heard no do you be the first time
owner of any one any single one of these
pride no I was gonna say we have we've
never really gotten I've never gotten a
complaint about the products that we
sell neither about like I've never had
anyone come back and be like it's not
really oh you got to use the other side

feel free to join us if you want to
drink drink response leaves drink
responsibly though and that kind of
thing cows or is bit with that tech
slash store
sure is he also has a wide variety
mentioned ice it's all sourced from the
same place if you buy stuff while we're
doing the live show we will shout out
your name at the end of the show John
uhrin after-party and if you buy from
both of our stores will get shipped
together you a little bit of a shipping
discount refund so it's true
exactly exactly
alright let's go into tech news let's do
it
what's on the list Oh
that's why News News News all right it's
a first stop exciting we have a bit of a
correction from a story we talked about
I think last week last week because we
talked about we already know x5 70 is
the new chipset that's coming out to go
along with the release of the rise in
3000 series processors right pardon me
that are coming out on July 7 7 7 mm-hmm
because there's 7 nanometre mm-hmm we
talked last week about the potential of
an x5 90 chipset based on some
documentation from some motherboard
manufacturers and whatnot that according
to gamers Nexus do be a source dubious
at best but they say given the cows
wearing it gamers Nexus sure maybe a
shirt as well anyway Steve reports the
articles written up by Eric Hamilton
Doba Steve reports that X 590 not going
to be a thing or at least not going to
be a thing in the context that we
expected to potentially be a thing this
was probably early documentation
possibly early plans that they had in
place to possibly do an x5 70 chipset
and an x5 90 chipset differentiating
them by X 590 having PCI Express Gen 4
support for an x5 70 not having that
support so they're potentially going to
do a couple tiers of higher-end
motherboards and I for one am glad that
they did not they apparently have gone
with the decision to only do X 570 X 570
having gens for support but if there is
going to be an X 590 it's probably
potentially going to be a threader for 3
chipset there's already been a lot of
rumors flying around about thread River
3 it makes sense where you have epic
chips based on the 7 nanometer and them
taking that same epic configuration and
translating it down to a high-end
desktop implementation like they did
with earlier versions of epic and thread
Ripper 1 and 2 would make a lot of sense
yep and for those of us at home who get
excited about this sort of thing the
potential for like up to 64 core
high-end desktop platforms so that's
that's kind of fun that's kind of fun
like for all the excitement about rising
3000 and everything like if AMD in a
couple months is gonna be like oh yeah
and here's threader for three yeah
with that kind of core count and like
configuration they my goodness and these
may be students but not fire easily I
really I really hope the benchmarks and
everything back up all the hype and
everything yeah but all right beyond
that this is actually from a I mean a
lot of you guys probably follow a gamer
gamers Nexus so you probably watched
their news video yesterday so you might
be aware of this stuff but we're
repeating it nonetheless yeah the second
thing from this set of data was the be
550 and eight 520 silicon that that
talking about as media creating now I
was given the impression at some point
that be 550 was just not gonna be a
thing that they were gonna have X 570 as
like the the Halo product the high-end
for the mate the mainstream high-end and
then for people who wanted to spend less
or didn't need all those features you
just still have be 450 and and a for
what and whatever those stupid a chips
they're gonna 2840 I don't ever pay
attention to it but it does appear
according to this information that there
is a be 550 and a 520 chipset in the
works which might be good news for
people who are looking for more recent
launches of current platform stuff and
not wanting to go with last gen products
last gen some degree according to the
article which is sourced from digi x
which requires a membership which Steve
pays for mmm but then he takes the
information and writes it here for us
what a great good job Steve thanks for
dinner
it's like piracy but as media is on on
the hook to produce these chips
expectation as for the motherboards
based on them to arrive in early 2020 so
be 450 right now and and I think still
going forward we still need to wait for
tests on the day you know on the X 570
versus 2 B 5 B 450 and everything just
to give us an idea like is there really
any
performance difference there anything
like that I think p450 is still a very
viable yeah budget option and there's
lots of good motherboards based on that
and most don't see a point for beef by
50 yeah this is why it was so plausible
that there wouldn't be a beef I 50
because what are you really getting out
of it
that'd be 450 doesn't deliver and so the
question remains and is it's not
answered by this article is whether if
these new chips that's are going to come
out do they support PCI Express Gen 4 it
would kind of make sense for them not to
again to keep that you know the sort of
halo feature for the X 570 chipset but
at the same time like Chow said what's
the point you then of making B 550 and a
520 if there's not some level of support
for that so we will have to wait and see
there might be a little more limited
support fewer lanes some Gen 4 lanes and
7 gen 3 is it's hard to say for sure
for now P 450 is probably going to
remain the best budget option if you
don't need that PCI Express Gen 4
support and honestly right now or for
the foreseeable future at least this
year there's going to be no point to PCI
Express Gen 4 beyond people using really
high-end superfast nvme SSDs yeah which
are pretty awesome because they go up to
like five thousand megabytes a second
reads and upwards of 4,000 megabytes per
second writes that's pretty cool on a
single drive don't get me wrong but not
everyone needs that yeah so anyway pick
your poison
I needed some new stuff coming out soon
but x5 90 is probably not gonna be it
moving on here I was looking at his joke
of it hero
here are you having too much fun okay
sorry about that plot twist
he's the porn bot this is an article
from The Washington Post which does have
a pay gate actually hey Pete yeah
Washington Post you have to pay if you
want old tables okay you can make like
you can watch you can read up to four or
five and the single instance yeah just
open them in an incognito tab and you
can watch it
many as you want anyway point being this
dude
Jeffrey Fowler the the the guy wrote the
article did a bunch of testing with
Chrome and he found that my goodness is
there a lot of tracking going on this is
an opinion piece but for anyone who's
concerned about privacy or it's
concerned about being tracked I was just
concerned about the level of information
that a lot of online companies are are
getting at now that is that is
apparently being aided and abetted by
Google's Chrome browser it's it's it's
pretty out of hand and you know if you
look at the numbers he took a deep dive
into Chrome's handling of data
he ran experiments on how it operates
under the hood and one test he found a
week's worth of web browsing uncovered
over 11,000 requests for tracking
cookies the chrome allowed by default
all of which Firefox because he was
doing a comparison test between Chrome
and Firefox automatically blocked we've
talked about some recent updates to
chrome that are going to seriously
disable the vast majority of the
abilities for ad blockers such as you
block origin which we recommend you use
which we also are happy if you whitelist
us on but we totally don't blame you if
you don't because man a lot of ads are
very invasive and especially the you
know we it really makes sense to run an
ad blocker for a general internet usage
these days chrome welcomed trackers even
at private sites he claims Aetna and
federal student aid sights set cookies
for Facebook and Google which in turn
told the tech companies whenever he
would pull up the insurance and loan
services login pages
he also said google signs him into his
own account so you know for this for the
for the cost of that convenience is like
oh like this website just knows who I am
I can go ahead and you know you're
giving up a lot of potentially personal
information for some people that might
not be a big deal for others that might
feel invasive and like their like their
you know their pants in you just looking
at your bare ass
and there's nothing you can do about it
not a good image I don't know that's one
way of putting it
point being Firefox has many more
privacy protections by default Mozilla
the Mozilla developer referenced in the
article said Firefox offers enhanced
tracking protection and the privacy
shouldn't be an option for users to
manage with switches and dials so
basically not saying like sure you can
do stuff to Chrome and get add-ons and
various things like that that might give
you a little bit more enhanced privacy
but it shouldn't be up to you to go in
and do that the browser should sort of
default to you know a certain level of
privacy and security for you
Fowler also says he found that there was
no way to defang at Chrome but he claims
it's not as simple as opening up an
incognito tab changing browsers it's as
simple as the most effective solution so
if you guys didn't notice
and we both it's funny because I I came
over today to Paul's house and he was
like oh setting up the stream is a
little bit different because I'm using
Firefox now and I was like you switched
over to Firefox too because I just I
literally just switched over from I've
been using Google Chrome forever
I literally switched over earlier this
week and then I go to Paul's he's like
yeah I switch to so it just seems
there's a lot of reasons to be more
specific
io pretty much every system I have has
both Firefox and Chrome both in the same
same and I typically use them as
interchangeable browsers I usually have
likes logged in on some stuff in one and
locked in on some stuff in another I
find that to be convenient right no I
have mobile browsers on every system
chrome is typically the first one that I
load up yeah but I'm gonna be switching
that over to Firefox so yeah there we go
Firefox choose choose Mozilla team if
there any of you guys yes yes to the
Firefox all right we're just gonna talk
some quick trash trash about EA it was
easy to do both talking smack did you
hear about this this is from almost a
week ago so it's already been sort of
chewed on but we you know it's up to us
to bring up and continue to point that
stuff like
this yeah ei had a discussion about loot
boxes this was sort of interesting venue
for it - because representatives from
both EA and epic actually met with the
UK the United Kingdom Parliament's
digital cultural called digital Culture
Media and Sport Committee just wide
pretty much that's all like a world
that's all the entertainment to the
world for everything we know they have
been investigating addictive and
immersive technologies however hmm and
this led to a variety of interesting
situations for instance Prince Harry was
there Prince Harry
no he wasn't there he Prince Harry has
criticized for tonight in the pack
really yeah
Prince Harry has an opinion on fortnight
course yeah he said Wow
what's new says it shouldn't be allowed
no because social media is dangerous and
stuff like that because social media
gamer article pins Harry is the Duke of
Sussex Duke of stuff night commander of
the Royal Victorian order personal
aide-de-camp of Her Majesty the Queen
Elizabeth the second longer reign King
of dragons ruler of the handles in the
first men the breaker of chains breaker
of chains mother of dragons okay what
was I talking about I'm sure he gets
that all the time all right
but apart from Prince arias criticism
fortnight Kerry Hopkins who is the VP of
legal and government affairs for E a was
asked about loot boxes which have been
outlawed in some European countries and
including Belgium and in another cool
country wants to be like built France as
they're all competing to have the best
fries yeah Belgian fries french fries no
it's bad joke let's move on quickly
getting nervous I think I should be able
to read and say
point being chat seems to hate Harry she
was asked about loot boxes and whether
they're ethical and she said yes of
course they're ethical they're ethical
and fun and by the way ei doesn't call
them loot boxes they're called surprise
mechanics that sounds way funnier and
less it sounds way more innocuous
because loot boxes has gambling keel and
a negative connotation surprise
mechanics oh that's like a particle
surprise what did I get
yeah how innocent that's what they call
them surprise that's hero what are you
doing Wow marketing is here everything
here oh yeah coughing up a another dog
here step it yeah here all my goodness
yo Bobby he's a big boy boy they
compared them to like toys that you get
a little surprise in like a kinder egg
oh it's hatching moles totally the same
but yeah I remember gambling for all of
my McDonald's toys yeah and the Happy
Meal is just rolling the dice a lot of
the time what it boils down to for stuff
like this is whether or not the the
prizes and loot boxes can be traded for
monetary value and again a lot of times
a lot of the time they can so it varies
from game to game I think like if you
want to get rid of all the all the fluff
and whatever other nonsense stuff that
is talked about and them calling it
surprise mechanics versus whatever
whatever else you're talking about large
companies that have a bottom line to try
to meet and that often try to make as
much money as possible
out of whatever their property happens
to be EA's property is lots of different
video games and the model of having
extra stuff that you can buy in game on
top of whatever initial upfront cost you
pay has proven to be extremely lucrative
especially for certain games that have
gained a lot of popularity hero hates
that type of game EAS has tried to
recreate this in many different senses
but they've often fallen flat because
they they get ahead of themselves before
attempting to create an awesome game
that lots of people will play and
like okay lots of people playing this
let's try to like me you know milk more
money from it by adding stuff that
people can buy they go about it the
other way like how can we possibly
monetize this game the most ways
possible while it's currently in
development right then you have games at
launch and and people are like this game
is just a money suck it's just
constantly trying to sell me stuff it's
more about making it a business than a
game exactly so and loop boxers are
among the more egregious offenders in
this category so yeah really all people
are asking yay it's just like make good
game make good fun games and stop
seeming constantly like you're just
trying to maximize profits right like
it's so obvious like there's so many
good game developers out there who just
like really wanna like use their
creativity and whatever to make it an
awesome experience for people out there
yeah and then you have the you know
marketing or or whatever the the
business people come in they're like you
know we need to monetize this just
shitty shinny like everything that's
good right some big company has to buy
up and then try to milk as much profit
as possible as inking
I can't out of it that's like invariable
or do you notice capable do you know if
like the loot boxes in question or like
performance upgrades or if they're just
cosmetic or if it's a mixture of both
are there any like differing schools of
thought you know between between what
type of loot boxes are available or is
just the general consensus is that
they're all bad even if it's for
cosmetic good this this is this is like
a an inquiry in in the UK and like like
members of parliament or asking and
stuff like that so I don't think they
quite drilled down to that level of
detail when it comes to like specific
different games that use different loot
boxes yeah they were referring I believe
to FIFA quite a bit I'm not too familiar
with how the loot boxes work in their
name but I think FIFA is also quite a
significant cash cow for them yeah cuz
cuz cuz the football football very pop
okay some people on chat are saying
FIFA luboc Azhar play to win way to win
yeah you're pay to win yeah which is
terrible like III honestly don't have a
problem with well here's the thing it's
weird like from a developer's standpoint
like I don't have a problem with loot
boxes if they're just cosmetic however
if they can be or if they are traded and
sold for real money then I can see that
being a real problem for you know kids
who are now gambling to get loot boxes
so they can sell them for real cash and
buy other things or whatever it's it's
like consequential it's like it's not
the loot boxes itself that are a problem
if it's just cosmetic it's not the loot
boxes itself that's the issue but what
they can kind of lead to if they're
traded and sold for real money then it
becomes a serious issue
obviously the pay2win loot boxes where
it's like this actually helps you gain
an advantage in game either
competitively or through the campaign or
whatever against other players that's
there's a huge moral dilemma there that
I just definitely don't agree with
cosmetic thing is a slippery slope
I feel like cosmetics it's like you can
phrase it and disguise it in such a way
where it seems harmless but if there's
this underground market of like trading
csgo skins for example that are just
purely cosmetic but still have a lot of
real money involved that is changing
hands between like 12-year olds that's
there's there's something really wrong
with that too so I feel like I don't
know we're kind of is there any
regulation like there needs to be some
sort of regulation at some point if if
this is the way it's gonna be I don't
know I just like I think for a lot of
online business models and I'm going
broader here not just video games and
everything but like a lot of music
streaming services for example like a
lot of these services where you you they
they their goal is to sort of rope you
into paying a monthly fee mm-hmm or to
rope you into paying money over and over
again for something like a loop box or
something like you know a season pass or
something like that
like I think a lot of people are I can
speak for myself I'm getting sick of a
lot of it I'm oh yeah and and for me I
like I kind of want to revert back to
the old model a lot of certain ways like
I'm less interested
paying the monthly fee for the online
music service where suddenly you know
their deal with a certain record label
is gonna go go down and right I'm gonna
lose access to a third of the library or
something like that
sure versus that too just like my own
personal mp3 library that I'm
downloading and saving locally and
having saved on my devices similar to
like I I kind of want to veer back
towards games that just have a simpler
model of like year here's our game
here's the game pay us $40 for it and
play it over 50 48 to 60 dollars
depending on you know the what it's
worth and now you have the game there's
nothing that you never you never have to
deal with ads in the game or something
in the game making you feel like you're
not getting and blow your experience
unless you're paying more money right or
anything like that just like here's yeah
yeah it's a simpler model Hales back to
a simpler time yeah NES days but that's
that's kind of what I've been feeling
recently anyway I totally am right there
with you man brief brief aside but let's
crazy world we live in let's move on to
PCI Express Gen 4 which we talked a
little bit about on Kyle's half and we
mentioned the only real use for PCI
Express Gen 4 right now or in the near
future is superfast nvme SSDs so kind of
good in the instance that for people who
don't really need extremely fast storage
you can probably get by with something
like a B 450 motherboard don't
necessarily need to get onto that PCI
Express Gen 4 train right away also very
nice for people who were like wow I do
video editing or something else that
deals with a lot of heavy i/o on a on a
drive these are freaking amazing so how
much is it going to cost is what I was
trying to get to to 49 to 49 one pair
mine one terabyte that's not bad
actually that is the pricing for
Coursera's next-gen PCI Express 4.0 SSDs
which are now available on Amazon that's
pretty reasonable presale so presale so
you know we typically don't recommend
that but yeah article from PC gamer here
also lists some competing SSD
in their pricing like a 970 evil plus
one terabyte is 218 dollars WD black SN
750 one terabyte 216 dollars so that's
not that much more I mean
250 yeah that's pretty comfortable and
considering the significant bump up in
performance because there's really only
one controller made by Faison mm-hmm
it's gonna be available right at lunch
there's others that are that are gonna
come out but that files on controller is
pretty impressive in and of itself yeah
all of the drives are gonna have similar
performance because all it's really
gonna matter is a man that they paired
it up with sure and we're looking at
four thousand megabytes per second or
four gigabytes per second writes five
thousand megabytes per second or five
gigabytes per second reads converter
like 1500 that's like ten times the
performance of us of a SATA SSD a SATA
read three sixty eight gigabit per
second SS do ten times jump that's
that's a lot it's not so a lot of people
who are currently running SATA raid
arrays or even high-end nvme raid arrays
can get that equivalent performance with
a single drive with these new drives
mmm-hmm so I'm happy that there it
appears that they're not launching at an
insane price yeah it's still expensive
don't get me wrong you can get a one
terabyte SATA or a lower-end nvme SSD
like a six 60p that uses qlc flash or
something like that you can get that for
around a hundred and ten two hundred and
twenty dollars yeah
so you're still looking at probably a
little bit more than double the price
per gigabyte compared to something like
that but of course you're getting much
much more impressive performance yeah
for the people who actually need that
kind of throughput it's well worth it
yeah it's not it's very reasonable
pricing specifically if your interests
in the ratings for this Corsair MP six
hundred four thousand nine hundred and
fifty megabytes per second sequential
read the 970 Evo plus tops out at 3500
megabytes per second mm-hm so that's a
it's a nice jump thanks notes it's a
nice jump SN 750 goes to about three
in 470 so yeah and then just imagine
like we would like some of the demos
that I was seeing at Computex where
they're rating you know two or three of
these things together four of them
together for PC agent for they I can get
speeds up to fifteen thousand megabytes
a second that's really good sequential
reads like I hope I can test that at
some point that just sounds insane
especially you know if you're editing
like 4k or a ke video I'm in the film
industry I could see I could see a big
shift in the film industry especially
because there's this huge emphasis on 8k
now on 8k video I stuck to Chris about
this I'm sure he has some sunlight to
shit on it but that was one of the demos
that they showed at the AMD press event
just before e3 was a I think it was like
a I think it was a raid a raid array
that they had with PCIe gen for several
nvme drives playing just regular
playback at you know 1x speed real-time
on an 8k workflow and it was just
buttery smooth just playing like a
regular video whereas I think on PCIe
gen3 the equivalent setup was chugging
along pretty pretty consistently it was
pretty choppy and stuff so this is this
is a big deal this is a really big deal
I think it's probably the biggest
feature that rise in 3000 brings to the
table honestly for content creation its
bold bold statement I'll see I'm a bold
a bold man alright for those of you who
are looking to the next generation and
kind of kind of trying to suss out
pricing and expectations maybe that
gives you a little bit better idea of
how much money you need to save to
invest and yes a couple people in chat
we're asking if raids gonna be a thing
yes absolutely it is crafty is
apparently in charge crafty whatever
raid you want us to promote even if it's
please don't let it be porn related
because we're already trying to kill the
porn BOTS but anything you want man just
put in the show dock and we'll get to it
and welcome so enjoy the show no cells
here but he's he's not moderating he is
just chilling he's enjoying the glorious
viewing of us and the things we say
what's the like being on the other side
south
he's probably it's not gonna want to
moderate any more because he amazed he
realizes how awesome they just have an
office-based moment all right final news
bit story from my half is this EVGA
thing this one out in the newsletter a
lot of you guys who have purchased EVGA
cards in the past but a lot of people
who I've talked to have have spoken
highly of them for various reasons their
customer service is pretty pretty high
up there among those reasons and I will
absolutely back up anyone who who wants
to say that and I would agree yeah
however they also have a long history of
interesting trading deals for people who
have maybe a slightly older card who are
looking to potentially upgrade it go
through that ends they just sent out a
newsletter for an event that is starting
tomorrow or an opportunity that's
starting tomorrow and I'm not sure this
is still part of their step-up program I
don't know if it's exactly part of their
step-up program that's not in any of the
documentation here but for anyone who
has a 900 series of 700 series and video
graphics card EVGA specifically I guess
you'd have to have EVGA you are going to
be able to trade it in to get credit
towards a 20 Series card okay now
there's two two aspects to this I want
to point out here
first off training in a 900 or 700
series card if it's a reasonable
trade-in value and to be clear that is
not specified here that's what it says
though if it's a reasonable trade-in
value no that's what I'm saying oh okay
if EVGA is giving a reasonable price for
these trade ins icing you know I and if
you have a 700 C I just found a use for
this card here like this is a kingpin
put that right there that's a classified
classified classified your hold hold
that thank you thank you guys I'll be
your Vanna White this is a 770
classified absolutely drool-worthy card
in its time oh yeah I would debate the
efficacy of getting the classified
serious card within 770 there's also a
780 and 780 Ti classified card that I
feel like might have been a better
investment at the time 770 you know
you're going for a more price to
performance area anyway my cards are
always absolutely over built and good
job so if you have one of these cards
you know they're not they're not pulling
their weight quite quite as much as they
used to so taking like a 700 series card
trading it in getting maybe a one to two
hundred dollar credit for it towards a
card that you wanna upgrade to maybe
that's a good deal for you not 100
percent of the time though because you
have to also consider if I were to just
put this card up on Craigslist or Ebay
or matter how much can I get for it in
cash right that's really what you're
weighing in your mind here right the
benefit here of going through EVGA is
you don't have to worry about putting up
a sale meeting some sketchy dude and
from Craigslist you know what's like
traded crack or something like that for
the card instead of money like changes
the meeting locations at the last second
right and you know it's a reputable
source yeah it's a reputable source and
everything looking at me and maybe all
you really want to do is upgrade to a 20
Series card maybe that's a perfect
solution for you they just applied that
exact balance to towards new so that's
what I was they have not said exactly
how much money you're gonna get for your
card that you trade in I was trying to
find their actual wording here because
they do say it specifically oh Jesus
here this is all these million doses all
they say significant these are the words
that they're saying as far as the dollar
value that you might get for your trade
in a significant discount on a 20 Series
card such a subjective words so we've
got to wait and you guys you guys follow
up tomorrow this launches tomorrow I'm
kind of curious how much they're gonna
be offering people for their 700 series
cards right and hundred series cards and
so on and so forth yeah second part of
this though which I'm gonna say is a bad
idea
0% financing for 12 months now have a
payment plan on your G
you guys just to be absolutely clear
here I am NOT a fiduciary I am NOT a
financial adviser he's not your finance
guy but my where I'm coming from here
don't finance a graphics card they're
bigger adult things to worry about
you've got the money just spends and you
know you've been saving and you've got
that cash to spend on it you know dive
in here they don't finance it
don't don't buy something with such a
precipitous fall off in value yeah that
I'm a year from now as you're making
that payment you're gonna be like man
this is a bet it's just I am bring you
to the head month after month is gonna
seem like a horse idea every month it's
gonna seem like a worse idea in goes
gonna be more regret that seeps in if
you want it now buy it and it's gonna be
great but if you can't afford it there's
an all-in-one there's a tiny cutout of
people and apparently I was reading a
few comments in this neighborhood
there's a tiny cutout of people and
maybe this is more common in the EU or
something like that I have no idea but
there's a small number of people who are
that careful and confident with their
money because this is a 0% financing
offer sure so if you pay it off within
12 months you're not paying any extra
yeah it's not that paying the cost of
the card if if you're that kind of
person that small percentage of people
that can be like yes I have this
financial plan and this budget that I
save and I'm gonna put that towards a
graphics card then yes there may be
there's a small number of people who
this will work for sure
but I'm gonna say most people just just
don't spend money that you have not that
you're gonna have in the future right
that's just my advice I feel like this
is this is like setup for kids like kids
who maybe have like a $50 allowance
every month yeah it's like hey mom and
dad I'll give you 50 bucks to mow the
lawn every week you know for the next 12
months if you give me this graphics card
and like okay in a perfect world that'll
probably work out smoothly and there
won't be any issues there but I feel
like the yeah like most buyers like Paul
said you're either gonna be able to pay
this and afford it in one lump sum or if
you really are struggling that badly
where you need to space out your
payments on
graphics card maybe you should consider
using that money on more important
things or maybe just consider that you
don't need a 20 atti or a 20 80 or
whatever like you can there's the you
can still game gotta get that rate
racing pole there's lots of graphics
cards that you can still play video
games with gotta get that Kazi you know
sweet like one or two hundred dollars
trainer like or like you're trading in a
900 series card and you'll get probably
still doing fine with that 900 series
card for you know for 1080 gaming so
that's tracing none of the race yeah so
I hope I hope EVGA appreciates that I've
promoted their offer here but also that
I recommend no peoples through the
financing option no one uses hey also
just want to point out just FYI that the
770 classify this is badass that this
super high-end like high-end for its
time graphics card classified premium
has no backplate see that was before we
started being like where's the backplate
image a it's just a little cosmetic
detail that here this is a lot about how
far we've come yeah I mean you go back
to the 700 series timeframe like yeah
the back it's it's a backplate has
become just a given such a you know
yeah actually given like you you don't
you don't want a nice graphics card well
that if I come back got a back plate
these days so how spoiled we are people
are saying their GTX 680 s have back
please you're right well bully for you
back plate just traps in the heat nobody
and then we get into a bank do it I
don't know why was offensive cat alright
guys my half is gonna be slightly short
hey today because I want to move on to
the after party hey you cuz that's
that's where the action actually happens
yeah so check out the link in the
description if you want to move on to
the after party on youtube if you're
watching on twitch just don't do
anything you can continue to watch Kyle
drink whisky and we will answer some of
your questions
read some donation comments and we'll go
