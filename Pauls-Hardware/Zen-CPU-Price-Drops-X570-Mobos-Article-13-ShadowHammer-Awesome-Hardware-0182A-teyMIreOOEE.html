really
yeah in in this week yeah random what
did I'm up the other time I was
recovering really old footage off of TV
tapes
digital DVD some DVD like tapes that I
have yeah and old project I did and
there was a snatch poster on the wall I
just remember see anything nice anyway
though hello everyone and welcome in a
awesome hardware so awesome this is a
live show that Kyle and I do every
Tuesday evening we talk about technology
and computers and also other random
stuff so thank you very much for joining
us if you're watching live we stream to
twitch TV / awesome hardware the entire
show and then I'm you tube we break it
up so the first half is gonna be on my
channel pulsar where the second half is
gonna be on Kyle's channel bit wit it's
all linked in the description and then
later I'm will do an after party if you
happen to buy stuff from our stores or
give donation comments during the show
we will be addressing those in the after
party so bear that in mind and we also
drink beer and we occasionally use adult
language very naughty but cheers thanks
for being here guys did I miss anything
no that was very efficient goal trying
to trying to move through it beautiful
our stores yes so speaking of buying
stuff if you like our our content and
the stuff we produce in our and or you
want to just hear us shout your name and
johnson in the after party feel free to
check out our stores my store is Paul's
Harbor net we now have captive
thumbscrew designs it's new design which
is super awesome
it's just everyone everyone really likes
it and they think it's probably the best
design ever I think see it's a captive
something to rave reviews there you go
so buy that or anything else on my store
it's all real it's all real nice we
should we should create reviews on our
on our stores and just like five-star
all of them like like so many other
manufacturers do a lot of companies yeah
yeah we should I mean it's basically
what we're doing right now is
our stores a five-star review bamboo at
X slash stores Cal store he also has
real nice stuff there Mogis if you
happen to buy awesome hardware merch
don't worry the the proceeds are split
between us so you can buy from either
store but thanks to all you guys for
your support if you do buy stuff and we
hope you like it we try to make good
quality things ok violet your Johnson at
the end of the show yes we've certainly
she'll let us go into some discussion of
the technology news first off some good
news
I'm started I had the decision today at
the beginning of the show or when I was
planning it's like should I start with
the good news first or the bad news
first
we're doing good news first oh you're
gonna end on a bad note yeah I am so
you're gonna have to recover from that's
a bummer but anyway here's a good news
for anyone who's looking to maybe get a
new computer or needs a processor
horizon the the Zen plus stuff the rise
in 2000 series CPUs quite a few have had
some nice price drops recently most
notably the rise in 727 hundred which is
available on Amazon for er $20
Wow not currently in stock but ships in
four days I guess you have to wait that
I mean this this went up earlier today
so this usually goes for as much as 300
but usually around 250 or so that's
about a $30 price trap which makes it
very even more compelling than it
already was this is also on comes with
the Wraith spire which does a bit better
job of cooling so get this overclock at
a bit you'd basically have a 2700 X
right in that range so that's good deal
that's not all though 2600 is still the
same that's been 165 for quite a while
which is still a great deal 2600 X
though is down to about 185 if you get
out on new egg so that makes that brings
up the question 2,600 2,600 X you get a
bit more clock speed you do get a the
rate spire with the 2600 X as well 20
bucks more that's a trade-off you can
get it if you're not overclocking and
you want better cooling but I don't know
you can get I mean if you look for deals
the the hyper 212 Black Edition I got
that for 30 bucks I was on stuff for
like 22 or 23 what the rebate it was
with a rebate banana yeah and the 2700
220 and then the 27 X I guess 290 that's
not the greatest deal 2700 seems to be
sort of joining the 2600 is like a
really really nice sweet spot sleeping
you for yeah what uh hurt equivalent
what's the 9900 case still floating at
ninety nine hundred cased over well over
500 usually 52525 last I looked at it
which is a lot more the 9700 K which is
an eight-core non hyper serrated CPU
which the 2700 is like very comparable
to it's it's it's a little bit behind it
especially if you look at looking at
single core performance but it's more
than twice as much or about twice as
much $410 this is a 220 no comparison
there so a better value this could
potentially means n2 is coming we've
been talking about rumors for Zen - it's
supposed to be seven nanometer a little
chip --let's and might have as many as
16 cores and 32 threads on a single
little am for socket processor but we
don't know exactly when that's gonna
happen so right not too uncommon for the
order for price cuts for the last
generation leading up to a next
generation launching helps clear out
inventory and everything so if you can't
wait then that's that's a good deal
going along with that Zen to the Zen to
rumors we have X 570 some more rumors of
that this is from video cards accom and
this is just a text list of motherboard
SKUs that video card says they received
we've received a list of upcoming X 5:17
ASUS motherboards for AMD Rison 3000
series there they all are
including the crosshair 8 formula
crosshair 8 hero as well as Wi-Fi
edition crosshair 8 impact mini ITX cool
we got some Strix boards we've got some
prime boards we got a
Pro workstation board we got some tough
gaming boards in there too so Asus you
know not to not very not too surprising
to see all those but I would say nice
hopefully like that impact will come out
you know close to launched that's
something that asus has kind of been
known for delaying a little bit right um
but also a popular form factor for
people when I build a little tiny
computer with ace that's a new one 578 I
think the ACE is like more
oh no that's a workstation oh okay
workstation yeah Road right
ws usually workstation for you so maybe
they just maybe they just got the ACE
name for work their workstation line
yeah not sure it's a new one as rock
we've already kind of talked about this
but asrock also had a bunch of x5 70
series motherboards leaked that was
through the Eurasian Economic Commission
website so those are all listed there
they're all on a jumble of tech stuff so
it's hard to kind of see which is which
but you know I guess some in summer x0x
570 pro-4x 570 Pro for our to look they
have the the pro 4 and the revision to
come out at the same time that is
thinking ahead there as rock-headed
themselves x5 7 TM Pro 4 actually the
well we only know of the x5 70 chipset
according to this the like the be 450
and be 350 some of the budget issues all
right I'm sorry as Rock Pro boards there
are actually some good deals for what
you get for the price so something you
might anyway what are they gonna call
the the budget boards be 550 it looks
like when X 5 70 comes out that will be
to kind of go along with the new CPUs I
mean assuming these like screenshots are
accurate at all and that X 470 be 450
and I guess 8320 will still exist ok so
and and replace they've also been stuff
like MSI had the BIOS update that went
out that said it was for rising 3000
series support and everything so like if
my my guest right now based on all these
rumors and everything is that there's
something like you know you need an x5
70 board for support for the highest end
chips but then you still can use x4 70
or be 450 for other ones I don't know
we'll see what kind of a trade-off you
get there I have to imagine that and
hopefully for people to learn especially
if they're going for 16 core a butte
Mike why do you need to be 450 successor
though I guess my new models new design
I can see updated be 415 chipset
motherboards coming out from
manufacturers with may be updated power
delivery if that's required for the
higher court count CPUs that would be
good
something like that but I mean it's not
really necessary if being for if it's
not gonna add features right now yeah
it's true
x5 70 might be more features
oh well X I'm sorry x5 70 is supposed to
have support for PCIe gen for it so
that's that's the right thing so I don't
know I also get excited to see new board
designs and stuff yeah that's is they
you know because they change from gen -
Jen's and how many be 450 builds have we
done in the last 2 years or last year -
a lot a lot so good chipset is excellent
entry-level chipset board and this is
slightly eyes to the side when it comes
to talking about AMD and the rice and
stuff in general but like I really like
the longevity of the platform oh there
since the 300 series I am going to be
doing an update on my htpc built at some
point and that is a at some point that
is an X 370 motherboard yeah that I need
to keep using because it's got am three
mounting holes and the passive cooler I
have needs them and it's not it hasn't
been updated right so I need to use that
motherboard it's nice you can swap the
CPU and still good I could still upgrade
to a second gen rise in you know a 2000
series right now if I wanted to and not
no not yet completely sure but there's a
chance I might even be able to drop in a
third gen rise in CPU and write out
system but we'll see it's the perfect
showcase of
of wide open platform like that's nice
okay so that's that's all that's all we
have to say about that I'll do that the
oculus rift s you gonna get one thing
out of these no no I've got buying
anything VR in a very long time no VR
not excited I've not even using my
current VR headset I didn't really want
to get my VR setup back setup because
yeah like I'd like to jump in and play
beat Sabre oh yeah I've only really
tried that once it's the only game you
need I've heard and it's it's so fun you
know but yeah the rift s successor to
the original oculus rift so not like the
oculus go which is a more budget kind of
standalone thing this will connect to
requires a computer to run it and
everything like that good we need to
require computers more often yeah but
it's uh it's it's new and different and
update its gonna be $400 it's arriving
in spring so that's not too specific but
I'm a TechCrunch article which is linked
in the description along with all the
articles I'm discussing today it has
sort of a bullet point rundown of Canada
updates features
biggest improvements are a move to the
new inside out insight camera tracking
system which has five onboard cameras on
the headset itself so you don't need any
external thing to you can just you just
use it checks you don't need any like
lighthouses or no it just replaces all
that yep it just just looks whatever at
as what's around you and and tells how
you move around and stuff like that
that's awesome
so that's cool a little bit of an update
to the resolution each eye is going from
10 it used to be 10 80 by 1200 now it's
1280 by 1440 it's a bit more resolution
but it's also dropping the frame rate
from 90 Hertz to 80 Hertz so that means
that the PC requirements are still
largely the same but the article says
you might need a faster CPU depending on
your situation
this new headset was built in
partnership with Lenovo so there
kind of says that's a maybe a plus but
also maybe a minus because they weren't
really super happy with the kind of more
plastic knee design um but whatever they
go excuse me
it is shipping what's updated oculus
touch controllers it does not have on
ear headphones that's using the near ear
speakers that the oculus ghost started
using they greenlit this design only
after a more ambitious redesign was
cancelled so not sure how I feel about
that
like keeping it cheaper so more people
can buy it that's one thing but a more
ambitious design like I mean that's
that's fun I'd like to see what they had
in mind it's $400 otherwise and that
it's an ambitious price yeah 40 bucks is
still a lot of money for a lot of people
considering the you know that's on top
of the price of your PC but it's
definitely a lot more accessible than
the original price of the oculus rift
which sold $800 oh yeah if you got the
rift InTouch combo together so there you
go there's a bit more stuff about it on
the oculus rift website and I'm sure
everyone's gonna buy it there's a
notifying me thing on the page
TechCrunch said the rift s is more
expensive but feels cheaper with
lenovo's hard plastic design so hmm
that's that's a shame that it feels
cheaper than the go feels cheaper than
the original oculus really is which
which does kind of suck getting
something like that but less expensive
who knows maybe it just feels like that
and it's actually really durable and
it's gonna last a long time sure that's
complete speculation like a condom but I
can say it anyway move on to my next
segment which is oh joy oh yeah back oh
wow bring back some oh joy so you are
ending on this is the badness but you
were talking about and as I warned you
guys earlier a good thing we have extra
Beauty err bad in it then the Oh dry
segments is bad news
with no resolution or silver lining or
anything like that so just pure pure
that's what we're here to talk about now
so of course the number one topic for oh
joy the EU has passed article 13
it's even an unlucky number and births
are terrible it says they renamed it to
article 17 but I don't know is that
that's just what the article says they
decided to go their partners were
talking about it recently isn't calling
an article 13 this is something that I
think in the u.s. you might not have
heard about it all because it's an EU
thing but this has a lot to do with
copyright and protections and in
particular how the internet works
because on the internet it's very easy
to go and take that picture or that
video or that song and copy it onto your
computer and you know then re-upload it
somewhere else
or maybe make your own thing a
derivative work from it and there's a
whole wide range of abuse case scenarios
in there and on one side of it you have
people stealing other people's content
which is wrong and on the other side of
it you have new unique works being
created which should be encouraged
yeah nice and I stogie there I'm trying
to eat this very slowly so that it's not
loudly in the microphone that were
mobbed up yes yeah article 11 yes is
also included as part of this but just a
few facts about the matter this was
approved I believe yesterday depending
on your time I think yesterday in Europe
at this point approved by the European
Parliament three hundred and forty eight
votes for and two hundred and
seventy-four against this has been going
on since 2016 when it was first voted on
there's been a lot of controversy around
it and a lot of influence because you
have some pretty heavy hitters I'm sort
of on both sides of it's kind of pushing
for Pro this and anti this the pro this
is largely the rights holders for
creative works so the music industry is
a big one and in film industry RIAA I
believe also involved there and pushing
for it on the other side you have
companies like Facebook
tube and Google which large internet
companies which often aggregate contents
sometimes redistribute contents and they
have been pushing against this because
now that it has passed those companies
such as Facebook YouTube and Google that
hosts content on their websites will be
responsible for checking all uploaded
content for copyrighted material that is
from article 13 that's so the question
the question that you must ask yourself
if you want to try to look at this from
an objective perspective whether you're
hearing about it for the first time or
otherwise is is this copyright directive
meant to empower creators and news
publishers or are these draconian rules
that are a threat to the freight to
freedom of expression I don't think it's
an easy or simple answer I would lean
towards this is a bad thing if you want
my personal opinion I like I like the
ability to the the thing that pops up on
the internet very often derivative works
this has often been called it's it's
it's kind of a bit of an
oversimplification
I think but calling it like a meme
killer because memes right it's like a
you take a picture you know like the say
I've seen very often shown the that you
know the dude with the girl and like the
dudes looking back yeah yeah the girl
and Nick and his girlfriend's like I add
some captions and take something out of
context and use that is a copyrighted
photo right so according to this law the
copyright owner of that I'm sorry
according to the this directive I guess
would be what it's called the copyright
directive any of these websites are now
responsible for blocking that being
posted if it is if it is copyrighted
content also involved is just the fact
that the Internet is far too broad and
expansive and has too much content being
thrown around on it yeah for any
for it to be reasonable to assume that
you're gonna have human eyeballs looking
at everything so there's gonna need to
be some sort of automation going on here
so which is gonna suck right now we're
to deal with that yeah so the the most
direct example of what will sort of I
guess need to happen to comply with this
in the EU and potentially beyond there
if other countries try to do something
similar to this is that is the YouTube
Content ID system which automatically
has a database of existing content and
if you put something else up and it's
recognized it's like oh that's the
flagged because that's already been used
somewhere else and it can be a song or
it can be video or anything like that
so so is that gonna be more strict
perhaps in in the UK more strict than it
already is like it's more aggressive of
an algorithm that goes around content I
deem you know anything that's even
remotely suspicious because obviously
like you said there's no way that manual
review could be to be had well the the
problem I think we'll be alright so
either either we're looking at a bunch
of the kind so if you're looking from
our personal perspective stuff that we
post like this this show for example in
this show we take articles from the
internet we show them on the Internet
I'm still showing by the way lots of
lots of chat conversation everything we
show those articles on the Internet and
I think there's something to be said for
the writers of articles like researched
original contents because that because
researched original articles are
repurposed all the time yeah we're doing
it now to some degree I would argue that
we you know discuss it in context and
hopefully add our own opinions and we do
a we make some sort of change or
modification to that I try to be
thorough by posting links to everything
that I discussed about there that we
talked about so you know if the original
content creator were to stumble across
at the back I well they'll it's linked
in the description I think there's a
reasonable level of
attribution and everything that can go
on there but according to this if we do
anything beyond like individual words or
very short extracts then news
aggregators will be required to pay for
snippets of articles that are taken from
places so there's just there's just an
incredibly wide range of implications
and applications to this law in general
and it's not good news if you prefer
that content to be freely distributed
online and I say that without any
attempt at like and I say that knowing
that there there is like I said at the
beginning of this discussion there's
kind of both sides of it I think the
answer lies somewhere in the middle I
don't think it's something that's easily
like you can write a couple sentences
about and say all right here's the law
that's going to take care of that but
ultimately again I feel my opinion I
think the passage of this is a very bad
thing and we're gonna have to wait and
see how this affects youtube lots of
other sites like YouTube Google how it
affects stuff like our show it's
entirely possible that this show might
not no longer be available in the EU not
necessarily right away what will happen
next is the EU member-states will need
to accept the copyright directives text
and then they will have two years to
implement it so I'm sure some EU Member
States might do that more quickly or
less quickly but if you're seeing stuff
happening today by the way that's
probably not the immediate result of
this if if that's what you like I
complained on Twitter earlier about a
copyright claim that went out on my
channel this morning I don't think
that's because of this is it in effect
now starting now know that you new
member states need to accept it and they
have two years to implement it oh I see
yeah but it's basically like it's been
voted on it's yeah it's gonna happen so
Dan
yeah so that's crazy how their phrasing
this or pitching this as a win for
creative types that's that's the
argument for it because on the one hand
like that would be the like for that
would be the argument of that the
massive corporation that owns the rights
to millions and millions of various
pieces are the creatives they're the
creatives because they bought that or
whatever than they and they yeah so
that's ass backwards right there so that
I feel like that description when it's
coming from you know a huge media
company isn't that what it was pretty
disingenuous yeah so I think the
underlying I think the underlying point
there is true yes people who create
content unique content should be
compensated for that and they should
have some level of protection for their
work just being stolen and reproduced
elsewhere that someone else is going to
make money off of it without them
benefiting from it so it's theoretically
meant to address that problem but it's
it's doing it in a way that is much more
favorable to large companies that holds
that whole massive amounts of rights to
various contents okay let's see if
people are saying VPN VPN is is an
option absolutely but you know you can
use VPNs in China for quite a while and
then they were like oh maybe we should
just outlaw those because people are
using it to break the law so who and
outlaw the law breaking tool if if the e
is gonna do this
who knows if they'll take it that for or
anything that's crazy
yes dammit UK okay so yeah definitely
free speech is is at issue here as well
especially when it comes to the news
articles that's another fact of this I
apologize I can't dive deeper on this
right now guys so feel free to check the
alright I only posted one article in the
description from a gadget on this feel
free to do your own research just bear
in mind there's a ton a ton of
misinformation going around about this
right now so use your judgment and think
like yeah when you're reading something
it's it's usually pretty easy to tell
where the writer is coming from if
they're trying to push one side or the
other right and then there's also lots
of articles where they're trying to be
very diplomatic about it sort of lay out
both sides but like I said I think I and
many of you in chat will agree that this
is a bad thing yes why it's a no joy
statement if that wasn't a tip all right
charter is getting sued poor charter you
know how we usually talk about Internet
Service Providers kind of in the
negative side here but poor charter is
being sued by a bunch of those big
companies that we talked about that Oh
own rights to music and music music
labels Sony universal and Warner suing
charter because they're claiming that
the cable that charter profits from
music piracy by failing to terminate the
accounts of subscribers who legally
download copyrighted songs the lawsuit
also complains that charter helps with
subscribers pirate music by selling
packages with higher internet speeds
you've got to be kidding me that's a
great pirate
image there for the article - Oh perfect
um this one's from ARS technica by the
way and there's no way isn't that what
you want more internet speed Kyle okay
so I can get all those pirated
software's that much faster oh my god
why I mean there is no other reason why
no one would want fast internet other
than piracy clearly vets intent so
obviously this many legs for this
lawsuit to stand on coming from
Universal Warner subsidiaries the
complaint was filed in the US District
Court in Colorado Charter has a
copyright policy that says repeat
copyright infringers may be disconnected
but according to the lawsuit they have
failed to disconnect to those repeated
infringers in practice the music labels
are also asking for statutory damages of
up to one hundred and fifty thousand for
each work infringed these alleged
violate
this occurred between March 2013 and May
2016 under the DMCA ISPs can't be held
liable for Internet users copyright
infringement of the ISPs error I'm sorry
if the ISPs adopt reasonable adopt and
reasonably implements a repeat infringe
or policy so Charter says they did that
the music labels say no you didn't and
now they're in now they're in court
about it
the law is apparently a little bit vague
about the actual steps that the ISPs are
supposed to take so there's no there are
no winners in this circumstance because
even if the even if the music labels
lose and charter wins and charter I mean
and maybe you have charter and you'd
like him but they're one of those but
they're one of the big ISPs that doesn't
always doesn't always act right moving
on though one more thing to talk about
here this is news from the Asus side of
things
motherboard vice.com it's the article
Kim Zetter wrote it ASIS software
updates have been pushing malware to
hundreds of thousands of customers
according to this article and this was
done through the Asus trusted automatic
software update tool crazy this was
discovered by researchers from cyber
security firm Kaspersky Labs and
basically attackers were able to
compromise one of the one of Asus
servers that handles updates for its
live software update tool then this was
used to unwittingly install this
malicious backdoor on PCs that's
connected to that server to get the Asus
live update I believe these are mostly
laptops that were affected so so bear
that in mind
the Kaspersky report estimates that half
a million Windows machines were affected
that's 500,000 those of you who want me
to do if you want to see me I was about
to go to Google transient see me do more
math in my head
follow me it all
and make a new youtube channel for that
weird thing about this though is that it
seemed like they were only targeting
about 600 of those actual systems
because the attack had a bunch of MAC
addresses that were coded into it so
they were looking very at they were
looking for specific targets huh half a
million in fact that systems 600 of
those that they were actually looking
for theoretically what's on a system if
it found one of those targeted addresses
the malware reached out to a
command-and-control server that the
attackers operated which then installed
additional malware so this this adds
this like very cloak-and-dagger kind of
thing to it because usually when I think
of like malware and attack or something
like that I imagine like a hacker would
want to do something that has a cast a
wide net right you know yeah do
something that you can try to get it you
know two percent of the people who you
try to get to reinstall your malware
actually gonna do it anyway but now
you're like what are these systems have
in common how did they get those MAC
addresses yeah I mean I guess there's
ways to do that and why are they a
target who are those people yeah are
they he's whose employees or are they
like celebrities are they celebrities or
government people or something like that
item YouTube no it's it's just it's I
just had to speculate what if it what if
it was you pal what if you're one of
those MAC addresses I would feel special
in a bad ways that'd be weird though I
don't know why they would do that it's a
lot of work to go to uh but yeah
Kaspersky said that they notified Asus
of this back in January and we're
hearing about it now so that is
disappointing
Asus for their part has responded today
according to them only several hundred
pcs were infiltrated not 1 million or
half a million they also say that they
helped customers fix the problem they
patched the vulnerability that allowed
the Asus live update utility to be taken
over and they have updated their servers
after the attack they do have a patch I
saw them tweet about it but you had like
tweet to them to get the patch it wasn't
like this that here go here too
right to download it I'm sorry not to
patched a diagnostic tool you can't
download to see if you're if you're
affected with the malware so I don't
know how they're actually distributing
that or if that's just the tweet I saw
earlier today that wasn't actually ready
yet so anyway not good news for Asus
also no Asus that did the response to
this they never even mentioned Kaspersky
I just feel like this isn't that kind of
like it it's like a common courtesy yeah
thanks for pointing this out they
brought is people's attention and
usually when you hear stories about this
and its public and they're like trained
to you know fix things most of the time
it's like you know we tried to tell them
about this a while ago right didn't get
anywhere so usually they're like alright
well we're just gonna make this public
yeah and then there's kind of that the
clean up after the fact that they try to
do so I feel like there's probably some
saltiness towards Kaspersky from Asus
like thanks for causing this fire that
we now have to put out when in reality
it's like dude they they probably saved
you from from being in an even bigger
fire had they not told you about it or
had this just gone you know undiscovered
it could have been a lot more than six
hundred so it's just be grateful
cuz Persky by the way are the ones who
named this attack shadow hammer just
sounds like a weapon in World of
Warcraft that's like that or if it's the
it's the weapon of the Thor Thor power
supply the Asus Thor has a shadow hammer
so that um it was Thursday X called the
shadow axe
no no this was Mjolnir was the hammer
hacks the hacks axe shoot I'm nothing
but if somebody and chats gonna say it
in like two minutes no but yeah this is
only like tangent star breaker Thank You
Chet Jamie Jamie 42 wins that way this
is only tangentially related and I only
get Italy I know I said that you said
genitally so I can say because genitals
part of that wording have you done many
Asus builds recently like those an asus
motherboard and loaded up windows
ten no not recently not like super
recently with Windows 10 standard
updates asus has a hardware ID thing
that recognized in window that right
that Windows Update recognizes and
automatically prompts you to install
software called thesis armory crate oh
yes I have seen that no and I never
install it I just don't like it because
it's a pop-up that happens automatically
with standard Windows updates I don't
want that software yeah it's an engine
that's this is not related that's that
the armory create is not malware
distribution - right unlike that but
this type of attack is something that
could be distributed in that same sort
of way yeah I don't I really don't like
that neither do I know like third
parties advertising to make their
windows so Asus just the software I like
the Sun I'm sorry I like I seem to like
their hardware recently a lot more than
their software
yeah all right that's all I got for
today my half so guys we're gonna cut
now we're just a trip to Cal safe if
you're watching on YouTube the link is
in the description if you're watching on
twitch stay right where you are
thumbs up button if you do this video
thanks for watching guys we'll be back
