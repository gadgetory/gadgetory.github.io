Pauls hardware this is probing Paul
episode number 8 that's about eight I'm
actually in the Philippines right now
I'm in pondan which is out in the
provinces so you might hear some
roosters in the background and maybe a
tricycle or two rolling by but I also
realized that I did not do a probing
Paul last month I completely blanked as
I was working on my ears rooster as I
was working on my how to build a
computer suit so check that out if you
haven't already and I'm going to get
right into the questions these are all
taking taken from the comments section
of the last episode of protocol so the
first one is from Matt matrix and he
asks just curious is then going to be
ddr3 compatible or is it exclusively
ddr4 he's heard both sides or you can't
find a solid answer
AMD so far has announced ddr4
compatibility so I don't see ddr3 being
a thing there as well and it's
definitely something that AMD would need
to support since the memory controller
is actually in there as part of the
processor when Intel introduced Andy
bridge not syncovich an inch ten
intelligence skylake they did include a
ddr3l controller as or the controller
was capable of ddr4 or ddr3l nothing
about that from AMD so far so I'm
expecting just ddr4 support which
honestly I think is the right way to go
because it's the newest and latest
standard next question is from Kenney
Freeman would an all-in-one PC ever find
its way into your house and if so what
would you use it for Kenny that's a good
question and my initial response would
be no because it's just not really my
thing all in ones buts there are some
out there that have been pretty
intriguing at origin for example has an
omni they have different variations of
it available but it has like a 34 inch
or 35 inch 34 40 by 1440 widescreen
monitor and that's kind of my thing with
the with all-in-ones is you're stuck
with whatever monitor you get that and
the lack of upgrade options origin has
managed to make one that has a really
good monitor built-in first of all and
also has a lot of upgrade options for it
I mean you can get up to like a 59 60 X
or 69 58
in there so I might consider something
like that what would I use it for I mean
just a gaming PC probably something like
that but that is the downside of the
all-in-ones is you're stuck with
whatever monitor they give you so you
know if you got a 1080 all in one right
now you probably feel pretty left out as
people move to 4k really soon the dirty
diddler tasks that's a great screen name
how long do you think a core i7 6700 K
will last will still be viable for
gaming video rendering or streaming or
an streaming for a few years or should
you upgrade to something like a 6800 K I
think the 6700 K will last a good two to
four years depending on what you're
planning on doing with it for gaming
streaming basic video rendering you're
probably just fine but if you're moving
again towards that 4k or higher
resolution when it comes to both video
rendering or game streaming you'll
probably start to feel like maybe you
need a few more cores in there so that's
probably where it's going to start to
feel a little bit slower but honestly
6700
under K is an awesome processor right
now especially if you overclock it you
have eight threads to work with still so
I wouldn't be too concerned it will
probably last you quite a while but if
you're really worried maybe start
looking at the indusial stuff from n
celldex 99 platform and maybe a six core
or an eight core processor Vedanta
Sharma asks well first he said I really
love your videos and that's always
awesome thank you very much for saying
that his question is M ITX mini-itx
builds are they on par with ATX builds
he loves the way small form-factor pcs
look he complimented my wife's PC hot
box that I built just recently she that
made her smile yep she's smiling and
he's really interested in building a
powerful machine and I could define an
OS there are some downsides many ikx pcs
he won't be doing sli but is it a good
move
alright so definitely with mini ITX you
get the small footprint you get the
portability factor and yeah they can be
quite cute the trade-off there is that
you're not going to get as much
expandability you don't have any extra
expansion slots to work with and you're
also probably going to be dealing with a
little bit more restriction
when it comes to airflow and keeping
things cool that said a chassis like the
define now s does have a pretty standard
layout as far as the amount of fans that
you can include in it and that kind of
thing but you know it is a tighter
amount of space to work in you might
find the build process process itself to
be a little bit more challenging
and beyond that I want to say big thank
you to Nicholas Cluj who posted a reply
to your question since your question was
posted a good two months ago and did a
very nice layout of a several of the
things I've already mentioned so I love
mini ITX builds just make sure you get a
case that actually has decent air flow
in there because otherwise you might be
really restricted and you might have to
consider lower power hardware in order
to make sure that you're not overheating
but there are cases that can do it and
define an OS is definitely one of them
next question from advection 3 5 7 Paul
are you a clean freak like one of those
people who has their underwear arranged
neatly for each day cleans dust with a
magnifying glass and freaks out and when
even the smallest item in the house gets
slightly misplaced my wife is skelling
at me now because she knows that I am
NOT I aspire to be a clean freak
although I do have my t-shirts folded
very nicely via the konmari method which
is also from my wife so I like to be
clean and I like to be organized I think
it helps me stay more efficient
especially as I'm trying to get work
done and that kind of thing but I cannot
claim to be a clean freak but I do like
things to be clean I'm just not like
super diligent about cleaning things all
the time
next question from Bari so 101 what are
your opinions on VC LK overclocking for
skelux if use I can get a 6700 9k for
about $270 and pot on overclocking it
using the BC LK method I need a little
bit more versatile than what a 6600 K
can give me and the 6700 K is out of my
budget in your situation it does make
sense
I have sort of stayed away from doing
further tutorials on how to do the VC LK
overclocking method since I did the
first one because Intel cut it off newer
bios's it doesn't work with many
problems are going to be they're going
to be working with an outdated bios one
that came out around
December of 2015 or January of 2016
you're not going to get any BIOS updates
so you're not going to get support for
like KB Lake or that kind of thing which
I guess you don't really need if you're
planning on just doing VC le VC okay
overclocking it's an older processor but
you also don't get access to some of the
other kind of cool features like you
don't get turbo boost that was actually
my biggest disappointment with with the
BC LK overclocking is you just don't get
it so for some people yes it makes sense
especially if it's a really a budget
problem and you really do want to try
overclocking just keep those issues in
mind because they are downsides to be
CLK over hucking all right next question
from an itch patel can you get Kyle to
change the name of his channel back no
no I cannot and finally one more
question from Mason's Accardi is it
worth it to wait until say Black Friday
or Cyber Monday to buy parts would I
make compromises for a deal I wouldn't
like in the end so just buy Parts I want
now or would it be worth its wait
because there's some deals and some good
stuff I'd say right now since it's a
beginning of November well waits but
right now is about when the deals start
happening so Black Friday is definitely
a great time to shop for computer parts
it's a definitely a time where you can
get deals that you can't get other times
in the year and one thing I would say to
keep an eye out for is the overarching
like 10% or 20% off deals that you can
get from like a specific store that
applies to everything and that way you
can get like a good deal on like a
processor or something that you wouldn't
find discounted otherwise that is a
great way to do it and I guess the
ultimate answer to your question would
be yes hold out at least until right
around the Black Friday time right
around the Cyber Monday time and then
keep your eye out for those really good
deals just bear in mind the best of the
deals that you can find are the ones
that are going to be gone really quick
so don't like hold out forever like if
you see something and it's within a
reasonable price or maybe a little bit
of a discount to set compared to what
you have seen in the past then jump on
it because you never know they might not
let that deal last anyway guys that's
all for this video I hope you've enjoyed
it I'm going to sign up from here in the
Philippine Islands
you have enjoyed this video and it
thumbs up button and all that good stuff
and leave me comments in the comment
section and let me know if you have
questions for next month's probing pulp
because I won't forget next month I
promise
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
