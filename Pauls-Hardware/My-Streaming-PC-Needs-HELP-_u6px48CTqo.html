today's video is pretty important
because I have a tool that I use very
often on my youtube channel it's my main
streaming and capture system and it has
been having issues it's still functional
but I've been limping it along since it
started to have issues several months
ago today I'm going to be fixing it
refurbishing it and upgrading it
hopefully to do even better hold on and
hopefully now it will be able to stream
and capture even better because I now
have a 4k streaming capture card from El
Gato so I'm going to be adding this in
cleaning the system out and you guys get
to come along for the ride
yay so this is actually gonna be a
precursor to a full cleaning of this
entire area out here in my garage
because things have gotten really really
bad but he was a streaming and capture
system side panels off there's cobwebs
and other stuff going on in there it's
super dusty inside the main thing that
failed was my Intel 750 series nvme SSD
raid array I had to 400 gig drives in
raid one of them died I believe it is
died completely and I just kind of let
it I kind of let it be I didn't really
do much to it to fix it so I'm gonna
pull those out as well and see if I can
upgrade the storage on this or maybe
just get one of those back in there and
up and running but I guess let's just
get to work I need to pull this thing
out of the corner and start tearing it
apart
so this is a little embarrassing guys
but I'm gonna show it to you anyway
here is the system so when my Raider a
originally started to fail I actually
pulled the side panels off to try to get
back there and I pulled one of them out
and I ended up figuring out which one
was going bad and then I was like I will
deal with this later and I've just been
sort of using the system as is since
then but it's been over by the back door
and the side panels been off so I have a
lot of this kind of stuff going on which
looks pretty gross it's not as bad as it
looks I want to say but yeah oh that's
that's not good so this obviously needs
deep clean apart from updating the
capture card situation so I supposed to
have three capture cards with this
system this is the 4k this is a 1080 60
these are both Blackmagic capture cards
and then the external which I'd
typically use which is a razor rip saw
the razor rip saw has recently stopped
functioning with the system which is why
I'm intending to do a clean install of
Windows but I've also figured out that
my Blackmagic 4k mini cards here the in
works great as a capture for my camera
but I can't get it to work with any
monitors so capturing like a PC gameplay
or directly from a PC monitor isn't
working so that kind of limits the
functionality of it also the second one
which is the 4k mini monitor card which
I thought I was going to be able to like
use as a pass through is really just
made to use as a monitor you can connect
the monitor to it and use it for a
monitor if you're using like in editing
applications like premiere or something
like that so for that purpose it works
great as a pass-through for 4k no so I
don't even need this anymore I'm just
gonna pull that out I also marked in and
out on all these and I actually looked
at the elgato 4k 60 Pro and that already
has in an app marked on it so that's
gonna have a pass-through for 4k which
is gonna work great for the capturing
video games and I'll still keep the 4k
as an in because this actually works
great as a capture for my camera the GH
5
so I ended up working into the evening
on this project yesterday and that was
very nice because I liked the system I
liked the system a lot actually because
I don't care what it looks like
it is only supposed to be functional and
as a result I wasn't worrying about our
GB lights or anything there's not even a
side window on this or anything I did
have to use the be quiet silent basis
side fan intakes here so I've popped
those on and then on the other side it's
just got a little bit of a gap there so
you can pop that panel out sooo provide
some air intake and that is just again
more fresh air internally for all the
stuff going on in there and then as you
can see I still got the 1080 TI in there
and then all the capture cards set up
the Blackmagic intensity on top which is
just a 1080 60 capture card I've got the
4k Mini below that and still keeping
that in there to capture off of the GH 5
because it does a great job with that
and then the elgato down by itself and I
separated that a little bit cuz these
can get a little bit warm from what I
have heard beyond that it was just a
matter of a lot of cleaning there was a
lot of dust built up in here and
thankfully I was able to remove a lot of
the pieces to get back in and under and
get rid of cobwebs or dust or wherever
that had built up and then I had to
remove of course one of my Intel 750
SSDs a simple blank spot there and I'm
probably gonna take my 1.2 terabyte
until 750 and drop it in there so I'll
have a couple of those for now I've got
the 400 gig one working just by itself
to three terabyte drives in raid one and
that's just for some redundant storage
so I can copy footage onto that the main
storage drive I'm using the Toshiba ocz
Rd 400 and that is a 500 gig version of
that and after that it was just a matter
of getting all the software set up so I
did a clean install Windows 10 on this
because I did want that and fortunately
before I went wiped everything and
removed the old hardware I wouldn't got
a list of all the software and
applications that were installed backed
up everything from my documents and
downloads folder and wallpaper and all
that good stuff so I could easily
reinstall everything and get this system
back up and running and it's actually
worked out great so the main things that
are new is the elgato software so I just
went and downloaded that from their
website installed it I haven't used it
too much but it seems to work just fine
and the capture card itself was
recognized also download it and install
the black magic software which I'm not
quite as fond of but it is functional
enough for
now so that does give me the capability
to capture to 4k streams a 1080 stream
and then the possible addition of
another 1080 stream if I add the razor
ripsaw to this as well
I tested this last night but I just
running another test real quick here's
my GH five it's in 4k mode it is piped
into the L got so in the back there and
then here look it's working there's me
hi I'm e I also wanted to check the
Blackmagic devices just to make sure
they are functional and it looks like on
the drop-down list here yes we do have
the intensity Pro as well as the Dec
link mini recorder 4k those are both
being recognized and and yes I do
recognize it's kind of silly to build a
crazy capture system and then be
recording the screen but this video is
almost art over so don't worry about it
the guys that is gonna wrap it up for
this video thank you so much for
watching I am really excited to get this
new system back into my production
workflow and I've decided to change the
name before it was the godly streaming
and capture system because at the time
the 69 50 x10 core CPU from Intel was
the best CPU that you could get and when
it comes to consumer CPUs now that's not
the case anymore so I've changed the
name to Captain Stream that's right
captain stream or Captain streamer
that's that's the name of the system now
and the cap in stream because capture
and streaming is both it's very super
clever anyway thanks again for watching
this video guys - thumbs up button if
you enjoyed it and we'll see you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
