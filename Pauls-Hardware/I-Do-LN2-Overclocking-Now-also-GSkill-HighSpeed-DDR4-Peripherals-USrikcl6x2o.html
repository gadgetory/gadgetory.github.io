to you by MSI EVGA Tesoro g.skill and
Coolermaster alright guys I'm over here
at 9 gang and I'm at the G skill booth
where they have the World Series of
overclocking stage over here which is
behind me but they've actually offered
to allow me to do some hardcore
overclocking here and we're going to see
if we can overclock at 7700 K 2 7 7
gears it's what we're aiming for it I've
never done this and I fully admit this
I've shown you guys overclocking like
this before but I've never tried it
myself so we got some ln2 here cheers
Cheers so just know you're not supposed
to drink this stuff so what's the basic
idea we have a pot as it is known yeah
which is made of all copper I imagine
nickel plated and this is what sits on
top of the CPU
you're also deleting the CPUs right so
the TPS have been deleted the crappy
thermal paints that Intel you uses has
been replaced by something much higher
quality League goes back on more thermal
paste pot sits on top of it it's
actually got a little gap here for
thermistor to drop in there to measure
temperature and and that's all I know so
far so that's not all you need to know
for pouring in that's the basic point
man well good so this is the process
being used right here yeah right now we
have a 7700 K which is at fifty five
hundred megahertz which is running at a
voltage one point one seven which is a
that's actually pretty good overclock
right so NASA click it's weeding out
1.60 because when you do that like you
can't trust cpu-z CPU Z is not
trustworthy so we're actually one point
six right now so that makes a little bit
more sense
oh wow here's five point five a one
point one seven volts that is a very
nice chip right there alright so now we
just pour liquid nitrogen yet if you
want to get it to stuff a gigahertz the
first thing we have to do is call
down a temperature to about minus 190
degrees centigrade we call it okay full
pot because we just keep on pouring and
we leave degree that we reach the lowest
temperature possible with with the
liquid nitrogen okay and we're at 118 -
118 right now so just I just went for it
alright here we go but essentially it's
not off with that massive plume of smoke
coming out a month ago spool pot the
liquid nitrogen just starts to simmer
and violently bubbling alright because
the what is the book what is the boiling
temperature of liquid nitrogen it's a
minus 196 degrees okay
so right now we are above that which is
why it's all vaporizing I just try to
pour it all in make sure you don't over
for so it's like oh yeah we don't want
to get it over under the under the
motherboard or the TV or or our g.skill
memory some modern CPUs do you have a
cold look and then you have to manage
the temperature very accurate okay here
we could just pour in until we got the
lowest temperature with others of you
have to very carefully control the
temperature okay it makes it easier in
one way but also a bit more difficult in
the other way because the thermal page
not all their whole place in would send
this kind of a pole temperature okay and
once in a while we could have something
that we call thermal paste cracking and
that's basically when the thermal phase
solidifies and then loses the contact
between haider the CPU died at the eats
better or the heat sir and the sea-cocks
okay so having accurate thermal readings
is what's going to allow you to be like
if you've lost years the good thermal
paste contact there they got full of
that out all I really would have you
would have a thermal thermocouple in the
vicinity base had one right next to the
heat spreader as well okay so you can
see when you run a work load if the CPU
died temperature goes up a lot but your
CPU pot is stable then you have a
problem that's when your your Delta
separates to other when you have a
high Delta you know that you've actually
get a crack all right so right now we're
down to minus 192 point four ish what
would be our next step we have to
increase the voltage to sustain a high
frequency okay
so we're at one point six right now
and for the first step until six point
five gigahertz we can use 1.85 okay so
just punch that in yeah there you go
there we go apply yeah there we go and
we go to the CPU ratio and the ratio ah
and then a little tab enable the group
tuning so all the cores are enable high
yet
we're running core for a threat by the
way without bailing any of the course or
hypothermic oh nice so 55 we can go
let's say 262 person all right
we now have six gigahertz representing
the CPU Z at one point eight five five
volts so things are looking good now
when we cool it down lower just kind of
keep bumping up the we're we're all good
with the table eight we're at a point
now we can go K we have no thermal
cracking the voltage seems alright we
can just increase the frequency you and
Lauren all right so bump up to say six
five or just go straight for seven six -
six - six - we have to take small leap
it's a little bit exactly like you're
good to bugs and quickly you got an
interesting over yourself I see alright
so keep things warm all right we got six
- all right here - micro sticks fall
down all right how long do you like do
you give it some time you're like six -
entrapment there's there's a strategies
where you would leave it for a bit so if
you leave it for a bit and there's no
load on this review your CPU I will go
slightly down a temperature okay so
maybe you can get like that send extra
megahertz or something like that right
over that one for all right or let's
prepare for seven gigahertz we have to
increase the CPU or voltage to 1.93 for
IRA
Oh also pay attention to the temperature
right so we have to pour it again to
make sure we're at minus one we ran out
of ln2 the temperatures starting to
creep up a little that we're at 186 85
so we got a dump in some more since I'm
in charge of this I got to do it yeah
you have to manage everything you have
to be on top of the temperature you have
to be on top of the voltages the
multipliers everything's old shifting at
once it's all active
all right so we're back down to 193 here
so let's jump up to item 1 9 2 on the
Bolton oh yeah 95 95 1.9 to 5 volts
apply right in full at 193 and how we
got the reading at we can jump up to
let's say 6.7 and then just one ratio up
at a time okay to gradually get to
stuffing everything all right till we
hit apply at 6 7 all right we bumped up
to six eight now 6.8 hit 6 9 apply my
heart rate is increasing feel the
pressure all right we got six six point
nine I kind of crept up there too okay
does that usually happen always going to
be this wide without a little bit back
and forth on the Facebook okay face
block is fluctuating by about to two or
three hundredths of the megahertz
all right let's jump up to seven why not
awesome there we go alright I'm going to
pour I'm going to pour in more Ellen -
you want to try a bit higher now we have
to take even smaller steps so we just
start going up with the detailed paper
okay 0.2 megahertz at a time all right
same process oh yeah and we go keep in
mind it's also a refill chip it's not an
engineering system so this is listen you
can do this at home basically with the
retail chip you just got to get all this
other you need a bunch of ln2 and that's
stuff all right
temperatures still looking good we're
still - 193 where it's seven point zero
three gigahertz that's that's pretty
good now I'm gonna go for it we're going
to go 100.6 on the base clock
oh there we go 7042 I think our
temperature is dropping just ever so
slightly and that's it you got to stay
on top of things and not what you're
actively thinking of what's needed yeah
I feel like if you could get over 70 70
you're going to be the fastest youtuber
that we've had it overall yeah all right
I got to do that no four are gonna be
too else's vineyard we had the guys over
farm when I gave her next to Steve yeah
hey Steve Oh mind it's over as well all
right I got 7:06 then well that was
almost 70 70 I'm at 100 point nine good
101 101 we have 70 77070 point zero
seven which i think is very lucky that's
a very lucky number right there you can
increase a little bit the voltage to
like one point nine five five all right
let's do 5 5 C we can hit seven point
one okay
and apply temperature up I'm going to
add some more Ellen - yes I am a
hardcore overclocker search stream that
so experienced the couple at spawn some
base clock up another point to here 101
point - on the base clock ah memory read
access violation I'm going to call it
though that I won I beat Steve and Linus
it was Jay here no alright Jay didn't
know he's already gone back to him right
I beat Stephen - five point seven zero
megahertz on the lm-2 overclocking with
a 7700 K so champion so I win thank you
thank you everyone
everyone go comment then we finally got
our blue screen - so we've come full
circle alright thanks you guys I think
we should also probably check out some
of the hardware the G scale has on
display here so I've heard they have
memory let's start off with some G
skilled memory they have it all lined up
here so I'm going to kind of run down
the line and show you guys each kit and
what they have it took - these are all X
299 the newest Intel platform 4 X 3 CPUs
this is a 16 gig kit letting it 45
hundred megahertz what we're looking at
right now is try to be non RGB cos
remembers RGB you have to have some
extra data that's traveling over the bus
between the memory and the rest of the
system which means with RGB memory
they're not going to be able to exploit
as high frequencies and see here's
another 8 gig by 2 kit also running a 40
500 megahertz this one are a little bit
tighter timing at Katz's latency 19
again on the X 299 this looks like it
must be a KB Lake X system though
because the gimm flops are only
populated in one slide
remember KB Lake X cpus are dual channel
memory skylake X CPUs or quad channels
so when you have quad channel you're
going to have memory on both sides if
you have K bulik X and running dual
channel you're only going to slot in on
one side of the motherboard so that's
kind of why they have this too
next up here is the fastest gift they
have currently running at least with a
keg by two configuration 4800 megahertz
Cathleen c19 everything that I'm telling
you is validated by like what's up on
the screens here I'm not going to like
to show you guys the close-ups of
everything what's going on
trust me what g.skill is showing is
actually accurate here this one again is
running in dual channel mode but that's
really fast
4,800 megahertz and already on in cells
and the newest design of CPUs here's a
16 gig kit and this time we're moving
into the RGB memory so remember it's RGB
you can't you're not gonna be able to
quite at a frequency but you do get
pretty colors so you know that's your
trade up 4,000 megahertz 16 gig 8 gigs
by 2 kits under your cat slings 218
Steve I just want to point out hold on
Steve here look Steve James person
lately I get to get the hair down Steve
became a person to say that he concedes
to my victory in the overclocking
challenge that g.skill has going on
right here we also have their Bower here
to validate he actually wasn't there but
I'm but I'm just 7000 70.1 come up with
you make that up right now
no in fact I have a screen cap of it
that I'm displaying on the screen right
now just two trues and I'm not a liar
and I am better at hardcore overclocking
immediately okay well I'll list another
one moving out to here we have several
more kits where this is RGB stuff so I
kind of like this one gets kind of red
button blue seen doing America I mean I
guess there's other countries with all
three is rather exciting but I'm getting
distracted up this is a 64 gig kit 8
gigs by 8 gigs all populated in X 9 X
299 deluxe 80s prime motherboard this is
running 4200 mega again with RGB that
makes it more of a challenge to run high
frequency but excellence if G still has
a kit that is
validated and working SSP next up we got
a 32 gig kit this is just 16 gigs by two
so if you're setting up a mini ITX port
or something where your gym flops a
little bit more limited you can still
get your RGB and you can still make it
really fast with 4,000 megahertz testing
through 17 18 18 38 that's an asrock XQ
9950 formula motherboard in there by the
way
and finally the fastest RGB ddr4 memory
kits that anyone has there at least you
feel heads I mean I would say anyone
because you still usually have some the
best memories out there this is a 16 gig
kit a kick by two forty four hundred
megahertz cast latency nineteen nineteen
nineteen nineteen thirty-nine and even
though the memory is FS it still has RGB
data going through a tooth that's pretty
cool look it's doing this fashion - team
session - so much better the fast memory
is awesome in all but it's even more
awesome if you have that fast memory in
a rising configuration so here's a
crosshair 6 here with an AMD right
instead of 1700 this kit is at thirty
six hundred megahertz AMD just recently
launched a new Ajitha new microphone for
their rise and cpus the dividers with
all that's of 4,000 but you know the
memory manufacturers fillings work to
get kits that are going to be validated
work with that of course they've been a
little bit finicky with actual types of
ICS that they're actually using incense
on beta eyes have been the most
effective for writing processors 36
header bigger so at Kathleen's be 16
it's really really fast especially in a
rising system and I also have this kick
here which is 3466 vacillating 319 an 8
gig by 2 kit as I mentioned these are
also RGB they are also RGB so that's
cool too is another 3600 kits that a
castellated 16 as well 8 gigs by - this
one is a gigabyte GA ax 370 gaming k7
mother
and finally down here on the end a
couple thirty two hundred megahertz kids
both eight gigabytes too fast latency 14
super tight signings on these not quite
as high as frequency but 32 megahertz CL
14 is just a drip and fast Verizon and
of course G CL is where can I get any
kissed validated what I was asking it
was like what kind of guarantee if I got
a rise in processor and I buy one of
these kits do I have that I'm going to
be able to just plug in into that speed
and that those timings I get the system
to actually work they said you know it's
not hundred percent obviously every CD
is a little different the memory control
and every CPU is a little different so
getting them to play nice together isn't
always just going to be a plug and play
sort of thing but as the micro pedal
states come out from Andy as g.skill
works on the memory kit and the modules
that are in there and validates those
you will have more options and what they
did say is that in their experience if
you have an ex seriously PU like a 1700
X or an 1800 X like we have right over
here they have said that those do seem
to play a bit nicer with a higher
frequency memory so if you are looking
to get some high-speed memory with the
rising platform then maybe consider one
of the XQ CPUs because the pricing for
those I mean it's usually about 20 30
bucks more at least for the 1700 x over
to 1700 and then 1800 X of course does
have a price premium but I have seen
several sales on that too so there's a
little there's a little bit more
validity to getting excuse let's finish
up with some riff rules we have riff
just Mike over here now the one up on
the top shelf player is the MX 780 and
that's actually been up a little bit you
guys may have seen me talk about that
one last year actually it's really come
up a little bit higher end though so G
still is working on making mice that are
a little bit more affordable so for
about 40 bucks you can get this one here
that's the MX 570 you'll notice it does
have some LED lights on it actually the
LED are on the back is blazing leaf
bright super bright baby halos as I'm
filming stuff like that g.skill did say
that with the software you will be able
to adjust the brightness on that
pretty cool and exercise 70 though does
it's got an optical sensor 7,200 DPI at
the right hand of design but it does
have on ROM switches and six
programmable buttons and then of course
that customizable RGB lighting will
store up to three fill files internally
in the mouse and it comes with a braided
cable MX 530 is here again this is
really going to cost you about 30 bucks
u.s. these are also supposed to be
launching in q3 of this year so keep
that in mind they're not available quite
yet
thirty five hundred dpi sensor on this
one again in right-hand design arm run
switches you get to store up to three
crap profiles in this one as well
no braided cable that you do get again a
couple RGB accent lights with the
g.skill logo as well as a scroll wheel
let's talk keyboards next again the one
up on top of the km 780 RGB and that one
I have already discussed and shown you
guys before look at my coverage from
last day if you really want to take
supposed to look at that they have a
couple more come out so the km 570 RGB
is down here on the second level
so the 570 is going to cross you not
quite as much money we don't have prices
for these yet but again we should expect
them in about the third quarter of this
year so I'm not too far off they are
testing out some white option so guys
what as you still know in the comments
if a white version of one of their
keyboards is something you'd be
interested in they might bring that to
market they do have at least a version
of it here that they're showing up these
are all mechanical keyboards of course -
they feature Cherry MX mechanical
switches they're available in blue red
as well as brown these here on the left
in our RGB have perky RGB LED
backlighting and g.skill also has a
software suite that will allow you to
configure that lighting to your
preference now down on the bottom they
have another version of these and look
how cute it is these are 10 kilos so
these are actually going to be known as
the km 560 RGB no 10 can there so a bit
smaller is it more portable and
now if you're really short on deaf space
of people like thank you this option
again fully programmable the software
suite can help you adjust the RGB
lighting on these and whatnot now if
you're not into those RGB options you do
have a couple probably going to be
slightly less expensive options over
here the camp 570 MX &amp;amp; km 560 m ik
basically exact same as far as functions
and everything goes except just red LED
backlighting and then here you're not
going to be using software you configure
stuff everything is adjusted internally
in the keyboard using the function
button and the different buttons on top
and finally here's the km 560 and TAM
570 just just without any lights on
we're I feel weird being a g.skill and
finishing my g.skill video on a stuff
that doesn't have RGB likes on it
lettering on all these is on the
underside of each key so keeps the top
side nice and clean with a nice clean
look and again they're considering white
options for this as well as the black
option and again available in 10 keyless
and non 10 keyless option so guys that's
going to wrap it up for my coverage here
at the GPL booth of course I need to say
huge thank you to them for sponsoring my
copy text 2017 coverage as well as other
sponsors EVGA msi Tesoro and
coolermaster of course this is thumbs up
button to subscribe it's not a c-more
I'd look I'll be back with more Computex
coverage coming soon assuming I don't
forget how to talk see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
