spools up but if you're watching me live
thank you guys so much for being here
this is my Black Friday deals video
because it's Black Friday today last
night and this morning I spent some time
to go through a lot of the deals that I
was able to find online and I have a
curated list here that I'm gonna share
with you guys today which will go over a
lot of the different primary parts of a
computer building such as CPU
motherboard graphics card and share with
you some of my favorite deals now all
these deals are linked in the video's
description down below so you can go
down there if you want to just click on
those and get straight to them also I
want to point out that these are my
affiliate links especially for mostly
for just the Amazon links so I do get a
little cut a little kickback if you
click those and shop on Amazon so that's
a great way to help me out and buy stuff
at the same time and of course I wanted
to fully disclose that right from the
get-go so I'm gonna dive straight into
this too right now I'm gonna do this by
category so we'll start out with CPUs
I'm gonna start out with Intel CPUs and
our first candidate is a core i7 7800 X
on Amazon for three hundred and ten
dollars marked down from about three
hundred and ninety dollars this is a sky
like X processor 6 cores 12 threads and
if you're interested in getting into the
high-end desktop space this is kind of
the entry level for that I like talking
about entry-level high-end desktop
processors but it's a significantly
reduced price and granted there's of
course arguments to be made about X 299
versus X 399 but don't worry I'll be
getting 2 X 399 as well if you want to
up to the 8 core version the 78 20x 444
dollars over on Amazon for this one and
this was this is markdown even less than
it was last night so $155 off more than
more than 25% 26% off according to
Amazon get a ship within a couple days
there so for high-end desktop lovers
there's a few nice options there for you
the 7700 K is last generation from Intel
KB Lake but still a very viable
processor especially if your focus is
mainly going to be gaming not too
significantly reduced but about $300
right now savings of about
d bucks so if you can find a reasonably
priced Z 270 motherboard to pair this
with and I'll I do have at least one of
those that I'll be getting to in a bit
that's that's going to be a nice way to
get yourself a good gaming system for a
nice discount over what those CPUs cost
earlier this year particularly before
coffee light came out now I want to
apologize to you guys because I I put
the 8700 K on here oh no look it just
updated Wow alright it just updated I
only put the 8700 K on here because it
is arguably one of the best maybe even
the best purely gaming processor that
you can get right right right now as far
as clock speeds and performance goes and
apparently you can't actually order it
from Amazon right now for $400 which is
still about $20 more than what they said
the MSRP was gonna be so I'm only
including this here just because it
seems to be available right now it's
gonna be in stock on December 1st so you
can order it now for 400 bucks and it'll
ship out in about a week and for
hardcore intel fans I know there are
people who are looking for this and they
do seem to be selling out despite their
limited stock so there you go let's move
on to AMD processors some really really
good deals on the AMD space I mean if
you weren't excited about Rison already
rise and discounted even better there
isin five sixteen hundred one of the
most popular kind of entry-level
I want to say entry-level but kind of
mid-range gaming and production
processors it's got six cores and twelve
threads and it's a very good processor
and it's $190 it's $30 off the list
price to 220 pair this with a budget be
350 and motherboard you have a very
powerful configuration for not much
money their eyes in 7 1700 be a step up
from that it's only about like $50 more
I mean I mean you might as well just get
this right you get an 8 core 8 cores 16
threads and you can overclock this so
this would this you can make this
equivalently compatible or like
equivalent performance wise to the 1800
X with a bit of overclocking you will
need a slightly better motherboard if
you do want to go like balls-to-the-wall
overclocking with something like a 1700
or an 1800 X 1800 X you can get for $320
it is
decent markup from that 1700 if you're
comfortable with overclocking definitely
go up to 1700 over the 1800 X but the
1800 X does have really nice
out-of-the-box speeds and it will
possibly get you the best top and this
like single core speed their high-end
reisen is called thread Ripper and II
launched this platform much to the
chagrin of Intel earlier this week and
I'm sorry earlier this year and they've
also dropped the prices so the 1900 X
originally listed for 600 quickly
dropped to 550 now it's down to 450 full
hundred dollars off if you want to jump
from eight cores to 12 cores and 24
threads the 1920 X can be had for $650
it's $150 off the list of 800 and in my
opinion one of the best deals right now
when it comes to just pure performance
for your money $800 for the 1950 X 16
cores and 32 threads just just really
really like if you need to do video
editing or number crunching or animation
or anything like that that really
requires a lot of CPU horsepower 9050 x
is awesome for that so check it out
let's move on to some CPU coolers just a
few listed here this is a nice budget
CPU cooler does a very good job it's by
Animax and it looks very nice because
it's got all black fins and everything
like that the fan that it comes with is
a little gaudy because it's got these
LEDs but this is the e TST 40 on sale
right now for $22 very solid air cooler
looks very nice wide range of
compatibility with cases just make sure
your case is tall enough to fit it and
that's marked down from 46 dollars
that's more than half off the list price
that's pretty good if you're into all on
one liquid cooling typically you would
have had to spend say $50 plus to get
yourself in on that the master liquid
light 120 is only $30 right now on
Amazon savings of $20 this is sort of a
basic entry-level on all one liquid
cooler but liquid is the most efficient
way of dissipating heat from your your
CPU so if you're interested in that
especially if you're gonna move it
around and ship it or something like
that I think this is a really good deal
for a little all-in-one from cooler
master if you want to step up a little
bit to a 240 this is the
master lickin matter would not the light
so it looks a little bit nicer you get
some sleeved sleeping on the tubing and
stuff like that and of course a larger
radiator and another fan $65 over on new
egg this one is also a m4 compatible so
really nice solid option if you're gonna
be like overclocking that 1700 or
something like that I think this would
be a great great pairing for that so
let's move out of graphics cards now
this is the GTX 1080 now you should
right now graphics cards granted the
pricing has been a little messed up over
the past few months if not half of a
year so you should expect to get you can
get a GTX 980 for around 500 bucks and
get a GTX 1070 for around 400 bucks
I need 1070 TI I guess for around $450
so I didn't really choose any 1070 TI's
was mainly focusing on the 10 80s and
the 10 70s but 1080 here from gigabyte
for 510 dollars not terrible not awesome
but not terrible a gtx 1070 here from
msi for four hundred ten dollars and
then there's a $10 million rebate I
don't want I don't want from here
there's a $10 a bit card so you get it
for $400 total and then this one I
thought was interesting this is a Micro
Center deal and you do have to go into
the store so you might want to double
check if you're close enough to one and
if they have it in stock in your
location but this is a gtx 1070 Seahawk
$400 straight up available with a rebate
so you can get it down to 380 and it's a
I mean you need a the rest of the liquid
cooling loop for this because it comes
with a look it's power liquid cooler
attached to it but less than $400 for or
1070 with the liquid cooler is a really
good deal I mean that that block by
itself would probably be an extra
hundred dollars on top of that so hey if
you're close to a micro Center well
you're lucky as is but maybe check out
that deal if you I'm looking for
something a little bit more in the
budget range the GTX 1050 is a very nice
entry-level card to gigs if you're
playing at 1080 it can handle most games
with this card this is an Amazon deal
but but but check this out and just a
heads up for any of you guys shopping on
Amazon
sometimes the listed price it's not the
price that's available here oh that's
cuz it's out of stock that's what
happened alright this happened as I was
getting these lined up
and whatever so I guess this is one of
my deals that ran out of stock between
the time when I lined everything up and
I did it but it is available for 8799
there's a line now look it's letting me
add to the cart it's temporary
temporarily out of stock so it won't
actually that let me check out or maybe
it'll let me check out and then it'll
ship it later I don't know but $90
anyway not too much crazy going on there
but let's talk about AMD AMD cards are
very overpriced so it is of note to
mention that the rx 580 is actually
selling for MSRP again it's like up to
you whether you want to decide if this
is a really good deal or if it's just
like well okay I was really waiting on
an rx 580 but if you do want a free sync
monitor this is good news because a MSRP
RX 580 pairs up very well with like a
discounted free sync monitor anyway $10
rebate card as well this is an
aftermarket cooler version by power
color that's the red dragon so $240 nice
to be able to actually buy an RX 580 for
that much moving on to the next category
which is motherboards though we have a
few of these and I've again try to
separate them so we're starting with the
Intel ones this is a Z 270 board so this
would go very well with the KB Lake CPU
like that 7700 K that I mentioned
earlier only 110 dollars for the Asus
prime Z 270 this one has a solid power
delivery configuration so you'll be able
to overclock it as well as all the
modern features that you would expect
was e 270 like m-dot to nvme supports
and all that good stuff
very nice discount $50 off down to $110
only available for another 14 hours of
the deals I'm talking about today a lot
of these are gonna end later today
because they're Black Friday deals but a
lot of them will proceed through the
weekend here's a Z 370 board so if you
did invest in the copy Lake processor if
you really really wanted to get that a
700 K or maybe 80 600 K this is a good Z
370 board this is the gaming 3 I'm sorry
the gaming 7 from gigabyte Oris which is
on the higher end of their gaming series
they have a 3 5 and 7 so it's gonna have
a really nice power delivery nice array
of features when it comes to
expandability as well as you know the
blingy stuffs like RGB $200 right now
$20 million rebate cards so $180 for a
Premium Z 370 board I think that's a
pretty good deal too let's move to the
high-end Intel we got an X 299 so if you
were considering any of those Intel
skylake X CPUs I talked about at the
beginning a good pairing for those this
one's only 219 at 99 and you get a
$40.00 mail in rebate cards so that
breaks it down to 180 this is the Auris
gaming 3 so it is a little bit more on
the entry-level when it comes to X 299
when you consider the high-end
motherboards X 299 on in sell-side and X
399 on AMD side they ain't even
motherboards actually a lot more
expensive so it is kind of a contrast to
the amount you have to pay for the CPUs
that you can get the motherboards for a
little bit less and I think $180 for
this one is a pretty good deal let's
move on to a be 350 board this is the
asrock a be 350 pro 4 this is according
to gamers Nexus and build Zoid who
recently did a nice breakdown of a lot
of the be 350 boards which are often
sort of met when it comes to the actual
power delivery this has one of the most
solid power delivery configurations as
well as a bit of actual cooling on the
power delivery when it comes to be 350
boards it's 75 dollars normally and
right now you can get a $20 mil and
rebate that brings it down to 55 bucks
so you can pair this with a nice six
core rise and even an eight core and do
some overclocking you don't wanna go
high-end eight core overclocking with
this all the time but definitely make
sure you have some airflow over those
VRMs but again very solid entry-level
board X 370 if you want to step it up to
something a little bit nicer for a risin
platform a m4 motherboard this is the
ROG Strix X 370 - eff gaming and 4 X 3
70 so ex 370 gets you you know dual GPU
configurations and a couple other
features but mainly just the X 370
boards tend to be built a little bit
better so this one has a very solid
power delivery for overclocking and
there's a little rebate form right here
you can click on and download that 15
more dollars off gets it to 115 bucks I
think that's a very nice combination
that and the r7 1700 I think is a really
really solid combo for less than $400
all right
X 399 very expensive motherboards even
right now on Black Friday there's none
that I can find that were below
hitter than thirty two three hundred
forty dollars so if your errand has
spent already gonna spend three hundred
thirty or three hundred forty dollars on
a next day 99 motherboard then why not
just get like the best one or at least
one of the best ones the rog zenith
extreme the crazy overbuilt one that has
all sorts of high end overclocking
features its @rg it is the extreme
so like chances are asus unless they do
a new revision of this isn't gonna come
out with much more beyond this onyx 399
so that is marked down 175 dollars down
from 550 all the way to 375 so if you're
really if you're looking at an extra 99
board this is a really solid contender
before now like 550 it's like alright
that's a super premium you know for
people who have money falling out there
but or whatever but anyway let's move on
to memory memory is challenging right
now it's very overpriced in general so
hard to find too many deals but here's a
couple solid kits especially if you're
looking at Rison this is the Corsair
Vengeance lpx kit which is just insanely
good compatibility particularly with
risin running at ddr4 3000 which will
run it 29:33 under aizen platform 160
dollars this has been going for over 200
dollars for the past that in a month or
two that i've looked at it so that's a
solid kits to buy eight gigs and get you
up and running a little bit less money
for a again solid ddr4 kit this is ddr4
2800 i wouldn't get this verizon you're
probably gonna have a little bit more
challenge with compatibility there but
if you're getting an Intel platform
definitely a solid choice here for only
hundred and forty dollars ddr4 2800 is
perfectly adequate when it comes to
speed and of course XMP support you're
always gonna just be able to plug that
in and get it to work with Intel CPUs
next up is storage have some SSDs and I
have some oh I think I've one hard drive
this is a nice price per gigabyte option
here from crucial the 525 gig for a
hundred and thirty dollars mark down
about 20 bucks
there's also the 275 gig version of this
just click on that little thing that's
only $80 which you know isn't insanely
good price for four for an SSD but it is
a little bit more capacity than you get
with the 248 or 250
gig and about the same price that you
pay for those and this and the MX 300 is
a solid SSD here's a really good price
for 480 gig SSD but you do gotta jump
through at least one hoop and bear in
mind that this is a male and rebate deal
so this is a foreigner native Patriot
ignite solid 480 gig SSD just to say to
one price is 160 there's a rebate so
that brings it down to 135 now on top of
this there is a current frys.com
newsletter that's going out and you can
get an additional 35 dollars off of this
it's a unique promo code so you got to
go to the Fry's website and you got to
sign up for their promo code emails
which I believe you can do via this
little icon in the top right then
they'll issue you a unique promo code
but that means you can get this 480 gig
SSD for $100 and as long as again you're
willing to jump through a couple hoops
that's a that's a really good price
couple more SSDs actually want to point
out rackets in right now has a 20% off
site-wide deal going on you got to use
promo code in order to activate it the
promo code is what is it bf 20 bf 20 you
use that on checkout so you can get 20%
off for instance this 88 a 256 gig SSD
lists for $85 that brings it down to 62
dollars at least if the math here is
correct but that's pretty good deal for
a 256 I'm sorry 68 dollars is what that
brings brings it down to and for a
high-end SSD like the samsung pro 960
which you have a hard time getting a
discount on because it's one of the
fastest pretty much the fastest nvme SSD
that's out there so they don't get
discounted very often
right now it's 290 and with that 20
percent off site-wide you can get it
down to $250 which is probably the best
price i've seen on that particular SSD
and it is insanely fast if you need the
fat if you need the fast go with the 960
pro 4 terabytes barracuda hard drive
from Seagate for $90 anyone who needs
some mass storage it's a very good
record price for that this is another
one that's ending soon only on for about
14 more hours and well not quite lastly
but next step is going to be a few cases
I like some of the case discounts going
on right now again just to knock off of
fit 10 15 20 dollars here in there but
that makes it a much better option
especially I mean when you're rolling in
all these Black Friday deals together
you combine that all in any like wow I
got this whole computer for X dollars or
whatever the carbide 270 are from
Coursera's really solid case side panel
window good ventilation easy to build in
and yeah good good reviews all around
$55 down from 70 solid choice this is
the master box light five this is over
on new egg this is only $60 and a $10
email and rebate card brings it down to
50 and it's got RGB fans on the front if
you're into that as well as tempered
glass so that's a that's a solid deal
for that bear in mind that the front
piece here is plastic in the side pieces
is tempered glass just to clarify that
but again a solid case from Coolermaster
plenty of room inside for your full-size
ATX build a basement power supply shroud
area - I just had a couple cases there's
there you go EVGA supernova this is
power supplies got a couple of these
this is a very solid 80 plus gold EVGA
power supply with all black cabling it's
fully modular just a really solid power
supplies 72 dollars this is kind of the
price you would expect to spend for
something that's maybe like 80 plus
bronze or something like that like a
higher-end 80 plus bronze unit but 650
watts is going to be adequate for the
vast majority of gaming pcs and yeah
just a solid deal there from EVGA
Corsair has their CX 550 this is the
modular one for 50 dollars so if you're
on a little bit more of a budget you can
save a little bit there and again this
one has all black cabling it's partially
modular it's even got a pretty black and
white label that won't clash with the
rest of your builds and finally if you
want to max efficiency for at least $2
she has a Rozsival quark series 750
watts they get a bit more juice with
this 180 + platinum rated though and
this one is $90 but there's a $25
million rebate card so brings it down to
65 so I really saw the price for a 750
watt 80 + platinum unit right there
let's round things out with some
monitors
because I know you guys love monitors
it's what you stare at all the time when
you're playing on your computer so
having a good monitor is very nice this
is a Costco deal for an HP omen 32 inch
quad HD gaming monitor so it's 2560 by
1440 and it is 250 dollars 32 inch so
sizable a sizable monitor here a good
refresh rates the higher resolution 75
Hertz and I was not able to clarify 100%
if this is freesync compatible so maybe
there may be the reviews will say down
here someone bought this on Black Friday
a year ago apparently anyway you guys
can probably look that up by the way if
you're hearing snoring in the background
it's just heroes falling asleep
completely over there but let's move on
to a BenQ unit 27-inch 1440 monitor so
same resolution as the last one but a
little bit smaller this one has a really
good refresh rate and reaction I think
of the wrong word here but for
millisecond response time is the word I
was looking for a good brightness and
everything height adjustable so $250 as
well and this one's probably going to
get you a little bit better picture
quality whereas your the trade-off here
is the size but same price there $250
over on Newegg if your got a little bit
more high-end and if you're one of those
people who has a Nvidia graphics card
right now and it's been considering free
sync but the free sync monitors are just
always so expensive for the night I'm
sorry jisuk if you're considering g-sync
but they're always so expensive
clarity Swift 27-inch 2560 by 1440 so
you can push it with the you know with
the decent mid-range graphics card 165
Hertz g-sync 480 dollars this is down
from 700 so that's a nice discount in my
personal opinion guess it's still a
little bit more of a premium than you
would pay for an equivalent freesync
monitor with those same specs but if
you've already got like a gtx 1070 or
something like that this is a really
really nice monitor to pair up with it
if you're a little bit more of a budgets
and if you're also interested in the
ultra wide thing this is the LG 29 inch
IPS LED backlit 21 by 9 so it's ultra
wide and it's the 1080 resolution which
is basically back 1080 stretch to ultra
wide I forget what the
with I think it's 38 40 by 1080 I forget
exactly but it's 1080 stretch to ultra
wide is is sorry 2560 by 1080 is the
actual resolution here 21 by 9 aspect
ratio one hundred and eighty dollars and
this one does support freesync so this
is a great combination with something
like an Rx 580 or any other freesync
compatible hey Mindy graphics card I
guess if you got a vague or something
like that oh no um wrong link anyway
though that is all for my video right
now so thank you guys so much for
watching these are my Black Friday deals
