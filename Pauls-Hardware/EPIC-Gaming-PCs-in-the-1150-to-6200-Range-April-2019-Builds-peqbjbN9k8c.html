builds video for April 2019 this is a
monthly series and it's about the very
first thing that you need to do if
you're building a new computer and
that's decide what parts you're going to
use so today I'm going over parts lists
if you're interested in me actually
putting systems together as in build
videos check out my builds playlists
which I will link down the video's
description and then you can actually
see me put computers together in the
meantime I today we'll be going over
three different parts lists and these
are gonna be a little bit higher end
today ranging from pretty high end
around 1,200 dollars up to $3,000 and
then an absolutely crazy one that I did
that's well over six thousand dollars
this is all based on your feedback from
last month's drop holes so thanks for
voting those of you who did and if you
look in the description for this month's
video there's another straw poll for
next month in May what do you want to
see ivory upped quite a few of the
options from last month that were
popular I also added an HTTP C option in
there too so let's dive into it for our
first build and this one is about 1150
dollars
altogether I'm using PC part picker for
my perk picking lists by the way and
links to all this stuff is down in the
description
this one's actually coming in at about
11:20 671 that is after a couple mail-in
rebates so you actually end up paying a
little closer to eleven sixty or eleven
seventy but we have a risin 720 700
these have recently come down in price
they were 220 but it's bounced backed up
to about 240 still a really good deal
for an eight-core 16 thread processor
and to get a Wraith spire cooler along
with it which will cool it adequately to
get you up and running of course you can
upgrade that in the future if you want
this is a micro ATX build so I went with
a micro ATX motherboard did I mention
that at the beginning this is the price
power size optimized gaming PC I wanted
a reasonable price I wanted a lot of
power and I wanted it to be not crazy
tiny like a mini ITX build but I want it
to be smaller so the B 450 M steel
legend is the motherboard from asrock
which you can get for about $90 I like
as rocks budget boards as long as you
don't go super super budget if you step
up from there from like the 60 $70
boards to like the 80 $90 ones you
actually get a lot for your money I like
this one because it actually has dual
MDOT 2 slots it's got one up there and
then another one down in the bottom
right it's got four dimm slots so you
can upgrade your memory in the future
and then it's a p450 motherboard so that
unlocked for overclocking so yes you can
overclock your processor with this
motherboard it's not gonna overclock
quite as well as your crazy high-end you
know 200 issued all our motherboards but
it will allow you to push your CPU a
little bit further than it runs out of
the box
for memory I have a g.skill ripjaws 5
kits 3200 speed you do want to go with
faster speed memory for rise in 3200 is
a good one to aim for $95 for a 16 gig
kit it's so awesome that memory is
reasonably priced these days this one is
verified to work with Rison most of the
reviews say it plugs in just fine with
XMP values or you might have to run it
at 3000 speed but not too much of a
drop-off there for a storage drive we
have an Intel 660 P 1 terabyte m2 nvme
Drive and with this over like a 2.5 inch
SATA SSD because the price per gigabyte
for this drive is right in line with the
price per gigabyte for standard SATA
drives this uses qlc flash memory so for
extended writes it's not gonna be quite
as good but it is nvme cuz it's gonna
give you a little bit more performance
than a SATA Drive and for the same price
yes I would go for this over a 2.5 inch
drive for a graphics card where you have
an r/t X 2070 from MSI I was just
looking at well priced RT X 27 TS which
you can get for below $500 that's nice
this has an aftermarket cooler with a
dual fan cooling solution and it has a
pretty clean looking back plate as well
so 485 dollars after rebate for the RT X
2070 Ventus from MSI oh and did I
mention this also qualifies for the
Nvidia gifts so you can get anthem
battlefield 5 or Metro Exodus along with
the purchase that's a nice little add-on
for a case I have the cooler master
master box q 300 L micro ATX mini tire
case and I like this case because it's
small I feel like it's well-designed
it has total ventilation up here for
good airflow so that's nice micro ATX
and I feel like micro ATX cases don't
get a whole lot of love and it's pretty
flexible too there's actually a bunch of
add-ons and upgrades you can do on this
case you can swap the i/o so it can be
on the top of the bottom left or right
so very flexible pretty unique design
stays in a pretty compact footprint too
and it's only 40 bucks so hey good deal
her power supplies stuck with
coolermaster and I'm really happy that
we now have access to the NW e-gold 650
cooler master and they've made a lot of
solid power so
flies in the past but I felt like their
pricing hadn't been quite as competitive
as like Coursera or EVGA recently but
here we have an 80 plus gold rated power
supply all black cabling it's got a
pretty nice low-key black and whites
color scheme as far as the design itself
goes and it's a it's a good cooler
master power supply you can get it for
$55 that is after mail-in rebate so bear
that in mind but well done : aster
thanks for providing some more
competition to EVGA and corsair in this
range also added one more fan master fan
pro 140 airflow this is actually like a
10 or 15 dollar fan but there's a
mail-in rebate on it too so you know
four bucks after that's because the case
only ships with one fan so you would
want to add a second one but there you
go guys
just under 1150 for this build I think
this would do really well for mixed-use
gaming of course but also anything that
you need to do a lot of heavy lifting
with the CPU since you got 8 cores in 16
threads check it out links in the
description now guys my next build is
absolutely ridiculous both in the price
as well as the choice of components so I
feel like I need to have a disclaimer
this is not a sensible build and
probably nobody should realistically put
it together but it's based on the fact
that I have I have these not just one
but two of the MSI r-tx 28 ETA lightning
Z graphics card actually one of them is
Kyle's and one of them is mine but
clearly I need to put both of these in a
system and you know do some sort of pun
along the lines of lightning striking
twice because that makes total sense so
I ended up with this build it is six
thousand two hundred dollars or so total
and that's not including the peripherals
and everything so I'm gonna go down this
it features a 99 hundred K and dual 20
ATT eyes and a bunch of other absurd
stuff and in case you're wondering I've
got the cards so yes this is probably
going to be the system I put together
when it comes to the case the case is
probably a placeholder and I might have
more on that in the future but still
waiting on confirmation so I want to say
too much but let's go over the parts
from top to bottom starting with the CPU
which is of course gonna be the 9900 K I
could have gone high-end desktop with
this but the 9900 K really has the best
single core performance and it's 515
dollars so it's not like it's a cheap
product by any stretch either for
cooling we have the enter Mac
like otech to 360 a millimeter all in
one liquid CPU cooler very solid CPU
cooler and it's been proven multiple
times over that the ninety nine hundred
K especially if you want to overclock it
you probably can't get by with just the
two hundred forty millimeter rad a IO
you're gonna want a three sixty one and
this one by inter max is really solid
just make sure you get the two version
of the liquid tech for a motherboard and
this is also a product that I already
have on hand so that's why I'm choosing
it it's it's a six hundred dollar
motherboard this is the MSI z3 90
god-like which is their highest NZ 390
motherboard which is pretty absurd in
many different ways and has lots of
crazy stuff added on to it that I'm
probably not gonna even make use of all
of it but you know if you gotta go crazy
high-end this is the way to go
godlike is what msi calls all of their
super top-end products except graphics
cards those are those are called
lightening for memory I have a 32 gig
kits the team Nighthawk RGB memory which
is RGB and has a really cool look in
design and I thought would match very
well with the motherboard also a kit
that I already I have on hand and 3200
speed since I got two of them it's gonna
be a 4 by 8 gig configuration so that'll
fill up all the DIMM slots inand look
really nice with the RGB LEDs on them we
of course need some high-end storage I
was looking at the Samsung 970 Pro which
is about $300 for the one terabyte
version the WD black is like right up
there when it comes to performance and
it's cost about 50 bucks cheaper so with
that I also haven't used the WD black 1
terabyte at this point so we'll throw
that in there too I wanted some extra
storage so we have four more terabytes
of SSD storage in these eight a de su
800 2 terabyte drives so these are
perfectly fast inadequate as SATA SSDs
go they also have a black housing so if
I didn't want to remove that sticker if
they were in some place visible I could
probably do that 220 bucks on Amazon for
these and yes you can still get the
Intel 660 pm2 nvme SSD for pretty much
the same price as this but you gotta
bear in mind with the 9900 K you're more
limited on PCI Express Lanes you're
gonna want all 16 eight mate go into the
graphics cards which means I can't
really add a whole bunch of extra m dot
2 devices that's why I went with a
single fast nvme SSD one terabyte
or the operating system and programs and
then former terabytes of SATA SSD
storage for everything else next we have
two of the GeForce r-tx 180 Ti lightning
Z graphics cards from MSI which aren't
available for sale anywhere I think it's
weird that MSI is having us like talk
about these cards since it doesn't seem
like anyone can actually buy them not
that they're sensibly priced they're
about $1600 each at retail or so we're
told but you know it's the highest of
the high end the top of the top-end
custom PCB crazy lighting effects it's
got a no LED on the side that shows the
performance and the current frequency
and temperature and everything so you
know it's gonna be a beastly graphics
card actually make that tube to beasley
graphics cards but getting ahead of
myself let's talk about a case and for
that I have the in win 915 black which
is a 450 dollar case which is expensive
that's a lot of money for a case but for
an over-the-top $6,000 plus system you
want something that stands out that
makes it a bit more unique and distinct
and this one is actually pretty cool
there's a video on Amazon that you can
watch about it and when they do unique
designs that I appreciate it's anodized
aluminum it's got tons of room inside as
well as tons of airflow it's got some
LED accents across the front USB type-c
as well of course which is nice and of
course
tempered glass side panel windows so I
think this is a beastly case I have no
plans to actually use this one directly
I might hit up and win and see oh it's
also got automatic ventilation at the
top that's pretty cool that kind of
shows you where the extra $250 for this
case goes compared to like a really nice
$200 case but I'm like I said I'm not a
set on the case for this build quite yet
so it might end up being this one or it
might be a special other one that still
sort of in the works but for the
purposes of this parts list this would
be a perfectly legitimate case to go
along with the rest of the hardware that
I have chosen let's round things out
with a power supply the EVGA supernova
t2 1600 watt basically I wanted a
maximum amount of power available which
is 1600 watts if you're in North America
you can't get a better efficiency rating
the titanium it's got all black cables
although I would probably go with the
custom sleeve kit for this build if I
was going all out but for now that'll
work and it's you know 350 bucks that's
that's super
for a power supply so as you can see
here there's just several products in
here that are really skyrocketing the
price the motherboard being about $600
to $1600 graphics cards for about 3200
dollars total and then to a lesser
extent the case and the power supply so
let's see if next I can do what you guys
asked me to do and do a $3,000 high-end
gaming PC setup that includes not just
the computer but also peripherals so
mouse keyboard headsets and monitor and
for that I have this build which is also
like the description $3,000 full PC
gaming setup and what I actually did was
I started with that ridiculous 6000 ish
dollar build and I was like what can I
cut down from that to make a reasonable
$3,000 build and also fit in everything
else I came in a little over I'm at
three thousand sixty one dollars total
after rebates hope you guys will forgive
me for that but this is also a really
really nice build we have an i7 8700 K
so I stuck with Intel to keep the
high-end sheen going I guess although
you could build the system for probably
three four hundred dollars cheaper by
going with an AMD platform they need 700
K six cores and twelve threads versus
eight cores and 16 threads on the 9900 K
but it's also three hundred and seventy
dollars versus 515 to 525 doesn't come
with a cooler so we need that we have a
be quiet dark rock for which cost about
75 bucks 70 to 75 which is a lot for an
air cooler but I like air coolers
because you have peace of mind of never
having to worry about leaks or a pump
failing this is also a really
nice-looking one it's all black and it
performs really well so you'll be able
to overclock your 87 or 2k with this no
problem for a motherboard I stuck with
MSI to sort of have a comparison option
here and this is the MP g z9 d gaming so
you still have a Z through 90 chipset
it's still a very well-built board that
you can overclock with and everything it
still has RGB LEDs and four dimm slots
and you know all of the basic functional
stuff that you'd want on a motherboard
it's even got a USB 3.1 gen2 front panel
connector it's just about $200 or 185
compared to $600 for the god-like that
seems like a reasonable trade-off to me
for the memory I stuck with the same
kits of team Nighthawk it's just a 16
gig kit two by eight gigs instead of 32
of course you could easily
pull that up just double the price for
storage I just have a single one
terabyte SSD which should be just fine
for an operating system and plenty of
games to get you going and of course you
can add more in the future if you want
here's another great nvme SSD deal the
crucial p1 one terabyte which is five
bucks cheaper than the Intel 660 P it
says it's on sale right now for a
limited time but it appears to be about
hundred five bucks in multiple locations
so keep an eye out on that one as well
as on all the an alternative to the
Intel 660 p4 a video card I used the
parametric filter because I was like I
really want to try to wedge an RT X xx
atti in this build for $3,000 it seems
like something that would be possible
so I wedged it in there with the
cheapest one possible now theoretically
you should be able to buy a 20 80 TI for
$1000 but that's a bunch of poppycock
because as you can see cheapest one is
$1,200 surprise surprise the entry-level
price for the Nvidia founders edition
you can at least get an XC gaming
version for that much but I just added
with the parametric filter here so
whichever 20/80 TI is the cheapest is is
the one that will go into this build for
a case we have an $85 fantex Eclipse
comes with a couple fans tempered glass
solid case solid build quality yes you
could spend fifty or hundred bucks more
but it's not gonna make a huge
difference
to be perfectly honest for a power
supply we have Corsair txm 650 watt 80
plus gold certified this one semi
modular black cables 80 plus gold 650
watts and about 60 bucks after mail-in
rebate the the cooler master one I used
in the first build that you could also
swap in here just as easily and then of
course the peripherals so for that first
off I wanted to choose a monitor and
basically I wanted ultra wide because if
you're gonna be full time gaming I feel
like the ultra wide is a really nice
experience right now I also want a 34 40
by 1440 as a resolution because you can
actually push really high frame rates on
that resolution it is fewer pixels than
4k especially if you have something like
a 20 atti so ultra widescreen 34 40 by
1440 and then free sync support at least
so we can connect that up to our in
video based graphics card to still have
adaptive sync because we want that I was
trying to go for a really high refresh
rate like 144 Hertz or so like this
you monitor I have behind me but these
still cost a little bit more this one's
about $1,000 I went with this asus rog
Strix XG 3 5vq which is an asus monitor
really high quality it's part of their
rog series it's seven hundred and
fifty-five dollars right now hundred
Hertz so not quite as high refresh rate
but hundred Hertz with adaptive sink is
actually a really nice refresh rate too
so nice specs all around with this
monitor of course if you can tack on
another 200 250 H dollars or so I do
think this LG behind me would be an
upgrade to that so I'll post a link to
my video on that monitor in the
description too rounding things out we
need a headset and a keyboard mouse the
HyperX cloud core gaming headset you can
get for $70 has a very nice set of cans
as well as a mic that sounds pretty good
you know there's a lot of crappy
headsets down in the 50 plus dollar
range this one's actually good they have
higher-end versions of the HyperX cloud
set that have a few more features but
was trying to come in under $3,000 so I
think anyone who gets this will be happy
with it finally I have the cooler master
master keys like l gaming keyboard and
mouse combo which you can get for about
$56 this has a mouse not a crazy
high-end Mouse but forward and back
buttons it's got an Avago sensor on
there it's a solid mouse actually I've
been using several of these little
cooler master more budget mice for
various purposes and like they're just
fine like you don't need to spend 100
bucks on a mouse and of course we have
an RGB keyboard it is not mechanical it
is mem can achill but I've tried this
keyboard it actually feels really nice
and you don't need to spend a hundred
bucks on a mechanical keyboard like this
this one also works just fine so getting
both of those for $56 I think it's great
deal so it around Zout this build and
helps everything come in at well just
over three thousand dollars so guys let
me know in the comments section down
below what you think of these builds do
you think they're reasonable except for
that $6,200 one of course let me know in
the comments section if any of you guys
are planning on building one of these
systems relatively soon whether you go
with my parts list directly if you swap
a few things out here and there feel
free of course to customize these to fit
your needs and your aesthetic tastes
thank you so much for watching this
video though guys once again links in
the description and don't forget to vote
on next month's builds thanks again for
watching and we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
