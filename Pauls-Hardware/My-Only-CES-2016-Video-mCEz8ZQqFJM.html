hear me okay welcome to my first CES
2016 video I've realized that I don't
really go to CES for the technology so
much I mean I do like the technology and
I am going to be doing some tech videos
some kind of standard like product
coverage or we're on tech syndicates
channel so go over there that's
technique a syndicate I'll be doing like
your typical like a i'm here at this
booth and here's their products so check
that out if you want to see kind of more
standard coverage the first thing that
popped into my head what I thought about
why do I go to CES or just maybe one of
the nice little bonus reasons is
actually the drive out I live in LA so I
Drive it sticks three and a half ish
hours or so and actually really like
driving through the high desert which is
what I'm doing right now even though
we've had a bunch of rain and fog on
this trip is actually visibility was
really bad earlier it's just it's a
beautiful landscape I think and I
actually kind of enjoy the drive ok went
on between Victor melon Barstow right
now I've got maybe a couple more hours
to drive and then it's not Vegas I
proceed yes we are now officially just
outside of maker on the edge of the
desert this is bat country although i
haven't seen any they must not like the
rain
I was like this part right here we come
around this left
it's just a lobbyist greatest downhill
section
all the way down the state line
way out there in the distance
also further after the left there's
alien megastructures being built to
harvest the sunlight
good luck state life is a rollercoaster
here's picturesque state line National
Park crossing into Nevada the glorious
tendon fields greenery of California to
the lawless wastes of Nevada
unfortunately the CHP doesn't have
jurisdiction here all right guys I've
made it to Vegas I checked in we're
staying at the Palms I'm here completely
by myself for now well actually tech
syndicate is here i'm supposed to meet
them just a second but i thought i'd
give you guys like a 60 second room to
it let's see if we can do that first off
here's the view check that out ooh it's
so like dreary and rainy and everything
in Vegas is so weird for so yes normally
it's just like really cold and dry
anyway we got sort of a partial view of
the strip here's the inside of the room
which is super dark whoa there's these
eyes on the wall just staring at me got
two doubles over here a pretty standard
room otherwise got some desk space over
here this this right here don't touch
that that's trap ah that's pretty much
it should have wonderful fun times in
here I'm sure and let's oh one last
thing to show us a bathroom ooh look
there's me there's a bathroom it's very
yellow anyway that's it for the room
tour let's move on look I found tech
syndicate
busy look everybody its corsair if you
want to see our coverage of the corsair
booth and go to tech syndicate also
don't look at Cain he doesn't have a
glasses off do you look everyone it's
ASIS I'm not going to show you guys any
of this stuff either but I did want to
come over point the camera at these guys
oh yes Terran 100 ahead news loose you
won't have to come down the roads
tonight look there's a white balancing
they're getting professional camera
stuff very anyway they're completely
ignoring me right now cuz i'm vlogging
so that's brilliant welcome back to
polls like CES blog look i'm doing
random celebrity cameos celebrity your
celebrity it's a celebrity that brandy
there's a bunch of celebrities in here
look there's a celebrity logan talking
to celebrity Linus I'm linus you get
your hungers okay hey all the guys at
fun Kyle I finally made it over here
we're we're gonna drink some beer and
we're going to do the live show it's
gonna be awesome and I don't why I'm
telling you guys this you probably have
already seen the live show was it good
let me know let me know in the comments
if the live show was good it's time for
awesome hard way it was good oh it's day
two and we're actually at the convention
center this is unprecedented i usually
don't even come to the convention center
while i'm at CES i go to all the other
places but like it's madness there's
people everywhere we just paid forty
bucks for parking Cain what do you think
of all this this is madness you said it
I'm not looking forward to this are you
mad no
so you know it's a BMW formula ii it's
my new ride this is actually a police
cruiser apparently there's a lights on
top there's some pretty cool stuff going
on here didn't oh I i'll be honest intel
hasn't really given me a whole lot at
CES in the past one of the things i
really like about their booth that it
was a really plush curbing just wishing
how to fly it's just it feels it feels
good it feels good just to walk around
on this carpet I really recommend coming
to the info booth at CES just to
experience the carpeting that they have
eight honestly is scary news though
anywhere the angel walk is by the game
it caught me
on anywhere
this is the I Triple E booth one that I
normally wouldn't stop by I mean I
tripolis awesome they do standards for
just tons of stuff in technology but
look at this gaming setup they have it's
for way they have like Otis flight
sticks and everything each of these
little boxes has like a full alienware
gaming system and I didn't ask for the
details and specs and everything oculus
rift headsets I don't know what the
tablets used for but then there's also a
camera that watches each person is
sitting there unfortunately this demo is
down right now so I can't show it to you
guys in action but they're doing like
Mars exploration demos and stuff like
that but I just saw this and I was like
damn that's just a badass setup i feel
like if you're into like high-end gaming
rooms like there's got to be somebody
putting together something like this
soon with the boat oculus rift coming
out some new technology here at CES
these are cryogenic sleeping chairs as
you can see brave volunteers have come
over to lay down and be put into
cryogenic slumber only to be awoken 100
years later for CES 1000 no 2011 21 16
it's going to be wonderful
why is his car wearing headphones we may
never know
I want here's a 98 inch 8k TV I'm a
company named skye worst who I never
actually heard of before I know you guys
are watching this probably in 1080 but
you couldn't go like right up to this
thing and there's no pixels you can see
anything they're showing all this food
porn and stuff like that I think it's I
think there's too many I think there's
too many pixels and there's no AKA
content but still pretty badass this is
Omni remotes if you like they have
control issues I'm so conflicted right
now these headphones are awesome but the
only song they have playing it's Celine
Dion oh no never let go Jack
all right we're at the win we just had a
party everyone's wasted right now but I
left behind by my damn crew I want to
interview turn here because the entire
linus tech tips crew has left him lately
behind they haven't bonded what are they
what are they doing right now they
didn't have to get food and they forgot
