we were trying to get everything set up
before the Sun went down and if the Sun
hasn't gone down yet but um but it's
going down it's going down so alright
cool you're a we don't have anything
really planned yeah okay again nothing
planned for today Steve actually wrote
our entire show yeah actually does have
a few topics lined up so we're going to
be mainly going off of that and
answering some of your questions in chat
for today show it's also going to be the
more condensed than it usually is I'm
going to say half an hour per per side
yes instead of the regular hours so bear
that in mind hopefully that's cool with
you guys shout out to the people who are
still holding strong and twitch chat
even twitch chat is letting us know
about the audio issues by the way so
yeah thank you guys that's commitment
yeah you thick all right so um we
I do want to talk a little bit about
some of the stuff that Steve was talking
about before we started the show Steve
of course doing a tech news website
knows lots of text news so if you have
he actually a few topics that he threw
out there and that I thought were
interesting so all of these have
articles i'm assuming on gamers next we
just did one yeah this one article
problem for around up yesterday exceeded
some kind of content for today to hold
the fort while here i guess the the
easiest one is probably the I guess the
RX for 60 msi card so there's no chi new
RX for 62 Ramos I pretty late the launch
cycle the only reason this is really
relevant news is because they're half
height so that's kind of cool exciting
it's a reasonably powerful card and for
a hundred bucks same for the 1050 you
throw something that's a hundred dollars
into a small form factor pc that's
pretty good fit even though it's been so
long since i built like i have fights as
to their but you can get him like
especially like the mini ATX ones like
you can you can do it really
Silverstone's got a lot of good boxes
for that too that could be interesting
yeah they haven't do they have they made
me recent mini-itx cases with with the
half slot not sure if they have a fourth
half slot we definitely saw stuff with
half slot at CES okay but i'm not
positive it was new okay yeah so that
was kind of justing they're both thought
my head 1090 megahertz base and i want
to say twelve hundred megahertz boost
and then I'm two gigabyte and four
gigabyte model at last I looked prices
were TVD nice as the news out of msi for
the 460 s that's definitely good news
for those who maybe have like an older
like pre-built system or something like
that too that may be either didn't come
with a graphics card or came with like a
much older one where the CPUs still
decent for you know a lot of the you
know basic GPU bound games they just
need a graphics card but they can't
really get one because they're all full
height and said yeah right so yes I
wasn't bad then I guess there was a
a news topic on from JP are John petty
research which take their numbers with a
grain of salt but there's still a
research firm that has a lot of work in
the industry and some history so it's
certainly better than any of us can come
up with in terms of getting numbers for
sales and hands like that so they
reported that again off thought my head
that in terms of market share for AMD
Nvidia last quarter and the per GPU
market share has gone up to i think
twenty nine point five percent oh and
the previous measurement that JP are
reported which i believe was a different
period of time but previous measurement
was twenty one point six percent so AMD
has gained some ground in the in the GPU
space with nvidia taking the romanian
70.5 percent or so did it say how much
of that was due to the RX 480 at all or
it did not but it's pretty fair to
assume that that's most of it or just
polaris in general right they did
publish something JP are several months
ago that showed a boost from from
polaris so that's not reasonable and
then they also had numbers on overall
sales of a IV's attached rate of addin
boards or a i beez two systems so that
attached rate would be like if you go
out and buy even just SI system
integrators building finished systems
attachment card to it I think that was
up to forty four percent which is an
increase of 33 there's forty six percent
I have your article I see increased
thirty six percent year-over-year
comparing q4 last year to key for our q4
2015 to Q 4 2016 total attach rate is
forty-six percent now and of course this
is all from Steve's article on gamers
Nexus calm and then the market share the
AMD has now that he mentioned 29.5
percent is up from twenty one point six
percent last year so that's like that's
a pretty big job yeah and slowly I
Steve earlier if that includes consoles
we don't think it does I think it's just
as Adam board probably just add more
Kurds and then I like you I like stats
aib shipments peaked in 1999 at 114
million units and 2015 there were 44
million units shipped but they're up
this year a couple percentage points and
by this year I mean 2016 that's when the
medics are from yeah so they're up a
couple percent from those that 44
million number but it's all down overall
good news for PC Villars and gamers
because it shows that information tells
the manufacturers that people are
interested in those types of products
and it means they should hopefully keep
keep making them and everything yeah
yeah so cool really quick some donations
from dr. B 1900 thank you very much
hotel room is this the baby oil episode
at last you know I guess if in baby oil
episode were to happen it probably would
be in some sketchy hotel room there's a
veil there's a bed right here but I
think we have to slum it up a little bit
more for that maybe like a hotel six or
motel six you know or this is a slightly
nicer hotel yeah this is oh we don't and
we don't have any like luxury baby oil
and to to justify the descending about
stay tuned for part two five dollars for
my crimes against Steve thanks for your
video on embargoes and NDA's been really
fun and interesting to watch i recommend
kyle watch them yes I wasn't I mean it
was partially directed at Kyla yes I
think I do I was you know I mentioned
Kyle how much interested I do a lot of
things for the community in my own
special way like get Steve to make
useful videos but yes that I think I
skim through that video and I think it's
definitely a topic that a lot of people
like we were talking about earlier don't
fully understand like the difference
between an embargo and and NDA and
exactly what you know what's happen on
behind the scenes when all of us
reviewers post a video at the exact same
time at 6am you know whatever and
everyone's like is it like a collab is
it a spiracy Luminati or anything
yeah it is very useful plenty of
competing science that don't really know
what they mean either embargoes man da
ya like like for instance there's
information we could be discussing right
now with you guys but we're not because
we respect NDA's and we don't want to
break them because you know this kind of
this mutual thing amongst people in the
industry so it's frustrating when you
see people go outside of that right
because it's someone basically taking
information that is not supposed to be
shared and probably for their own
benefit just like me like here and by
putting it out there and for people to
read at home like I understand getting
excited about that stuff and reading
about leaks and that kind of thing but
the reason NDA's happened and Steve
explain this very well in the video is
to keep everyone in the press on even
footing and to make sure that when you
guys get information it's not just
coming from a single source that might
be biased or might have wrong
information or something like that you
should be able to go to like eight or
ten or twenty year how many sources you
want to read about information when a
product launches and for that reason we
be very much try to abide by n DS and
end it in like the come the companies
that make these products they also have
their own kind of marketing plans in
place where you know if someone like
leaks information early it kind of
screws everything up for them you know
all the marketing dollars you know that
they're using you know from the funds
that we're giving them paying for these
products and you know as business owners
ourselves like there's there's something
valuable to that and when people just
don't give a and they just leaked
information for their own personal game
and have no respect for businesses that
are trying to profit and continue doing
what they're doing for the community it
it's it's like having a best friend that
just like weeks every secret you ever
tell them right it's just like just
frustrating the point you're making
certainly on the business side on the
prophet inside like we understand very
well what has to be done to stay in
business
in this industry it's not easy at least
on the media side but there's a big side
on the community too we're giving us the
time even if it's just a week or
something to look into a product means
that hopefully each one of us can
develop some kind of angle on the story
that's not just regurgitating all the
slides that whatever company has given
us so you actually get like filtered and
thought through information rather than
I'm going to repeat all the slides in an
article or whatever and take credit for
it and that's it ultimately gives you
way higher quality content to consume so
that's why India is good and thank you
for that donation it led to useful
 shout out real quick to our mods
spider as well sell thanks for being
here guys I'm seeing you I see you word
you guys are great and yeah let's see do
we have any new questions that have
popped up um there's a five dollar
donation from Richard Dortch I missed
the front side bus overclocking on my
x58 system i sure hope am deol's front
side bus overclocking Orizon it makes
the OC process so much more fun OC with
only multiplier is kind of boring I
don't know anything about ricin at this
point yeah we don't know anything about
rising but a front side bus overclocking
I understand nostalgia but it's mostly
thing in the past yeah I mean I guess
it's to some extent been replaced by
base clock yeah but yeah I mean I mean
overclocking in the past like I never
did it back like honestly I never did it
when it was that confusing when you had
multi kieta memory you know external
memory controller and the northridge in
a South Bridge and that was back when
your motherboard could have a really
serious impact on how fast your system
was overall but a lot of that stuff that
used to be little components on the
motherboard has all been gobbled up by
the seed in pci express commercial
airliner a controller most most
motherboards now just have a single
chipset rather than northbridge in a
South Bridge and it has simplified
things in a lot of ways I mean there's
there's pros and cons to it of course
but I would
say I understand nostalgia but I'm glad
that we don't worry about separate clock
speeds for all of those things and and
getting them all to play nice together
anymore um yeah let's see I think was it
was there with a one more item in your
news story of Steve I yeah Gabe Newell
um hey Gabe he this is I don't think I
included that part in the story I think
it was only in the video no yeah he was
with the table kind of a round table of
other editors I think and said was it
was talking about performance of VR in
the market there are not any almost
change last 24 hours public numbers on
vibe sales or even rift sales I don't
believe anyway not recent ones so it's
hard to gauge just how successful those
products are and Gabe said paraphrasing
but this should be pretty pretty close
to the quote was um he is okay with the
idea that VR can turn out to be a
complete failure but also had the caveat
that there's a valve is still very
optimistic about VR they're still
investing in it still developing titles
and working on the vibe so but it seemed
to me not a not like an escape plan but
more of a like we're being realistic
about this this is a new thing that is a
very complex and different and people
don't always latch onto those ideas so
quickly so it's definitely like VR is
one of those things that everyone who
i've had try it thinks it's awesome but
there's so many people who still haven't
tried it because it's difficult to
access the hardware if you don't know
someone who's a computer enthusiast or
something like that and they've done a
fair amount of like demo setups and
moles and that sort of thing that I've
heard about but I've also heard that
those aren't as appealing because it's a
crappy and bayern yeah it's just not the
case I'm very using a headset that's
been used over and over again and stuff
and you get the eye herpes in there and
stuff yeah
and then all those complications so you
don't really want to deal with four BR
but I don't know I i would agree it
seems more like realism like it doesn't
seem like he said he's like oh it's on
the downs right or anything like that
it's just being like yeah i'm i don't
okay i feel like Gabe's pretty good just
it seems like it's great because my dad
doesn't mess around too much he's very
transparent I respect and I think I kind
of like sometimes I cvr sort of like
like laser tag in a way like people
aren't gonna buy a laser tag set and
play it in their house they're gonna go
to a dedicated like facility that does
laser tag I feel like that's kind of
what VR is right now we're unless you
are an enthusiast you're not going to
like dedicate a space in your house for
this really expensive technology you
know I mean so it's just like there's
just the barrier to entry so high right
now and until that you know it becomes
more simplified and mainstream and more
affordable I think it's gonna it's
probably going to be something that we
see take off in like with like third
party businesses like laser tag center
sorry Luke a forest entertainment
exactly yeah but and I know the contents
not I haven't enjoyed a lot of VR
content beyond initial impressions so
far but I think that's more of a
challenge of developers have to figure
out how do I build for this thing and
make it mechanically intuitive what are
you what kind of game are you hoping for
vr I don't know to be honest I'm mostly
a strategy player when I do get to play
games so that means a lot of game
mechanics as opposed to game experience
I feel like right now be our marketers
toward experience and definitely and
immersion unreal
of course so i think that i think the
headsets needy a lot smaller I think the
theoretical technology in ready player
one we're like you know shoots the image
with lasers on to your retina rather
than having a display that sits in front
of your eyes or something like as a
feature trust me yeah yeah I mean it
sounds sounds painful but it also would
be a much simpler way of having a VR
headset or something like that be a
stream and all that stuff down I think
would make it a lot more accessible for
people and of course the cost being a
huge barrier intrigued right space yeah
and then as computers get faster and we
have new computers with more cores and
better graphics cards at launch that
should help too not that we know
anything about paid all right let's see
we are actually coming up on a half an
hour pretty quick here I think yes and
we do have some other things that we
need to go to this evening so where is
again that could be very short stream I
think we have one or two more donations
pop in there yes five dollars from Nick
dimage free odds sorry if I butchered
that Callie's want you to know you look
really buff from this camera angle well
that's why i SAT here because it's all
it's all deceiving just wait till you
see the other side thank you very much
five dollars just to tell me that I am
five dollars from Justin Horton thank
you sir love to get love the show guys
any word on rise and I TX boards coming
out with launch don't need specific but
if they are making one need one for my
landlady you 37 water-cooled building
hmm that's a very good question we
should have brought we should hopefully
a cricket sound effect hopefully you'll
be able to find out the answer to that
question soon yeah that yeah potentially
um and there was I saw one and chat
there from this one DV odisha TV put one
in there soon thank you leave a chow he
said penis i thought i wanted to read it
because he just said penis yes we
appreciate the penis donations it's gone
it must've gone by sorry TV good i
didn't see
your dollar donation and we did say
penis for you on the stream so there you
go and in one dollar mmm inator it
doesn't help that some of the
exceptional titles have been boring
secretary workplace game they had jet
like javi dugout simulator yeah yeah
good point that's how that goes and then
that one year to got that Justin's got
cool Boop oh there's TVs there we go
penis TV set ahem penis can't donate as

the donation I'm sure taste it I'm sure
your burgers will taste way more
delicious with a college dorm educated

started at 515 yes so just for the sake
of brevity and that's moving things on
and Steve's actually got a flight to
catch in a little bit too yep so we need
to be those madness needn't be concerned
with all this stuff again guys I know
this was sort of a weird awkward show
and everything so yeah done something
else is how it's always gonna be
although next week might be similar who
knows you know the reasons we'll see how
that goes yes guys we're gonna switch
over to kyles channel so we'll try to
post those links in the chat and
everything thank you all so much for
watching this one and thumbs up button
or if you thought it was crappy um
dislike uneven so we Steve's here I
