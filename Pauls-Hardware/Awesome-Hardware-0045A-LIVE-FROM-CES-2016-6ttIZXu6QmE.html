Becca and eyes the other homies are in
the kitchen they just got back from
shopping nothing we can do about that
this Vegas folks you just roll with it
you just roll it perfect dead on alright
cool cool well this is your half of the
show Paul so I suggest you introduce it
and all that mainstream to YouTube oh
yeah yeah let me see if you do screaming
it works that's true um I didn't even
set up a show I neither do i can do it I
can do it it we'll do a live bucket
 it throw it in the bucket I
hit the button why is it'll be okay why
isn't popping up anything wrong it's not
hiding behind their lives um new live
event title put it in the fridge please
oh yes thank you what is this awesome
hooded good burger where Wickham would
you please put in the fruit is it what
episode is in spray is 45 45 45 oh I
should probably edit that on that oh I
did I'm so on top of things you are a
type of thing but that's also because i
have else to do thing other than
just get here you had a boatload of
other thing that's a lot of play stuff
yeah right okay live from CES
descriptions good I'm use those tags as
is i don't care fuking and I'm just
gonna start bracket okay that should be
the title of this stream awesome
hardware number 45 CES 2016
literally streaming live all right it
says we're not streaming to you to blood
yeah wow really really maybe maybe
there's something wrong with your
internet Kyle at home no because we've
changed nothing nothing so two weeks ago
we try to do this yeah I'm Kyle's house
with this system and didn't it didn't
work we kept trying and it would go for
a second but Time Warner would never do
that because I pay them honest money
there well it's not it's weird that are
an honest company yeah it's weird
because it streams just find it switch
right yeah other than that it's it's
strange we're still having yes there are
liquor bottles being
in the background oh we're streaming to
YouTube though hey hey everyone I needed
to play hi who has no idea what's going
on welcome welcome to awesome hardware
this is a very unique and special
episode of Awesome hardware if you've
never watched the show this is not a
good one to start with this is not going
to be a normal show true but the cuddle
and I do this show every Tuesday evening
usually at five-thirty p.m. pacific time
we stream to twitch TV / awesome
hardware and we also streamed our
YouTube channels today's show we are
framing from CES Las Vegas Nevada we
both just got here today I have been
running around I've already been to a
couple vendors today and it's been a lot
of fun but my half of the show which
you're watching right now I have nothing
planned oh good I have big fat goose egg
I tried to do a little bit yesterday and
then my plan was like oh I'll do it
tomorrow anyway I didn't really have a
plan ok so we ever have a plan though
Paul yes yeah we believe in it we kind
of do usually play in the show out with
topics subject matter all of that good
stuff but today's half especially my
half of the show is going to be a little
bit shorter a little bit more off the
cuff so I'm thanks for bearing with me
if you're if you're not into this kind
of thing then stick around for next week
and I promise we'll have more plans hey
 the plague is today is so
 cheers yep hmm just be glad that
we don't have like a dead hooker behind
us or something cuz that honestly that
was close to happening i'm also i'm also
glad i can drink beer now i have a when
you when you're in vegas and you go to
the different vendors and a lot of them
have sweets and hotels and stuff like
that and a lot of times you get offered
like a drink like like hey here's we
have this like 20-year scotch or
whatever whether you you drink that
stuff right yeah I do yeah delicious but
I typically don't I don't go for that
during
day I don't like to clouds the mind you
know and plus what I'm trying to talk on
camera unless I'm streaming a live show
evidently I I like to have my wits about
me um fit anyway cool yeah so I'm glad
we're back to stream time so apparently
buffering on YouTube is a lot worse and
it's causing lag on Twitch it's lagging
it's like a on twitch the frame drop is
Rio no all right I don't see a pop-up
from exploit saying that okay as well
well you know what then you to
youtube sorry YouTube viewers if you're
watching this right now go to twitch TV
/ awesome hardware yes because I'm just
gonna cut the YouTube stream and uh
it we're doing a live bitch yeah you
want a lot of supreme but you have
dropped streaming to YouTube uh no I
don't want to stop the broadcast
broadcasting twitch yeah all right so um
those are our roots twitches our roots
yo yeah oh alright we Mak we cut out
YouTube we might have some we might have
some some bandwidth limitations here
right but that's okay that's alright so
Kyle how was how was your day you got
you got you got here my day was good I
went to del taco twice we woke up we got
breakfast at Del Taco by my house down
the street and then like three hours
later we stopped at Barstow oh yeah and
got some Barstow time actually I didn't
get anything there because I was still
full from breakfast but my wife got
Barstow taco which is obviously amazing
and then we finally rolled in we were
right on time I mean we this is the only
time in history though in my life that
I've driven to Vegas from from LA and it
was raining the entire time cuz of El
Nino yeah there's lots of rain today
lots of weary stormy yeah it was intense
I cut a lot of it coming up out of LA
but once I get into Victorville and the
high desert there was some rain but it
was it was spotty yeah kind of here that
I like hydroplane to Vegas yeah first
off Tocqueville is not better than del
taco you shut your mouth oh yeah you you
shut it can we ban
and who's man mod been whoever said that
and I just want to point this out dr.
jump for anyone who's not aware del taco
is not well if you're in the US it's not
it's not nationwide I think mostly in
the west coast and western state
fortunate soul del taco actually started
in baker or Barstow I forget which one
yeah i think was where the first one was
yeah so if you happen to be on a road
trip to her from vegas from Southern
California the del tacos in Barstow and
Baker are like super del tacos yeah
everything costs a little bit more but
like you get a chicken soft taco and
it's like massive and they put like they
serve it open-faced yeah they put more
stuff on it it's crazy like a whole new
experience yeah so it's it's well worth
trying and I I don't blame Kyle for
stopping there twice I'll probably need
to stop on the way back yeah get some of
that absolutely um all right let's
should I should I even attempt to talk
about anything no let's talk a little
bit it's whatever you feel coming I can
talk about a little bit of stuff shoot
the we can talk about so guys
again normally I try to plan a little
bit of show planning and stuff but I've
had no time so far today i have been to
corsair and asus those are two big ones
so I've had some of the big ones that
I've seen some of their products yep but
they have but the thing about CES is
it's never a huge event for like your
your component level pc product launches
its just write it you know you get a few
things here and there but I feel like
most of that stuff comes out at computex
yeah so um yeah as a results there are a
few things but not a lot also Angela
thank you for joining us and you're not
very Angela you're not very late because
I was very late yeah we like literally
just you're right on time today about
five or ten minutes into it but my half
of the show is probably a very pretty
short anyway so um this should work
right hey it works okay um here's pc
perspective and uh wait where did it go
you know it's actually good that you saw
course here today because i actually
have a story from them about what
they're showing off at CES okay but
since you're not super prepared for
your hat if you want to talk about it
you can go ahead and I can kind of a
riff on that okay from the info I have
because I have a feeling that I know
what you're going to talk about if
you're talking about Coursera so yes
from of course there yes um but I could
be wrong yes that that is what we saw
there okay but let's let's let's wait on
that okay cuz i don't i don't have any
visuals to show sure but here's here's
something that i did see today that i
thought was kind of cool um asus has
made a few of these little portable
monitors in the past but they've all
been TN panels um this one I thought was
pretty cool it's the env 168 B+ which is
just a wonderful name for a contentious
people are trying to open bag the chips
in the background they're realizing it's
horrible for the audio um mb 168 b+
though it's a USB 3 point of water 15.6
inch it's 1080 and it wait no this isn't
this is incorrect it's got to be it's
supposed to be IPS Scott this is an IPS
panel ooh if this is the one that I just
saw literally less than an hour ago this
is an IPS panel and that's a big
difference difference wait maybe there's
two different models oh no first it uses
an IPS display instead of the occasion
okay now and I'm sorry I understand if
he's blah blah all right title of the
article mb 1 69 c plus okay first line
of the article mb 168 B+ that's not
sorry it's actually the MV 1 69 c plus
way more easy to remember of course and
and that is the new one so what he was
saying is that they have done this
before but with a TN panel gotcha okay
this one is IPS so it's really good
color reproduction beautiful super thin
and light and easy as USB type-c
connector nice so you only need that one
plug god there's no extra power it's
just that one plug USB type-c that is
awesome over to the thing so for
something like a road trip like we are
doing to go to see yes where you might
want to bring a laptop write and edit on
it but you might be used to like a
you know having the extra screen real
estate with multiple monitors grab
something like this and pop it up I
think it's me two hundred bucks that's
pretty good so yeah I was I said the
same thing as I gari that's expensive as
a 1080 monitor goes but for the
flexibility again of this and like super
thin to like really thin it looks very
sleek yeah so I thought thankful I
thought that was kind of cool that's
what I think that's great for editing
yeah when you cuz especially on a 15.6
inch display I mean we're used to I mean
what are you headed on a 27-inch I had
it on a 27-inch I have a 30-inch 2560 by
1600 yeah with a 27-inch 10 18 x to it
right so I mean that's a lot of inches
that you're losing if you're just going
with like a 15.6 inch laptop like I have
here so just to expand that you can
extend your premiere pro timeline
like that or have more file explorer
windows open so you can easily drag and
drop just those milliseconds add up
add up actually so that's nice to see
much like streaming with a single
monitor you streaming too yeah you
missed that extra real estate since
we're on the subject and since it's the
next article that's listed here
apparently pc perspective must have also
visited a sous earlier today I'm feeling
them they have a new line of 4k monitors
this is the Animus with the mg line
there's a new swift monitor too but this
one is actually 24 inch ok and I don't
think this is 4k wait i'm confused now
what are they talking about this is why
when we do show prep it helps let me
know what the hell is going on yeah um
this but this is more fun this is a
fresh article so maybe the article is
wrong or maybe I'm confusing this thing
but the other thing that I saw at asu's
was a 24-inch 1080p asst rog monitor
which fits everything here so far except
this says a line of 4k monitors and it
wasn't for K it was 1080 ok um but which
makes more sense on a 24 inch to play a
lot more sense I believe you um and
human use and it was g-sync so r GG sick
monitor 24 inch 1080
and I don't know if I was supposed to
talk about the price yet it is going to
be like four to five hundred bucks which
is yes more expensive but it's kind of
like all of the g-sync monitors are more
expensive I was going to say like oh so
it's like a budget g-sync panel yes but
that's still kind of pricey as budget
g-sync panels go this is on the cheaper
side and I mean it's got all the rog
stuff so i think it's the you know it's
got all the screen overlay stuff that
they do and everything which which can
be fairly useful alright um it's not IPS
though so anyway that was another thing
they showed there they also had a they
have the final finished version of their
34 inch 3440 x 1440 who r o g9 monitors
so kind of a competitor to the ac's
predator x 34 absolutely competitive
asus predator um I'm sorry to the acer
predator sorry there asus rog swift 21 x
9 34 inch goes up to 165 hurts mmm in
overclock mode though right and i
believe it's still IPS it is it is IPS
and it has to be the the housing I mean
it's a weird thing to talk about for a
monitor but like a lot of the stuff
recently I don't know I like
transformers I guess I don't know just
get a design they have like mechanical
things built on top of each other but
kind of symmetric I don't know just
biotech almost Yeah right just kind of
kind of those cool design things and I
know sometimes that type of thing can be
overdone and seemed over the top yeah
but this one just it seemed really cool
the base at the back has this kind of
twisted design yeah on it that looks
pretty cool I mean it's very like this
looks like it belongs in Tony Stark's
you know dungeon or whatever right you
know for for iron man but it and and
then whereas the predator x 34 has a
pretty cool sort of downward firing glow
that it can do underneath and you can
change the color of it right the ROG one
right at the center of the base projects
downward a circular red asus rog logo oh
wow with like us kind of a circular
circular design and
an rog i right at the center what's kind
of crazy and i know it's just silly like
l like lighting bling on a monitor but
like everyone who walked up to it that's
like the first thing they noticed was
like ooh that's cool yeah this is got
this cool it's a marketing technique I
think definitely a marketing thing it's
definitely product purely an aesthetic
and all that stuff but um but yeah also
guys if you're if you were trying to
watch a YouTube stream we cut that off
I'm sorry yeah we are streaming from an
Airbnb in Las Vegas and the YouTube dual
stream was eating up the bandwidth and
it was making everything choppy so right
I'm gonna try to do a transfer I'm gonna
try to draw transfer to it maybe ya
later I don't just know anything at all
just can just transfer it over and say
who cares yeah I don't know I'm not cuz
I'm not gonna kind of editing i know
that's for sure crunch crunch time but
whatever thank you all for joining us
those of you who are here and sorry
again that we've started kind of late ok
for bearing with us mm-hmm what's next
ah i wonder if there's anything anything
on that i'd like to show pictures rog
what would that be um 34 inch curved you
see Sarge e34 curved there it is well
there is go to images Lucy DIY page on
it yeah but the images that are up right
now might be the earlier versions
because they all right that's a thing
that we've I've already seen a ton of at
CES yeah is like hey all that stuff we
showed six months ago to change
completely nothing has changed but like
all that stuff we announced like hey
these are the products we're launching
soon now we actually made lunch dimmer
right yeah yeah I know you mean yeah we
finally got it to the confirmation on
all the parts you saw last year yeah so
I don't see there's any pictures yeah
this is a kid Gert now this is an older
this is an older design oh is it yeah
they seem to look like that I mean it
looks similar but I did they've changed
it interesting does it still have those
three kind of triangular tripod legs
yeah it's got three legs and stick out
and this is and it's
got like 10 of some of this you know
etching good on the back and that kind
of that how wide are the feet like as
far as would you need a pretty large
desk to fit that they're pretty wide
yeah but I mean they had it on a
standard size desk so I don't think
you'd need anything crazy big uh you
know as long as you've got a reasonably
big size desk that could fit a 34 inch
ultra light I think it's always the rear
foot that that worries me yes looks like
and I want to push it back as far as I
can cuz I like well this 34 inches it's
right up and on the standard rectangular
base you can actually kind of overhang
it on your desk a little bit without you
know too much trouble but indeed but
cool yeah sounds like Asus was a good
was a good good sweet yeah very good a
suffering stop by there oh yes okay yeah
they're at Trump you have power yes it's
the best tower it trumps everything
right when you walk in it's like this is
the best and the what most wonderful
location possible in Las Vegas eyes are
acting better and something but they
don't let Mexicans it's definitely
something racist about Mexican okay
racism oh man don't worry we're gonna
steer the show in the completely wrong
direction does pc perspective have any
other fabulous articles that they have
been posting soap with me so you here's
something I wanted to talk about but I
liana it is kind of slow really I wanted
to talk about this because I spotted it
but I have not I can't so guys I can't
say that i've read this article or
there's lots of articles on this in the
past couple days so i'm just going to
touch on it briefly and I there's a pc
perspective article here we're looking
at it's called AMD technologies group
previews polaris architecture right so i
am going to try to read a little bit of
this so we can comment on it just to
touch but but what can we say about this
all right it's Polaris is the name of
the next generation architecture that
AMD is working on the North stop yes
this is Polaris the North Star yeah oh
okay are you doing a speed test right
now yeah I'm just curious okay I meant
to do before we started screaming it's
kind of doesn't that use up your
internet yeah
it's I'm just kind of curious to see how
I'm sacrificing your after the show
Tegrity the stream because you don't
sabotaging sabotaging now my own true
all right so it's not based on the 14
enemy rises yep using FinFET technology
so 3 3d transistors which have been used
in various things Intel's de la which
this i think i read a bit of that i
don't know if it was this article or in
an text but this is the first time in
what 55 years or so that that were
diverging away from 28-nanometer for AMD
yet for AMD yeah i know amber going to
14 or so this is a big kind of a
generational leap that I think that AMD
is kind of coming across so it's a big
deal it's a big deal well it's like
we're at my house there's a train going
by yes that's awesome I know how it
feels um so yeah they have taken their
gcn architecture which is the 28th made
up built on the 28 nanometer process a
cat was talking about and they've
updated it there they're doing cool new
stuff like hdmi 2.0 a right playboy's
1.3 yeah next generation multimedia so
does H this I thought was actually
pretty cool this is kind of going along
with AMD building an h.264 encoder into
their which we start out with the was a
600 series and started out with yeah um
they are building in an h.265 main 10 d
code for up to 4k so 4k h.265 at 60
frames per second built-in encoder
that's part of the GPU so what that
could mean for any of you guys who have
used that technology and the nvidia side
is you know it can income it can encode
whatever it's displaying to you on the
screen for a game you're playing it can
also encode that very rapidly with the
built-in hardware in order to output it
for streaming or anything like that so
very cool and very nice to see that
upgraded to like this is the next
generation of ok cities which even allow
for K screaming I don't know but if they
don't now they're probably going to very
soon they half China's just coming out
otherwise it's like well what are you
gonna do well I mean they don't have to
but Emily they should then they need to
if they wanted to stay
a relevant and competitive with likes of
netflix and youtube great um yeah so
they have a shot of the Polaris
architecture a historically pin
performance per watt for radeon GPUs so
you can see all the flashy new signs so
there's a new command processor in
fourth generation graphic for next yeah
new gcn architecture yeah nice
multimedia cores and his display engine
and l2 cache and all that cool stuff
right um the upshot as far as a demo
that they were showing for this and this
is actually all stuff that AMD talked to
a lot of the reviewers about I think a
month or two back but a lot of it was
under a really heavy NDA so they're
they're releasing the information very
slowly right um so here's using the
Polaris architecture and I think this is
with the Star Wars Battlefront yeah
battlefront test two demo yeah and sorry
if this is a little grainy but they
basically we're playing star wars
battlefront at 1080 at 60 frames per
second on the Polaris architecture using
a demo card right and they were
comparing it to a GTX 950 right which
was also running at the same frame rate
at 1920 x 1080 but the 950 had 140 wat I
don't know if this is a totally or the
actual measured power draw but one of
the other either way sure 140 lat versus
86 watts yeah and that's that's a huge
difference and power or power efficiency
has been something that nvidia has kind
of claimed the throne or you know
they've they've been ahead in that game
for a while right um even when AMD has
had cards that could perform
competitively with NVIDIA it's always
been like well the nvidia card uses 20
or 40 watts less or yeah you know did
they they just they've been more
efficient for what you get out of it so
bright that's pretty sweet it is but you
also have to bear in mind that Nvidia
hasn't revealed their numbers in terms
of power efficiency for Pascale either
they have done and they're probably
going to be you know like I still feel
like it's going to still be competitive
but there's probably a higher chance now
that AMD will be
kind of neck and neck with with Team
Green in terms of power efficiency it
seems like hipsters nice if these if
this information plays out thanks to
FinFET yes well yeah been in bed vinca
it's such a fun fun little term to say
in bed yeah so they are planning to use
this for small form factors small form
factor in integrations right but yeah
there's kind of the rundown of it
fourth-generation mid-2016 we can expect
this land available a planned
availability mid-2016 mm-hmm and they
didn't seem to talk a lot about hbm at
least in this particular article maybe
that's something that they're I don't
know I don't know I the way it's been
going seems to me like they're probably
going to be doing like hpm based cards
as well as gddr5 right maybe the gddr5
was it plus or dvd-r six sounds there's
a couple other day on GDD are variants
that they're also kind of working on so
we might see something like that so hbm
basically reserved for like the higher
end cards most likely yeah because
because they're still very like ships
limited yields as far as production one
goes for hbm so yeah well it'll probably
still take a little while to get an h BM
card in your hands unless you're an
early adopter with lots of money yeah
you know that's often the case mhm um
all right it's all for my chef the show
yeah is it I mean I mean that i might
have nothing for their plight no let
some guys if you have any questions any
random question do you a genuine if well
answer some questions yes I feel like I
want to go for at least a half an hour
yeah of course have we been going for I
have no idea how I don't even know what
time you stir what time do we start guys
and I oh GD are 5 X 5 X oh yeah thank
you gel dad d / Sony wait hundred and
thirty-two viewers thanks for watching
the show everyone why I don't know how
this why would it why would we get a
surge in viewership that this is a lunch
I'll show on the worst day of our lives
like super late no prep and they're all
very unplanned we need to just drink
more I think we've just been doing the
show wrong or I think people just want
to see like utter debauchery an
organization and complete chaos some
people just want to watch the world burn
and dad for that we throw up we can go
that route that's right by the way are
like IPAs but you should really try this
cuz it started five minutes ago this is
a Kern River Brewing perdedor brewing
excellent brewery other winter ale
interior it sounds like a really
seasonal kind of like spicy stupid ale I
don't like winter ales generally but
this is actually a rebrand of their
original IPA that like made waves
everywhere no this is mine it smells
like your cat it smells like your cat
and you don't want it so you will give
it to me you will give it to me that is
tasty yeah it's not bad at all um yes
because of CES we're at CES mm-hmm was
that not I think all we mentioned that
it clarified that I think right um am I
mad at Kyle for sharing his address this
is kyle's address I am staying in a
different place right so this will be
the first time in weeks that Paul and I
haven't shared a bed if you well I
didn't think we're gonna get that detail
but maybe times who know if I I feel
like if you were gonna like release the
address where you currently work yep
this is a good time to do it yeah is
this temporary location system Prince
true and there's a security guard and
there's a gate it's probably the best
time to reveal although I i was able to
schmooze my way past him don't tell them
that i sweet-talked him just anima 20
it's Vegas hey I was like yeah they'll
run on money game at 20 was all good um
any stuff from corsair that you're
interested in at CES from the almighty
chalupa yeah i can go for a chalupa
right no I your name no I don't want it
and I want you actually we're gonna get
dinner after this race oh of course
maybe I should have my half of the show
oh yes I already visiting corsair um
what did what did I have oh they had the
new cases okay had the there
facts are very the rectum alpha spec
respect specs suspect series from course
there is their budget series so they're
cheaper yeah but they released the
highest end of the spec series is it's
the spec alpha right and I told George
cuz George is like I'm out of names I
got nothing else is very solid it call
it have fun it's awesome best guys if
I'm doing and doing some reporting for
tech syndicate cos of course gonna be
doing reporting as well but tech
syndicate is where I'm gonna have some
some of mice my reporting about stuff
watch my interview with George it was
fun nice um yeah he nice George is
awesome because he also he gives no
 a lot of times it seems yeah right
like there it is look we made a case
he'd be a great guest on the show the
computer in it he a great guest on
awesome hard he would yeah he knows his
stuff I think he's got he's got the
right attitude and all that kind of
stuff but yeah so the spec alpha is it's
like the highest end of that it's very
much that kind of like gamer design for
so2 brigade's you know the angles in the
big window and it comes in a like a gray
and red and white and black right a
black and yellow finish yep um
definitely not bad at all an acquired
taste I think yeah yeah but the interior
layout seems pretty cool dude I mean
relative what you think of the exterior
and that's the thing that you can be
fairly you know reassured about with
Corsairs like pick the case that you
like the look of yeah and chances are
you know you'll it's gonna have in
knowsley okay all right so here's a tech
power power of article there's the spec
alpha so um looks this extra reminds me
of one like an asus rog yeah yeah wanted
they're all in one yeah
they're not on one this mate the m8 no
no that was a as rock ones are pre-built
systems great the great cheer gr8 yeah
relating Zeus it's a red white black and
then there's a more subdued I'm shocked
that they didn't go with the black side
panels with the red striping for ROG
you're right that blew my mind I was
like what that was Jim missed
opportunity but George said they were
looking at other colors so this is this
is definitely the kind of case it seems
like they might launch in a variety of
different colors through the they have
like three variations right now but
they're looking at other color
combination so I would be surprised if
they made a special right shorter run of
like you know you know I'm gonna say
right now I'm not a fan of the exterior
like at all it's just on my style I kind
of agree but at the same time it's one
of those it's one of those types of
styles that you don't really find in the
case of this price point this is an
eighty dollar case and it looks it looks
more expensive than that at least from
the the design factor it looks like like
like you know designers from art
school a fancy art school in New York
like helped to create this case that
would probably cost like you know
upwards of 100 150 dollars but it's 80
bucks so if you're into this kind of
aggressive bold design it's a little
it's a bit impressive for eighty dollars
doesn't it today it kind of looks like
it's gonna tip over here though doesn't
it it's a good optical illusion as well
well there's many fun things in one yes
they don't have a picture of the black
and yellow version here the bomb i see i
said the front of it to me kind of looks
like the front of a Best Buy yeah just a
little priceless favor say yourselves a
lot of stuff in best buy hey is this is
this entire ship yeah I don't think I
don't think it wasn't I don't like to
pop out window yeah a fan of the pop out
I like the pop-up window I like it it's
another one of these cases that issues
the use of a an optical drive bay so
then frees up some of the space inside
and it's got pretty good radiator
support and all that kind of stuff sorry
again i think i agree with kyle here
it's not necess
sarily the design that I go for but uh
George said the same thing that's also
what i like about george he's like look
he's very rare this is a case where
you're gonna love it or you're gonna
hate it yeah this is not a case where
there's metal groundies and you know
what he says that he hates it I don't
think he hates it I think boy yeah he
has he taken some militarizing actively
he's like I I haven't shown this to
anyone who said you know I'm kind of in
the middle about it he's like they
either like wow that's awesome or like I
hate it it looks terrible this is the
case they'll go like Super Bowl
something yes but there is definitely a
market for this style of case and if
you're into it it seems like the digital
was the called digital storm digital
storm cases kind of runs me a little bit
but cool i actually have more to say
about the other corsair cases okay
coming up on my half but what is this
valve reviews I don't I don't know I
don't know what any of this is add video
via our demos I i wish i had like a
contacted oculist or something because i
don't and it was able to do some videos
there this looks like it might just be
funny footage of is that is that Ranger
out of Ryan with an oculus I love Ryan
Trev Ryan shrouds awesome is he talking
he's such a degen oxide axle / fish I
want to see I want to see silly footage
of Ryan shroud in the area he's an
animal Hey look he's VR the VR
experience brought to you by Ryan shroud
X so this is the other is this the
nvidia this is envisioned i love the
contrast this i love in VR is the
contrast between what the hell's going
on in real life versus what's actually
going on here is it looks like he's
derping around with you know whatever
but what he's actually doing is like
piloting a jet over these majestic
mountains with you know like what like
what what does this have to do with what
Ryan Sharpe was just did you get to
reality that looks like he has like
sparklers on the fourth of July zyk yeah
Becky there's more there's more
this looks funny look what what's he
doing he's he's commanding him out and
he's clearly blinding him out show me
paint Offit's oh he's climbing Brian
shroud is climbing a mountain why is he
climbing nice ok this is get on it
audience meme it now that that should be
a thing ok um so yeah there's so much
going out at CES let's I know I have a
good idea Kyle what's up you have a full
schedule for this week a mine up and I
do is that correct that's true do you
have anything that you're really looking
forward to on your calendar anything
were you like either something you've
already kind of spotted a launch of or a
specific company who you're like they're
really nice or maybe somebody who gave
you money earlier I mentioned them on
the show see who gave me the most money
this year no honestly I'm excited about
all of them and I think it's probably
because I haven't done too much in depth
research of what they're actually going
to be showing at the event and and like
all the vendors you contact with your
like a youtuber journalist or whatever
they're they're kind of sometimes
they're they're really like like I don't
know what open about what they're
sharing but I feel like a lot of the
time if it's good they learn a bit
more cryptic about it like they kind of
want to entice you like oh why don't you
come out and see what we have to offer
it's a really great concept that we've
been dealing with and it's like okay
that doesn't really tell me specifics
but you have me intrigued at the very
least so there's a lot of vendors like
that that I'm seeing this year that I
really don't know what to expect but
that kind of makes me equally excited
for all of them like you said sometimes
CES is just showing up to a sweet and
seeing all the from last year and
and just being like ok so that is
actually a thing that is actually coming
out this year great good job guys and
there's a lot of that a very common
question when I roll in those sweet for
the first I was what's new yes exactly
can write e nua night know what's no new
yes right what have I never seen before
what will blow my mind and you know but
that can be rare and I think it's I
think that's the thing about CES is
you're just you're just hoping to be
surprised the whole time you never know
I mean you can easily go into a suite
for
company and they've got all the same
 and it's just kind of underwhelming
but I have high hopes for this year I'm
seeing a lot more here's the thing I'm
seeing a lot more vendors this year than
I did last year okay and there are a lot
more vendors that actually pertain to
the content of my channel end of like PC
DIY stuff really big brands that we all
are familiar with you know in building
computers and stuff like that so I'm
stoked about just that bad idea that's
good yes great answer um two questions
that have popped up in chap that I
wanted to answer one is from is drew
drew so Phyllis who just said your
favorite stuff at CES so far which I
don't think Cal can answer nope or maybe
more on his half of the show from
stuffies research but Kyle hasn't gone
anywhere yet rated i could say because i
visited corsair and visited asus and i
think the thing that stood out to me the
most um actually the asus rampage
there's a knock on the door the asus
rampu outside know the maximum gesture
the Maximus eight formula yeah right oh
that's not where GP one which we talked
about last week on the show they have a
demo of it I mean they have it there at
the isus booth and I was just like wow
that's a badass motherboard pizza we r
who ordered us a pizza yes it's already
paid for that's a good question this is
it very good is ah see if you're gonna
do that you can least pay for it what
did they get ok I mean should we just do
it what oh yeah I mean yeah we're gonna
yep you know Josh you need cash oh hey
how's got a cache creek okay so um you
 guys you guys you guys
what god I don't know it's just the
worst dream ever yeah give me some pizza
though we good the the person
responsible has not come forward yet I
don't think we she'd this because they
didn't pay for it what we paid for it we
pit I think for it alright this is the
second time we have had pizza delivered
while we've been streaming the first
time was by our friend fractal Josh who
did us the solid of paying for the pizza
yep rather than just having it delivered
so that we didn't have to be like dicks
to a pizza guy who shows up like hey I'm
just trying to do my job and deliver
pizza damn it but hey whatever what is
it but the first one is oh onion no
it's fine what's the other one's all
cheese oh I think you're just good
bucket ok let's go something smells
strong over there that's the jalapeno
ooh extra jalapeno a jalapeno for Paul
okay we hear those more pizza on the way
no guys if you're gonna order
please if we at least pay for it if
don't be it if we get more we're gonna
have to turn it away so yeah you guys
are
ruining the night of a purple leaf pizza
slippery okay doesn't bother me
let's let's let's roll ahead though all
right let's doing we're giving anyone
else some great ideas what else we have
tucked up mmm arm I don't know there's
some arm stuff there's so much CES stuff
I need to absorb it and i have not had a
chance to do that yet right rio toro
launchers a prison case what the hell is
this i saw that i passed right by it
doesn't look that i'm gonna look at it
because you don't reminds me of a ranger
like a deep cool type company okay
trying to make their way into the US
market but some former course i can be
wrong former employees of course area
and vidya founded this comes okay it's
totally it's all the rio toro like
kokoro all they state is that they
develop innovative pc components
difficult to gauge what what they intend
to do in the future website also list
gaming mice and keyboards here's a case
i don't know what it's it's not
terrifying I mean it's got a mesh front
it's got some green doesn't have a good
picture hey don't look like it um prism
Tower rgl it's an RGB case case
interesting everything is RGB now
literally everything it's got to have
our gb lights on if it's not our gb it's
not it's not hot actually I'm phrase in
that vein and going back to something
that the Maximus eight formula
motherboard asus has on display not only
did they do the right thing by having
only RGB LEDs on the board with no other
colors around black or dark gray right
it has an RGB header an RGB LED header
on the motherboard okay I don't know how
how it's gonna work as far as
compatibility goes uh-huh but for
instance if you have our gb LEDs in your
case okay so like I don't know if you
could take like at NZXT hue nu plus like
the Justice strips right just take the
strips and plug it in and forget about
the module itself yeah forget about the
module but it's got a head around the
motherboard to plug the RGB LEDs
indirectly ok and then
yeah and then you can use the assume I
haven't seen this directly but
presumably then you can use a software
to control your RGB lighting um not just
on the motherboard but match it with
everything else in the case I'm
surprised asus didn't also have LEDs
like RGB LED strips to go along with
that because that seems like it would go
a hand in hand as far as like a
marketing thing that's crib I the
motherboard by the LED strips well
they're also a taiwan-based company and
those no shortage of LEDs in Taiwan no
tell you that they are everywhere if you
want cheap if you want cheap LEDs oh my
god just just buy a thousand-dollar
plane ticket to go to Taiwan we do need
by a bunch of strips we need RGB toilet
paper it's been super cheap eat okay
that's already on the way guys okay oh
it's old news but you know what
eventually eventually Paul it's gonna
get annoying when you have when every
single peripheral and thing on your desk
is RGB and you have literally eight or
nine different softwares to control them
like we need one you there eventually
everyone's going to have our GV
we're going to need one universal RGB
soft like program to control everything
so and that's why I mean like one of the
things I think why corsair goes with
like the corsair link United software
that they have the right kind of thing
but I mean the tendency for companies
when they develop that sort of thing is
to make it you know unique and special
for the company rather than open yeah so
um oh so yeah who who knows I like RGB
LEDs I don't they're not a strong
selling point for me unless I'm really
like building a system specifically like
this needs to light up and everything
like that right for the most part I
consider them more of a nice to have and
drew I find with with any stuff that I
have that's multi-coloured RGB LEDs I
play around with a little little bit at
first and then I settle on a color and
then I leave that that like I don't
write mess around with it a bunch after
that exactly exactly you always get the
idea in your mind like when you're
buying you like I'm gonna have fun with
Spence I'm gonna drop so many hours into
configuring LEDs I'm gonna like change
it on a weekly basis now you find
something you like and then just set it
and forget about it like the next
years until you buy something new going
along with your idea of some sort of a
uniform centralized place to control RGB
LEDs yeah that could be something that
would encourage me to have you know to
use more colors would be like what if I
could program it so it's like it's like
type a Type A one one right you know
every day of the week taipei 101 lights
up and I'd be cool so maybe something
we're like a you could put it on
schedule schedule Monday's rainbow day
and tuesday is like you should patent
that show anything red day or and
wednesday is pink only pink sunsafe i
don't know i'm just-just snow yes I'm
telling you I completely agree that's a
good idea hey I park it immediately I
should I should celery stick sushi sell
that to people yeah okay um what time
did we start again uh chat tell us what
time we started we don't know what we're
doing i really don't i feel like i've
been going for a good 45 to an hour that
long really I mean we turned off for a
while I have no idea I don't know I
really have no idea what time did we
start streaming y'all come out I think
we started screaming before seven of
course maybe 640 it's probably been like
50 minutes Paul okay well I think that
is a good time to wrap up my half of the
show then oh we're so close to a
thousand viewers do hey nice guys if
you're watching don't go anywhere we're
gonna cut the stream very briefly and
then we're going to stream again for
kyle's half of the show kyle has had
time today to plan his half of the show
which means that we will have more
visual things to show you and Kyle will
have researched information on topics to
that puts so much unfair pressure on me
to elucidate no I don't I don't feel
confident in my have to show anymore you
told me that you had done now there's
this golden standard that I have to
there is Tim's gonna be the cows have
the show's gonna be the best best cows
half of the show ever pulse drunkies
lying I'm lying to all I need more beer
yeah guys thanks for watching my half
the show again sorry it was late and
there wasn't a whole lot of prepared
stuff but i will be doing more
yes coverage on tech syndicate this week
yep by posting one or two videos to my
channel just with some shenanigans and
some random stuff and it's going to be
wonderful yes and I'll be back next week
on Tuesday for a more normal awesome
hard work again stay tuned we'll be
right back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
