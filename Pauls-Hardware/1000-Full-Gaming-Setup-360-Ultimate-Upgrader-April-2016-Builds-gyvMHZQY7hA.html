monthly builds video for April 2016
first off I am a little under the
weather I happened this week I don't
like to like you know complain about
that too much but just so you know I am
a little bit congested also I know this
is the April 2016 builds video but it's
actually still March as at the recording
of this it's March 31st tomorrow is
April April first and just so you guys
know right up front I'm not planning on
any April Fool's nonsense this year so
this will be my April video I guess
anyway what this video is all about is
that choosing parts for new PC can be
confusing for people especially if your
first time builder so each month I
create a couple computer build parts
lists so these are parts lists they're
based on your votes and your feedback
although I also do build them sometimes
so if you came to this video expecting
to see me actually assemble something
I'm not going to be doing that today but
I will direct you over to my builds
playlist which is right here where I
have lots of builds even just earlier
this month I built my wife at least the
first stage of her new computer so
that's up and ready to go if you guys
want to check it out also this is based
on your feedback as already mentioned so
I do want to hear more from you guys
from last month I actually did this Q&amp;amp;A
are not Q&amp;amp;A there's a straw poll just to
ask you guys what I should build for
this month so you can see number one
right here full gaming system
$1,000 so I will be doing that full
build including system monitor
peripherals I'm skipping the VR build
for this month simply because Avaya ver
and oculus are hard to get right now if
you didn't pre-order they're not
available to elect July so I'm going to
push that back maybe another month and
then I am going to also be doing this
potential PC build so I was shooting for
about 400 bucks although I did not
actually end up spending 400 ollars with
the idea being a system that is really
really upgradeable but has a really low
entry-level cost so if you need to get a
system you can kind of build it now and
then save up and then upgrade in the
future which I actually often recommend
so there you go also don't forget that
next month I will be doing this again so
be sure to vote on what you want to see
in May let me paste this into twitch
chat twitch chat is here too by the way
guys I originally broadcast this live
every month twitch.tv slash
hardware I don't really have a set
schedule for it but it's just typically
at the end of each month or the
beginning of the next month so just
follow my Twitter if you want to find
that out anyway here's the options for
next month so check those out and let me
know what you think all right so let's
kick right off into it with April 2016
and this is the thousand dollar full
gaming setup that includes the system
itself and usually the builds that I do
here only include the system unless
otherwise mentioned and in this case I'm
mentioning otherwise this will include
the other stuff and then also I'm using
PC part picker to put all my build lists
together because I just think it's a
great resource for price comparisons and
also it has like filters you can use to
make sure everything is compatible in
that kind of stuff compatibility filters
and then of course links to all this
stuff if you're watching on YouTube at
least is going to be down in the
description so go ahead and click on all
that good stuff and you will be able to
actually go to these pages alright no
number one against thousand dollar full
gaming setup here all the parts for it I
went with skylake because I just feel
like it's you know the best thing to
invest in right now it's the newest
platform and then here all the parts on
the list I also included Windows 10 here
I'm going with the kinguin net version
of Windows 10 which originally was about
$20 but now the price has gone up to 25
for $28 I also got a monitor and a
keyboard mouse combo from coolermaster
down there so let start with the CPU
high-five 6500 3.2 gigahertz there's a
6400 you could get for a little bit
cheaper but this one you can get for
about one hundred ninety-five dollars if
you buy straight from Newegg or
something like that
skylake quad-core this one has a higher
clock speed than the 6400 I tried to do
some overclocking with these lasts more
actually almost two months ago now
intel has kind of shut that down but um
it's still a good processor is still
pretty peppy so if you want to spend
about 50 to $60 more definitely
seriously consider it 6600 K you'd have
to spend about 50 bucks more for that
CPU and about $30 minimum for a decent
cooler to go with it but that would be a
pretty nice boost in CPU performance for
this but would cost more money for the
motherboard I have this gigabyte z170 HD
3 which as you can see is available here
for as little as 110 dollars with a $10
Melon rebate from
and this little motherboard I feel like
does it I mean it gets a job done it's
one of those thinner motherboards so you
know bear that in mind it's not like
it's a cheaper motherboard we're looking
at a hundred dollar price point but it
is still z170 so you can still overclock
it's even got some coolie on the VRMs so
you can you know overclock it's probably
I can overclock as well as like a $200
board but you can still get probably
eighty to ninety percent of what you
would get with a more expensive board
you got stuff like a couple USB 3.0
front panel headers and and you know you
got some legacy support on there as well
that's typically what you get with these
lower end motherboards but I also like
that you have an MDOT two slot because
that is a way you can get really fast
storage if you want to drop in something
like an MDOT two SSD in the future also
Tom's Hardware recommended anyway let's
go on to memory I have a two by eight
aid kit from g.skill this is the aegis
Aegis g.skill Aegis 16 gig ddr4 2133 as
you can see fairly simple design very
low profile black it'll blend in you
know yeah I really just use the PC part
picker drill down to find an 8 gig to
buy eight gig kit 21:33 or 2400 I don't
spend too much because the memory speed
isn't going to affect anything and I
wanted it to look decent fifty seven
dollars for this kits ain't half bad a
data premier SP 550 240 gig SSD I keep
coming back to this drive because it's a
very decent performer it's not by any
means the fastest 2.5 inch SSD you can
get but it keeps being like 60 bucks or
less there's a few other in this or
others in this range that you can get
right around $60 for 240 or 256 gig SSD
I think it's a really nice price to
performance I was even looking a hundred
and twenty gig assist ease for the
second build that I did today and I
don't even feel like those are like you
got to spend like 40 bucks I'm like why
wouldn't you just spend 20 bucks more
and get basically double the capacity
anyway for a video card we have an r9
398 gig I was trying to wedge a 390 X in
here but that really workout shows this
one from gigabyte because it's available
for about 300 bucks seriously consider a
390 X if you can find one that's on a
special I wasn't able to find any today
but this one's pretty decent it's got
like you know nice cooler from gigabyte
it's not tear
long two even got a backplate on it look
look bringing pretty nice looking
backplate so it'll look sexy in there
next up is the case I want to define s
with window so it's just a really solid
case IV well I actually haven't build in
this specific one but I've built in the
define our v and kyle has a bill in this
it's just a very nice case for seventy
bucks and i feel like especially for a
beginner you're going to get a better
experience with this because there's
plenty of room to work with and it has
room for all of your needs in there in a
nice big window so you can kind of see
what's inside for the power supply this
is this is all right so the SSD and the
power supply from this build are both i
used in both builds because i keep
drilling i keep using my drill down
methods on pc part picker to find the
right power supply and i keep coming
back to this one because i'm like
alright I want something between 500 and
650 700 watts because that'll that'll
accommodate pretty much any any SSD I'm
sorry any graphics card any single
graphics card that solution that's out
there I want it from a reputable vendor
I want 80 plus gold because it's a
decent boost in efficiency going to 80
plus gold compared to bronze and then
when you do that and you look at the
options there are several options down
here in like the 70s dollar range
actually can get this for 50 bucks if
you do a mail-in rebate with ncx right
now and but none of them have this sort
of like look it's fully modular and it's
got all black cables oh my god I would
really want it a power supply and
there's I mean there's really not a lot
of competition for this one I feel like
down in this area so I've used this
power supply before I will keep
recommending it as long as it's
reasonably priced and has all these
features and all that good stuff you
have the power supply you will of course
need those other things I mentioned so
that includes I decided to include
Windows and I have been recommending
getting Windows 10 from King Wynette's
because it is very inexpensive and
whereas there is some question ability
to them being possibly grey market or
international versions or whatever I
personally think that if you buy this
and activate it with Microsoft and it
works then Microsoft is happy especially
with Windows 10 anyway the price has
gone up since I first started
recommending this it went up by about 10
bucks but you can still get it for 28
Denine and i find that that is a much
more reasonable price to invest for
something like Windows 10 that is going
to be doing data tracking on you and
that kind of thing anyway so yeah super
cheap also you need a monitor so I did
the drill down again this is an Acer 60
Hertz 21.5 inch 1080 monitor with LED
backlights and the reason is a way
that's the wrong thing it's just cheap
amazon has it for like 90 bucks right
now yes you know a higher refresh rate
you know one hundred and hundred Hertz
or higher than that would be nice but
hey can't get that for 90 bucks and this
one has very decent ratings and this'll
get you up and running without having to
invest too much you also need a keyboard
and mouse so for that I have the
Devastator 2 this is brand-new from
coolermaster they have a Devastator
original the Devastator 2 is new and
therefore I assume much B must be much
better also kitty hello welcome welcome
thanks for joining have to assume the
Devastator too much must be much nicer
because it has two on the end it's
available with the red green or blue LED
backlighting it's a rubber dome keyboard
but for 30 bucks for a pretty nice
well-built
keyboard and mouse combo forward and
back buttons on the mouse which are nice
you have some media controls on the
keyboard as well
that are up there and you know this is
just nice little combo Devastator
original had tons of positive feedback
this one is already getting a really
good reviews on new egg even though it's
brand new so there you go alright so
that's my $1000 complete builds so if
you're starting off from ground zero and
you have nothing to use from a former
system or anything like that for about a
thousand and I guess I should I should
at least say it's not I did go slightly
over its a thousand 1146 according to
that but anyway let's move on to the
next thing which is my potential PC so I
like doing builds where I like where
somebody says hey I'm on a really strict
budget and I'm like all right you could
build the system on a really strict
budget and you know cut way back on
everything and get yourself a working
system that you'd have to make
compromises in a lot of areas or you
could do something like this get
yourself a working system this doesn't
have a graphics card for example but
this is completely built around the idea
that in three or six months you're going
to be upgrading
it's and making it better because that's
the benefit of building your own system
so I even got this below 400 bucks this
is three hundred and sixty dollars for
your potential PC so that would even
leave you some wiggle room to buy
yourself an operating system as well
anyway this is also a skylake based
builds because I didn't feel like there
was a nice upgrade path well x99 would
be a nice upgrade path but you can't do
that for 400 bucks AMD I just if you're
looking at AMD just wait wait for later
this year because the upgrade path there
is non-existent they're completely
replacing their platforms on FM 2 as
well as a 3 anyway g 4400 asrock
motherboard 8 gigs of ram and that same
SSD that same power supply in a cooler
master case so let's run through these
really quick pentium g 4400 is basically
the cheapest LGA m51 cpu that you can
get just to get a system up and running
however even for about $60 you get a 3.3
gigahertz dual-core processor it's not
going to run circles around the higher
end ones but it will again get you up
and running and it's got integrated
graphics intel HD graphics 510 so you'll
be able to work your computer you just
won't be able to do a whole lot of
gaming right out of the gate but the
mother where we have the asrock z170 m
pro 4s micro ATX I chose this one as a
part that I'm planning to keep in this
build so there's six parts in this build
four of them I'm intending you to keep
two of them plus sort of a third I'm
intending you to replace or upgrade this
one I wanted you to keep even though
it's about a hundred dollars
it still has a pretty nice feature set
for a hundred dollar motherboard at z170
of course so if you upgraded to an
overclockable CPU in the future you
could overclock it it's got some vrm
cooling on there which is nice if you're
playing to overclock it is micro ATX so
you don't have quite as much expansion
but I find you know most people go for
single card solutions anyway so you can
drop drop a graphics card or even two in
here if you so desire in the future I
also like that it has a nm2 port right
there in the center which I don't know
how well you can spot that but there it
is yeah MDOT 2 which is right there you
really can't see that very well come on
there's the m2 Ultra m2 right there so
you can upgrade to a faster SSD or
something like that in the future
you want to and then what else what else
does this have says other things I need
to zoom out zoom out SATA connectors USB
the main thing this is missing I think
is it only has like three fan headers so
you would want to get a fan controller a
fan splitter if you went that route and
then also for the i/o you've got a DVI
and an HDMI which are going to be fine
for your integrated integrated CPU
graphics for the time being and I think
with those two connectors you'd be set
with just about anything
budget memory holy crap four gig memory
stick for thirteen dollars this is a vex
ears budget series this is just cutting
the price down as as little as you can I
did two of these sticks for $26
again there's no it's it's ugly it's
just green but it will get you off the
ground and up and running and you could
upgrade memory very easily in the future
another thing I liked about this
motherboard was it's got four four dimm
slots so you can add more memory in the
future if you want again that same SSD I
just I find that an SSD is a vital thing
to have right now if you want a fast
feeling computer that's very responsive
and I also like the idea of keeping your
SSD and not planning to upgrade it
because if you install windows on it or
something like that the SSD and the
motherboard that's going to give you the
easiest upgrade in the future if you
have to swap out the SSD and reinstall
windows or something like that it's just
a little bit more of an inconvenience
and if you change the motherboard out
often your windows license won't work
anymore if you have done a Windows
license so keep that in mind - all right
the case here here's the cooler master
in two hundred this is one I've
recommended before it's a nice case it's
got plenty of airflow it's all black
well designed
you know I've liked getting a real big
side panel window or anything like that
but hey you have front panel USB 3.0 for
example and just plenty of room in there
and you can see this case has many
reviews over a long period of time and
people like it finally that same power
supply's before yuvigi a supernova X 650
watt 8 + gold because again all of those
reasons I told you guys before are the
same reasons that I would choose that
now and I can't like I tried to find
that Mouse was like that no 70 bucks
get yourself power supply it'll last you
for years
and it will do everything you wanted to
do anyway though that is all for this
video guys I really hope you have
enjoyed it those are my two builds let
me know what you think of them down in
the comment section down below on
YouTube also hit the thumbs up button
and leave me a like if you enjoyed the
video you can also check out my store at
startup Pulsar right at net or you can
pick up mugs and paint glasses and
t-shirts not this t-shirt but I have a
brand new t-shirt design coming out very
soon stay tuned for more tech videos and
we'll see you all next time
