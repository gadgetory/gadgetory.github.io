hardware this is my monthly builds video
for October 2018 if you're not familiar
every month I part out a couple pcs that
you could buy the parts for and put
together yourself at home just FYI I'm
not building the system's today so check
out my builds playlist if you want to
see me put a system together I have
plenty of those available and I'm
actually gonna start off today's video a
little bit differently than I usually do
because I'm gonna do a quick unboxing
right now Corsairs new Vengeance RGB Pro
Series ddr4 memory gives you blazing
fast speed and dynamic multi zone RGB
lighting with 10 ultra-bright LEDs per
module customization options are
practically endless with the Corsair IQ
software package and they're available
with black or white heat spreaders find
out more about the Corsair Vengeance RGB
Pro Series via the sponsor link in the
description so if it's not already
obvious this is the core i9 the newest
Intel processor ninth gen it's a copy
Lake refresh it's still 14 nanometer but
it is eight cores and sixteen threads as
you can see performance unleashed for
Paul's hardware this is a review kits
sent directly to me unfortunately we
don't have the actual dodecahedron or
whatever the the retail packaging is but
we do have the important part which is
the processor right there in the middle
so I now have a 9900 K I can't share any
performance numbers about the CPU yet
but I can do a theoretical parts list
for build if you are absolutely dead set
on buying this processor now this video
series is still based on your feedback
so I do have a strawpoll lengths in the
video's description about what pcs you
guys want to see in November it's gonna
be Black Friday or at least Black Friday
month so I've got a few price points
listed there as well as potentially
skylake x high core count CPUs that were
announced the 28 core W 31 75 X or maybe
a bang for the buck 9600 K build if
you're interested in AMD builds honestly
I think I have you guys covered for that
today so I'm not gonna probably go over
new ones of those next month but we'll
see what prices you guys are actually
interested in this is the trap hole for
last month for October and everyone
wanted to see the update to the late
2018 best or fastest gaming PC possible
so I definitely have that I did that
build last month
the 9900 K was available in this video
did very well so got a follow-up on that
then of course bang for the buck Rison
Plus on SIL GPUs and then I also wanted
to include the $800 PC because Pete did
seem like a fair amount of people were
interested in that but let's jump into
it but the first build here I did $1000
and $800 for a bang for the buck
AMD build and I'm basing these both
around the risin 7 1700 because it is on
sale for a really good price right now
one hundred and eighty dollars and this
is still 8 cores and 16 threads and it's
still overclockable so you can get very
comparable performance to like an 1800 X
or 2700 X if you overclock the CPU a
little bit I didn't include an
aftermarket cooler because we are
strength trying to stick to sub $1000
and right now it's coming up to about
970 but adding that on might give you
some better overclocking in the future
if you're looking at other CPUs
available for this platform you can see
that for 8 cores you really can't get
better than the 1700 right now you got
to spend an extra 40 bucks to claw your
way up to the 1700 X and even more than
that if you on a 2,700 2,700 2,700 X and
I think the high core and thread count
is really one of the things you should
go for if you're considering investing
in this platform and you want a a mid to
high end PC out of it this is a look at
the motherboards that are available for
this platform and if you're looking down
on the low end there's quite a few that
are available down here but if you're
going for an 8 core you probably want
some better power delivery and for that
reason I'd recommend sticking to the
motherboards that have good reviews and
that are probably more in the 80 to 100
dollar range I actually chose this asus
rog board because it does have some
nicer features and it's got a got a nice
look it's got very good power delivery
for overclocking of course this is about
a hundred and twenty dollars you could
get away with something a little bit
cheaper and I will follow up in the
second eight hundred dollar build with
some more recommendations for that as
for video card for $1000 PC I would be
looking at either a gtx 1070 or the AMD
radeon vega 56 i'm looking for both of
those here the vega 56 unfortunately is
still about four hundred and twenty
dollars at its lowest price you can get
a 1070 though for 360 at the cheapest or
maybe 380 the 360 dollar version here is
thanks to a $30 million rebate and this
is the mini version from gigabyte so i
would take a look at some of those 380
dollar variants as
if you want to get a one that might
overclock a little bit better out of the
box and then rounding things out for the
rest of the build we have a 16 gig
memory kit that's 3200 speed you want
faster memory and a 16 gig kit it's kind
of my starting out point these days if
you're not going super budget I have a
500 gig SSD which will be plenty enough
to get you by and get some systems
loaded up maybe supplement that with a
mechanical drive if you have an old one
lying around that you can reformat and
then we have about $60 on our case that
shows the NZ NZXT H 500 because it's a
solid black case by the way this whole
system would be pretty much all black
with the option to turn on RGB if you
wanted to and then finally we have a 550
watt power supply it's 80 plus bronze
rated this one's a very good deal at
about $33 after a mail-in rebate it is
not modular but it does have all black
cables so if you wanted to spend a few
more dollars on the power supply you
definitely could get something that's a
little bit nicer than this but this will
get you buy if you want to spend a few
more bucks maybe look into a 650 watt
version and then modular power supplies
are also very convenient so that's my
list for the 1000 dollar version but
people were looking at an $800 variants
here is that it's only slightly
different in a few ways so I went with a
slightly less expensive motherboard I
went with an 8 gig memory kit instead of
16 gigs and then we've dropped down from
the gtx 1070 to an AMD radeon RX 588 gig
which you can get for 230 bucks these
days which is a good price so i'm just
going to go over the parts that are
different from the $1000 build starting
with the motherboard this is an asrock
x3 70 pro 4 as Weka actually did a
really good job with their lower end x3
70 and be 350 boards when it comes to
power delivery there's some of the only
ones at the low end that are actually
pretty sufficient and it's also got
features you'd want like it's still got
MDOT to support and everything it is a
standard ATX board so it'll fit in the
case and it's all black and white for
about 80 bucks or I guess 82 dollars if
you go for the mail-in rebate it'll get
the job done and it shaves 25 or 30
bucks off of the total price which is
part of the thing that gets us down
under 800 for memory I went with a
slightly slower kit this is a 3000 speed
kit rather than 3200 so you get a little
bit of a drop-off in performance but not
too bad and you can get this for about
$91 right now
and it is a kid that will work out of
the boxers rise and you just got to plug
in the XMP values again this is an 8 gig
kit versus 16 and of all the parts that
I dropped down for this less expensive
build I'd probably stick with the 16
gigs over this if you have that choice
but this will get you by and if you
money is tight then you got to have
memory so that's just something that'll
work for you finally for the graphics
card if you're dropping down from a 1070
basically you're gonna drop down either
to an AM be ready on rx 588 gig or in
NVIDIA GTX 1066 gig if you look at the
prices for both of those they're
actually really comparable about two
hundred and thirty two two hundred and
forty dollars is where they start an
depending on the games you're playing
these cards kind of trade blows back and
forth I opted for the rx 580 because I
also like to think that in the future
you might consider something like a free
sync monitor and free sync monitors are
much cheaper so if you're not planning
on eventually upgrading to a RT X 2080
or 2080 I in the future then the rx 580
from AMD Radeon could in the future be
paired with a free sync monitor which
you can get much cheaper in like a 1440
free sync monitor would go great with
that so that's why I chose that but of
course easily swapping the gtx 1066 gig
if you have a g sync monitor already or
if you just like nvidia better and now
the fastest computer you can possibly
build right now or at least
theoretically so again I want to point
out a couple very important caveats to
this bill
one I am not endorsing buying the I 999
hundred K right now it has not been
independently tested please wait for
independent review tests to come out
that said it's pretty safe to assume at
this point that the 9900 K will be the
best choice if all you're concerned
about is gaming on a single graphics
card and you want the best gaming
performance possible that's pretty
reasonable to assume right now we don't
know how much better it will be we don't
know if the 8700 K will still be a
better choice by comparison that said
someone's gonna buy this there are
people who are like I want that I want
to get it now and I don't even care that
new eggs pre-order price is 580 freaking
dollars wow that sucks new egg that's
way higher than
was supposed to be pre-orders when it
was first going on we're like 522 $530
but it's literally the only place it has
it available right now so that is
impacting the overall cost of the system
which is close to $3,000 if you're
comparing that to my fastest build
possible from a month or month and a
half ago that was about $2,400 so yes it
costs more now but what can you do you
got it you got to pay for the best I
guess also want to point out that when
it comes to fastest gaming PC possible
the CPU is going to be one very
important factor and then the graphics
card of course is going to be another
very important factor the RT X xx atti
is the fastest graphics card right now
but beyond that I'm trying to keep
things somewhat reasonable so I'm not
like assuming you're gonna be doing ln2
overclocking I'm not even assuming
you're gonna be doing full custom water
cooling on this this is still air-cooled
parts for the most part except for an
all-in-one liquid cooler for the CPU and
I've chosen aftermarket GPUs like this
asus strix geforce r-tx 2080 TI which
has a custom PCB so it's got better
power delivery and we have now
discovered that the founders edition
cards are a little bit more picky about
doing custom v BIOS updates and there
have been V BIOS release that have
higher power limits that allow you to
overclock the cards better or at least
go higher frequencies if you have
adequate cooling and the aftermarket
cards are much more capable accepting
those aftermarket V bios's as well as of
course just running at higher speeds
overall because they are over built and
the OC versions that ship overclocked
have the bin GPUs that promise they will
be overclocked one last thing to point
out is that the highest of the high end
GPUs have not been launched for the r-tx
2080 ti yet so the EVGA is probably
going to come out with a kingpin
classified gigabytes probably have an
horas extreme and so on and those will
probably be the fastest of the fastest
but we got to work with what we have for
now so that said let's quickly run down
this list of course the 9900 K at the
top and if you buy this you will at
least hopefully get this cool
dodecahedron packaging which is just
kind of fun we want to keep things cool
so I did upgrade the liquid cooler this
is actually adding $100 to the price of
this build so bear that in mind too but
this is the master liquid ml 360 R what
that would be a nice match with the case
that I chose and I also have this on
hand so I can build the system which is
nice
it is 160 bucks a little on the higher
end for an all-in-one liquid cooler for
a motherboard we've got the z3 90 Taichi
ultimate from asrock and this is about
two hundred and ninety dollars if you're
wondering why I chose it this is part of
the reason I physically have it here
with me so I can actually again build
the system with it this is on the higher
end again for motherboard you could
probably get by with something more in
the 180 to 220 dollar range but since
I'm planning to build this system that's
what I'm going with
and the z3 90 boards have not been
widely tested for their power delivery
systems yet this one I'm pretty
confident will be adequate for
overclocking the 9900 K at the highest
levels so that is why I have chosen it
but of course peruse other motherboards
if you aren't interested in this one for
memory I've gone with a 16 gig kit this
is ddr4 3600 and actually when I was
looking at higher speed memory I found
the 3600 speed memory had some pretty
good deals on it even the RGB variant
this is only 160 dollars right now on
Newegg that's a pretty good deal it's
actually doesn't have the best latency
it's casa latency 19 so as always
reality check your memory choice and get
the fastest speed for the most
reasonable price but that's a good kit I
would recommend for a storage
configuration I once again have an MDOT
to nvme SSD for our main operating
system that's a 500 gig drive this is
basically the same stuff that it shows
last month but it's about $155 for that
and then a 1 terabyte drive for our game
storage for about one hundred and thirty
seven dollars and then of course the
graphics card
we got the Asus GeForce r-tx 20 80 TI
Strix this is the overclocked edition
again I chose this graphics card because
I have it so I can use it for the build
for the price I've entered 1250 because
these 20 ATT eyes are impossible to find
right now you're supposed to be able to
get the 20 ATI for as little as $1,000
but that's a pipe dream at the moment
you should be able to get one for as
little as 1200 theoretically if you're
just okay with going with the founders
Edition but the aftermarket overbuilt
versions like this have been mostly
selling for around 1200 to 1250 so
that's why I put that price in there
finally we have our case just what was
the same case we built with before the
Lian Li PC
Oh 11 under Bauer edition in white and
then I
650 watt EVGA supernova power supply is
actually a slightly different power
supply because it's a better one for
less expensive so wanted to update it to
that it's fully modular and again of
course all black cables so guys there
you have it once again my builds for
October 2018 if you want the fastest
single GPU gaming PC that you can get
right now you want a ninety nine hundred
K that you overclock as fast as you can
within reason and a twenty eighty atti
that you do just about the same thing
with of course you're paying a lot of
money for this so please bear in mind
that my first two builds today we're
eight hundred and a thousand dollars
that are still perfectly adequate gaming
PC's that you don't need to spend three
grand on and also try to chase down
parts that are very difficult to find
right now that said people are always
interested in what is the fastest thing
you can build right now so I will be
putting the system together and doing
some testing on it later this month so
thank you guys for watching hit the
thumbs up button if you enjoyed it
subscribe if you want to see that when
it comes out in the future and that oh
and links to all the stuff I talked
about today is in the description below
