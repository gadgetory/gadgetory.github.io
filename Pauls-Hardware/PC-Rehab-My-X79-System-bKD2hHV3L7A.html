hardware today's video is on yet another
gtx 980ti it's this one from gigabyte
and hey everyone welcome to pauls
hardware I have another gtx 980ti video
I'm gonna share with you guys today and
this one's from gigabytes g1 gaming ok
hey guys Paul here with paul's hardware
and today we got another 980ti video I'm
gonna be going over this g1 gaming from
gigabyte alright you know what guys I
think I need to set this aside and I
have a confession to make
it's it's something that's been weighing
on me for quite some time but this
morning it really struck home as I was
getting ready for the live show and you
know I could sit here and explain it to
you guys all day but I think the best
thing to do is just show you what a sham
life I've been living actually is this
is what you guys typically see this is
this is my setup this is the desk and
back there everything's looking pretty
clean pretty nice I'm really really
happy with the desk that I got set up
and all this good stuff everything's
pretty clean pretty organized you can
come out here and get my work done even
the area over here which still has lots
to be done this that's storage and
things that still need to be organized
and whatnot
everything's pretty happy and that's
this is this is the facade this is what
I show you guys every day but you know
what let's go let's go deeper into the
depths of my home and share share a dark
secret so here we are this is the
computer room this is my wife's desk on
the right side which is in reasonably
good shape this over here on the left is
my desk this is where I actually do most
of my video editing the arctic panther
is great for it but I like to come back
in here it's it's a great place to get
work done however if you can't tell
immediately it's just in shambles you
know there's this front that we present
to people
when we're making the videos that we
have these clean desks with like LEDs in
the background and everything and and
that's really just not what I've got
going on here this is all like tax
paperwork that I have to get done I'm
doing other I have this other ongoing
projects and organization stuff like
this it's right here that's it that's a
mini DV camera see cuz I got I got these
old mini DV tapes that I need to capture
and I'm working on setting that up you
know all these ongoing projects but it
just leads to a lot of clutter but you
know the clutter is something that I
could take care of pretty quickly the
real shame the thing that I'm terribly
terribly just just I want to hang my
head about is this computer right here I
don't know if you guys can hear it but
it's definitely a lot louder than it
should be a lot louder than I would
consider acceptable especially when I'm
critiquing other people's computers and
speaking of critiquing other people's
computers Kyle and I do that all the
time we look at people's computers and
we're like oh you should fix this or fix
that or whatever but you know what let's
take this out let's you know what
daylight is the best disinfectant so
they say so let's take this outside and
get a closer look all right so
everything is disconnected I'm out here
in the backyard
you might notice I've got some some
fields back here that's gonna be some
corn maybe some okra kale I don't um NAR
he's also lounging in the Sun but here's
here's my three main issues with this
system okay issue number one I'm using a
stock heatsink fan granted it is a stock
LGA 2011 heat sink fan which is a little
bit more rare but it's still not the
greatest I think I might drop in one of
my air cooling unit there my liquid
cooling units that I have since that
would go in there pretty easily issue
number two of course is just dust in
general since I haven't cleaned this in
quite some time I don't know if you can
see up here but yeah those families
there those are pretty nasty so getting
to pull those out and maybe clean them
off or I might replace him - that's a
possibility the graphics card could
probably use some cleaning that's a
GTX 780 by the way and then probably in
the worst case of hip hypocrisy for me
is this rat's nest of cables and SSDs
just down here and there's like a 3.5
inch drive that I just kind of set in
there and stuff like that all pretty
embarrassing so I need to reposition
some of these drives may reduce some of
those cables and just get everything a
little bit tidier so hopefully things
will calm down as far as the noise go
things will be cleaner and I'll feel
better about critiquing other people's
computers once this is in better shape
in case you guys are wondering this is
the system the x79 build that I put
together and my how to build a computer
video which is a year and a half two
years old and that now but then still
kicking strong and still a great option
for video editing and that kind of thing
so until I move over to Arctic can
through full time this is still getting
tons of use so definitely worth fixing
up and getting in good shape again at
the tools I have lined up for this job
are the vacuum cleaner which I'm only
going to be using on the outside so I'll
use it to suck dust off of the front and
suck dust off the back and off to the
top maybe the bottom as well but I do
not ever use the vacuum cleaner inside
the case apart from that my school
collection is pretty standard for this
job which is a screwdriver of course to
remove things that's necessary some
canned air and I have a toothbrush which
is great for getting dust off of stuff
and then for for stuff that requires a
bit more finesse I have this little it's
an old makeup brush of my wife's which
is great for just dust and stuff off
that's nice and delicate
I gotta say I'm really happy I moved
outside to do the majority of the
breakdown of what was going on here
because there's tons of dust on many of
the things not least the stock heatsink
fan that's LG of 2011 this thing is way
more cake with death dust than I thought
the Hall of Fame graphics card the GTX
780 from galaxy this is a pre Galax card
also super caked with dust so I think
I'm actually I'm not going to reuse this
card for now this is the 780 because
it's I think this might be a good use
case scenario to show how to clean a
graphics card and disassemble and
everything so maybe I'll save that for a
future video I'm not gonna reuse the
stock heatsink fan either although I
will be cleaning those both off
eventually so I'm gonna swap in a stock
980ti because it's been sitting in the
background and I might as well put it to
some better use and then also for the
CPU cooler I'm going to go with the
fractal Kelvin t12 this guy right here
and I'm choosing this because one it's
already set up for LGA 2011 I was using
this on the test bed up in the corner
back there
although I went with an air cooler now
because it's a little bit easier to move
around this has been tested and run a
few times so I'm confident you know it's
all good to go and everything and then
other than that I got the fans that I
pulled out I'm gonna be putting those
back in but I will be reconfiguring them
because I realized that I have a fan hub
back here and actually I also have the
fan controller that's built into the the
Corsair 760 T here so I'm gonna use
those rather than plugging the fans into
the motherboard which was what I was
doing and this motherboard is an older
gigabyte c7 x79 motherboard and these
lower fan plugs that I had it plugged
into don't have fan control I can't
control the speed so that should solve
my fans being loud problem dust is
mainly cleared out although there's
still quite a bit caked on I've gotten
quite very dusty doing this little
project but anyway let me finish this
out and then I'll give you guys a Grand
Tour of it once it's all finished
well everybody I don't know about you
guys but I'm feeling much better about
my progress today look how clean look
how pretty she is everything's where it
should be
my biggest like dilemma here was was
making sure that all the tribes which
were connected in very specific
locations because that's um raid
configuration setup I had to make sure
that as I was moving those and
unplugging them that ivory plugged them
back in the same way other than that
everything's like just way way cleaner
there's a lot more space up in here for
airflow to get back I mean everything
was working fine before it's just I felt
so bad with how what kind of a shambles
it was in I originally had a 240
millimeter closed-loop cooler up here
the pump failed on it and I had to pull
it out and at that point was when I
really did some rush stuff to like drop
some more drives in and all that stuff
so all the drives are now either in the
cage down here or the SSDs back in their
little 2.5 inch slots back there new
graphics card is installed CPU coolers
installed as well just a couple moments
of truth here how about some power there
we go and the moment of truth there goes
not too loud a lot of thing right now is
the pump but the pumps are running at
full speed because it's connected to
this other header over here so I'm going
to need to go into the BIOS to adjust
the RPMs on that that upper header is a
four pin and that does have speed
control these lowest ones do not on this
motherboard other than that all the fans
are connected and I think they're going
at full speed let me see if I can turn
them down
that's pretty loud
there's not a nice finish though
that's this is not at all what I have
planned
all right yes you can't always get what
you want
and those two front fans despite my
attempts to clean them are pretty bad
shape they're rattling all over the
place they're just old I wish they were
a little bit higher quality and had
lasted longer but I'll give Coursera
some crap for that
in the meantime thankfully I have
replacements so let's swap out these
fractal venturi HP for teens and see if
that improves things at all
okay
I have swapped out my front fans with
some fractal venturi fans and let's see
if it doesn't sound terrible anymore
that's insanely better again that that
noise you can hear right now is that
pump which is running at full speed and
I will be able to go in there and change
that and slow that down just a little
bit but oh my gosh that heinous whining
ratalie off-balance noise from those
Corsair fans is gone and you know it I
get the added bonus of those fans not
having white LEDs on them I'm really not
a big fan of LED fans to be perfectly
honest
fortunately the exhaust fan the 140 in
the back here is still going strong
that's a little bit higher quality one
and the old ones I just chucked in the
trash because they were done for but
that is all for this video guys I hope
you have enjoyed it I'm certainly
feeling much better about the system as
a whole it's a lot cleaner everything's
smoother it's I know it's gonna be super
quiet now and I feel much better about
critiquing people on pit my PC thank you
so much for watching though if you would
like to hit the like button on the
feedback area down below you can also
leave me some feedback to comment let me
know what your system is looking like
could yours use sort of a cleaning out
and a refresher like my interested or is
yours like do you diligently clean it
every month let me know and also don't
forget to subscribe to my channel for
more tech videos as always thank you
very much for watching
if you enjoyed this video though don't
forget to leave me some feedback in the
feedback feedback make the kiss</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
