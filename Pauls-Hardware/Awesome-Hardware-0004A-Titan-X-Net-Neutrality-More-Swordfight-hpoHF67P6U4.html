yeah are we real life yes we are okay I
knew as soon as you belted out the evil
laugh that we had to be live no that's
kinda you got a kick off this type of
show dem theatrics you might be blocking
your microphone pal oh oh you guys hear
me all right
is that better perhaps do I sound
beautiful weave people were doing a
countdown because I said 20 seconds but
then I took probably close to 30 so I
imagine we lost nearly half the audience
you're so unreliable all right guys we
we have had an interesting day so far
we've dealt with a little bit of
technical difficulties we're using a
setup that was not exactly what we were
planning to use today nevertheless we
think it's okay so I give us a little
feedback and chat let us know what it
sounds like silver chains says it sounds
well sweet so that's cool
all right by the way did you know silver
chains is actually my fiance's brother
he's silver chains is my future
brother-in-law really isn't that isn't
that interesting
that is nice I'll be extra nice to him
all right welcome unless he's a dick
then welcome to the family give him a
bunch of all right and welcome to
awesome hardware this is our weekly show
that Caroline I do on Tuesday evenings
at 5:30 p.m. Pacific time it's broadcast
originally live on our twitch channel
which is twitch.tv slash awesome
hardware and then we upload it's in two
halves the first half this week is my
half so that will be on my channel
Paul's hardware and the second half once
my half is done we'll go on Kyle's
channel that's called awesomesauce news
it's very intuitive yes and that's how
it works and if you're watching this in
the future there will be links to get to
his half and back to my half and it's
fantastic I promise it's a great system
it works great we've gotten excellent
excellent feedback on it so far drink
check we're drinking some Murphy's red
ale yeah excellent excellent beer
although these are our last two signs so
I actually might make it through the
entire stream without paying aisle might
not have to take a pee break and if I do
I'll probably just use this bottle
that'll be nice yeah in the meantime now
we have a tech news to talk about of
course we have all of the well not all
of the popular segments you've come to
know and love but many of them
we're gonna be talking about some GPU
news we're gonna be talking about the
internet and the state of the Internet's
and we're gonna be talking about we're
gonna be sorry we got a swordfight
segment coming up and we also have of
course just general news about
technology and then the second half is
Kyle's I know what he's gonna be talking
about new in the meantime as well you
can also send us tweets or talk to us in
chat our twitter handles are
flip-flopped because we are flip-flopped
and we didn't flip flop the Twitter
handles yet so mine is actually over
there
both will figure it out Kyle's is down
here Hey yes you guys know how this all
works
okay alright let's let's dive right in
those start talking about things that we
meant to talk about announcements we
have announcements yes we do
Kyle Kyle put his announcement before
mine so we'll talk about Kyle's first
only because it's more important okay
but my announcement for today is that
I'm now selling two new designs in the
awesomesauce merch store you can go
check them out I've actually put some
limited time one-liners on the backs of
various torso chasis that I'm selling
now again that's awesome sauce
network.com slash store this is a
one-time deal so once these shirts sell
out I will not be reprinting the one
liners on the back of the shirts at
least not that these avoid my warranty
ones yeah so if you click on if you
click on the boy to my warranty one in
the middle and then you can see like
open up one of the graphic ones yeah
that's fancy paint it's super adorable
has special straights so check out
megamouth store they will not be
restocked so so buy one
I am the meantime have no special shirts
on my store however I do have special
are you kidding kicker I was told by
epic John today or yesterday that I now
have up to 6 X on my site so I'm gonna
double-check this right now and verify
yes
so in black and in the dark gray you can
get all the way up to 6 X 4 you larger
gentleman out there and of course all
the way back down to small too if you're
into that so that's cool does it does it
go on infinitely is there like a 500 X I
don't know I don't know how big it
actually gets me and then one last
announcement is that Zoolander 2 is
coming in February 2016 1 and the only
reason I popped this up is because this
was like one of the first things that
popped up on my feed this morning and I
thought it was
I really enjoyed the Zoolander movie so
again I think it's hilarious that
they're making another one and this is
actually a Paris Fashion Week so there
goes Ben Stiller and watch this dude
trying to take a selfie like with him
and Ben's stories like now I'm happy
they're doing that I think those are
good movies and I hope they make more
good good and funny ones yeah
absolutely thing anyway those are our
announcements to start to show off and
and now we're actually gonna get into
tech news what's the name of our live
show Kyle awesome hard work alright
let's talk about some awesome hardware
oh yeah I said what you did there yeah
okay you did there so I'm gonna start
with my first segment which is a GPU
update this is the Titan X edition
oh hello Google ad this is a 10x edition
because it's Titan x is what a lot of
people are talking about if you're
talking about GPUs if you're not
familiar with it Titan X was sort of
informally announced slash launched at
GDC last week by Jensen it seemed like
it was kind of half planned but I know
some some actual cards have gone out to
some people I don't have one but I heard
Jays getting one and lionesses getting
one and actually the folks over at
videocards dot-com have come out with
some speculative specs that works right
as well as some benchmarks so if you're
looking at this chart over on the left
side yeah benchmarks the cards are going
out people have people have had the card
via the cards are writing so I'm over on
the left side is the Titan X and they're
comparing it to the Titan black and the
Titan the TB see indicators there means
there to be confirmed they're not really
sure about those so as you can see most
of it is still to be confirmed even if
you have this card and you plug it in if
you don't have saved the right version
of gpu-z
or a software that can actually
recognize the hardware you're still not
going to be able to find out what it
actually is another good question about
this is the benchmarks that have been
coming out so far how are they actually
doing them I have a feeling this has
some like then some like driver hackery
going on here it's typically the way in
video will control people's ability to
actually benchmark cards especially for
a big launch that they want to keep
secret is they won't release the driver
so you without the driver the cards so
so they've sent out cards to people yeah
they haven't deal through the drivers I
don't know I have no idea okay I know I
know Linus had the card arrived he
tweeted a picture of it Jay said he has
one that's being sent but I don't I'm
not sure as far as if drivers have been
sent out usually they do like a WebEx or
something like that to introduce the the
reviewers to the card and the technology
and that sort of thing
but video cards supposedly has these
benchmarks I'm showing you guys all the
way up to four-way SLI with the GTX that
works so some pretty impressive numbers
one thing I wanted to point out here is
that the r9 295x2 still seems to be
beating out the Titan X granted you're
talking about a single GPU versus dual
but still nice today AMD can can be like
at least of the fastest single GPU or
the fastest graphics card just not the
fastest GP using single GPU graphics
card so this is three dimeric eleven
extreme some just wow numbers and that
one look at that scaling that's insane
of course 3d mark is always pretty good
scaling since it's made to benchmark
graphics card this is 3d mark firestrike
the graphics core again and they they're
they apparently overclocked it as well
so I'm okay there's some benchmarks for
you guys again this is early it's video
cards calm they deal on a lot of rumor
and speculation but still pretty
exciting at least to see what it can do
and for anyone out there who's thinking
or saying or anything like that I guess
you can only think words or say them
what else can you do it pondered them if
you're thinking that how this is all
stupid because it's you know it's gonna
be at least a thousand dollars oh that's
another thing from the article by the
way is that they're saying it's probably
gonna be a thousand dollars
who knows again that's totally
speculation but if you're thinking oh
it's gonna be a thousand bucks and who
cares like it's it's the high-end stuff
like you know most people can't afford
it consider it if we will that the
yields on GPUs of this size since
they're larger are much smaller and when
the yields for GPU like the dies that
they're trying to cut for the Titan X
are low and and I had a chart on this
but I didn't pull it up for today but
it's like in the end of 50 to 60 percent
range so you end up with
a lot of GPUs that you can't use but it
might just be a part of that GPU that
you can't use so what they did with the
original Titan was they took all those
dies that weren't usable they disabled
enough elements of it to make kind of a
standardized lower version to version of
it and that's what became the GTX 780 No
so I think if history is any indicator
at this point you're gonna see the Titan
X come out you'll see it be in the
market for a certain period of time
that's largely going to be based on how
well it's selling and whether they feel
like they need a competitor and what the
tune the 390 and 390x do when they come
out and then somewhere in long lines in
the future we're gonna see another card
now the thing is they've already used
980 so I don't know what they'll call it
they have to call it like a nine eighty
five they couldn't call it nine ninety
because that should be the dual GPU one
that's usually what they say for that or
maybe they'll make a 1080 and they'll do
like another overlap where we have both
900 series and ten hundred series at the
same time who knows but um there's
trickle down here so so that's kind of
what gets me more excited yeah and these
numbers again taking with a grain of
salt
who knows how accurate they are bosom is
the 12 gigabyte frame buffer also rumor
or was like okay goodbye 12 gigabyte
frame buffer is one of the things that
is confirmed yeah and it's cool to hear
that although and then that could be
another thing that they are using to
define the highest end card the Titan X
if you have 12v other you know technics
yeah chip Hill also has some benchmarks
so here's benchmark CGG try comparing
the two websites to see if their
benchmarks kind of know matched it'll
know I was curious
it's the set that would have been that
would have been the hallmark of some
like good some good research some
actually looking up information we at we
we ran out of time today we do yeah the
day flew by my zoom h1 appears to not be
working great that was that was probably
just died for this just for the string
goodness anyway yeah hey you know what
I've never did this I never tweeted that
we're alive
alright so chip Ellis awesome some
benchmarks on those those so I'm taking
a look at those if you guys want to
check out the early benchmarks and then
this is the DP report and I've been
talking a lot about the Titan X I
thought I might as well also throw some
AMD stuff in there okay we like AMD as
well so AMD r9 390x again we've been
talking about it or trying to at least
mention it every week even though
there's not a whole lot to say now there
was a GDC demo that was powered by the
r9 390x so that's pretty cool you can
see it's in this case right here which
is like I don't know what case that is
but like it's like my way they wouldn't
they wouldn't let him open the side
panel they wouldn't let him run any
software to like see what's like you
know the specs on it like GPZ or
something like that right so again not a
whole lot to say about it but they are
there they do exist and the latest news
that we have for the 300 series 390 390x
from AMD is that we're expecting to
probably see them at Computex yes cool
and and so end its the GPU report
eventually we'll have sound effects that
play at this point in from now we just
have me maybe like some epics you know
animation graphics cards that come in
and episode face or something like that
very exciting cards like alright so
that's the end of my first segments at
this point we'll take a quick break to
recognize our sponsor us yeah Kyle and I
both sponsor this show it's powered by
us you should buy us products to support
us yes I just made that up right now but
I agree with Paul who knows maybe maybe
one day we'll have sponsors and be fun
if we do have sponsors we'll make sure
that they're good sponsors and that
they're entertaining at least they let
us do stuff that's kind of entertaining
yeah right let's move into my next
segment which I kind of want to tear
through like as quickly as possible okay
it's not as one of those less happy
segments all right this segment is
called Internet watchdogs because it's
somewhat happy alright let's talk about
some news some good news Internet one
big bit of good news which is that
that we have title to classification now
for Internet service providers not just
internet service providers but also
wireless providers which was a something
that a lot of people didn't really see
coming
but yeah well you know I should do is I
should retweet you retweet it so that
news came out in the past couple weeks
there was a lot of people who were very
happy about it myself included because
none of us wants to see the Internet
dominated by large companies who can say
who gets a good traffic and who gets bad
traffic or who gets good internet speeds
and who gets bad internet speeds and
that that was good news however that the
the war is not over and there's still
stuff to be on lookout for so it seems
like we have won a victory at this point
um but I wanted to quickly go over this
article from the technology the MIT
Technology Review discussing five
loopholes that could undermine net
neutrality because the FCC has
classified these services as title two
but there are still question marks and
there's also still a big concern people
out how they might actually go about
enforcing these things so this is a long
text-based article so there you go
there's not a whole lot for you guys to
look at this being a video thing so I'm
gonna sort of leave it right there and
switch back over to s and I will sort of
give you a rough breakdown of what these
five loopholes are that the folks over a
technology review are talking about the
first one relates actually to throttling
now throttling obviously is a big
concern and that's the reason why
internet is now a title to is to say all
data is equal and you can't say this
data is good in that day that's bad you
get good data service and you can't the
question is will this these anti
throttling policies apply to specific
applications such a specific application
would be something like Netflix or Hulu
or YouTube or are they can apply broadly
to whole categories the opinion of the
writer here is that they should apply it
broadly to all categories however that
is language that in the current
definition is not clearly defined sorry
that's something that could go either
way and
again possibly be used as a loophole so
that's something to look out for and
assume a lot of these are just
suggestions for how they might clarify
things a little bit better so that the
companies that might seek to benefit
from potential loopholes can't actually
do that the next thing on the list is
the zero rating now zero rating is
something along the lines of let's say
verizon owns a media streaming service
like an audio and you know a music
service or something like that which I'm
sure they do but I don't know what the
title of it is they own that and then
they also own your internet connection
but they say you have a cap of to learn
that the gigabytes per month or
something like that however if you sign
up for arched our music streaming
service and you streaming our music from
our service it doesn't count nicely
against your cap and the companies could
potentially use that in order to provide
in order to make their services seem
more appealing than otherwise why would
you then sign up for another music
streaming service if you're concerned
about your cap and you can get free
quote unquote
data or at least bandwidth otherwise
okay zero reading terms are not set in
stone they need to be clarified and
again there's some potential there for
companies to take advantage of it yeah
the next one is network management
because what is P's do or not not just
the last mile ISPs but also the Internet
backbone companies is they they control
network they control the data that close
over the network and they do this in
order to as in order to provide you a
good service depending on what time of
day it is and where that all the
traffic's going you know if Ellen is at
the Oscars and she tweets a picture of
you know a bunch of celebrities and
suddenly it goes viral then you might
have a certain part of the internet that
is suddenly getting hit much harder than
others as a result these companies
actually do need to manage the internet
traffic to some degree they need to say
okay at this point we need a wider pipe
for this data here and you know we can
slow down this data here the question
that still remains is can these
companies use this excuse of managing
network traffic to actually continue
throttling that is
something that's possible is something
that's not set in stone and again that's
something that could potentially be
abused there's another thing called
interconnection so an interconnection is
basically the handing off the you know
the data the the pixels that the camera
is grabbing right here and encoding by
the computer and set over to twitch and
then sent back to you it goes through
many different pipes along the internet
and it goes through many different nodes
along the internet and all that traffic
is routed different ways so there's
interconnection there and there's
handoff between you know a company that
owned the survey and a company the own
server B for example these
interconnection rules are again
something they need clarification and
then of course on top of all this stuff
there is the fact that you have actual
need for traffic monitoring and
enforcement and this is something that
the FCC also has that really established
how they're going to monitor how they're
going to enforce these rules now this is
a fairly dry topic so I'm gonna kind of
leave it at that but this is these are
just some of these issues that I wanted
to bring up again the link is going to
be in the reupload on this video so you
guys can check it out and kind of look
over this I just wanted to say that we
should not necessarily let our guard
down we need to kind of keep keep this
at the forefront of our minds if the
Internet is something that you want to
keep safe and you want to keep open and
you want to keep the ability for anyone
to jump on and start using and not have
to deal with a big company kind of kind
of holding their foot against the door
then keep keeping people in ok one other
one other story in this internet
watchdog segment they'll move on to
something more fun I promise sword fight
is next ok stay tuned all right so this
is an article from ARS technica and this
one is about the Internet Freedom Act
and this this is hilarious so um I first
picked up on this one because I watched
the tech on tech syndicate last week and
Logan and Wendell were we're kind of
ranting about this for a while Logan did
it greats Tennessee accents for talking
about US representative Marshall
Blackburn's name basically there's like
we don't talk a lot about politics but
there's a lot of Republicans behind this
bill that's just what the story says the
Internet Freedom Act is basically the
opposite of
the Internet freedom it's more like the
Internet's non Freedom Act it's
basically taking all of the new net net
neutrality rules that occur by by title
to classification and taking away all of
the FCC's ability to enforce it like in
in a nutshell so goes back to the
article that talked about just a few
moments ago which was Howard's the FCC
going to enforce things this like right
from the get-go would would just take
away all of their their actual power to
do anything so it's it's bad I'm gonna
sit understand that's bad yeah if you
hear anyone talking about the internet
Freedom Act I'll tell them it's bad call
your representative and tell them if you
hear them that they're voting for it or
they're backing the Internet Freedom Act
that they're stupid the other thing that
this article lists very clearly is all
of the money that Blackburn herself has
received from att's PAC or political
action committee $20,000 from Comcast's
$20,000 from a cable industry
association PAC $15,000 from Verizon so
this is all just into her personal
pocket or link to the campaign it's to
her campaign but how do you how do you
how do you pay your bill campaign money
yeah yeah that's how you get reelected
and that's how you keep making more
campaign money right
so yeah Internet Freedom Act is bad it's
not really Internet freedom the opposite
of Internet freedom and that's we should
all we should all hate it okay right
moving scary moving it along okay yeah
all right I have I have more fun things
to talk about for the rest of the show I
promise next segment to swordfight
yeah yeah the ongoing segments and what
I like to say at the beginning of every
sword fight is that people keep asking
me for more sword fights that has
happened a couple times I swear but
really but what about really but what
about people who watch the stream have
they been asking food I see I see what
you did there
oh it's warm in here Kyle it's very
warming I am like sweating and it's
making me sleepy I'm like about to pass
that what do you think we should do
should we open the window I think I
think you should turn on the
air-conditioner okay and will will will
gauge people's response I have a feeling
we're gonna turn be turning it off with
that we might 10-second all right we'll
see we're gonna try the a/c because
frickin warm in here we have like five
computers on and my glasses are gonna
just keep sliding off of my face and if
it's alright there's the AC of glory I
can already tell it's movement today hi
guys
AC has just been turned on so please
please let us know if it's unbearable
it's bearable for you guys because it's
unbearable for us it's writing about us
it's just yes it's nice it's nice yeah
nice ambient noise that's right it'll
put you to sleep not too bad alright now
I'm really gonna fall asleep yeah it's
supposed to be 90 this weekend in
Southern California you know you know
spring sticky that's 90 that's 90
degrees Fahrenheit okay let's move on
what did I just say I just said we're
gonna do do some sword-fighting sword
fighting next sorry I got to get this
drought polling crazy so for those of
you newcomers just joining a sword fight
is basically possible in a Paul segment
square he picks a topic and then him and
I go at it with our swords our swords of
wisdom where we debate on either pro or
con we take one side of the argument and
we we basically just just try to try to
slam each other
that's the idea yes it's an argument
it's a pro and con and we don't
necessarily always agree with the side
that we're taking but we at least yes
try to play devil's advocate as much as
best we can makes an interest right so I
just linked a straw poll so you guys
might already be reading what we're
about to talk about but here's a here's
an article from also from the MIT
Technology Review good website by the
way we about how Nvidia plans to be the
Netflix of gaming hmm now Anthony has a
lot of a lot of things going on not just
graphics cards and NVIDIA actually seems
to have a plan moving forward
for how they can get around being a
graphics card manufacturer because if
you look five 10 20 years down the line
as things keep getting smaller the
potential to have the need for discreet
graphics card may or may not not go away
who knows but there's a lot of people
say that say yes as the integrated
graphics on a chip continue to get more
impressive or you know be able to do
what you what you ask of it then when a
discrete graphics art might not do
evening so grid seems to be in videos
response to that and it seems to be
invidious goal of kind of future
proofing themselves against this
potential drop-off in the market of
their kind of bread-and-butter product
that they create so right grid is a
streaming service and the simplification
and article is think of grid as Netflix
for gaming so Netflix is one of those
startups which probably couldn't have
happened without net neutrality entitled
to but um net Netflix is you guys all
know what Netflix is I don't need to
explain it a lot of you probably use it
I use Netflix I think it's fantastic yep
it's a it's a monthly fee you get access
to a large library of movies the
streaming service is generally good
unless you use a internet service
provider who's stupid but again then a
showers just hopefully solve that but
back to the question at hand which is do
you think that you will use a game
streaming service like grid do you think
you will do you see it as an
inevitability or do you see it as
something that will be another option
for gaming in the future and then if it
is going to be going that patent on that
path then how long do you think it will
be until that actually happens and we
have a crossover to where I don't need a
gaming PC anymore all I need is a client
all I need is a thin client on my
desktop and a faster internet connection
I can play all the games I want so we
have four options for you guys here
never yes as soon as possible five years
of 10 years so go ahead and link us or
wait wrong buttons oops
God and let us know what you think and
we'll come back to these results in just
a few moments so which side of this
debate do you want to take so so let me
just be just for clarification purposes
are is the side that we're taking are we
debating on whether or not
this this is something that we would
partake in or whether or not this is
just the natural trend that things are
going and and that we can expect to see
this in the future is it more of a
preference thing I think I think we're
going to see it that's already been
established okay the question for you is
as you clean yes I want it I want grid
service right or are you more of like no
I don't want and we're not just talking
about grid I'm talking about video game
streaming services in general okay the
heavy lifting for the GPU and the pixel
crunching is done by another server
somewhere else right and they stream you
that video there are pros and cons to
that latency is the biggest issue and
150 milliseconds right now is what
NVIDIA has paired this down to 150
milliseconds between you pressing a
button on a controller right tied into
grid yeah and it's having an effect on
the pixels on the screen yeah that's I
feel like I feel like that's too much
lag to my all right so you go anti grid
I'll go anti great right I don't think
am I gonna go first yes okay I I think
that we are not at the point yet with
streaming capabilities to facilitate an
HD high quality gaming experience I feel
like if we try to go into it now and I
think the early adopters will be
disappointed in some respects seeing is
how like we have such glamorous visuals
right now on our desktop PCs when when
playing games locally and on the show
sure but I think doing something like a
stream right now carrying all that
information all that data especially
with a millisecond lag I think you know
some casual gamers might not notice it
so much but I think those of us that
play regularly especially on PC and
stuff like that will definitely I feel
like it takes a backseat as far as the
gaming experience if you're used to a
desktop experience and used to that
responsiveness then right now it's gonna
be too much I can see console gamers
enjoying it a bit more than PC gamers
and I don't know how how good the
graphics would be either like how you
know what kind of bitrate are we looking
at
I mean I just tried messing around with
the doko the the NZXT doko not too long
oh yeah and you know it's a PC streaming
device it's not a mini PC but actually
it's just a device that carries a signal
from your PC and outputs it to your TV
and I think that was 60 milliseconds of
lag and I still noticed it like you know
I would jump I hit my jetpack and evolve
in like a split second later it would go
and it just threw me out of the game so
for looking at what is a 140 hundred 60
milliseconds of lag I mean it's not
faring well for me right now I'm not
convinced okay so anyway and you bring a
the the the example you use is one
that's very commonly used for this type
of when people discuss this type of
service is the FPS experience is one
that people go to immediately fps or
twitch gaming anything that requires
fast response time is going to
definitely suffer and if you're talking
about competitive gameplay anything that
that reduces your ability for that yes I
would agree with you I'm arguing your
side here let's go back and argue my
side which is you're totally wrong
stupid because grid is going to take the
world by storm
now you okay here's here's the here's
what makes me think grid as a high
potential for success well and it's not
necessarily because of the limitations
with technology that we have right now
it's more so because of the success
actually of some of the services that
have come before it that have taken an
established medium such as will say film
that Netflix has done and used the
availability of technology in the
Internet to deliver it to consumers in a
different way and it's in a different
way that for people was enough that it
really like that's why there's no more
blockbuster videos anymore that's why
you know the rental market has gone down
the crapper that's you know there's
there's lots of effects that it's had
but I could see a service like great
having a similar impact on this market
but I think the
the area of the market that it's gonna
take the longest to affect is going to
be people like you and me and other
people who build their own systems do a
lot of gaming and especially if you do
competitive online gaming that's fast in
reaction base that's what's going to
take the longest to get to but grid
doesn't care about that
grids going to be successful for so long
before that and they're going to be
successful by people who are playing
puzzle games by people are playing turn
turn-based games by people who are
playing simpler games things that don't
matter
basically by people who are playing
simpler games that might be graphically
intensive but aren't necessarily that
don't necessarily well if not even this
very competitive but but don't require
that fast reaction time I think there's
a huge market for those types of games
and I think that's where this is going
to make inroads and then if you have
that tied in with something like the
shield console a 200-dollar console with
4k support that already raised ranks has
no I want to say run circles but as a
potential to run circles around existing
next-gen consoles I think that's where
you I see a lot of potential adoption
and where I see this being a success and
I will say for NVIDIA if they get this
off the ground and they get a sort of a
base of subscribers that's Nvidia set
for a while a a service with the
subscribership like an a monthly fee is
that's like that's the holy grail for so
many companies you have to have to have
something like that so let's see what
you guys thought about this one them and
I I think I was right results need to
like show you guys the screen so you can
see haha so shady internet so you wrote
shady Internet service I try to put some
hips and character into the questions
and answer those maybe Nvidia
swindlers some shady internet search I
don't know well they goes along with the
idea that any cloud-based service is
like you don't trust it it's invisible
you're in the cloud in the internet and
you don't have it yeah all right so most
of you 54% said never and
I'm I'm not necessarily gonna disagree
with you there you know and I will say
the experience at least right now yeah
on a desktop or something like that
compared to streaming services night and
day
loading off loading the game up for your
on SSD playing lag free and then apart
from that we had the the the majority of
you who disagree but never were saying
about five years or so till it's
actually gonna mature and I think I was
about to I think that's reasonable
hopefully we'll see Internet bandwidth
open up the internet to actual
connection and ping times maybe even
come down with new technology and all
that sort of thing all right cool good
good search fight all right we have one
we have certified ground to this one I'm
actually going to totally rip off a
Linus tech tips video oh I totally got
permission from getting flagged all
right so uh if you guys caught this
video this is uh this is for clever I
haven't even seen this well you ever
seen this one alright so live Luke Luke
went to PAX East and he went to the club
booth and this is actually the part of
the video I wanted to show you guys so
micron has crucial microns a memory
manufacturer they make crucial samsung
makes him I mean all these memories
manufactures memory manufacture for lots
of people like Kingston for example
Kingston doesn't manufacture their own
modules yeah that they buy the modules
and and that sort of thing so right SK
Hynix is one of the big ones they've
been around for for quite a while but
you don't hear about them as much
because they don't have quite as much of
a retail space or retail presence SK
Hynix is now introduced Club which is an
interesting name but they have these new
modules and and and Luke was taking a
look at them some pretty cool designs
actually interesting I mean I'm not a
huge fan of the like the really tall
where every or anything like that but
when they're actually installed like
this kit that looks pretty cool right I
kind of like the the those elements on
the other yes I have a few data they
have an entry-level SKU they have a mid
tier one and then a higher tier one that
has LEDs for ddr3 and then they have I
think they have two ddr4 and maybe just
one ddr4 line as well but some
pretty cool looking and then a different
kind of design than some of the things
we've seen now all this being said the
question that it definitely comes to
mind at this point and I actually got to
get the straw poll here to link for you
guys so you can also let me know what
you think as we is a very important
question answer this question which is
do you guys think Luke likes me
that's the that's the straw poll quest
straw poll that's the straw poll cuz you
know I've hung out with Luke before he's
a cool guy and I think I think maybe
like I don't know like when we were we
were in Colorado right we were hanging
out and one point he just he looked over
at me and is like just kind of nodded
you know and I was like I think Luke's
down you know I think Luke that might
have been the altitude sickness just
like this is like nodding you like I'm
gonna throw up
was that the altitude it might have been
I mean he Luke's Luke's been giving me
some mixed signals here and there - okay
I've noticed I think Luke likes me
alright well said the I just one time so
let's do this if we're gonna we gotta do
the surf right this is a certified
signal so you can argue that Luke likes
you and I will argue that Luke likes me
that your argument won't go along with
the questions
wait sir sir are you saying that we're
having we're about to have a sword fight
with Luke in the middle that's yeah that
was the plan okay Luke just bright in
between ours okay so it's okay alright
just one time I think we were at CES
this is maybe two years ago and Luke
looked at me across across the room and
I just remember him like holding like
like a GPU but he was like stroking the
video card yeah and he was like saying
something like I I could really use some
big hardware right now and I was like
but he already has a video card in his
hands but he just kept looking at me
like like like a hundred yards like
losing a hundred yards that's the nut he
was an idiot was Linus that sounds more
like Linus actually it wasn't you know
you might be confused but so it's all
yeah I see I I will say that I think
Luke is like he like
me but he doesn't like me like me
because we were in a WebEx for an video
graphics card launched last year that's
like a little video chat right your
honor
yeah yeah we were it was a video chat
but we were like listening to like VTR
was giving a rundown I don't know the
780ti or something like that one was
coming out and and he was in Chad and I
was in chat and I was like hey Luke
what's up it was like hey how's it going
and I just I thought we had a moment
there let's see what you guys think was
the moment I think people just like the
way that one's phrased I I had I had a
brainwave with that so Luke he is truly
an enigma and we'll never truly know
what goes on behind his steely gaze and
windswept golden locks it's now his
mysteriousness that always attracted me
to him okay thank you guys for
responding to the poll and dealing with
my silly and in my defense I actually
had two options for the second straw
poll there was the second the second
swordfight
yeah one of them was a little bit more
serious but I don't know I think we
chose the right okay well done that is
the end of section 3 right one more to
go third segment all right we have one
more quarter left in my show and we're
gonna move on to some news now I'll be
talking about some news and should I
have like five wait how many is that
know that maybe that's like four I think
it's more things to talk about in news
and they're the kind of smaller stories
okay I kind of run through them fairly
quickly sure um I hope maybe possibly
the first ones from WD great buttons yes
okay persons from WD a very exciting if
you're like a surfer guy or you do data
centers
WD has introduced the world's most power
efficient high-capacity data center HDD
how power efficient is it ball and don't
know more power efficient
there's no are there any actual numbers
here we have a double right so
is the re plus which is there there it's
the raid addition plus that's what Ari
stands for it's six terabytes and it
consumes six watts no that's one watch
per terabyte that's pretty good that's
really good how much does a regular hard
drive it's like fifteen um I forget what
I feel like most mechanical drives are
gonna be in the five watt range okay
time to ten watt range but this is
probably more looking at like watts per
terabyte or something like that of
course it's got all the rain Edition
protections and stuffs that you might
expect five and six terabyte capacities
say to six gigabit per second 57 60 rpms
that's interesting 1.2 million MTBF and
120 ma 128 megabytes cash I wonder I
wonder if the slower p.m. has anything
to do with the low wattage yeah oh yeah
definitely yeah yeah I mean they're
going they're going for powered power
usage over performance here for sure and
the only thing that the only thing I
don't like about this is they have a
yellow on the label and I'm not against
yellow but WD uses like color coding for
all my drives and I feel like people are
gonna start calling this the WD yellow
that doesn't that doesn't doesn't my
with me is what pop rate the rate
additions have always had black labels
and they have been like you know like
the WD black series which is like the
highest end of the consumer drives and I
don't know yellow it doesn't seem bold
and you know it's not like not
attractive to it no like yeah freaking
check this out it's yellow I've never
said that to anyone like tons of times
I've been like look at look at it's
black or like look yeah it's blue I've
never been like check out this yellow
thing like a like a yellow sports car
you're like in plaintiff Vice City okay
last week I talked about freak and week
in my in my oh joy segments what does
freak stand for again uh
I don't know it is an acronym though
it's a secure SSL and TLS security hole
and it has an acronym which I it's not
written down in circle I read it off
last time but I didn't memorize it
anyway um we're talking about freak last
week and I didn't give you guys any
solutions for it other than don't order
anything online this article on ZDNet is
actually providing some potential ways
around it or ways to avoid this now the
main operating systems Oh they've also
discovered that it affects more devices
than originally thought so
you know that's usually the way this
goes right okay so it's not only
programs that use Apple's SSL
implementation or open SSL its present
in Microsoft secure channel stack -
that's not good
all right so any program that used
Microsoft's SSL TLS such as Internet
Explorer
another reason to like did you need
another reason to remove that excel or
Windows Vista 7 8 and 8.1 as well as
Server 2003 they're not mentioning
Windows XP because it's end-of-life but
if you're on your XP if you're an expert
in your vulnerable to a bunch of stuff
you get rid of XP and update Windows
Server 2008 in 2012
should be ok if they're configured as
servers but if they're configured as
desktops they might not be and then in
addition there's a there's libraries
that are listed here again this article
will be linked it so links in the
description so you guys can check that
out if you have an older version of
Chrome you're also my before chrome
version 41 in chrome auto updates so
most of you guys are probably ok unless
you've turned off the auto update
function but update your chrome if
you're on Internet explorer you need to
wait for a patch switch to firefox or
chrome 41 disable RSA keys Safari is
vulnerable don't use Safari Android
Browser is vulnerable switch to Chrome
41 if your Android Blackberry browser is
vulnerable don't use blackberry
opera on Mac and Android is vulnerable
so update to opera 28 or switch to
Chrome 41 or don't know a Mac or don't
use a Mac they also
I mean there's a lot of details in this
guy's so if you if you're concerned
about this I definitely recommend
checking this article out there's also
so Microsoft has publicly stated right
now that they're working on a fix for
this if you are a security concerned
person Steve I'm looking at you the
article has actually listed you can go
in the end of the group policy object
editor and you can update this new
cipher list and that will basically tell
it not to use the bad ciphers and then
that's a way you can sort of manually go
in and patch something if you're looking
for a sort of an interim solution so um
I don't know how many of you guys are
freaked out by the Freak thing last week
I didn't mean to do that
it just happens but there are at least
some some workarounds right now and
hopefully not no one has has been too
hard hit by this one all right pretty
freaky here's a quick story from Maximum
PC this is Windows 10 build that 1031 no
build one zero zero three one this is
all the way from Russia and this is just
a transparent Start menu now I'm just
gonna go ahead and say that I called
this when Windows 8 launched and
everyone was complaining about the Metro
UI and my thought at the time was like
you know if they took Metro like the
whole Start menu and they just had an
option to either make it fullscreen or
make it appear in a window and make it
see-through - that'd be cool but this is
something that a lot of people were
interested in after the tech preview
came out in October and it's now been
seen out in the wild here's a screenshot
of it or it didn't happen and also there
is no trace of project Spartan an
upcoming browser confirmed as Internet
Explorer's replacement in this build so
that's kind of interesting - I there
keeping that one under wraps for now
weird and early Windows 10 builds I
still haven't I still have an installed
Windows 10 I should do that at some
point I think I want to do Linux first
though really I've only know a little
bit of like dabbling with Linux for
Linux in the past and I've been thinking
about like dropping Windows 10 onto
something but I'm like you know what I
want to drop Linux on this on
things start playing around with that
because I haven't played with any any
recent distros it's been like a couple
years since I actually Dobin and did
much with Linux and even then it wasn't
it was really really lightweight I will
check out the tech syndicate Linux
channel there you go
or I'll talk to booth and I'll and I'll
look up Windows 10 because that sounds
way easier okay and can we use Windows
10 alright one last news story before we
jump over to kal segment do any of you
guys use the torrents you do do you use
uTorrent yes I do actually you
downloaded a recent version of it no
mine's really old okay good don't
okay well recent version I never took it
for any recent versions of utorrent have
silently been been installing a bundled
Bitcoin mining tool whoo but that sounds
fun I want one except it doesn't mind
the bitcoins for you oh not fun it uses
your computer's idle time to mine
bitcoins in the background for other
people Wow
yeah so will you see like a little bit
of your CPU usage but I said that people
said that yes in a bit it impacts their
CPU but I mean the main point here is
that it doesn't prompt you and it was
done without you know yeah it's totally
 it's not one of those right along
like oh I better uncheck that box er I'm
gonna get McAfee installed again or
something like that it it's it's just
installs without telling you so I'm if
you use uTorrent definitely check this
out the software is called epic scale
it's a Bitcoin miner which uses your
unused processing power to change the
world for a few people who wrote the
program and wants to buy gold-plated
iPhone I I I want that No damn it I was
trying to get through this whole side of
the episode without mentioning that
anyway so you watch out for that I guess
either use an older version or you can
go and uninstall it oh yeah so
BitTorrent said that you're free to
delete the folder with the software in
it and you certainly won't see any
persistent auto reinstalls it'll be gone
from your machine for good the problem
with the statement is it users report
that it's not true it does not uninstall
completely using a dream
or by deleting the application folder
well so that sucks then I don't know how
you actually maybe you need to use one
of those application uninstaller yeah
things which I never trusted cuz I
always wonder like how will I
uninstalled that application and it's
darling because I bet it knows some
tricks for how to keep me from
uninstalling it I would assume so as my
concern anyway though that's all for a
side a or the first half of awesome
hardware for dude a thanks so much for
watching this if you're watching the
re-upload on my youtube channel you can
click the link at the end of here to
head over and watch Kyle side or side B
of Awesome hardware and if you're live
then just stick with us for just a
moment and we shall be starting up once
again it's gonna be like the same show
we're gonna talk about all the same
stuff no we talked about different stuff
on Kyle's part but it's usually not
connect quite as good as mine
that's a lot anyway thanks for having
this thank you for watching awesome
hardware side side a see ya they tuned
slippers I'd be coming at you in just a
moment don't forget to hit the like
button and subscribe and you don't buy
