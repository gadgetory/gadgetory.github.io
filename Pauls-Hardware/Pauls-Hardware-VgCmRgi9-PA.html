welcome to Paul's hardware today's video
is going to be quite a bit different I
think than my normal videos I have a
project that is different than my normal
computer building projects and I really
want your feedback on it I need
suggestions and ideas but before I get
into any of that today or at least the
day this video is going up is July 12th
and it is the net neutrality day of
action so I really quickly wanted to
mention that that's going on if you use
the internet at all you've probably seen
some of the action because there's tons
of popular companies on the internet to
do lots of business on the Internet
including like Google and Amazon Netflix
who are all participating in this the
idea is to get more awareness out for
the current FCC notice of proposed
rulemaking which might change the way
the Internet service providers are
classified when it comes to the FCC and
how they're regulated basically that
means that your internet service
provider whether that be Comcast or Time
Warner or Verizon or any of the other
big ISPs out there or the small ones to
have to treat the data as the same
whether it's coming from point A or
point B or point C on the internet they
can't throttle or change anything like
that
now most people I talk to online and in
real life are okay with net neutrality I
think it's a good thing they think the
rule should stay as there is and it
shouldn't be any change so they're
against the current notice the proposed
rulemaking by the FCC so if you want to
let your voice be heard there's links in
the comments where you can read up a
little bit more on the subject as well
as a direct link to the FCC where you
can post the comment and let your voice
be known so please feel free to do that
and your support is greatly appreciated
let's get back to the real subject of
this video though and I got to start off
by presenting you with the problem that
I am attempting to overcome as any good
narrator should narrative should begin
with the problem is kind of well it's
not with this this is my garage and this
is everything that's in my garage from
the not so pretty looking area over here
to the slightly more pretty looking to
the not like you know incredibly well
organized but at least fairly well put
together so I can shoot videos and
everything
now last week or like week and a half
ago I posted a video where I did a bunch
of cleaning and stuff out here
I've managed to keep it mostly clean
here is the arctic Panther station where
Arctic man Thur is waiting for the
upgrades that are slowly starting to
trickle in I'll be working on that again
very soon but okay I'm getting
distracted already so over here is where
I can sit I have a few systems set up I
can do work I can set up test beds all
that good stuff pretty functional over
here is my table which I built in a
previous garage work log I actually have
sort of a love-hate relationship with my
garage work logs but I'll say it's
mostly love they don't get like a huge
amount of views as my videos go there
they're not like the greatest performers
but there's a ton of people who seem to
really like them so I have a niche
audience who's like all about the garage
work logs and I kind of want to do a
little bit more in there so the reason I
bring it up is because this table here
was built in a former garage work log as
well as my sort of framework that I have
up here which needs to be kill manage
and everything and I want to do them a
little bit more but my dilemma is that
when it comes to building stuff like
especially working with wood my garage
is actually not the best environment for
that so moving on to my for my video
production side this is like storage and
that is my workbench and this is where I
did a bunch of additional storage on the
wall in a former garage work log which
all turned out quite well and is working
quite well but I'd like to expand that
so further on over there you have kind
of like random storage overflow stuff
that's where things pile up and it can
get pretty bad if you look directly at
my storage or my workbench area over
here you'll probably notice it's sort of
an outsize ratio of like PC parts to
actual tools and stuff like that and
that that's not really going to change I
have no expectation that there's going
to be fewer PC parts at all but it does
sort of cut off my excess at times to
some of the hardware that I have managed
to accumulate at least tool hardwork as
I am a man and I tend to look at places
like quick deals and then they have
deals on stuff so the most recent thing
that I got was a compound miter saw
which actually got a couple months ago
and that's what actually kicked off this
whole idea of like hey I need to I need
a conference a little bit better
solution for this if I'm actually going
to use any of these power to
that I have but just to show you kind of
what I what I have to start off with
I've got a circular saw up there this is
a router this is an orbital sander and
then that is a jig saw I have my set of
makita drills right here actually really
like those those do gauge as Ismail
Black &amp;amp; Decker drill which isn't really
in service anymore this is a mess up
here I've got my Makita sawzall which I
cleverly hid from Luke and - so that
they couldn't use it during scrapyard
wars over here course is the laundry
area you know not not much to be done
there I can't really do much about that
then over here is like more generic
garage storage you know like large bulk
items from Costco or on that shelf and I
have have gardening equipment over in
this corner sort of but as I learned in
a previous garage look oh oh and then of
course this is where the dog storage
goes down here there's Hiro making sure
making sure that his bed doesn't float
away now in a previous garage work vlog
actually quite a while ago I learned
actually building this table that doing
would work with like circular saws and
stuff in the garage is a bad idea at
that point I had a test fit from new egg
that was over here in the corner and it
started kicking out a bunch of sawdust
and everything it was a bad it was a bad
thing so I have an idea for solving that
problem and it involved setting up
something outside and now here we are in
my backyard where I actually wants to
work on this project now I don't know if
you guys watched my my shittiest video
ever but um my backyard I also have I
guess the love-hate relationship with
because most of the time there's just
nothing growing out here and actually my
wife and I had just spent a ton of time
weeding everything out here there were
horrible weeds we're in Southern
California in a desert area and that's
really really bad weeds that grow out
here so we like we got rid of all those
and it's actually way way better than it
was before although it is pretty much
just dirt and and whatnot but I'd like
to start building a garden actually over
here potentially even something like a
greenhouse but that's further down the
line for now this is the back door to my
garage and this is the area where I
built the gate on the side of the house
over here did a video on that too if you
guys are interested
I don't think I actually classified that
as a garage work log because I wasn't
working in my garage but look here comes
nori but here's the last piece of
hardware that I already mentioned that I
got which is my REO be 10-inch sliding
compound miter saw which stole my box
because I have nowhere to put it
at least nowhere in the garage now out
here I have random tools equipments it's
just sitting on the side of house this
is bad it's not a good way to be storing
stuff but you'll notice I have some
pavement here and a bit of space so
here's my idea and here's where I need
your feedback I would like to create an
outdoor workbench along this wall
potentially partially along that wall
too but that's the basic idea something
that has the miter saw on top of it so I
can actually do wood cutting out here it
needs to be protected so I'm going to
need to do something with the roof up
here I might need to extend this somehow
create some sort of overhang I could do
it ghetto style and just get like an
easy up or something and put it up here
as well so that's an option but I also
need to be somewhat concerned with the
window over here because that gets light
you know in the afternoon and during the
day and I don't want to completely cover
that and block it from above so I might
be doing something sort of hybrid with a
covering coming out here but then also
something that has like a skylight or
something so that light can still get in
there maybe a trellis up on top or
something like that and I for the most
part have no idea what I'm doing I mean
I have some basic knowledge when it
comes to woodworking and that kind of
thing but functionally I you know I
really kind of just figuring stuff out
as I go
which I'm cool with I like the at-home
DIY stuff and figuring all that out but
if you guys have any experience in this
area and what to give me feedback or
ideas or suggestions I'm going to be
checking back in a comment section today
and then I'll come back in another day
or two as well and look through that and
see if you guys have any suggestions or
recommendations for what I want to do
out here in the very short term of
course I need to clear this wood pile up
there's nothing very exciting going on
right there and then I think I will
start to do at least a smallish maybe
mobile maybe something on wheels that
can roll but just a little workbench or
something that has a flip
that I can put over the top to protect
it from the weather at least gets this
miter saw up your running think of all
the things that I could mitre with my
miter saw alright I just spent like
three minutes outside and I am drenched
with sweat but it's summer here in case
you guys weren't aware that it's getting
pretty warm these days but guys that's
going to pretty much wrap it up for this
video just to summarise I am looking for
your feedback in the comments section
down below one what do you think of me
expanding pulsar where to not just talk
about PC hardware but occasionally not
all the time but maybe once a month once
every couple months doing a video that's
more dedicated to hardware that you used
to build stuff home improvement type
things I would try my best to include
technology in that where possible as
well there's some home automation things
that I think I could get into too would
be if you're not into that stuff would
you hate it if I still did that every so
often or do you think I should just
stick completely to the computer stuff
since that's kind of what my channel is
built on and then third what do you
think I should do outside here as far as
solutions for creating some sort of
covering creating an outdoor workbench
area that will be protected from the
weather to some extent protecting the
tools that might be stored out there all
those things are questions that I don't
quite have the answers to as of yet but
once I do start working on that I will
as long as you guys want to see it
include some coverage of that as well
thank you guys so much for watching this
video I'll be back later this week with
continued coverage on my other ongoing
projects arctic panther as well as the
htpc that i'm building out there waiting
on a few parts to read for those things
but I'll have more stuff on those soon
thank you guys again for watching
it's thumbs up button on your way out
and we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
