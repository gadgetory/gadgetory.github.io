what's up guys welcome back to Pauls
hardware today I'm continuing my monthly
build series this is my third
installation of the April build of the
month which is $1,000 right and 5/8
system with an r5 1600 and a gtx 1070 in
there I built this just a couple weeks
ago so check out that video if you want
to see a little bit more about the build
process itself a little some of my notes
on the assembling and using the case and
that kind of thing so today's videos
going to be the testing and benchmarking
of this thousand dollar system and
actually when I built it a couple weeks
ago I actually made it a little bit more
expensive than $1,000 I did the thousand
and fifty dollar version which included
the 1600 X CPU which required an
aftermarket cooler in the cooler master
master air 4 pro that I put in there now
what I did was I decided I wanted this
to be a sub $1,000 build and thankfully
to check out the links to the pc
particulates that I have in the
description you'll notice that some
prices have fluctuated in fact the gtx
1070 price you can get for 335 to 340
bucks so this system right now at least
not with this exact GPU but the EVGA
version of it you can get for less than
$1000 you also get the Wraith cooler the
race spire cooler that's in there which
means you don't need to pay extra for an
aftermarket cooler and even though this
cooler isn't like top-of-the-line or
anything like that getting the job done
it's not terribly loud and I was able to
overclock with it - apart from a CPU
cooler though this build features the
asus prime v 350 plus motherboard
full-size ATX motherboard with the be
350 chipset the graphics card is a gtx
1070 and I basically advise you to
choose whatever most inexpensive gtx
1070 you can find this one happens to be
MSI's gaming X version of the gtx 1070
remember I have two sticks of corsair
ddr4 3000 speed memory eight gigs each
giving me 16 gigs total I am running it
at 29:33 with very very slightly
loosened up timings the case of course
is the NZXT s340 in the black and red
trim the
power supply is the coolermaster v6 50
and finally for an SSD I've actually
slept in a Seagate 600 series SSD that's
a 480 gig model right there
now for setup here I first went and
updated the motherboards UEFI or BIOS
because that's very important new ones
are coming out they introduce greater
RAM stability as well as potentially
greater stability and compatibility with
different hardware you might plug into a
be 350 chipset motherboard version I'm
using a zero six zero nine and then of
course I went an overclocked everything
CPU and memory was overclocked using my
rising five overclocking methodology
that I just did a video on a couple days
ago you can check that out via a link up
in the corner then I overclocked the
graphics card with the MSI Afterburner
utility of course I also went and
updated all the Windows 10 drivers I got
the latest drivers from Nvidia which is
three eight one eight nine and then I'm
using monitoring utilities cpu-z gpu-z
hardware monitor and of course MSI
Afterburner so from there I went in to
start doing some tests but what I didn't
realize was that my overclock wasn't
stable I thought it was stable and then
I was running 3d mark and I bits
basically crashing out of the program
when it was running through some tests
now basically went back and did a bunch
more tweaking of the CPU frequency I had
it at 3.9 at first I dialed it back to
3.875 and then three point eight five
and then three point eight to five it is
nice with the horizon you can down you
you don't have to overclock in hundred
megahertz increments you can do 25
megahertz increments which lets you get
a little bit more granular with that but
eventually I decided to just test things
one at a time and I realized it was
actually the GPU overclock that was
causing the failures but ultimately I
ended up with a CPU overclock of three
point eight five gigahertz which is not
too bad at all I did that with a voltage
positive offset of about plus point one
or maybe plus point one a 106 or
something like that that ended up giving
me voltage that was hitting about one
point three five to one point three
seven volts and then when I was running
a stress test it was maxing at one point
four which is well within the range that
you should expect when you're
overclocking Rison you just don't want
to get past one point four to five of
course now CPU temperatures were a
little high and actually running at
higher voltage if I was going over one
point four
the CPU is getting it well up above 80
85 degree
and you don't want to get too far above
that because if it's 95 degrees it's
going to start to throw so that is why I
dialed back from three point nine that I
was at originally but honestly sometimes
discovered that the GPU is what was
actually causing the instability I could
probably go back there and play with it
a little bit more so most you guys
should be able to hit three point eight
or three point nine gigahertz possibly
even beyond that depending on your
specific CPU and when I tested Cinebench
with the 1600 X at stock I got 11 72 was
my score when I tested 1600 overclocked
I hit 12 79 actually a 12 84 and then I
hit 12 79 and I did a few other tests
right in that range but clearly you can
see that by overclocking at 1600 you can
make it perform better than a 1600 X
would out of the box of course you can
overclock at 1600 X 2 there's nothing
wrong with that but just saying I really
like the bang for the buck he get into
1600 load again though for the memory
overclock I pretty much punched in
directly that's 29 33 speed I went into
two timing sections and I took all the
timings of the listed on the side of the
memory and I basically up to the boat
all by one point so I went from 15 to 16
or from 16 to 17 loosening up the
timings just a little bit which might
help stability in the long run but
honestly I think my memory was
justifying to the whole time anyway for
my GPU overclock using MSI Afterburner
utility I set plus 90 megahertz on the
GPU plus 140 on the memory power target
was set to 120 and I did plus 15 points
on the voltage setting the fans I
manually set to 50% again that was when
I was trying to determine what was
causing the issue that resulted in a
peak GPU frequency of about 2100
megahertz which is a little high it
would taper off pretty quickly after
that it would end up running at 20 80
max and then it would dip down to around
2000 when it was actually under
long-term stress test load temperatures
with all of these over clocks in place
it is may now I should point out here in
Southern California so my ambience are a
little bit higher it's about 80 to 85
degrees Fahrenheit here which is 27 to
30 degrees Celsius so bear that in mind
CPU temps for 37 degrees Celsius idle
about 70 to 80 to 80 degrees Celsius
while gaming and then burying the stress
test it was hitting about 87 degrees
Celsius max
GPU was at 38 degrees Celsius idle 72
see while gaming and 81 C during the
stress test
next up has some noise testing so for
comparison here's what the system sounds
like while at idle next up to the gaming
test here's what the system sounds like
while just running Unigine valley
and finally here's the full-bore cpu and
GPU stress test with Ida 64 and Unigine
Valley
so obviously this isn't the quietest
system ever that is one of the
trade-offs that you get by going with
the stock heatsink band versus something
aftermarket but it does get the job done
it's still long for some overclocking
and it's not the most terribly difficult
thing to swap out in the future if you
decide that you want to quiet things
down just a little bit let's move into
some benchmarks though gaming benchmarks
that is I ran all of these at 2560 by
1440 I find that's a good resolution for
a system like this and I'm going to do
some comparisons here because last month
I built a $1400 verizon seven system and
I kind of wanted to see how these lined
up so here's the comparison of my
thousand-dollar build from this month
compared to my $1400 bills from last
month
so if you're just looking at those
gaming benchmarks the r5 1600 is pretty
much neck and neck with the r7 1700 the
eight core chips that I tested last
month and that is is pretty nice to know
that if all you're focused on is gaming
you can still get very nice performance
and do not necessarily have to pay for a
r7 chip of course the fact this is a six
core part versus an eight core part
means that scores and Cinebench were
definitely lower and then the games have
tested the CPU specifically like 3dmark
tests you saw lower scores in the
physics and CPU focus test as well
gaming tests again were pretty much even
there was a bit of a fluctuation here
and there like for instance and the
overwatch test the r5 system actually
performed much better but I would
attribute that to updated drivers
sometime using a newer driver now than
what was available about a month and a
half ago when I tested the other system
so thousand dollars awesome system great
for gaming and hey it's a six core 12
thread ship again so productivity I
would easily recommend this for as well
whether you're doing video editing or
probably a really really nice setup for
somebody who's doing like streaming on
Twitch or something like that because
you can play the game and also get extra
cores extra threads and CPUs to handle
encoding and actually sending your data
up to twitch while you're doing the
streaming thing so guys if you enjoyed
this video then definitely hit the
thumbs up button and let me know of
course comments in the comment section
are always welcome as well whether you
arguing the merits of this build or
whether you have ideas for a build of
your own I know guys thanks again so
much for watching and we'll see you next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
