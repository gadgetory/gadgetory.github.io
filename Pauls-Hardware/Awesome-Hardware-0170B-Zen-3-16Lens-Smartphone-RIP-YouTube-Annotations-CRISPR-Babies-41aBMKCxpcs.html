swear please tell me that's good alright
alright I'm waiting I'm gonna wait
though I don't believe it
I don't believe that we're actually live
on YouTube yet no until I see that we're
live on YouTube I'm starting oh thank
god
okay oh there it is there it is
hi everyone welcome to awesome hardware
sorry for the bit of lag getting the
second half of today's show up and
running YouTube like I accept no
responsibility it was a hundred percent
YouTube
yeah stream really rich and showed
people that so thankfully it caught up
so we're live I need to begin all ye
thanks for waiting around for those of
you guys who are watching us live it's
not a quick explanation for those of you
who are watching in the future this is
awesome hardware to live show we talked
about technology computers and we stream
every Tuesday evening 5:30 p.m. Pacific
time to twitch.tv slash awesome hardware
if you can watch the whole show the
actual show split in half and we also
stream to our YouTube channels for the
first half today's episode number 170
was streamed to the kyles channel bit
wit to us and that's length of the video
subscription if you haven't watched it
yet feel free to go and do that
apologies again for being late but we
have a few announcements - super late
but worth the wait that should be a mono
yeah Oh always always late always look
worth the way worth the wait I think
yeah oh but it's a great t-shirt idea
awesome hardware always late worth the
wait
we can do that that could sorry in the
future that'll happen
carry on point being though we have a
couple quick announcements
one is that we have a giveaway going on
right now and this was actually
coordinated by our friend brian AKA PPS
customs dad so if you guys are
interested in participating in that
giveaway go to my channel or Kyle's
channel or brands channel which is bps
customs and watch the video and there's
a link to the gleam io entry and there
and you can enter the giveaway it says
there's zero entries it's an excellent
giveaway everyone should participate
zero entries what no weird internet
gleams gleams kind of dropping the ball
on this what's wrong with gleam anyway
point being there's 21 different prizes
you can win so everyone go and enter the
giveaway and you will be happy super
happy when something it's only on for a
week - so you've you've got a limited
time to do so also do it now
announcements Kyle and I are gonna be
having a fan meetup it's gonna be brief
and everything so nobody go out of your
way but if you're in the Southern
California area specifically la Orange
County
maybe Riverside I mean it's a little bit
further away but especially if you
joined us last year because we're gonna
be doing pretty much the same thing
yeah then stay tuned follow us on
Twitter we'll be announcing a little bit
closer to this weekend some more the
specifics as far as where we're we're
meeting and when but it's going to be on
Saturday the 1st of December so if
you're in the area feel free to join us
it'll be cool yeah that's all for
announcements quick plug of our stories
if you guys wants to buy some nice merch
and also help support our channels check
out our stores my store is pulsar

the holidays if you spend over 50 bucks
you get 10% off if you spend over a
hundred bucks you get 20% off that's a
great deal we also have a couple new
designs that have just gone out the
excuse me the Robo love design which was
designed by Jay Ted is now available on
some some some desk mats some mouse mats
yeah it's a really cool design exploded
view of a whole PC build indeed we do
like that design Kurt's other shirts
mugs and pint glasses also available
oh look you can get again a gift card
for your friends and family cows stores
bigwig tech slash store he has the new
8bitboy which is also a fan design yeah
fan made and this is a submission there
wifey sauce and I looked at we're like
we need to put this on every piece of
merchandise we can but we haven't yet
but it's on mouse pads right now that's
dad's hoodie cities it's super sweet
oh and mugs of course oh that's cool get
two mugs and you can make it set them up
like that put next to each other that's
brilliant that's awesome well done
thanks to all you guys who buy stuff
during the show and we will be doing an
after-party once we finish finish my
half where we get super casual and we
will shout out your name speaking of
super casual we also drink beer on the
show-me occasional use of the language
so please hide your wife your kids also
I have dogs and everyone's calling it
met or happy that your wife's home
because you just drive or happy that my
wife so much is what just happened
mm-hmm
let's dive into some more tech news
let's do it which we get this yeah there
we go
first story here wait have to scroll
scroll school paralyzed from WC CF Tech
dot-com hello welcome home welcome home
lovely way
AMD's CTO mark paper master was was
doing some discussion so hassan over at
WCC f tech wrote up a little story on it
we've talked about zen and the upcoming
zen product from AMD we're somewhat
excited about it about them because
they're going to be based on TSM seized
seven nanometer plus EUV process node UV
is extreme ultraviolet lithography and
there's reason to be excited because for
one intel has been promising ten
nanometer for like forever and they keep
dragging their feet and we're not
expecting it until like the later half
of 2019
AMD drop in seven nanometer in there
it's pretty cool because we should
expect some performance improvement we
should expect some efficiency we should
expect products based on this new
process or a more refined process to
potentially run at higher frequencies as
well still not a whole lot of details on
it but there are products starting to
trickle out the first product that will
be available that's based on seven
animator is a vega 28 card the Instinct
mi 60 which is a graphics accelerator
and that will be shipping theoretically
by the end of the year later this year
given that there's only about one month
left in the year that's pretty soon what
do they mean by graphics accelerator
it's their artificial intelligence and
machine learning
gpus that's the same thing that they did
with Vega when it launched they
initially launched the frontier frontier
edition whatever you know remember that
blue one right and that was specifically
designed for for machine learning ai ai
tasks right it's not a huge amount of
difference between them I think it's
mainly a driver difference as far as
what they're capable of but starting off
with those cards they tend to sell for a
lot more for one sure but also there's a
more they're more limited market for it
so I feel like it's a type of national
they can they can launch it they can get
some cards out into the end of the
market that people start using and then
I would imagine that they're potentially
able to catch issues before they go with
like a full broad mainstream cheap
gaming GPU launch right which we are
expecting 7 nanometre trippi's based on
but again they're still very limited
information about that so but cool that
they're actually getting products out
there now there is a road map that AMD
has published now again there's only
this small picture in the article it was
Amanpour but according to the article
we've actually been promised not just
then to but also Zen 3s and for and Zen
5 for oh wait no Zen 505 times n 5 also
included not in this particular cool
little image here nice but Zen 5 has
been discussed there is an article
linked in this article just specifically
talking about Zen 5 this is actually
from April of this year because they did
some really early discussion of it but
um you know it's just it's AMD they have
a road map they have stuff they're
working on that's all good
you have to plant you have to do you
have to plan for the long game when it
comes to CPU manufacturing and
development but mark Papermaster did
unveil what to expect from Zen 3 now Zen
too if you if you following AMD over the
past couple years
Zen originally was 14 nanometer original
scent than they did Zen plus which was a
slight refinement most of the same
architecture shrunk
a little bit from 40 nanometers a 12-day
a meter mm-hmm got a little bit of
performance improvement it was nice but
it wasn't like a massive difference it
wasn't a huge shift or anything sure Zen
- should be a bigger difference because
it's a they are it's a talk they're
they're reading the architecture and I'm
a little bit more of a ground-up
redesign and again jump from from 12
down to 7 which is a pretty big jump
sure now when we tucks into it is in 3
that's more like Zen into Zen plus then
two dozen three so they said you should
expect better power efficiency with
modest performance gains with 7/3 given
that we don't even have any Zen to
products to really test yet this is
pretty forward-looking sure but you know
what AMD has in mind but yeah it seems
like maybe the Zen Zen plus thing I mean
I don't I kind of don't mind Zen Zen
plus Zen twos and - plus like that would
that would kind of work for me right it
would indicate that we're still kind of
on the same we're kind of in the same
family we just have like a slight
improvement right versus in 2003 I mean
we could we could go on ad nauseam about
manufacturers and their naming
conventions for their products but um
good to know they they've at least got
it to get it on the roadmap speaking the
roadmap the article does have a chart
here which I thought was fairly
interesting to look at if you're
interested in this type of thing years
down here at the bottom 2017 2018 2019
and 2020 we can see right now we've got
three or four 2000 series rise in 2000
series in 2019 we're expecting that to
of course seven nanometer and the first
products that are going to launch based
on seven nanometers into our epic roam
chips which are made for servers those
are gonna have 64 cores and 128 threads
it's pretty insane from the high end
desktop will have rise and threader for
3000 series
aka Castle Peak these are theoretically
again there's a question mark here so
this is just WC CF Tech theorising 32
cores and 64 threads because that's
what's currently available on 3 or 4 mm
series then we'll have Verizon 3
a series for the mainstream desktop am4
platform that's codenamed Matisse but
these maybe they'll be 12 core or 16
core versions we don't really know for
sure um on the aim apu side we have 3000
series Picasso which again there's still
some questions about whether that's
going to be actual as n2 or whether it's
gonna be kind of refresh as n+ but all
that stuff is expected in 2019 and then
in 2020 we got the 4000 series in three
seven nine a meter plus epic Milan is
the codename for that
no no code name for threader for 4000
series yet 4000 serious on desktop is
Vermeer and 4000 series on APU is Renoir
ah so there you go
exciting code names and secret secret
information of course shared with you
here it's a little bit more details on
am DS upcoming stuff this is a hardware
article all of my articles were linked
in the video's description by the way if
you guys want to check them out and this
is Lisa sue holding up the the Rome epic
CPUs so have you seen have you seen this
the the 64 core this yeah this is a 64
core things and I'm gonna like blow this
picture way up hi Lisa
okay there it is alright so these little
chips here are the new risin course
right so if you're familiar with the the
existing rise in the 88 eight cores on a
tape or 16 threads
sure this is basically the same thing
just seven nanometer right any cores in
16 threads each yep so you can see on
the epic they have this central piece
here which is actually I believe still
on 12 nanometer 14 nanometer which is a
what's that called
it's an i/o controller die which is
still based on 14 nanometer
manufacturing process so this is just a
little bit more information specifically
about the next generation epic processor
process the first the first products on
the CPU side based on the semmen
animator process the name DS going to be
coming out
and the reason this article is posted is
specifically because of ass ass off
sandra database entry which seems to
indicate potentially maybe that there
might be a significant increased in the
l3 cache on these processors now beyond
beyond that they are expecting increased
instructions per clock throughput and a
big overall performance lift versus the
twelve nanometer and 14 nanometer
products no that's weird I came back
alright Chad dismissed did you see that
no yeah just like this whole thing went
blank for watch this is gone for a
second I was like wait today we stop
streaming I think I don't Windows but
anyway this is a soft Sandra database
entry had details including the l3 cache
so the cache allotment on this entry
shows 512 kilobytes of dedicated l2
cache per core and then 16 by 16
megabytes so 16 16 mega byte blocks of
l3 cache so if you look at a rise in 720
700 X and that database entry on Sandra
you'll see 2 8 Meg's blocks of l3 cache
so each 2700 X dye has 2 8 Meg blocks of
l3 cache and then the the rise in dye is
8 cores split into 2 CC X units each
with 4 cores right so you end up with
with the cache split between the two
cores sure but this might indicate
doubling up of the cache is that you
would then get 16 Meg's of l3 cache per
core per CCX even so that could be an
indication of the improved performance
cache
I feel like cache is one of those things
that CPU manufacturers are always
trained to sort of fiddle with to try to
get the exact right amount anymore is
always better because I mean if you if
you consider the hierarchy of storage in
a computer you've got like your slowest
storage is like a hard drive and then
you've got like faster storage so it's
like an SSD right and then you have
fastest system memory right which is
which is volatile so it's only active
well you have power to it yeah they have
cash in the CPU itself that's even
faster than the system memory and
usually I have one l2 l3 right so point
being this may or may not actually be
true because we're working with early
engineering samples of the process of
processors we're talking a third party
software SATs off Sandra's ran analysis
of the hardware that was being used but
all that said this entry was for a 2p or
a dual dual socket am d---rom epoch
machine dual 64 Corvette processors so
128 cores 256 threads in the machine so
knows which is absolutely absurd and
just a few closers about this platform
overall it's going to support top-end
room CPUs it will be socket compatible
the new Rome CPUs will be socket
compatible with previous generation
epoch platforms but also will be socket
compatible with upcoming the law the
upcoming Milan server platform which
supports PCIe Cole Gen 4 nice
that's am that's kind of mind-boggling
to me because from my perspective the
PCI Express controller is part of the
CPU and most modern CPUs so to have one
that's compatible with M 3 and Gen 4
right it's interesting definitely over
over engineering but that's super cool
pretty to read a little bit more up on
the details than that boards and
backwards compatible yeah
so these game D CPUs will be competing
with Intel's cascade Lake SP CPUs which
are supposed to tell still shipped later
this year remember when aim when Intel
was like hey we have a 28 core 56 thread
processors shipping by the end of the
year that's still happening we're still
are we holding them to that for what
sorry I missed that I was reading chat
but Intel's absurd copy text
presentation where they oh did the
chiller unit on the that was that was a
fluff present a 28 core 56 to read
process I'm not I'm not holding my
breath okay yeah
they're still supposed to launch it by
the end of the year so well we'll see
it'll be disappoint see what actually
happens all right let's move on though
YouTube YouTube will be removing all
video annotations On January no but I
love annotation I said no one ever maybe
some people like annotations this is
just some of this is like public service
announcement everyone should be aware of
this annotations okay I will say
annotations are useful they still have a
place and I don't think they should
remove them they should just improve
them because sometimes like you you want
to added a little annotation in your
video so that people know like hey like
there's an edit here I had an additional
note or I messed up I wanted to say
something that I couldn't put in post
and so here it is on the actual video
player but no you got to put it now in
the comments if you've really make an
annotation and who reads the freaking
comments people I put things edits in
the comments all the time this is hey at
3 minutes and 15 seconds I really said
that word wrong it's actually this word
no one reads that I still have a
thousand comments every day that says
hey Kyle you messed up on that word you
never corrected yourself
you're an idiot I mean granted I'm still
in it but I didn't correct myself and no
one saw because I didn't put it in a
freaking annotation an annotation still
have a place in the world I'm just
trying to fight for equal rights for
annotations that's all when you were
when you were most enthusiastic in that
little diatribe you just went on right
now
that would be a little red light on the
on the sound board when you yep
of course hey I called them peak moments
so I'm monitoring and monitoring the
audio very diligently rip headphone for
this show yeah good good you know Kyle's
Kyle's pretty much summed it up by like
I said this is this is mostly just so
you guys are aware because obviously
it's going to be deeply impactful if you
aren't aware the annotations editor for
YouTube in general was discontinued back
in May of 2017 so it was it's been well
over a year that you haven't been able
to add or modify any annotations on any
video as it is right they were just
legacy annotation
that we're still there right that's all
that's pretty much all there is to this
story
annotations were replaced by end screens
and screens and cards pop-up and cards
which are phenomenally better yeah they
look more professional and work on
mobile devices that was the big selling
point for me Mobile's authorizes cards
and everything works yes and according
to the article cards and end screens
generate seven times more clicks than
annotations yeah absolutely driven
sanitation's yeah you cuz they go any
cool the animation pops out smoothly
that pops into my mind and this is very
abstract it doesn't doesn't really it's
not really legit but like I feel like
when annotations first came out there
was there were people who made videos
that really used annotations to get the
list yeah I had like
choose-your-own-adventure videos yeah
yes they were all kind of integrated
right those videos are not gonna be
completely useless right so yeah hold
those like videos I mean in like 2008
like which people probably still watch
all the time be very confusing for them
without the annotations I missed the
choose your own no I don't I don't miss
it hey I'm gonna skip the next story
because I don't have good notes on it
and I wanted to do a straw poll and I
didn't so I'm disappointed with myself
that's good let's move on to this story
from the verge do it about LG with a 16
lens smartphone camera that's right what
is it there's a there's a little diagram
there's the one that looks like an
insect of it right here
yeah it kind of looks like a just looks
really an alien sex I guess it's for the
16 have a link to the verge in the
video's description they have a link to
where they got the story from it just
lets go digital why why 16 lenses well
obviously cause every lens every lens
has you know some nuance and distinct
you know like when they polish it that
has you know polish significant what
like this is this I don't understand
this graph here this looks like it's
squishing the lenses in different ways
okay
anyway the thing that always baffled me
when they were talking about cameras
with multiple lenses was like does each
lens have its own a sensor right because
it's not just about the lens and the
optical apparatus of capturing the light
sensor itself the sensor the light
eventually hits a sensor and the sensor
is very important with digital cameras
the bigger the sensor the better so more
detail and precision and a better sensor
can also be more sensitive to various
color you know you could have better
color depth just like a monitor does for
the array here that's shown with this
mirror or whatever it's also point out
kind of seems to me to indicate that all
of these lenses are situated over a
single sensor and maybe they all just
hit a different part of it okay maybe
that slightly helped by a lens so what's
the minute that I don't know I don't
know this whole length this is in a
different language to translate it and
should that be a segment that we do
where all the articles are in a foreign
language that's purely speculative this
could be this could be revealing the
deepest mysteries of life what everyone
should do to live happy for the rest of
your time on this earth but it's a
German get to bear over here all right
that's right Jumeirah can at least
translate the German he knows he knows
the truth to happiness
anyway um the secret yeah so the goal
the multiple cameras seems to be effort
to offer different angles seen using the
perspective of the different lenses
different angles so is this the things
because you know you know Steve post us
on Facebook he posted a picture of his
cat or something where you could move
your phone and sort of see the cat in
like a three-dimensional like it was a
very slight it was a very slight
movement that you could make with the
pit with the photo but it allowed you to
sort of like give this sort of like so
maybe that's what real life is view
digital here is see right which I don't
really do the point
there's Winnie the Pooh here she Jim
Peng also aka
and he's seen from different angles and
you put your thumb on his face and then
he can twist face around and now he said
why do you need to do that who he's
demanding this feature because he's a
stupid bear he's looking at you you want
it so I'm gonna teach him a lesson
why no we shouldn't be stupid bear
should not be given any more attention
than this just not worn how about how
about this about how about this cow is
this plain things any better - you see
dude here I'll I'll let you explain
Kyle's gonna explain this one how would
the hell am I gonna just just go with it
guys okay dude right standing there yeah
and then man fingering woman's face -
lying around just just her head it's a -
line he's clearly he's clearly surfs
highlighting her face her her head and
now he's making her hotter with a chick
that has bigger boobs now you have a
down here at the bottom uh-huh these are
all the people whose soul you can trade
her soul with yeah you treat her with
the hotter chick the right there the
second one's gonna be chaotic evil or
something like that you sure so chaotic
evil is replaced with Instagram model
and then once you swap out Instagram
model that that black bar there is the
man's happiness like he is now happier
that he's with the Instagram he's happy
enough we don't want him to be too sure
he's not overloaded I mean like static
she may be tough 20 not top five and
then the meanwhile and this last one
obviously obviously what's going on with
this last image here which is very
related to these other images last image
is just art and now you reflect on your
decision did you make the right choice
picking the hot Instagram model with the
original girl who didn't have a frame
cut around her head let's move on to
something a little bit lighter here sue
its Chinese scientists have have created
Jean edited babies yes
this is an exclusive from the MIT
Technology Review okay Chinese
scientists creating CRISPR babies CRISPR
CRISPR babies well they're not crisp
enough Paul that's what I think is funny
when you talk about CRISPR babies it
sounds like wow they're really like
they're golden they're golden-brown and
delicious they're ready get him out of
that oven all right so here's perfect he
Gen qui huge N queen he's got a video
now that's an AP sorry I clicked the
wrong link that was ap report here's
this video so one talk sauce so
basically this this Chinese scientist
has gone rogue okay he has used CRISPR
which is a gene editor sure it's been
around for some time a lot of people
have been like wow you could use this on
people but then everyone was like well
that would be raise a bunch of like
ethical questions of like how it should
be appropriately used and we don't know
what the outcome could be and modifying
our genes might have results that we
don't foresee because we don't fully
understand it anyway this guy was like
fuck all that I'm gonna make two twin
girls that are HIV resistant huh yeah
huh okay who wouldn't want that
so this is his video explaining its how
he made these girls and don't worry guys
I've already scrolled through the whole
thing there's no actual pictures of the
girls themselves I was imagining they
would be superheroes they would probably
look like superheroes that's what I'm
figuring you come out with cake Chris
Jean edited babies crisp give me fake
crisp very crisp crisp capes crisp capes
Mizpah capes
then because plan crisp okay yeah
obviously this is thrown our entire like
our entire moral perspective of the
world into shambles we don't know what's
right and what's wrong anymore and the
fact that China did this first is
actually kinda good I mean if you're
looking at this from like like the u.s.
perspective right they've kind of taken
the brunt of the ethical complaints here
right there's much people like oh my
gosh you can't do this
playing God and a bunch of stuff like oh
thank god they did it first thinking
otherwise
yeah they they're just pick it up once
it's all fine I was like well they
already did it like we got to do it too
now sure
obviously sure more than that in just a
moment Jesus Christ are we advocating
for this now
no like maybe your sponsors don't want
to be sandwiched in between gene edited
baby speed at which those technologies
the speed at which this technology is
evolving is unprecedented
speaking of speed have you heard about
the good news of Toshiba easy SSDs I
haven't fixed yet okay oh crap oh we tip
sorry I've never done that before that's
amazing you could do that guys every day
every day we're learning every day
wheeler not available it must be making
her CX is off awesome hardware or thirds
wait we've got this sponsor you son of a
bitch sponsor Toshiba okay oh sure ah
don't do that no I can't do that it's so
satisfying what if what if our Toshiba
rep is like has to take this clip and
send it to like there it's like whoever
it be like hey here's our sad that I
paid for and that starts out with you
then they sang Toshiba in a very then
they'd have to say this is the most
enthusiastic anyone has ever said our
company name I appreciate house
enthusiasm for Toshi and it was the most
memorable time anyone's ever said our
company name true also we've already
really screwed up that Scioscia add
integration so
this is why this is why I think the big
that much hope that they're ever gonna
do this again
forget all that those guys forget all
that forget everyone just clear your
minds for just a moment clear your minds
okay it's just made of tape everyone
meditate on my voice and rational
meditate on my voice this week's episode
of awesome hardware is brought to you by
Toshiba
and hero and hero who's down there
licking his bodies looking he's licking
and crazy-looking parts Toshiba makers
of fine products such as this excess 700
external SSD the tier 200 internal 2.5
inch SSD the RC 100 RC 100 which is a
really cool little little tiny and
adorable in the new M that to SSD yes
all these products are based on BICS
flash memory which Toshiba can produce
for reasonable prices but is also quite
fast so you get a really nice balance of
reasonably priced products fast assess
these everybody wins
well you know tiny it is that's the RC
100 which is super super tight it's a
time use in my tiny hands so guys if
you're interested check out this video's
description I have links to some toasty
Toshiba products down there and you can
check them out and a big THANK YOU to
Toshiba for sponsoring awesome hardware
heck to the yeah I look super legit
right heck to the yeah alright
excelente in the meantime getting back
to those crisper babies what I didn't
realize that sandwiched you plan this
out so well do you do protects are in a
third fight third fight obviously of
course ok sword fight where Kyle and I
argue about a very controversial subject
crisper babies we're gonna argue about
crisper be go Kyle home you're drunk
you're clearly clearly at this point
we've explained you what Christopher
babies are and what they're capable of
happily now China started this just how
clear this is almost fault they started
it China sucks
China's gonna have genetically modified
human babies I don't know if they'll
stay babies this is one thing that has
been clear they could grow up to be so
for the rest of this discussion assume
we're adults when we say babies we mean
they maybe start as babies and maybe
they're designed to stay as babies and
they like super-killer babies or
something like that that's totally
possible but assume that we're talking
about babies that have grown to be
adults
sure okay I'm with you I'm out a percent
now obviously we have to respond to this
right so here's the straw poll that
we're asking you guys to vote on no we
here in America we take defense very
seriously so us scientists are gonna
need to respond to this
so when US scientists create superhuman
CRISPR babies sure us with with American
flags of course to defend against the
Chinese super human CRISPR babies in the
worse to come
what special powers should they focus on
giving them mmm pretty straightforward
yeah we all know special powers CRISPR
obviously their powers it's gonna be the
outcome so we have a bunch of options
here
now I think Kyle what we should do sure
since there are many options in it like
I said government I actually remembered
to choose the thing that allows you to
select multiple options here so select
select for these superpowers you think
are most important I think you and I
should each choose three doesn't have
create our own version of a
super-powered CRISPR baby okay and then
we'll sort of face them off against and
see which short who maybe has the best
one absolutely and I had device like a
point system for like who had points but
never mind that it's too complicated
okay but do you think in the worst
I mean telepathy I have to I have to say
till everything I mean being able to
read someone's mind is about most
importance in in order to win a war you
can you can you can predict and to
anticipate their movements their wants
and desires you can manipulate those
desires and to your own advantage you
know I think I think being able to talk
and to control animals yeah is also very
important you know you can use as a baby
you don't have a whole lot of physical
attributes of course you could have
super-strength and invisibility is as
Paul mentioned here but I think even
more
effective you know you get
super-strength as a baby doesn't mean
you up SuperSpeed you can be super
strong as a baby but still move one mile
an hour as you're crawling you'd be like
one punch man one punch man but but I
mean it takes you five hours to get to
your victim I mean it's not it's not
just because you have strength doesn't
mean you have speed people could just
like walk away from you slowly so talk
to control talk or to or control animals
hear me out here you can you you can
summon bears you can summon wolves you
can summon coyotes and and poisonous
centipedes I do like the I said I didn't
I did notice the last option and I was
very tempted but I think even beyond
that you want to be able to make people
happy in a war you have to know what
make people because happiness is really
just happiness what is happiness
happiness is just an abstraction so if
you can actually make people genuinely
happy and you can read their minds and
know what what what makes them tick what
makes them happy that is the ultimate
that's the ultimate evil possession is
to know what makes people happy that way
you'd know exactly how to rip it out
from under their feet and and and
succeed and just completely obliterate
all essence of hope in their lives
because nothing nothing is more
effective in a war than destroying one's
hope because if there is no hope or
allies the enemy you have to demoralize
them in every sense so with the ability
to control animals so that you they can
take the brunt of the physical work and
knowing what they know no me believing
understanding how their mind works from
a telepathic view and being able to make
them happy in the first place to really
because the higher you could all be
brought down as high as much as you are
up high so if we can make people really
happy initially if you can make your
enemy super happy that that creates a
greater Delta of how much you can bring
them down to the lowest low and then you
just have the fucking wolves attack you
know at fucking dawn and you're good to
go so that this is the only a trifecta
of a war strategy that I feel would be
the most effective in a battle like this
actually
like say you have to show them like the
life that they could have and and and
everything and then just take your
fucking and tape it away Wow
really that was this savage AF striking
all right um I I obviously disagree with
all of your choices they're stupid
it's cuz you're wrong and wrong super
wrong now first off the main thing you
got to have is the healing the healing
power because the healing capability is
what gives you the ability to be
resilient to bounce back from encounters
you might have of course but also the
ability to survive potential other posts
CRISPR procedures the might that might
occur we all of course are familiar
Wolverine it was his inherent mutant
healing ability that allowed him to go
through the Project X procedure which
which gave him the adamantium skeleton
and claws and everything you didn't have
a healing there's no way so there's a
lot of flexibility there it opens up a
lot of doors true that's what I'm saying
true now you gotta go with hand lasers I
mean I sure in this two hand lasers but
I'm talking about you know being able to
create some sort of the kinetic or
energy rich projectile from from the
orifices of your body to shoot at people
I just think it's a it's a good general
user man Jackson going on he'll write
you know especially to have ranged you
got a range combat not everything can be
handled and in the melee environment
finally really good hair really good
hair does help I mean if you train like
you got it you got it assume that
there's gonna be some sort of public
aspect you know cuz you got a bunch of
you got a bunch of superhumans they were
created in a lab and everything and
they're supposed to be saving humanity
but their hair sucks
and obviously there's gonna be some sort
of reticence in the general public
because people gonna be like you know
are these people gonna replace us you
know do they think they're better than
us somehow or something like that you
know just some really good hair and you
know it's like some presence there to
have the ability to talk you're gonna
communicate with people you're going to
connect with
and you're gonna help everyone know that
you're there to help them if you look at
all the United States Presidents they've
all had exceptional air George
Washington Abe Lincoln started the
trendy you no longer on the top sure on
the sides Obama just you know
free-spirited just short it short it up
cut it up it's just is evidence hard
evidence that's all right good good I
don't know why I'm arguing on your head
no I'm arguing your back clearly wrong
wow this is such see it's like what wait
what this is what happens when you give
them a thousand options
well obviously superintelligence
currently in first healing though oh and
that one sure super strength of course
you got telepathy disability
invisibility uh very I was very close on
that one yeah you know I'm kind of
surprised that and I think it was
because it was lower down as flying I
think I thought flying might be a little
bit higher up hand lasers though also
really high yeah pretty good human pull
okay so guys weird not this one
obviously this was an exercise in you
know speculation science so that we will
be using this to actually create a super
human being in the future so everyone go
ahead and Nick continue to vote let us
know what you think they tune for next
episodes we present our prototype yeah
alright we got one more argument here
for sword fight okay
a little bit more personal cows alright
great I'm not gonna be Oh give you the
option oh no to choose I have I can't
even apart you I have choice number one
and you're gonna be forced to defend
your right so now you guys maybe if
you've watched the youtubes and the tech
channels have seen some of these recent
Walmart PC videos right we we got Kyle's
over here published a couple weeks ago
yeah at one point five million views not
too shabby Kyle raised the roof not too
shabby at all there I'm up thirty dollar
thirty thousand thumbs ups on that one
there
word followed up of course Steve from
gamers Nexus he's beating me at one
point six point six my god well I feel
like such a sucker in his defense he did
have the actual PC actual PC I feel
pretty good about getting 1.5 off of
just the screen cap and you have Kyle
has a follow up to have a fault where he
actually did get the PC as well do have
a fault which I was actually kind of
hoping you would do yeah which is
already at 700 K now here's the thing
something like that you might look at
this you might look at this and think to
yourself you know what what a wonderful
world
you know Kyle and Steve are providing a
service to everyone here's who's Kyle's
follow up the 1400 oh you do it 730
providing providing a service to
everyone you know taking this PC and
opening it up and showing the internals
anyone who might have been fooled by
going to Walmart and everything I think
that's not the case I think that a lie
oh I think that is false something more
spamela resent to you guys right now
what does that theory about what is
going on here Walmart Walmart's not
gonna sell gaming PC's and I'm gonna
make money selling gaming PC's they know
this Walmart is a they're they're a
large company they have lots of stores
they have a basic idea of like who their
customers are and who their customers
aren't sure I think this all was a setup
complete setup definitely obviously
Walmart has paid off Kyle and paid off
Steve to create these videos
sounds legit and they're sharing the ad
revenue from them we are drowning in
money in Walmart exactly sweet sweet
YouTube money that's not comes through
so Walmart was like hey Steve hey Kyle
we're gonna make some really really
shitty pcs you guys tear them up
obviously people eat that up right now
yep and you know everyone wins you know
we get a little we get a little paper on
them on the on the comeback and you guys
get get to have the benefit Walmart
Walmart paid me gosh this Walmart PCs
nobody buy them oh no that's if everyone
was even gonna do that the first place I
will admit Walmart paid me and Steve big
bucks to talk major shake um
any gaming pcs well what's that to be to
be clear laborat of absolutely clear
what you're supposed to be arguing oh no
I am arguing the J massive conspiracy
that Walmart are all you know no people
just like watching a new category of
video called PC built cringe porn which
is clearly the obvious answer to all of
this nonsense people like watching
things that suck people who are really
bad at building computers
it started with very it started with the
verge it did start with the vs. where
this all originated I mean I I made a
video on the verge PC and it blew up
more than any other video that I've done
on the successful PC build I'm like PC
of the month this PC is amazing PC of
the month this PC is literally perfect
in every way
jack-shit views compared to any disaster
bill that you've ever seen the verge do
or Walmart to uh you know you know you
don't tune into the news my grandparents
so tune into the news every five every
day at 5:00 p.m. to be like what's going
right with the world today no everyone
wants to see the catastrophe the child
that's been abducted the crime scene
that happened at the local grocery store
or you know the the car chase that the
cops have been after for hours so you
know it's a it's a human nature human
nature we are naturally attracted to
fuck up hurry to chaos and so Steve and
I have just managed to find a way to
capitalize on that and Paul's just
simply jealous of all of our hard-earned
success I never I never denied that I'm
just trying to drive from the horses
just you know trying to dig down to the
source so I can profit no better I think
I'll there's very very honest and
straightforward response and everything
there and it appears that you're correct
yes people just like watching shitty PC
builds and people who actually have an
idea of what they're doing feel like no
this is wrong and bad and shitty we're
gonna do this this category is being
added to pornhub as we speak oh yeah as
a as a new key
get up on that kind of thing absolutely
