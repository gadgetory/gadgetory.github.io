ever isn't it it's up there it's up
there with top with the greatest of five
unprepared shows there are some topics
though haven't we done a show before
where we were just like we have nothing
we're gonna we didn't but though it
might have been cousin really jet-lagged
from Computex or something yeah it's
some use some good excuse for not being
ready and being tired you just had a
baby yeah and you know I'm your close
friend so I feel like I had baby too so
that's my excuse I guess it is I get to
piggyback off of your excuse it is
hereditary so okay that works for life
oh yeah we're live hi hi everyone and
welcome to awesome hardware
I remember how this goes this is a live
show we usually talk about technology
and computers and stuff we drink some
beer responsibly of course you do we
occasionally use adult language so watch
out if we swear and everybody scream
every Tuesday evening at 5:30 p.m.
Pacific time we're a little late today
sorry well but you know that's kind of
traditional too we're worth it and first
half of this episode number 188 is on my
channel pulse hardware second half is
gonna be on Cal's Channel bit weight
that's linked in the description or you
can watch the whole damn thing on twitch
twitch TV / awesome hardware thanks for
joining us everyone who might be here
and watching us live and also a big
thank you to our awesome moderator cell
also saying he's there in chat and he's
he's a good person
fundamentally good decent and wholesome
person also so also incredibly evil well
he said he's a dichotomy he's he's like
a yin and yang depending on he is the
universe depending on this season I
don't I don't I don't remember how to
have his his powers works but his mental
state alright today's today's show is
gonna be a blessedly brief we do have a
few things to talk about but as Kyle
already mentioned I am a recently new
father
a little over two weeks ago and a baby
infant no a newborn I guess right now
and she wakes up every few hours
cries oops bees something like that we
get up to take care of it so lack of
sleep for has caused me to generally be
bad at everything now so that and I'm
trying to deal with that and transition
to this new phase you know to build a
computer anymore
Paul vaguely I like what are you
switching to max I was potentially going
to do a video on Monday I am still
filming at the odd video here and
they're trying to keep things up with my
channel and I I had sort of a build a
builder I'll work on a system set up the
other day and I just didn't I was like
knots too intimidating instead I just
just cleaned
thank you good yeah one of those awesome
videos of me cleaning coming up I can
understand agrees point being the
content of my channel has never been
stronger so thank you all for watching
hell yeah that's oh yeah let's quickly
this stupid keyboard looks quickly plug
I'm gonna yell at the keyboard every
time which which mediate which ones are
media keys f1 through f5 or standard f1
through f5 through f12 o media Keys
those media keys by default and you got
a press function f7 and I I usually use
f7 and f8 to switch switch scenes
because your cuz you're all got so
stream deck although it is plugged in
still is not yet set up and it works
that would know it doesn't know until
you set up what do you need this
oh that y'all got to oh right well I
haven't also capture card as well let me
press the function for using you know
capture cards I thought that capture
could have turned a penny on this mess
decks over nigga right there it is yes
right see default still well know if I'm
gonna continue using that keyboard with
it's awful helium then I think the
screen deck yeah
I think I need to actually shoot we got
to show people which keyboard we're
we're talking trash on it's a really
nice keyboard I really likes nice it's
super sexy this is an asus rog I don't
know it's a sample set doesn't say
switches feel really nice I think
they're cherry and makes it looks cool
and I have to pull it over more all
right can you guys even see it
Raji strix scope out of the scope I hope
this isn't under NDA I don't think it is
they just sent this to me this week
maybe it is that who knows no definitely
not if it is you didn't see it here
anyway I'm sure it's awesome in every
other way but I really don't like that
decision with function for anyway it got
an if' design award clearly the people
behind if' didn't mind of the function
King so obviously that's like if if it
got a design award if you fix this
shitty party and keyboard you would have
got more that word what the hell was I
talking about
oh there's doors doors function at eight
our stores function hardware dotnet for
my store
check it out buy stuff cows stores bit
with that tech slash store do the same
there it's all real nice do it moving on
to some technology news okay I have just
the briefest smattering today we're
starting off with some interesting
I thought interesting news so we're
expecting very soon some at least
announcements if not launch of AMD's
rise in 3000 series processors this sums
in to architecture microarchitecture 7
nanometre manufacturing process see my
friends not completely fried I can yeah
yes let's say some of these things all
there but a lot of question because
we're still using am for socket on these
new motherboards for these new
processors so the processors are
backwards compatible or so we are told
but what functionality will work one way
or the other and potentially good news
here for people who bought like decent
wait I see I'm pressing wrong buttons
again where to go ah okay people who buy
decent like am for motherboards you
might be able to pop a rising three
thousand serious CPU in there and also
get PCI Express Gen 4 support Oh II see
ie 4.0 which is this is going to be one
of the first platforms it has that it's
articles from an antic
they released some BIOS updates for
their existing x4 70 and B 450 and for
motherboards they are specifically to
support these news n2 and risin 3000
series processors Anandtech
went ahead and updated their gigabyte X
47 to gaming 7 Wi-Fi flashed it to the
latest f40 firmware and found this
little screen that says PCIe slot
configuration apparently you can
switched it back to Gen 1 which which is
useful very useful for those of you
maybe for networking but you got Gen 4
in there so you can you can pop in Gen 4
you would have to have an actual risin
3000 so you see if you installed for
support for that but it does seem like
there's potentially some backwards
compatibility going through there that's
pretty cool this has not been officially
confirmed by gigabytes or by any other
motherboard manufacturer or by AMD so I
guess still bitter grain of salt there
but it is something that's in the BIOS
and they usually don't do that unless it
is going to be a thing in some way for
current motherboards in the market
according to the article would depend on
how they're built because PCIe 4.0
specifications state that the traces the
connections between the CPU and the
slots need to be a minimum length they
need to be short enough otherwise they
probably have signaling issues and can't
maintain high your frequencies err
anyway so that would mean that is it is
probable but not confirmed that some
existing X 370 be 350 X 470 and B 450
motherboards might get support for this
with the new processor of course so cool
I've done lots of build videos over the
past few years with 300 series and 400
series AMD motherboards and one of the
reasons I like to recommend it is
because of the upgrade path and for a
lot of people who might have initially
jumped on with maybe a rise in apu like
a 2200 2400 or maybe like a sixth core
then when these new cpus come out it
would be pretty stinking cool to just be
able to buy just that cpu and pop it in
and go from a six core 12 3
- you know a much faster eight course
sixteen thread or even better you know
it's well of course ich Steen course I'm
like that yeah and if this is true again
then it would mean that they're
potentially not locking out that PCIe
4.0 functionality to sell the 500 series
motherboards which you could totally see
them doing because we've been trained by
Intel to think that they're gonna do the
dick move rather then provide more
support down for people who already own
hardware and not try to force people to
buy new stuff right so cool if they do
this again it's not 100% confirmed but
this was the most interesting thing that
I saw as I frantically prepared for the
show definitely sounds more like an AMD
thing to do than an Intel thing yes and
then that is something that you know
that's one of the great things about
having AMD kind of resurgence and and
being competitive again is one of the
things that they have done pretty
consistently is provided things that
Intel typically locks out up to much
higher price points like unlock CPUs for
overclocking and other stuff too that I
can't think of right now cuz my brain
I'm a brain kind of you can think of
something right yeah sure
yeah of course well I think I'm sort of
the same way as you and someone is
looking to me for advice on building a
new system for gaming and they have a
limited budget usually it's a fixed
budget right like most people and I
almost always always recommend a Rison
platform specifically because of the
upgrade path because most of the time
you want if if gaming is your mo you
want to dump most your money into your
GPU as opposed to your CPU so maybe you
can't afford a blazing fast balls to the
wall CPU but that's okay most games are
GPU bound anyways spend the most you can
buy the buy the nicest and fastest
graphics card you can afford and even
though maybe you might see a little bit
maybe your CPU might not be completely
up to snuff maybe it falls it's somewhat
into the the bottleneck category you can
still upgrade it down the line and
eventually you know balance the parts a
little bit better you're still going to
get pretty decent gaming performance
even with like a rising 5 processor for
example you can
with saying r-tx 2070 or even in RTX
2728 ii but but yeah I think it's a
great option it's incredibly flexible it
doesn't walk you in and replacing out
the CPU and doing a quick BIOS update is
so much simpler just from a hardware
perspective than having to swap out your
motherboard that's literally connected
to everything else in your system so I
do appreciate that too but hopefully we
will be getting many more answers to a
lot of questions about this stuff like
really soon cuz Computex is is like
right around the corner couple years
couple weeks away hey what week what a
week in a few days away weekend a few
days away now to close Kyle's going I am
NOT I'm staying home this year because
of the baby but I will I'm gonna be
doing some you know some sort of
compilation videos probably steel piles
or whatever towels video and like reuse
it but that is Commission sounds like a
great plan actually but yeah I'm gonna
what I'm gonna try to sort of eat the
copy text news and digest it and then
sort of process it into something that
you can then consume
that's probably honestly way more
effective and efficient than actually
going there and being so frantic and
having a million thoughts that your mind
and being super stressed out as you're
running from booth to booth 15 times a
day like your content is probably gonna
be better than any of the people who are
actually there including mine I'm gonna
try to take more focus I'm gonna try to
take advantage of that yeah but you have
the baby handicap as well yeah well I
mean that's that's true for now until
forever what was I gonna say was I gonna
say oh I I am planning on going back
like I really do enjoy going to to
Computex every year even though it's
Taiwan and like the worst possible time
when it's just hot and humid
yeah I'm really uncomfortable if you go
outside I really like going and it's one
of those events that I've been doing for
a while now so I'm gonna miss it but
I'll be back even if my regurgitated
stuff this this year does super awesome
I'll probably anyway
what's next Taiwan
Microsoft Paint yes mspaint getting an
update as you can see really we started
on a somewhat interesting story and it's
quickly going downhill I think this is
the highlight of the of the week I think
this is very interesting and that's
paint
which all of you use all the time every
day you know it's available they're
available in Windows for its time
immemorial and Microsoft had said that
they were gonna get rid of it it was
going to be deprecated so they say in
future Windows 10 updates but a bunch of
people were like no I like paint that's
useful all the time I use paint I mean
for something you need to copy and drop
in real quick it's it's useful there's a
huge artistic community that uses paint
as well artistically only paint I saw
some guy draw like a photo realistic
image of Thanos in ms paint and it
looked like a movie poster it was like
it looked better than the CG and in
freakin and game it was really
impressive hi Priya getting called by a
sandwich bakery at the moment a
Vietnamese sandwich bakery I have no
idea why she's not the point that I I
just never answer my phone ever it's no
I don't know so a useless and horrible
yeah like it wasn't my mom or mom who
would have thought that you know
everyone has such quick easy access to
phones now in your pocket ready and the
one thing that the phone originally did
see like it's so horrible you know with
cos you don't you never get calls from
people know or from people you want to
talk to it's all it's all stamp ban
trying to sell you stuff I really had
some sort of list just another mailing
list you know just you know some way to
penetrate our faces and that's paint
though mspaint uh how are they have
taken it they you can use the arrow keys
to move around it's that's really use
the arrow keys to move the on-screen
cursor use the spacebar to activate the
tool they're adding because normally you
got to use the mouse nothing that
everyone can
most easily so as an accessibility
option uh you can now use the keyboard
controls as a primary input method more
the precise team we have here this
gorgeously rendered desert landscape Oh
Vista which was created with only
keyboard controls as part of Microsoft's
validation testing obviously by one of
the artists on their team that and I I
want that hanging up in my house it's
transfixing I'm I am transfixed also
they have some general enhancements to
the way paint interacts with screen
readers such as windows narrator more
accessibility options
can you just say narrator draw me a
desert and probably and that's it that's
what it does that'd be nice I would
imagine would be my orientation all
right let's move on here lastly for news
I have here a horror story mm-hmm a
horror story not not a horror story that
he's gonna serve me that well it's a
horror story about this summer a horror
story yeah you're right this is written
up over on the subreddit asshole design
because that's where the post was close
to they got a lot of attention I
originally saw this on reddit incredible
I'm sorry I originally saw this on
Twitter because that's where mumbo jumbo
who is a youtuber does Minecraft videos
he does some other stuff too but I like
I went on a random time where I was
everyone I got the Xbox one and had
minecraft on it and I started playing
and then I psycho this sucks I and I and
I installed it back on the computer
again and that was playing minecraft
like sort of briefly yeah I forget when
that was but I started watching mumbo
jumbo videos he's it's it's they're
really entertaining he's got such he's
just has such a sort of light
personality like he's I'm very easygoing
and you know he goes around Minecraft
and does stuff that has a series called
hermit craft but he he posted this tweet
a company is systematically copyright
claiming every video I've ever made
despite me owning the rights to all
music used in them please tell me I
don't have to manually dispute all 1800
claims of course you do we have YouTube
we're talking about
to make anything easy for the creator
that's him I just wanted to give a quick
gander his channel yeah I mean he's got
a huge following oh I'm sorry
he oh that's no this is a return of
craft channel it's no he's a three point
one point 1 million subscribers
strong strong channel so yeah very big
uh here-here's just Twitter thick boy as
well and this goes back earlier he made
a video talking about the copyright
system as well apparently they cast cut
out but about 25% of his content was
claimed he is now in contacts with
YouTube so this got a decent amount of
traction like the people were talking
about this because he is a fairly big
youtuber and I think for a lot of people
like me and Kyle you see something like
this in your like oh my gosh that could
so easily happen to me the fact is for
doing a Content ID claim once you have
enough subscribers you have access to
that I have access to the system I can
go and it will tell me all of the videos
that I've ever made where it has flagged
other videos with Content ID that have
used what it recognizes as my content I
can bulk flag all those videos and you
have the option you can say leave the
video up and monetize but the
monetization goes to me now or you can
take you can take the video down I think
is one of the options right and then
whoever the whoever put that video up
that was claimed then they get an email
and then they go in and they can dispute
it but when you're disputing them you
can only do it one at a time it's about
five or six clicks to get through and
you have to click the things okay and
you have to take a little thing that
says I own this content yet whatever
reason so I've gotten some recently I
got had some old ad Rev audio micro
music that was getting picked up in some
of the videos I just went and
individually disputed all those and
thankfully most of them were released
something like this like you can't do
that and I mean it could but how much of
your time which you should any spending
making videos or otherwise is then being
you know used in that way especially
when you know that the company that did
that I did not need to invest that much
time yeah input
those claims that this is when this is
why I say like an MCN is like a
lifesaver because if you if I brought
this to fullscreen which is you know my
I'm CNC or MCM as well they would they
would for the most part they would take
care of this now it kind of sucks
because if you're a smaller channel you
don't get as much support sometimes you
don't get like a one-on-one you know a
person like helping you out but when but
it's usually the larger channels who are
getting attacked in this capacity
anyways so if that happens to you the
MCN has been really helpful it's like
okay they're taking a cut of my earnings
every single month and a lot of times it
seems like they're just you know taking
your taking your dose giving off the top
for for nothing but when shit like this
hits the fan
you're really thankful that you have it
it's kind of like having insurance like
that have nothing Bad's gonna happen but
then every once in a while something bad
does happen it's nice to have that that
support system legal team and all that
stuff so quick thought so his most
recent update is that it's apparently a
song he has that he has been using the
he has permission from the artist but
the artist used a sample that was picked
up by Warner's Content ID bot so so
there you go and his lesson is not only
should you ensure you have complete
rights to the music you're using but
also ensure that you ask about any
samples that have been used otherwise
you use be in that situation so it's so
small like that and I guess that would
be another potential like so Kyle and I
both are both full screen full screen
gives you access to epidemics sound
that's the music content platform and
that's where I get pretty much all the
music that I use currently so all of
that should be clear you know but you
know there is a possibility that
somebody who makes music for epidemic
sound could use something that was
picked up otherwise one of the really
annoying things that's happened to me is
it's an old track that was used yeah
somebody a couple years later uses that
track and like sings over it or
something and sort of makes a song with
it and then they start claiming other
videos that use the original track
that's right that has happened to me and
that's
especially because the song they made
with the track was horrible like it's
just so bad anyway though it's uh well
yeah that's good I hope he works it out
yeah me too I'm Bougainville November
alright so that's all I have for my sort
of prepared content for today but we're
gonna do a little little QA okay
take Sam out better demotions yeah yeah
answer questions that have been asked in
chat Papa Q 100 Danish Krone ax yeah I
think DKK I think Democratic Korean
Crona we'll just say 100 100 dick
Congrats Paul okay our hero and nori
okay with your baby girl being all noisy
and demanding attention it's a good
question okay yeah pups poppers handling
all this I've been asked that several
times fortunately so far it's all been
good um excuse me my dogs have some
triggers that get them barking pretty
loud most of the time they're pretty
quiet mm-hmm but everyone I can kind of
go off sure fortunately she are my
daughter Hannah does not react to that
they just as good yeah that's really
good so so that's cool and when she
cries which she does sometimes as well
which can also be quite loud they don't
seem to mind that mm either so that's
awesome also cool I see a question in
chat right now from hit the vape who's
asked if there's any update with
giveaway items the giveaway items have
been in given away no I I took a little
bit longer to follow up on that
it was very this is a very dragged out 1
million subscriber Thank You giveaway
that I've been doing but actually today
I was able to spend some time and work
on those so all of the currently claimed
prize winners have had their info sent
to vendors who will be sending prizes
out I just shipped out today and when
dropped off the computer build in
in a dr. xaviar century 2.0 that I put
together that was that that was the
first prize amazing
yeah so that night got shipped out today
there's still one prize and had not been
claimed it was prize number five and the

lucky number because when I was in
elementary school we each were assigned
a member based on when our name came up
in our roll sheet and I was eight and my
last name is Hanson sir hjs whatever so
it was always my lucky number this
meaning that this show is technically
should be my luckiest show that we've
ever done
cuz got two weeks in heaven yeah and I
won't have another show this lucky until
episode 888 so well I go ahead episode
88 before right that's true I'm yeah I
guess that's true I guess this is it's
times tied for first yeah it feels feels
feels lucky because I mean we haven't
planned the show really at all and I
feel like it's done pretty well it's got
to be that second eighth you know so you
work in a random kind of lucky thing as
well with doing with last names and
stuff what's a sister alright so
completely didn't realize this I just
had a daughter you did name's Hannah
mm-hmm it starts as a nature my sister
was messaging me about a gift for
getting for my mom having the initials
of all of her their granddaughter their
grandkids on them mm-hmm my sister's
kids are Evan and Ian
my last name is Heimlich all right first
three letters are H E I Hana Evan Ian so
and I just completely not intentional
that that happened that we need the
Shamus she sent me a picture of it with
this little thing and it has a little
initials on it I was like hei starting
to spell out like it's building less
anyway it was just saying you should be
five more grandkids all the time so my
other sister who just got married on
Sunday aha she needs to have five kids
oh you wrestle smelly that's her like
you can't have any more your other
sister can't anymore you guys are you
guys are done tapping out already asking
me this like within within so what is
the next one yeah I mean that you got it
you got a nastas obligatory annoying
questions true but I hope I hope you
guys get there I hope she pops out I
hope your sister pops out five kids well
and spells out hime life from all might
because I'm seeing I was seeing
relatives and everything recently and
they all say like it's pretty common for
kids to be about two years apart mm-hmm
because apparently there's there's like
the infant newborn time period that's
really hard and then there's a certain
point where like the kid starts to do
more stuff for like oh your person
yeah and I guess I guess they started
this this time where enough time has
passed where the the parents get decide
like let's do this again yeah so right
there's a transition that occurs but but
right at the beginning like right now
I'm like oh my god why do what I've been
considering is like people who have
twins or triplets or more yeah it's
gotta be I can deal with multiple
entities like doing that of things that
the babies did anyway yeah you gotta
hire someone if that's true all right
get a helper you got a few more got a
few more here cuz they get X 20 bucks
toys for the baby thank you Miss ain't

what's your opinion on ducky keyboards I
like the way they look I've never
actually used one regularly I've never
owned a ducky keyboard but I've heard
very good things but the quality but the
craftsmanship and they used Cherry MX
switches genuine switches most of the
time so uh I like them as much as I can
yeah I'm kind of in the same boat i I've
never had a ducky keyboard but I've used
them before and they're solidly built
you know good good
keyboards I mean a lot of keyboards
they're only as good as the switches
they use and they use a variety switches
but including cherries and I think I
think they have some other ones too but
anyway yeah I've gone to their booth at
Computex yeah oh yeah they're nice tape
on the keyboards next up we have a cell
so why you giving us my own stop it 10
dodge Congrats again Paul I've been
looking at some upgrades to the PC been
making more content in Adobe Premiere
for YouTube I record mostly 1080 60 and
4k 30 what what upgrade should I look at
uh well CPU and memory that's that's
what I did to like 1080 60 4k 30 I try
to do one of the other of those yeah I
mean if you're dealing with a lot of
video files than words in your storage
is probably gonna be be up there if
you're doing a lot of transcoding then
you're gonna want a lot of CPU
horsepower so make sure you have enough
capacity on an SSD to actually edit on
yeah like dump your RAW files and edit
from your SSD and if you can spread the
workload across multiple drives that's
even better so boot off of an SSD and
have your raw footage on a different SSD
don't even use a macam then if you have
another one for your cache yeah that's
better
exactly and vme is really nice I forget
what CPU still has and then of course
you want
didn't he have a six core no 1700 I
think if he's still use in the build
that we made him then that should be
pretty solid for right I think that adds
1700 in it I thought it was an eight
core I'm gonna reach too bad to say you
have to look at the video yeah but if it
is it's crazy how moving from video to
video every week can sort of just
destroy your memory of what you've done
in the past but that's why you can
always look up stuff on YouTube and be
like oh yeah I remember when I did that
thing yes before 512 II guess his bones
you're good and it was a 1700 X you're
smooth sailin a nut in those departments
that's pretty nice yeah but I mean look
at the pricing for one and two terabyte
SSDs has gotten really good yeah just
don't get a 660 P Intel those those are
they get bogged down with heavy reads
and writes and not as good for for video
editing your fun without nvme so what's
your channel name you sell streams on
Twitch just cell processing month which
is cell processing on Twitch yeah and I
still have youtube he does it see how
she would find YouTube ourselves gonna
posted in chat right now it might it
might be so I think he's still
processing across the board oh no no
he's not it might be what is it wasn't
even show the one that he used to do
here's how it is with still so
processing I'm just kidding I know they
made that channel does not exist you're
asking what's the name of the show was
alright point is what was the point
Danner I don't even know this there's he
posted it in chat okay it's suspicious
calm slash Channel / definitely use
capital C 5 5 capital W capital and KJ
and - oh no those I'm gonna get a vanity
URL capitalized or else and everyone got
subscribed to sell he just posted his
YouTube channel and then we're gonna
rates all processing wnj so very rarely
does self-promotion which we appreciate
cuz you know
that's keeping it classy so when it when
the opportunity does come up we like to
point that out okay Bowen yeah
next we have four offices says the 660 P
is fine after the firmware update
it's the qlc which is not great for
heavy loads so yeah that's thank you
decreed with me and disagreed and then
we agreed with me but right questions
let's go to your half of the show yes
Corey yes nine dollars and 80 cents
using OG arctic panther as inspiration I
have a 980 s Li set up but need to
upgrade for a new rig 2080 or ti gret
Steve and mrs. Paul's hardware hmm yeah
I mean the 28 CI is just so freaking
expensive and did you watch the recent -
tech tips video on our TX no I did I
don't always watch Linus tech tips
videos but certain ones keep popping up
and everyone one shows up frequently in
here like right this algorithm just
people idolizes lines well I saw some
people saying it was a good video as
well but anyways about RT X and kind of
the how how it's been eight eight months
now since our TX launched and really
what are people getting for all that
extra money right and yeah yeah yeah the
20/80 probably where you want to go who
what to say there which is also very
expensive but oh yeah yeah Carl bad
five dollars hey Paul I was the guy who
sent you an email about the t-shirt
coming undone at the bottom thanks for
the new one Oh once having wardrobe
setting wardrobe hearing Carl if you're
emailing that to the email address
that's on my store though that would
actually be John who probably got that
and hooked you up with a new one and
Jon's awesome - actually I was on email
responses recently as well when Lauren
Ian Santiago the last one for Falls have
six dollars and 37 cents I was going to
spend this on on a burger soda and fries
instead I seek advice
shall I get a graphics card now 2080 or
wait I have a 2700 X and a GTX 10:50 TI
ooh you really want to upgrade from that
750 Ti I would wait for knobby
because I mean why not it's almost here
yeah wait wait tell Computex and see
what happens there cuz you're looking at
a week a week or two for all of the
those announcements to come out you know
there might be stuff announced there
might be assessment launched we don't
know but you know you you might have
more options or at least you might know
like ah right wait another month and
then and then you'll have more options
beyond that though upgrade that 1050 Ti
if you're not going to drop if you don't
want to drop as much money as you need
to drop like unlike a 2080
then keep an eye out for some like maybe
potentially used 1070 1070 TI or 1080
those are still really good cards and
very good upgrades from a 1050 Ti heck
Finnegan 56 is in Vega 60 forests have
been popping up for absurd prices it's
like you want to write them off like
they're they're useless because they are
at their normal prices but then suddenly
you see one for like pennies 200 bucks
for the Vega 56 or something then okay
well now it's kind of competitive yeah
but yeah there you can find some pretty
good deals on GPUs out there so keep an
eye out you know don't don't don't shy
away too much from you stuff just
reality check yeah yeah let's move on
them all right we're done with my half
of the show thanks for watching guys hit
