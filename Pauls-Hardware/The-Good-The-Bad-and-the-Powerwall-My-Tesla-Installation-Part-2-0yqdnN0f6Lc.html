the sponsor link in the description to
learn more what's up guys how's it going
and welcome back to Pauls hardware
today's video is part 2 of my Tesla
installation it's actually Tesla doing
the powerwall which is a big battery
that backs up the power for your entire
home and there's also going to be solar
installation going on that's being
handled by Solar City they're both
associated companies so I'm gonna be
just sort of taking you guys through the
installation experience today and I
wanted to be upfront about what's going
to be included in this video in the part
1 video I did kind of a vlog and they
updated my main electrical panel
part 2 is gonna be kind of a similar
style to that part of the reason for
that is that there's going to be a two
to six week gap once the installs finish
today where I need to wait for the
utility Southern California Edison to
come inspect it and sign off before the
whole thing can actually be turned on so
I'm gonna do a follow-up video later on
where I talk about stuff like how much
it costs actual use case scenarios show
you guys the app and that kind of thing
today's just going to be the install so
I don't want anyone to get any random
ideas about what actually it's going to
be included that said it is just after 8
a.m. here in Southern California and I
have a few more things to do still
before the crew arrives to do the
installation so I'm gonna get to that
okay here is my backyard once again and
I don't know if you can tell but like
the lawns kind of mode everything's
pretty much the same as it was last time
I showed it to you yes my plastic is
peeling off just a little bit perhaps
but the powerwall
is gonna be installed today to the rates
of this stuff and I think there's a
couple more panels that might go on and
of course the solar is going up on the
roof up there the crew from last week
that did all this did a really good job
and they also were totally cool with me
filming so I'm going to get permission
from the crew this week to do the same
thing once again setup time-lapse over
there I got to get that
going on but I think most importantly
right now before anyone arrives is I
need to make sure that I've picked up
the dog poop so I'm gonna I'm gonna
handle that back inside here and here's
my my stash of equipment for today I
have fortunately I thought ahead and I
charged my hero for up today for the
time lapse pulse got two battery banks
here goes did a fine job keeping this
thing charged to be doing the time lapse
all day last time so I'm gonna do that
again just got backup stuff here for my
rx 105 that I'm using two documents
today's stuff and oh this thing this is
just a little mini tripod by Manfrotto
and I really like it I'm using the
mirror to show you guys it's not
focusing very well and I'm using auto
white balance which is why everything
looks kind of yellow here
this the lighting is really stark right
now but all right time lapse camera
setup once again I've got it in roughly
the same spot that I had it in for last
week backed it up a little bit I made it
go a little bit higher so I can
hopefully get a little bit more of the
roof up there but it's actually already
going I just started it off crew hasn't
arrived yet but in order to keep this
thing powered for now I'm gonna plug it
in just a see inside so it can keep
charging maximize the battery life once
they turn the power off I can switch it
to these power banks and if that if I
really run out of battery which I don't
think it'll happen based on last week
then I can actually get a UPS inside and
plug this into the UPS and still keep it
charging so documentation has begun I
have good news
Tesla has arrived we're on schedule
Doug's reluctance I'd getting angry of
course work area is being set up I'm
very happy they brought an easy up today
actually timing wise they were very very
fortunate for today cuz it is pretty
warm today it's gonna be in the mid mid
80s here in California but it was 95
like a day or two ago and it actually
dropped down so they're just laying
stuff out here and then there's a big
truck out front that has all the solar
panels in it so I'll check that out but
shade this is reminding me that I really
need a patio cover that'll maybe I'll do
that next
garage work log in the future or
something it's all the gear in the truck
you're not loaded Hey look new toys I've
got got the nest and they get a home
gateway so should I should do it at
least give you guys an unboxing of the
nest I think
solar panels your solar panel plugs
plugs in the back is the spec sheet
25 watts per panel inside the puppies
are waiting patiently not really
patiently they're like what the heck's
going on out there
you guys were ok with this last week
great so if you guys will forgive the
drilling and stuff going on outside and
on the roof I have a quick unboxing to
do I wasn't aware of that so this is my
home gateway from solar city this is
part of the the whole solar system and
breeds and reports your systems energy
energy production and ensures everything
is running smoothly so you actually
connect this up to your home router and
that's how the solar grid can accepts a
Quick Start Guide involved in there here
is the actual device itself under here
that's basically just an Ethernet jack
in there and that's pretty much all
there is to it I suppose so like there's
a USB port on the outside so maybe you
can access that for some diagnostics or
something beyond that there's just an AC
power adapter so yeah I get to plug in
one more AC power thing and then a nice
pretty low profile Ethernet cable to
connect it up and this I'm told me needs
to be connected directly to my home
router next up is my nest and this
actually comes you get this free free
all you have to do is spend 30 grand on
it the solar and everything insulation
but alright this is actually gonna be my
very first smart home thing but
basically it's a smart thermostat Nest
has been out for a while so you guys may
or may not be familiar with it but um
let's get this out of the box so
convenient things like automatic
programming of your thermostats don't
cool or heat an empty house if you if
you leave you know it'll turn off that
kind of thing
control the thermostat from remotely on
a phone or a tablet or laptop and of
course hopefully no and then the
internet can hack into it and take
control of my house and determined how
hot or cold I might be that's always the
fear of course with the smart home
internet connected devices but you know
it's the future so we've just gotta just
get a trust trust Google there all right
here is the nest itself and it's got a
skip I don't know what I don't know why
that's covering right there but I'm
gonna leave it on for now
looks like pretty simple connection
points in the back for the wall-mounted
portion of it
we got a booklet here with some brightly
colored documentation that installation
and how it works and all that good stuff
here we have the business end of the
units which has some buttons
I have no idea what these buttons do
fascinating though look it's got a level
so you can level it it's useful too and
of course the connection points here for
for this side of it which looks to be
micro USB and then this proprietary plug
which actually gives the connection to
the base unit wall mounting hardware
this is a metal bracket for the back and
then a plastic bracket which is that's
more of a wall plug tape feel so gives
it a gives it a finished look and it's
installed and then other than that just
just a set of screws in here so a set of
screws and that appears to be pretty
much it oh they did they didn't include
a screwdriver and that a bulbous nest -
screwdriver oh with a flippy Phillips
head and not phillips head things so
that's handy
it has been inboxed over here this hand
Kurt I'm told it's called the Escalera
the stare cat it's a dare climbing hand
Kurt which I guess is specifically made
for this type of installation that's
actually really cool it gets motorized
on the back has gears and the hand crank
cuz let's have to have the ability to go
manual but here's my first look at the
power wall there's the mounting points
on the back it's got a big bracket and
they're working on mounting it right
over here it's gonna be down up against
the ground and then they're gonna need
to run an inverter for the solar grid
and that's gonna be mounted to the wall
right over here there's a their work I
guess standards are sort of being
developed and updated over time for this
type of thing depending on the city and
that kind of thing so you're not
supposed to mount anything above the
battery and that's what Ian burgers
gonna go to so when they're up on the
roof they actually drill into the roof
and they tie in so they're using
climbing equipment this is all for
safety it actually did that even when
they were doing the free pre inspection
check stuff which I approve up and then
when they're done they removed the
tie-downs they do and they hatch it over
with tar or whatever to make it make it
waterproof which is good this is the
hard part I need to run a charge on my
credit card which is a little bit more
than I typically charge on it and I
wanted to call ahead to make sure there
wouldn't be any problems running the
transaction it is fifteen thousand nine
hundred and sixty two dollars and
eighty-eight cents yep it's actually
being installed right now little bit you
- thank you very much oh I forgot to
stay on the line to do the survey I'm
sorry Jase
chasey are very nice justnow that's the
easy part calling to make sure that the
charge is going to go through and now I
actually have to read the church so I'm
gonna be talking about how much this
whole thing cost and if you if you
caught that about sixteen thousand
dollars is what I'm gonna be spending
right now when you get a tesla powerwall
solar installation you pay a $500
deposit and then you pay half when they
begin installation and half when the end
installation so double that amount yes
about thirty two thousand dollars is
what this whole thing is costing however
there's a ten thousand dollar tax credit
at least available right now I believe
it's nationwide in the US I think it's a
federal tax credit so I am going to be
getting a substantial amount of this
back but it's a tax credit so I still to
pay upfront I would almost say that's
the most money I've spent all at one
time but I just recently paid taxes this
year that's right it's very good cause
it's like there's people on the roof
what's going on all right look I've got
some chalk lines down and see the
general that's that's where the solar
ball is gonna go
nore Jerry is gonna give us a quick
rundown of how this is all set up here
so how's this work so weird energized
safe this is your main breaker this
turns on your entire house panel system
okay this is your AC which is not being
backed up by the Tesla system this is
your main 100 a prick it powers up your
gateway which is your your smart brain
system okay this controls everything
this is your transfer switch this
registers if there's a utility power
loss this is where you're capable of
transferring your power back and forth
to the utility to between your solar and
your your battery okay so this is this
is where will will will control
everything right here if you're wanted
at breaker feeds this which powers up
your panel so whatever you turn this
breaker on or off
you're gonna lose power to your gateway
Tesla system okay and you lose power to
all your branch circuits that feed your
house okay testing the parallel all
right so right now we're off grid
we're being powered by the battery only
and
go ahead and turn the main back on
restore utility power he'll take a few
seconds - OH matter of fact it the tesla
powerwall we restored power will take
five minutes before it switches you back
over utility ok to protect itself ok so
you'll have exactly five minutes from
now
it is time to set up the nest oh that's
brilliant okay and then you and then you
just push English you need your that
password and provide this is the nest
keyboard oh really
yeah usually usually you have to do this
this is the alright we have a single
family home - how many dogs we have the
thermostat is in the this is a white
collar
I don't know why I need a detective so
those are the wires that's where they
are existing one on the previous one now
I know what's what heat cool fan and
power guess is your heater yes uh yes
yes gas heater for severe forced air
temperature
she's your eco temperature heats - not
gonna tell people what my wife usually
has a set - yeah
this green leaf that means whatever this
is eco mode out of a state
recommendation I will spend less energy
because it's not gonna cool doesn't want
it no this is a temperature that
everybody can live in kinda need like
one big California yeah we usually
actually have it at 81 yeah you know
I've learned to deal with myself so the
system is functional at this point
firewalls there this is a power wall
gonna work or not until everything's
signed off for by the power wall you
cannot turn it on until you get
permission operating from okay from
Madison alright so for now it's sure
does look pretty
alright guys we have now reached roughly
the end of this video and I'm going to
explain some things because I didn't get
quite as far along today as was
originally expected the main reason for
that is that my roof they've determined
is not quite in top shape it's not like
my roofs falling apart but it's looking
like it's probably gonna be due for
replacement based on their assessment
within the next sprout
two two three four years and if you
install a solar grid on top of that it
makes it much more of a pain in the butt
to go in and fix any roofing problems
you might have first off the roof
situation is something that Tesla said
is usually assessed and they would tell
me upfront so that was something that
they said should have been notified
earlier about but as a result they are
actually going to fix my roof for me
they are gonna redo the roof where the
solar array would be like free of charge
which i think is pretty cool
honestly I don't mind waiting a little
bit longer for something like that and I
definitely agree that fix the roof first
before putting the solar panels on top
that's definitely the way to go so if
you're considering something like a
tesla powerwall solar installation is
something like that definitely they're
gonna check your roof maybe check your
roof yourself bear in mind it's
something that you'll probably want to
have up-to-date before you put solar on
top of it but all that said they're
going to be getting back to me later
today about options for the roof and
we're probably going to have the whole
roof redone and they're going to cover
the part of it that's the solar array
would be on so I guess I'm probably
gonna do follow-up video on the roof
going it but they did install a decent
amount of hardware today's you maybe saw
so we actually have the inverter here
for the solar panel so this is where the
sunlight will go and through here and
that's got its own deal and I can
instantly turn that on or off look I've
got a power wall yeah so the ultimate
upshot for today is that my electrical
system has been expanded I still have
power and everything so I'm going to go
for now no solar panels yet and they
gave me the option to leave the solar
panels here or take them with them I
decided to have them take them with them
just because they're already out by the
truck so I'll bring them back when they
do that installation one last thing I
did want to bring up though before I go
here is that if any of you are
considering getting a powerful like this
one it used me as a referral I only just
discovered this today but if I can refer
five people to get a power wall from
Paul's Hardware then I get I get a power
wall I get a red special edition power
wall
and I can add it to this one and then I
can have more battery which is kind of
exciting so if any of you guys go sign
up for Tesla I'll see if I can get more
information or if I can do a direct link
or something like that but I think you
just put pulsar where for the referral
hey if you guys do that I'll be very
happy with you and and maybe I'll get a
red powerball in the future it is bright
out here this morning hey guys this is a
second outro you get a double outro for
this video so I wanted to update because
powerwall has actually been installed
for a couple weeks now and as I
mentioned in the first video they
determined that the roof needs an
upgrade that has been scheduled now but
it had to be scheduled for the first
week of May it's gonna be a few more
weeks until I can bring you guys a final
installation video and then of course
after that a testing video where I go
over how much it costs and whether it
was worth it and all that kind of stuff
so I wanted to give some kind of closure
for this video and for that purpose I
have wow it's great can you guys see
okay
tada a new umbrella so happy such an
upgrade thanks for watching this video
guys hit the thumbs up button if you
enjoyed it we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
