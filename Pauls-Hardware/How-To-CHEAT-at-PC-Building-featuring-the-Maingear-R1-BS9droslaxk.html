click the sponsor link in the
description for more information so
about a month ago sometime after the
Rison launch AMD hit me up and asked if
I wanted to take a look at a risin build
from main gear I was well confused at
first you already build the Rison system
with main gear I asked no they said
they'll send the system over already
built needless to say I was a little bit
confused but it turns out that to get a
nice desktop gaming PC you don't
necessarily need to put it together
yourself main gear is just one of quite
a few boutique system builders who will
build a customized system to the specs
that you choose test it pack it up and
ship it to you so you can be robbed of
the joy of building it yourself with
your own two hands even if your hands
end up getting a bit bloodied in the
process
cheating is what I call it but I suppose
I can take a quick look at the build
that they sent since it is from their
special edition r1 line and it does have
a rise in 7 1800 X CPU and 2 GTX 1080s
and sli with a green Razer theme and a
nicely done custom liquid cooling loop
now to be honest I had no idea they were
sending a custom water-cooled system I
was expecting something that was a
little bit more off-the-shelf but given
the size and weight of the shipment I
should have probably been tipped off
manger does a really nice job with their
packing though and you'll get a massive
outer box with extra padding for the
qisas retail box that's inside you'll
also find accessories here which for me
included a nice main gear t-shirt a
corsair bag with all the extra cables
from the sleeved power supply cable kit
that they used an external slim DVD
burner
strangely enough but ok I guess and a
dossier which held relevant accessories
such as screws and SATA cables a
Kingston USB Drive loaded up with a
Windows recovery image which is very
nice to have a main gear mousepad a
remote for the RGB LEDs inside and
documentation but the very new PC user
friendly with a simple yet detailed
QuickStart guide and a QA sheet showing
all the steps and checks that your main
gear tech went through when building and
setting up the system my builder was
Sean
thanks Shawn good job inside the bigger
box is your actual case box and NZXT h
440 razer edition in this case lol even
I could tell the shipment got bounced
around a bit everything inside was
pretty much just fine
main gear uses form-fitted foam that's
inside the system itself during shipping
that keeps stuff safe and there is a
warning message on the side panel when
you first take it off that tells you to
remove all that stuff inside so the
system unpacked and safety foam removed
I can finally check out the build and oh
my god is it a pretty one core
components again are the AMD risin 7
1800 x8 core CPU and 2 GTX 1080s from
nvidia and sli with a main gear high
bandwidth sli bridge I like the contrast
with the silver finish on the MSI X 370
X power gaming titanium motherboard
provides the memory is a couple Kingston
HyperX fury ddr4 8 gig sticks so 16 gigs
tolerated for 2666 speed and for storage
there is a samsung 960 pro 512 gig and
vmin dot to SSD and a 2 terabyte Seagate
notebook hard drive the power supply is
a corsair ax 860 i with the sleeved
cable kit and the case again is the envy
XD h 440 razer edition with green under
glow and glowing razor and main gear
logos on the front and PSU cover
respectively water cooling is handled
with components from ek bits power and
cool ek handles to cpu with the
supremacy evil a m4 edition CPU block
GPUs with full cover clear acrylic
blocks and chrome finish reflective back
plates that really looks nice with the
MSI motherboard in there and then the
DDC X res combo pumping reservoir sits
towards the front of the case and it
contains most of the loops green dyed
liquid from a coolant main here went
with bits powers excellent soft tubing
compression fittings throughout the
build and they also throw in a couple
quick disconnect fittings from coolants
at the GPU Assembly's Inlet and outlet
which should be pretty helpful for a
future disassembly or maintenance I also
like that there's a ton of room above
the reservoir to access it for recently
loop or topping it off rounding out the
loop we have two three hundred sixty
millimeter radiators at the top and the
front with air flow provided by seven
thermal takes green LED hundred and
twenty millimeter fans build quality
throughout the system is superb cable
management is expert level looks very
clean and even though this was rough
handled in shipping the loop
completely topped off and leak-free
thank goodness that's her performance I
would expect it to be pretty nice given
this hardware configuration in the
cooling so here's some test numbers for
you guys enjoy
as for noise even under full load this
system remains very quiet and that is
one of the bonuses of water cooling
here's a test
now if I had a critique of this r1
special-edition system from manger it is
definitely going to be the cost
everything costs more than you would pay
it retail when you buy a system like
this for instance you could select the
1700 X when parting out the system 1700
X retail cost 399 if you upgrade to an
1800 X though using their configurator
it should cost 100 bucks more they'll
charge you a hundred fifty bucks more
that is the up charge when configuring
your system and those examples exist
throughout all the different selections
you might choose when upgrading to
better parts I tried to configure this
exact build that I have here on main
gears website but I couldn't choose all
the exact components that I actually
used in this system so even though I
only choose the single chose a single GT
X 1080 and I did choose hardline to be
notice that it's soft tubing
but the price they issued me was five
thousand five hundred and twenty nine
dollars I parted out a built on PC part
picker with pretty much the same
components even a CPU liquid cooler and
a full Windows license granted it was
not a full custom water cooling loop so
bear that in mind but the cost there was
about two thousand seven hundred and
fifty dollars any way you slice it your
going to be paying a lot more for the
full boutique experience a smoke level
as well but just aesthetically the
system is very much tied to the Green
theme meaning that the RGB strip that
they put back here only really works
when it's set to complimentary colors
which is basically green or the sort of
greenish yellow that I have selected
right here basically there weren't many
options finally I would have liked to
see some out-of-the-box overclocking
even with this awesome cooling loop in
place the GPUs and CPU are still running
it stuck unless you go in those settings
yourself pros are there of course though
for instance you're going to get
lifetime angelic service labor and phone
support with any manger system that you
buy and that is definitely a big value
especially for anyone who's not familiar
with building or setting up their own
system you also get a one-year
comprehensive warranty on the system
itself and you can extend that to two or
three years by paying an extra hundred
bucks a year you also get the entire
system delivered to you built and ready
to go
and that is saying something as well the
amount of labor that would go into a
build like this is definitely worth some
money
so that's something to consider
ultimately though I'm sure there's lots
of you guys out there who watch my
channel who would never buy a system
like this simply because you know how to
put it together yourself that said
there's also tons of people who want to
get into PC gaming who are interested in
high-end builds who just aren't that
into building the system themselves and
it's great to have an option like this
for folks who can afford it and for
folks who want the peace of mind of
having the warranty as well as the
service available for main gear then
they are a very reputable company
excellent track record very positive
reviews and I'm confident that as long
as you're willing to pay the price for
it you would be happy if you happen to
buy a main gear system all that said I'd
like to hear you guys feedback of what
you think about a boutique system versus
building yourself obviously there might
be pros and cons that I left out here so
leave me those comments down in the
comment section below
it's thumbs up button if you enjoyed
this video and stay tuned for more
videos of course coming very soon on
pulse hardware thanks again for watching
guys
we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
