my coverage of CES 2017 I want to start
off of course by thanking my sponsors
for this event gigabyte OCC a Toshiba
company as well as deep cool now I'm
over here at fantex because they invited
us to share their case that they've been
working on for the last two freaking
years they've had this in development
they were almost ready at Computex last
year and we actually gave you guys a
sneak preview of it then it is ready
they have said it's launching and
available for sale it might take a
little bit of time to see it in at
retailers but you should be able to buy
this case the end to Elite for $900
coming towards the end of q1 so February
March timeframe now I'm going to kind of
try to go down as many of the features
of this case as possible bear in mind
this is a quick overview but it's still
going to take several minutes now first
off it's huge of course this thing
weighs about 72 pounds and it's designed
so that you can actually install
everything while it's sitting upright
because you don't want to take a case
this large and have to lay it down and
bring it back up and all that kind of
stuff so for instance a lot of the trays
in here and brackets that can hold
radiators can be removed so you can
still install everything outside and
then put it back in this beautiful build
that the folks at fantex put together
they said they put together with the
entire thing sitting upright so that was
pretty cool now going over just some of
the general features you of course are
probably noticing the LED lighting they
have a really awesome look and strip
going down the right side kind of tucked
away underneath and down across the
front it has sort of a extra piece down
here that seems to be holding the rest
of it sort of hovering out over the rest
of it at rest of the the bracket which
is the base stands on which I think
looks pretty cool and then of course a
massive tempered glass window here which
can now be opened via a simple hinge you
can also lift it up and off that hinge
if you need to which is also pretty cool
there's a bit of ventilation across this
piece of the tempered glass side panel
as well and then inside you can see
there's two main chambers a lower
chamber down here an upper chamber upper
chamber above of course and then on the
bottom you can fit massive radiators I'm
going to forget the radiator support I'm
gonna have to look off to the side and
remember on the bottom you can fit a 480
millimeter radiator you can also fit a
480 on the top you can also fit a 560 on
the front which is a 4
or by 140 which is not a radiator size
as I work with very often which is what
I can't just rattle that off but anyway
now all the RGB LEDs on this case are in
sync as you may notice and in fact you
have not only the strip's that are on
the case themselves but you have the
motherboard you also have elements
inside the case including the new fantex
water blocks which also have LEDs that
are integrated into them you can take
all those LEDs feed them back and be a
splitter connect them all up so you can
have one plug to go into a motherboard
that way you can control everything in
synchronization or you can use a front
panel right up here to control
everything via this little flip up panel
now front panel IO you actually have two
sets because you can potentially install
two systems in this in this chassis you
can do a large full-size ATX or larger
size motherboards also supported up top
you can also do a mini ITX system down
in the lower part and for that you just
need to swap in this little tray gives
you a mini ITX mount now because there's
two potential computers inside you
actually have two sets of i/o so a
couple USB 3.0 s for each potential
system HDMI in front so your V already
if you have a VR headset a USB type-c
connector up there which is just really
handy to have and then of course mic and
headphone for both systems you also have
reset button and then you have an LED
controller up here too which is one of
the fanciest ones I've actually seen not
only can you control all the different
potential colors that the LED might be
via this top section but then you can
tap through this and go through some
different effects you can possibly put
together so if you don't have the
ability to control the LEDs behave your
motherboard or software you can simply
write it up to the case directly and
control it all from the front now I
already told you about radiator support
for the top front and bottom but you can
actually this is a multi-use crossbeam
panel here I already said you can swap
in a mini ITX motherboard tray you can
also swap in a radiator right there so
you can fit an additional 480 and then
you might notice back behind the
reservoir right there there's a bunch of
little panels those are little
individual panels like this and they can
be swapped out independently depending
on how you want to configure it you can
use them as SSD mounts and they have one
right there or you can just use it to
cover up if you're not actually
utilizing that area just to give it a
cleaner look overall there is another
bracket you can swap in there
fact I have it right here this will
allow you to add an additional 360
radiator as well so obviously you can
install all of those radiators I
mentioned at the same time but it does
give you the flexibility if you want to
do an insane water-cooled system as you
see right here to put them wherever the
hell you might want to the other cool
thing about those back panels there is
on the opposite side the rear panel
which is actually fairly easy to remove
and put back on actually designed it so
you can just set the panel down on the
same level plane that the cases on and
it just sort of lines up and you pop it
to the side and then you can secure it
with some captured thumb screws there's
also a removable panel right there that
you can pop off to allow for exhaust if
you do happen to install a radiator
going that way and that is a pretty cool
look because you can put the fans right
on there and if you have LED fans or
something like that
well you could route those up to the
system as well and have more RGB LEDs
because lord knows there's not enough of
them top panel here also has a swappable
piece so you can have a complete
all-in-one unit that kind of covers
everything and prevents noise from
getting out but of course blocks air or
you can use the one they're using right
now which has a magnetic removable dust
filter that easily fits over the top for
your exhaust up on the fronts there is a
power switch that's also dual sided so
of course two systems so that power
switch needs to go either way now you
might also notice that the GPUs here are
angled 90 degrees so you can get a
better look at the fluid flowing through
them and of course there's a beautiful
fantex GPU blocks that they have on
there that can be done via this somewhat
elegant panel but basically it's just
the rear PCIe expansion or PCI expansion
bracket that you install and it gives
you a riser bracket that will allow you
to stall and still I believe two-way SLI
configurations or crossfire
configurations and make them look all
pretty like that with the ninety degree
rotated orientation here is the cable
management area and it is fairly dark
here so sorry for that but hopefully you
guys can get a look
another thing that fantex wanted to do
with this case is make sure that every
bit of space even though this thing's
massive is used in some way and if
you're not going to use it you can cover
it up and make it look aesthetically
pleasing but they really want everything
to be functional so massive CPU
backplate cut out
like that for wide range of CPU sockets
there's also a panel right here which I
believe is multi-purpose they've added
some additional cable tie downs in
various places so you can keep
everything looking nice and clean
there's a fixed pump mount down here at
the bottom so you can put a fan Tech's
pump as well I believe it has
compatibility with other pumps as well
okay but there's they're shaking their
heads like no don't use other pumps use
Fanta these fantex pumps the power this
isn't a fantasy level it's alright don't
worry about it it but fantex pumps are
good to EVGA power supply I'm sorry EVGA
this is a power supply back here at the
back of course there's two mounts for
power supplies here at the rear area and
then you can shove some cables up in
here there's actually plenty of space
for that as you might expect then you
also have a couple more SSD mounts over
on this side that's what those are right
okay
double-checking and then I don't think I
mentioned but there are two fan hubs
that are also included here both the PWM
both can control up to six fans so
basically unless you are doing more than
twelve fans in this case you should need
to add an additional splitter or
anything like that
now while fantex was working on the end
to elite obviously they had tons of free
time so they decided to develop this
prototype case this is currently known
as project two one seven the one we're
actually looking right here is the two
one seven s which is slightly smaller
but the two one seven they have actually
over there by the TV it's kind of dark
but we do have some nice footage of it
this is kind of geared towards more
being I don't say it's like a home
theater PC but it's meant to integrate
seamlessly with a home theater
environment so if you want to take your
games out of your your man cave or
wherever you sit and play video games
all the time bring them out into the
living room possibly set up something
like a VR configuration or anything like
that you might want a much more powerful
system out in your living room so the
basic concept from our understanding of
this design is that you can sort of move
it around any way that you want and it
will still look good so only at the back
here they actually have a couple routing
holes for the cables to come out beyond
that the top here is tempered glass
piece opposite side is also a tempered
glass piece they have a nice clean
finish with grey here across the front I
asked them and they said yes they're
also
to potentially do a black version of
this so if you want it to really mesh
with your entire home theater system and
you have all black which is very common
with that sort of thing it will now
these are both mini ITX cases the larger
size over there in the two one seven is
going to support larger radiators I
believe a 280 radiator well it will
support so they are geared towards water
cooling so you can make a really cool
looking system water cool it overclocked
it make it whatever you want to do and
then put it in your living room and have
a really cool showpiece but I mean not
just your living room I can imagine lots
of people having this onion on their
desk for example and the fact that you
can take the whole thing and make it
vertically oriented instead of
horizontally oriented means you got a
much smaller footprint like on your desk
with a really cool looking case now
there's not a whole lot of other details
about this right now they have shown us
in some of the design aesthetics that
they have done as far as like taking the
mini ITX motherboard put in at the top
they have sort of our horizontal bar
here right across just below where the
ITX motherboard sits that's we're going
to write your cables pass them through
to some channels that are going to go
that back here which are pretty much
completely covered up and you can't see
them they have a couple SSD mounts that
are also hidden on either side of this
and that's that's for the most part what
we know there are some more details but
I'm sure this is going to be forthcoming
they're expecting this to come out right
around Computex time this year so maybe
if we go to Computex in Taiwan we'll be
able to show you guys just like the m2
elites the finish version of project two
one seven and two one seven s as well so
let us know in the comments what you
think of these new concept cases let us
know how many of the enthu elites you're
going to buy Kyle's recommendation was
five I think that's perhaps I think
that's one too many I think you should
buy four and two elites and two elites
at minimum now I can't leave you guys
without at least pointing out and giving
some homage to the 8-pack version of the
anthalie that's back behind me that he
actually built this in one of the
earlier prototypes of the enthu lead and
we showed that off at Computex and it
should it's it's a ridiculous system
it's got a 3-way SLI configuration it's
got three separate water cooling loops
it's got a ton of like custom acrylic
work with channels for all the fluid to
go through and he's using Mayhem's
forget what to them the mayhem is one
that has that texture to it so it looks
really cool and you can actually order
these and have them made and sent to you
for the low low price of what set 30 mm
30 mm US dollars so if if 900 bucks for
the or you can spend just the low price
of nine hundred dollars which seems very
reasonable by comparison and build your
own but I mean honestly what a pack did
with this thick thing behind me is
absolutely insane so hope you guys
appreciate that as well finally how are
they going to ship these big old and
delete cases that look like you could
fit a human body inside or perhaps just
maybe more sensible use as a footlocker
after you move the remove the case out
of it but very premium in every respect
and I really like what enthu has done
with I'm sorry what fantex has done with
the m2 elites anyway it's the end of the
day at Computex so we're getting pretty
tired I'm going to end this video and
ask you guys to hit the thumbs up button
if you if you enjoyed it also big thank
you to my sponsors
once again gigabyte deep cool as well as
OCZ a Toshiba Company thanks for
watching guys and we'll see you very
soon with more Computex I'm sorry CES
