cards shiny new NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660s
and although they're launched today
Thursday was somewhat expected since the
1660 TI RT debuted last month starting
price of two hundred and twenty dollars
for entry-level Adhan board versions of
the 1660 should make it very appealing
to a lot of gamers out there it still
has six gigs of VRAM although it is
slower gddr5 and it will only be
available in third-party ad in board
variants like these the gtx 1660 gaming
x from msi the gtx 1660 XC from EVGA and
the gtx 1660 windforce OC from gigabyte
the corsair one is a gaming pc for
people who want maximum performance with
a minimal footprint don't let the size
fool you though there's a core I 999
hundred K CPU and an RT X xx atti in the
corsair 1i 160 kept chilly with
convection assisted cooling and separate
closed loops for the CPU and GPU there's
also a corsair 1i 140 with an i7 9700 K
and an RT X 2080 so click the sponsor
link in the video description to learn
more so what's the difference between a
gtx 1660 and a gtx 1660 TI they are both
based on the 12 nanometer touring t1 1:6
GPU which does not include our TX
capabilities so no RT cores no hardware
support for ray tracing or D LSS like
you get with our TX cards which honestly
isn't a huge loss in my opinion so the
main difference is fewer streaming multi
processor units and CUDA cores 22 SMS on
the 16 60 versus 24 on the ti 1408 CUDA
cores down from 1536 on the ti and then
you have slower 8000 megahertz effective
gddr5 vram on the 16 60 versus faster
12000 megahertz effective GDD r 6 on the
TI and either case the GPU has 6 32-bit
memory controllers for a 192 bit bus and
the default base and loose clock are
also a bit faster on the 16 60 at 1530
and 1785 megahertz respectively as
compared to the TI which starts at a
base clock of 1500 and a boost of 1770
so all these cards I have here are
manufacturer overclocked versions with
boost clocks bumped up to 1830
supplemental board power is provided by
an 8 pin PCI Express graphics power
connector and my gigabyte and MSI cards
have 3 DisplayPort 1 point
four outs and one hdmi 2.0 B and then
the EVGA goes with Nvidia's reference
specs for video outs which is one HDMI
one DisplayPort and one DVI these cards
do not have USB type-c for virtual link
support but board partners do have the
option to add that if they want
so speaking of these three cards they
all have their unique qualities starting
with the EVGA 1660 XC which is actually
a three slot card this allows it to stay
pretty short and only about seven and a
half inches long but there is a big fat
thin stack underneath that cooler thanks
to the third slot we also have a single
cooling fan and unfortunately no back
plates
I think this card will be great for some
mini ITX builds where card lengths can
be an issue but definitely not actually
for some mini ITX builds where the third
slot might conflict with the power
supply which is the case in a lot of
smaller cases out there so just bear in
mind when you're picking your case if
you go with this card that it is a
slightly different form factor although
I applaud EVGA for going for something
that's a little bit more different and
unique this one's going to go for $230
which is $10 more than the base price
for the 1660 but EVGA said there will
also be a $10 million rebate available
at launch the MSI Ventus excess is next
and this will also be a $230 gtx 1660
msi has done with a 2 slot design for
this one and they have also added a
backplate which is plastic but actually
think it looks quite nice not bad at
least four plastic backplate it's got
sort of a faux brushed metal finish and
it kind of wraps around to meet up with
the shroud that is on the heatsink which
also sports a single copper heat pipe
and a toothed fan cooler this card
measures at 8 inches long so still
pretty short and pretty compact and
again just an 8 pin PCI Express power
connector finally we have the gigabyte
gtx 1660 windforce OC and this one will
sell for the MSRP of 220 dollars and
it's a 2 slot design much like the msi
it does come in a bit longer at about 8
and 7/8 inches long but that's still
about an inch shorter than the width of
most standard ATX motherboards so I
think in most systems that length isn't
going to be a conflict issue it does
also have a wraparound backplate on the
back with a gigabyte logo and a bit of
3d texture that also kind of matches up
with the shroud on the front so I
thought that was a pretty nice design
and again we have an aluminum thin stack
with a single copper heat pipe providing
some extra heat dissipation from the GPU
now lastly I wanted to point out card
height or the
amount of height that's above the
pci-express bracket and for that one the
EVGA actually comes in as the shortest
the gigabyte would be a bit in the
middle it is a bit taller than the
bracket but then the msi one is
definitely the tallest of the three so
my first order of business for testing
is to see which of these three cards I
like the best to do further testing to
compare against the other benchmarks
that I have to do this I set up two
tests the 3d mark times by burnin tests
that loops for about 20 minutes to get a
measure of temperature as well as clock
speeds and then the fire strike ultra
run so I can get some scores that I can
compare against each other these are all
using the same GPU so the
differentiating factors should be those
operating temperatures and sustained
clock speeds also bear in mind when it
comes to base and boost clock speeds all
three of these at least according to
gpu-z were running at the same frequency
15 30 base clock 18 30 boost clock the
EVGA GTX 16 60 XC had an average
temperature of 70 degrees Celsius a max
temperature of 74 degrees Celsius
average clock speed of about 1854 and a
max clock speed of 1965 system power
during the time spy burning test was 184
watts on average and then when I ran
3dmark fire strike ultra at the graphics
core was 2742 MSI GTX 1660 Ventus excess
had an average temperature of 70 and a
max temp of 74 pretty much the same
temps as the EVGA card average clock
speed was 1858 just a few ticks faster
and the max clock speed was 1965 exactly
the same system power draw was actually
a little bit less than hundred and
seventy eight watts and the 3dmark fire
strike ultra graphics core was 27:41
finally the gigabyte gtx 1660 wind force
OC had an average temperature of 68
degrees which was the coolest of the
three max temp of 74 which was identical
to the other two average clock speed of
1856 which was right in between max
clock speed in 1995 which gives it the
wind for max clock speed system power
job 181 watts and then a 3dmark fire
strike ultra graphics core of 2763 all
of these are within a margin of error of
each other and I'm not gonna say that
one of these cards is necessarily better
than the others because the scores were
so close but given the three results
that I have I'm gonna go with the
gigabyte card for further testing so for
those benchmarks I just talked about and
the upcoming ones all of them were run
on the test system which is back there
in the corner which features an Intel
Core I 999 hundred K
at 4.8 gigahertz and a Zaraki through 90
Taichi ultimate motherboard a cooler
master ml 360 our RGB all-in-one liquid
cooler 16 gigs of g.skill Trident Z RGB
ddr4 memory running at 3200 speed with
casa latency 14 a samsung 970 pro 512
gig nvme SSD and EVGA supernova g3 650
watt 80 plus gold rated power supply and
Windows 10 64 bit all the tests were run
in the Leanne Lee PCO 11 dynamic white
tempered glass case with the side panels
on and I was running Nvidia driver for
19.3 5 for comparison GPUs I have the
GTX 1066 gigabyte and that's the
gigabyte g1 gaming version which is
manufacturer overclocked running in
about 1950 megahertz the AMD Radeon rx
598 gig and the NVIDIA GeForce r-tx 2060
that said here are the benchmarks first
test here is 3d mark firestrike ultra
and the 1660s core 229 62 with a graphic
score of 27 63 and here you might look
at that rx 590 score and say hey Paul RX
590 is looking pretty good there but
also compare the 16 60 TI here and bear
in mind that this was the one test that
was somewhat anomalous when it comes to
my 16 60 TI tests and it's not going to
be represented as we move along so next
we have 3d mark x by extreme which is a
DirectX 12 test and here where you can
see where Nvidia has made some real
biggie gains when it comes to
asynchronous compute performance 1660
scores 27:10 with the graphics score of
25 o2 which beats out the RX 590 by
about 380 points and sort of sits right
between that rx 590 score and the gtx
660ti here's 3d mark VR mark Blue Room
which is a VR tests we have an average
score as well as a frames per second
score the 1660 scored 17 27 which
handily beats out the RX 590 which comes
in at 13 55 and here also I'd like to
point out that gtx 1066 gig if you got
one of those a couple years ago and
you're considering an upgrade there's a
pretty nice increase in performance here
when you compare that to the 1660 next
its ashes of the singularity escalation
also DirectX 12 tests were running at
2560 by 1440 here and the GTX 1660 has
37.7 average frames per second again
beating at the RX 590 was 33.5 which had
just barely beat out the 1066 year with
33.4 if we move over to 1920 by 1080
the 1660s
scores 42.7 average frames per second
again beating out the RX 590 with 38.7
here shadow of the Tomb Raider our last
two DirectX 12 test and the GTX 1660 got
46 average frames per second running at
2560 by 1440 rx 590 had a better
performance here but still wasn't able
to beat it as it came in just one FPS
short at 45 60 and 60 TI had a nice lead
here with 55 FPS of course if you want
the most performance out of any of these
cards you're gonna have to go with the
Archie X 2060 but that costs three
hundred and fifty dollars if you look at
1920 by 1080 the 1660 jumps up to 71 FPS
on average and gains a little bit more
of a lead over the rx 590 which had at
66 frames per second here's GTA 5 which
remains one of the top 10 games played
on Steam which is why I continue to run
benchmarks of it at 2560 by 1440 we have
75 average frames per second for the GTX
1660 which is a very nice performance if
you're playing on a 1440 monitor and
you're looking for about a 60 Hertz
refresh rate I think that would be a
pretty good experience for you
of course if you move over to 1920 by
1080 you can get more frames hundred and
thirteen average frames per second for
the 1660 beating out the RX 590 with 95
and coming in just between the RX 590
and the 1660 ti here's overwatch and at
2560 by 1440 we have 95 average frames
per second for the GTX 1660 again just
edging out that rx 590 which came in at
92 fps and here again just a slight edge
over the 1066 gig so it's gonna depend
on which game you're playing when it
comes to performance improvements over
the last generation of cards some will
have more of a game than others if we
move over to 1920 by 1080 we have 143
average frames per second for the GTX
1660 136 average FPS for the RX 590 our
final test is Metro Exodus and this is
also DirectX 12 so I guess I lied to you
guys earlier but point being that at
2560 by 1440 we have 31.9 average frames
per second for the 1660 and bear in mind
this is a very intense test not
necessarily representative of the
performance you would get in game it's
gonna be lower FPS in the benchmark run
than the game itself so just bear that
in mind but here is an example of a game
where the RX 590 is shining a bit more
and actually beats out the 1660 34.5
average frames per second and here was
where the rx 5
he also gave the 1660 Ti the greatest
run for its money if we move over to
1920 by 1080 we see similar performance
41.5 average frames per second for the
1660 the RX 590 beats it out was forty
four point six average FPS but the 1660
Ti beats them both with forty five point
three so to sum up the gtx 1660 provides
a lot of gaming performance at 1080 or
1440 and it beats out the RX 590 in most
of my tests not all of them but most of
them just as the 1660 TI did so for two
hundred and twenty dollars i think this
will definitely be the new go to
graphics card for budget builds and
we'll have to see if AMD is going to
respond with price drops for the RX 575
80 or 590 if you're wondering why i
didn't include the 570 or 580 in my
benchmark results one I literally only
had today to make this video and two if
it's beating the 590 it's gonna beat the
570 and 580 as well I only tested three
variants of the 1660 today though so I'm
sure there's gonna be a lot more out
there with varying features and price
ranges some of them with RGB and stuff
too but who cares about that we want
performance not aesthetics but the end
result is a very viable new GPU option
for people who are looking to spend a
little over $200 with notable gains
versus the previous generation if I have
any complaints about the gtx 1660 other
than the name which i'm still
complaining about 1860 TI and everything
it would be that I think Nvidia could
have launched these GPUs last year
sometime since right now we're looking
at touring and touring without our TX
which is what these cards have is
basically volta which should have
launched like last year but anyway I'll
post links to these cards in the video
description below let me know in the
comments if you're gonna pick up a 1660
if you are which one you might be
interested in and of course like and
subscribe if you enjoyed this video
