brand-new fractal design define our five

the link in the description for more
information
excellent hello everyone in today's
video we're going to talk about SSDs and
how to benchmark them and also be
featuring this Samsung 850 Evo 250
gigabyte SSD because it's new and fast
this tutorial is intended for beginners
though so apart from assuming that you
have a basic working knowledge of
computers and what a computer is I will
start with some SSD terminology basics
just so you know what the heck I'm
talking about for the rest of the video
so an SSD is a solid-state drive it
stores your precious bits of data onto
what is known as NAND flash modules
which have no moving parts and can be
very very fast this is the same basic
storage technology that is in a USB
thumb drive for example or the built-in
storage on your smartphone but manned
alone does not an SSD make it needs to
be incorporated with some other elements
before it can be wedged into your
desktop or laptop PC the form factor is
important that's the physical size and
shape of the drive and for SSDs right
now that's most commonly the 2.5 inch
form factor that has been used for some
time just like the 850 Evo here other
SSDs use the M SATA or PCIe form factor
which you may have also seen m2 is the
new form factor this is formally known
as ng FF physical compatibility here is
determined by a width which is the width
that way as well as the length which is
the length that way this Plextor m6e for
example is an m2 20 to 80 drive which
means it's 22 millimeters wide and 80
millimeters long I have another video
that's all about m2 since it's still
pretty new so feel free to check that
out if you want more information on m3
specifically so you'll need to check the
form factor to make sure that the drive
you're looking at will fit into your
system or your laptop but you also want
to check the connector 2.5 inch drives
still use the standard SATA connector
which is very common and the m2
connector is determined by the drives
width which is 22 millimeters for the
one I just showed you as well as the
keying again more on
and my m2 video the protocol refers to
the communication standard between the
drive and the rest of your system again
SATA is the standard here although PCI
Express drives are becoming more popular
every day the protocol will determine
how much bandwidth is available for the
drive to use to communicate so the SATA
revision 3 protocol that's prevalent
right now has 6 gigabits per second of
available bandwidth between the drive
and your system also keep in mind here
that when we talk about theoretical
bandwidth such as what is available via
SATA Rev 3 we use a raw bit rate to
refer to what's possible 6 gigabits per
second but when we refer to the actual
benchmarks that we're measuring
measurable data throughput will refer to
it using bytes so you'll see 500
megabytes per second for example 8 bits
make a byte just in case you didn't know
there are also a few internal elements
to the drive to point out the connector
will route over to the drives controller
which as the name implies controls the
data being written to or read from the
NAND and it also handles stuff like
garbage collection and we're leveling
that I'm not going to delve into today
some drives will also add a DDR memory
chip next to the controller for caching
purposes but for caching this 850 Evo
actually uses part of its own built-in
NAND but it sets it into SLC mode so
that brings us back to the NAND which is
where the bits of data are actually
stored and the NAND is what makes this
850 Evo so special first of all Samsung
has developed a way to stack layers and
layers of NAND flash on top of each
other so even though the chips inside
this drive look quite flat they're
actually 3d inside 3d vertical Nan's
like this is very new but it also
represents a big leap forward for
solid-state storage Samsung introduced
3d v-nand with the 850 Pro which stored
2 bits of data in each available cell
within the NAND flash that's also known
as mlc or multi-level cell NAND as
opposed to the much faster but also very
expensive SLC or single-level cell NAND
that's mostly used in enterprise and
server environments and military
applications that sort of thing the 850
Evo has TLC or triple level cell man
meaning it stores 3 bits of data in each
cell which also makes it more
cost-effective to produce
so altogether that's triple level cell
3-dimensional vertical NAND technology
and you can use it to store your cat
pictures to sum up the terminology
section of this video though I would say
that the form factor and connector
determined the physical compatibility of
the drive the protocol determines how
much available bandwidth the drive has
and then the speed of both the
controller and the NAND flash itself is
what determined how fast the SSD can
actually perform so now that you know
how to talk about an SSD let's say you
want to benchmark your brand-new SSD to
see if it actually hits those impressive
numbers advertised on the retail box I'm
going to focus on the typical SATA
experience with my 850 Evo now but most
of this will also apply to m dot 2 or
PCIe drives as well benchmarking
preparation will involve plugging the
drive into your computer and booting up
remember that your motherboard also has
a controller and you'll need to set that
controller to the right mode you'll get
the best performance by connecting to
the native controller on your
motherboard which for my system back
here is part of the x99 chipset you also
might have a z97 chipset or a 990 FX
chipset for example on the AMD side that
can also control your SATA ports so make
sure you're connecting to a SATA
revision 3 6 gigabit per second port
check your motherboard manual if you
need to or else you might bottleneck
your new SSD boot into the UEFI BIOS
section of your motherboards UEFI BIOS
and to find your SATA controller
settings make sure it's using a HCI mode
or RAID mode will also work here but
honestly there's no need to go into RAID
mode if you're not also setting up a
raid array just stick with AHCI just
don't use IDE also keep in mind here
that if your operating system is on
another drive connected to that same
controller and you switch it you might
not be able to boot into Windows after
changing them to the controller mode but
Google IDE to ahci and there's easy
tutorials for how to do a quick registry
fix to get around that problem also
remember that if your operating system
is installed and running off of the SSD
you can still go ahead and benchmark
that SSD but you're not going to get
quite the same performance since the
drive will have other things on its mind
like keeping your operating system up
and running after you boot it up though
you'll want to initialize and format the
new drive in Windows Disk Management
utility
then it should pop up is a new fresh and
clean drive ready to go so what we're
going to do today with our benchmarking
is we're going to look at the four
quarters of SSD performance those are
sequential read sequential write random
read and random write so sequential read
and write tests show how the drive
handles large files so video is always a
good example these will require as much
data throughput as possible they want to
write it as fast as I can or read it as
fast as they can
usually these test results are listed in
megabytes per second and the fastest
SATA drives right now that are able to
fully saturate the available six
gigabits per second of bandwidth on the
state of our ev3 bus can head maybe 500
to 550 megabytes per second random reads
and writes show how the drive handles
many small operations at the same time
this will usually be listed as AI ops in
the test results or input/output
operations per second now the drives are
way way too fast for you or I to
manually be able to give it enough work
to do to actually achieve its maximum I
ops but the synthetic tests that we're
going to show today queue up as many
commands as they can to stress the drive
that's why you'll usually see queue
depth 32 for the random read and write
tests one last metric is response time
but since SSDs move at the speed of
electricity these values are usually
incredibly low and they're rarely
compared between drives at least in my
experience I only bring this up because
response time for SSDs is such a huge
leap from older mechanical hard drives
and this is what makes an SSD based
system just feel so fast then that's all
thanks to the drive being so responsive
I chose these three SSD benchmarking
tests because they're free they're
pretty easy to use and they give a good
idea of your drives performance so let's
start with a tow this drive benchmark
has been around for quite some time it's
always a go-to for manufacturers
themselves who are looking to show a
drives peak performance so after you
install it just choose your SSD hit
start it's going to run a series of
tests using different file sizes I
usually run the default settings but
then I'll try queue depth for as well as
queue depth 10 which will give the drive
a little bit more to work with just
remember that these results are in
kilobytes so divide that number on the
right column by a thousand and that will
give you megabytes per second so
nice and easy next we have a SSS D from
Alex intelligence software also quite
simple to run and I like that it will
tell you if it approves of your storage
configuration or not via the green text
on the upper left in the window if this
text is red then it means that a SSS D
thinks you should change something about
your configuration this test will give
you sequential read and write speeds for
K tests which are actually honestly the
closest thing to real-world performance
for many of these synthetics 64 thread
tests which queue up as many commands as
it can to achieve maximum input/output
operations per second and response time
which I usually just look at and think
to myself man that's fast so switch the
view to eye ops if you want to see eye
ops after the test is over of course and
also note that there are a few more
built-in tests within AS SSD to try to
mimic real-world PC activities so you
can try those out if you want to compare
them to other drives there's a
compression benchmark to which I really
only find useful for drives that use
on-the-fly compression methods which at
this point is mostly SandForce
controlled drives from the past four
years or so our third benchmark is
crystal disk mark it's also very easy to
use and it's free here I usually go with
a 1 gigabyte file size and I just run
all the tests with three passes
sequential reads and writes are here
again a 512 K test and a 4 K tests that
use smaller file sizes and of course the
ever-important 4kq depth 32 tests for
maximum I ops after the tests run go to
edit and hit copy and paste your results
into notepad or some other editing
software and you can see your eye ops
and you can also see a few more details
about your benchmarking run so if you're
watching my benchmark test results you
might have spotted a few things
specifically about the Samsung 850 Evo
my a doe tests it about 550 megabytes
per second reads and 525 megabytes per
second writes I had an amazing 96
thousand I ops read score and a s SSD
and crystal disk mark showed about 75 ki
ops writes and 80 ki ops read on the one
hand these are very impressive numbers
but on the other hand they're not
standing out too much further ahead of
any of the other high-end SSDs in the
past year or to say this is because the
SATA revision 3 protocol is limited to 6
gigabits per second of bandwidth
in the real world no drive can really
achieve much past about maybe five
hundred and fifty megabytes per second
in any test while connected via SATA
rev3 it is a bottleneck PCIe drives like
the newer m2 offerings can up the
bandwidth to 10 or 20 gigabits per
second so I am excited to see what
Samsung is able to do with this new
technology using that newer protocol if
you're an SSD veteran you probably
notice that I skipped a few things in
this video
there are definitely other metrics to
benchmark SSDs by and the four-corners
tests that i've run today do focus a lot
more on achieving the maximum
performance possible to see what a drive
can do rather than actually looking at
real-world benefits also Iometer is
another benchmarking tool that i really
can't go without at least mentioning
it's widely used in the industry but it
is a bit more complicated to set up and
run so let me know if you guys would be
interested in another video dedicated
specifically to that software because
it's pretty dense I would also like to
say that using blended tests that mix
reads writes sequential and non
sequential activity can give you a
better idea of how the drive can handle
a mixed workload let's face it if you
have this drive installed in most
situations you're not going to be just
dealing with all sequential reads or all
simple intial writes right consistency
is another metric that I find very
important but that also is a more
complex topic so I'm gonna link an
article in this video's description
about right consistency along with some
of the links to the benchmarking tools
that I use so you guys can download
those and try them out as well as some
suggested further reading links to sites
that I often firuze for SSD info less
tocar and the crew at SSD review do a
fantastic job as does Alan Melvin tile
and the folks over at PC perspective and
of course the infamous Christian motto
from Ann Ann's Tech scene here writing
the bumper cars in South Korea that is
all for this video though but let me
