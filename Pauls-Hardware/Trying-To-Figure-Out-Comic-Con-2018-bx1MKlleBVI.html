is a vlog we're going to San Diego
comic-con I'm here with Kyle and it is
still morning time we're enjoying a beer
we're getting this started off right
we're on the Amtrak headed south and
right now we're almost to Oceanside I
think there's a bit of a marine layer
right now keeping things cool for us Oh
boobs
I can't see it's not
adjustment by the
very impressive landmark
we're in San Diego blogging Kyle okay
yeah look at that we've had Steve hey
there's two blogs at the same time guys
hungry
you wanna give thanks Steve oh I could
eat it's important spot in old town I
love Mexican food
never chimichanga chimichanga thank you
Steve for bringing us to this lovely
Mexican restaurant thank you that was a
delicious meal we talked about important
life things and we're now all better
friends for it we're gonna go we're
gonna go check into our Airbnb
anybody expecting from our a B&amp;amp;B amazing
balcony probably some champagne little
Swan towels I have to pee so bad right
now this mysterious maze of walls and
other things like oh look at that it's
nice for you though okay
it's the Coronado Bay Bridge there's not
enough cameras documenting our first
entry into therapy and peeling this bed
though it's so soft it's like animal
skin this should be my room oh no zero
stars
our Airbnb is pretty nice Cal's just
going through all the cupboards and
personal effects of the owner Steve is
Steve's being responsible and just
enjoying the ambiance look we even have
a balcony out here look at that this
lovely view of San Diego and we can even
see the water off in that direction as
well as the Coronado Bay Bridge I think
we made it
Kyle's just doing the pre comic-con just
just shaking it out shaking it out nice
and loose got to stay loose for
comic-con
what the it's day two we have made
a complete mess of the Airbnb well I
didn't I'm a I've been keeping things
clean I didn't really do a whole lot of
filming yesterday but today we're going
back over to Comic Con after catching
breakfast of course now we're gonna go
back over to the san diego land gaming
area and we're gonna play some games we
have a meet-up at 4:00 and we're also
looking to have a little bit more time
today to actually wonder the show floor
and see why so many people go to
comic-con birth the mission getting
breakfast I'm gonna get strawberry
banana pancake
two burritos Andi quesadilla for
breakfast
Bansi you can decide meanwhile I have
bacon and eggs
okay with that service I really get the
understanding how justice is
the logs
eh ever in the United States
that was a delicious breakfast I am so
full I couldn't eat all my pancakes but
Steve's helped and now we're actually
going into comic-con I think we still
have no idea why we're actually here we
were here for a meet-up weirdo fan
meetup at the land area what up what do
people do at comic-con very long lines
for some of the panels and stuff but we
don't really have time to wait in any of
those so I guess we just explore neil
degrasse tyson we're like good friends
now I walk past in my Dicky glance my
direction you're like just a split
second so maybe we'll do a collaboration
I would finish what you started
but but really emo this time so if you
don't stay here and you need to go like
an award show that's when you go with
your Chrome suit
don't don't ask what's going on here I'm
really not sure I really have no idea
what Kyle is doing why he is bothering
close-ups
but magneto is really in great shape I
am very impressed
it's distraction just get this Hanzo
figurine and then you can smash it to
pieces every time Hanzo headshot see
when you play an overwatch it's great
it opens up
human emotion
I'm sorry
boy Donald jumpstart Donald later
we got pretty tired we tried to go up
right to get food across the street but
it's like a zoo out there there's an
insane amount of people we're just in
Japan
and that's issue tjuku crossing which is
legendary for the number of people there
like it was worse than that so
we have managed to get food we found a
place to get food we have shaded seating
and they even had beyond burger for
patty this fee doesn't anymore so we are
very concerned about the feelings of the
cows and the chickens and the pigs
is so hot right now
Steve forgot his lightning cable which
Steve never does so he got a power bank
to charge it I just want to clarify for
the record here though that despite any
lies you may have seen in Cal's blog
about San Diego comic-con I just threw
my water bottle rank here in the
recycling where it should go everyone
reduce reuse recycle litter litter
so all the lines of people they've been
waiting outside other places they're
finally actually laying in
they colonize people
every thought they got
like these
where are we doing
going back to the plan PC gaming
okay I'm gonna change chairs there
chairs
oh yeah
work at hero
oh look at that Tiffany enchanter wait
how did you slay the bunny what happened
they just cover they just keep coming
back whatever ends
- shortly
greetings Tim the Enchantix
I'll do my cosplay tomorrow
signatures also to say thank you
more
you put a dick and later on can I get
like a something with you guys let me
see yeah I'm gonna see this you leave it
alone
what a jerk Kyle its outdo me I think
two more guys is spreaded and he was the
first person to code behind the PC
gaming area here to say everyone say
it's gonna go Steve might be okay
and it once there go Steve is telling
Kyle of the secret tricks for how to win
a Call of Duty tournament to the land
this is La noise over here this is the
competition for Steve Gallardo a noise I
think might have the advantage and cow
died
la noise is just tearing through team
bit grounds right now all right both of
them are alive both of them are still
alive still I oh no Steve killed someone
Kyle's got the power Kyle's dead
but Steve but Steve carried the team
just as predicted
Steve with district teacher with another
kill but Kyle is dead
once again you know sudden soo would say
that's the battle that is once just the
battle that you don't engage in because
you know you're gonna lose yes just like
Kyle demonstrated right now Kyle's in
the firefight core Kyle Jim Joe he
killed it gotta kill Steve Jason down
Jason down
Oh what's that a melee kill Steve who's
that at night you just stick the knife
in him Steve that Felix steve is
trolling now going for the name knife
only now Steve knife only it initially
seemed like the LA Galaxy we're going to
destroy Kyle that's Steve but it they're
apparently putting up a little bit more
of a fight
well it was Kyle with another kill three
kills in a row but then he died so we've
just discovered that the game that Steve
and Kyle were actually winning has now
been forfeited mainly because the number
of players wasn't set to four other
people jumping in the game and it was
not a two-on-two Kyle that again I
missed it this is kind of funny sik
Steve got killed
let's see what Caillou
oh Jesus
the LA Clippers have made a huge
comeback it is now just 90 to 80 the
overall scores with team backgrounds in
the lead
Steve has revealed his winning strategy
he lets Kyle run out in front and act as
bait to get killed scowl sighs Steve
comes in gets to kill and takes the boy
for himself 20 seconds left on the match
and team that grounds it up by over 30
points all I need to do is maintain do
maintain and not die just don't die
that's what I gotta do
don't you die whatever you do pals 7
seconds left
this is a match bonus good job you guys
won Stephen Kyle presently engaged in
rounds to just a matter out of the match
score is currently tied sixty to sixty
take that back same big rounds is not
losing by 10 points
things are slipping things are slipping
big time
let's kill their steve-o Kim has to lead
a little bit off like a shoulder length
off it Steve with two kills in a row
right there
could this be a turning point
that again maybe not we're now at the
halfway point in the round five minutes
elapsed five minutes to go
the score is three hundred and forty two
to two hundred team backgrounds looking
to potentially make a huge comeback here
huge comeback guys you can do it
fight fight hard remember your ancestors
it's like I kind of missed into the mosh
pit of a team
big grunt bit grounds just a quick close
game interview here what what brought
you down but where was the point of
failure
I don't point fingers here but I was
definitely hold my own way I would say
not having game seriously for the last
five years yeah definitely I've never
had double team I'm losing good teammate
folks you heard it here first Steve
blames Kyle entirely for the loss and
their friendship has suffered and will
probably never be the same again
you guys should play games at LAN
tournaments too just such nostalgia
proof for actual work at this Warcraft 3
yeah its Warcraft 3 3 device this was
such a good game
I spent too much time playing is give
them just seven up there like the other
