learn more what's up guys welcome back
to Pauls hardware this is probing Paul
episode number 28 this is a monthly Q&amp;amp;A
video that I do where I answer the
questions that you asked me last months
it's a pretty straightforward premise
last month was episode 27 so now we are
on episode 28 here is a look back
through the Oh down the hole of time to
the past probing Paul's and with that
said let's just get right into it with
the first question
Clarion Hatake asks hey Paul wanted by
two fans for my NZXT s340 I've two empty
spaces in the front for two 140 or 220
millimeter fans
what is the difference other than these
size for these fans this is a good
question I will address it here with
some visual aids so this is a typical
hundred and twenty millimeter fan for a
computer this is 140 millimeter fan it
is larger I should start out by saying
that not all fans are made the same so
this is an NFA 12 X 25 pwm fan from
Noctua and they put a lot of time and
effort into designing this to make sure
that the fan blades are very very close
to the ring around the edge so there are
factors with fans that you should check
such as CFM there as an airflow
statistic as well as static pressure
which is a very key thing to look at if
you're going to be using the fan with a
radiator or a thin stack behind it that
said and ignoring the differences
between slight variations and spec and
performance from the fans themselves if
you're just comparing a hundred and
twenty millimeter 240 millimeter there
are a couple of general things that you
can say about them this is larger yes so
you need a little bit more space in your
case and you need to have mounting
points for these but larger fans will
generally be able to move more air so
bigger fan moves more air and they can
often spin at lower rpms while moving
more air which is why the rage for quite
a while was like larger fans like
hundred and eighty millimeter or 200
millimeter fans those are less practical
because they're even larger and so you
do need a large case to support them but
that's the basic difference between them
if you have
40-millimeter mounts I'd recommend going
with 140 millimeter fans simply because
chances are you'll be able to get a
quieter experience but again remember
that not all fans are designed the same
the motor is also something to consider
so take those specs into consideration
and then get a bigger fan if you can fit
it in your case
next question from APEC hey Paul can we
have a power wall update please want to
know my thoughts and what I think as
well as efficiency and power savings now
that it has been in for a few months
my solar installation video I got a
Tesla solar array as well as a power
wall and those videos did quite well I
had lots of people asking me about them
so I am still planning some follow-ups
on them I apologize that I have not done
them quite yet but there are a few
factors contributing to that one of them
is that I was gone for a good chunk of
the summer when I first turned the power
wall on I was gone for two weeks there
at the end of the summer I was gone for
two weeks again also the temperatures
keep changing and fluctuating so I feel
like I could give an assessment right
now for like this one month of summer
but to be a little bit more thorough I
feel like I need a little bit more data
that said I can share at least this with
you guys right now
Southern California Edison likes to send
guilt-trip letters to its customers
comparing your energy usage with your
neighbors and I used to get this thing
that was like here's your efficient
neighbors and here's uu inefficient
piece of garbage not much energy you're
using never mind the fact that I work at
home and like I run something of a mini
studio out here in my garage and stuff
but here's the more recent one and now
we can see here's me
compared to my efficient neighbors and
way better now I got the great smiley
face there and if you look at the
comparison here for the past few months
you can see my March April May where I
was kind of generally above the usage of
everyone else and then June July
especially in summer when everyone
else's you should spiked mine stay low I
was still using power from the grid size
did stuff to pay a power bill during
those months but it was way way better
so I'm saving probably a hundred two
hundred and fifty bucks a month right
now but I have one follow-up video
coming where I am going to clean my
solar panels because they really need to
be cleaned right now and I wanted to do
kind of a before and after comparison
there and then yes I'm planning a final
follow-up video where I kind of give an
assessment of the entire thing it'll be
kind of a one year later thing from when
I initially signed up to get everything
installed next question from Joey Gil
Holtz
since the NDA will be over next month
why doesn't Vidya get away with
increasing GPU prices year-over-year
including the founders edition price up
facin with tanks performance in mind do
you think they're going to lose sales to
much more reasonably priced
Pascal cards yes they are I think that's
kind of their plan it's a weird
situation right now because everyone's
like oh the Archie x-series is too
overpriced by 10 80s and 10 70s and
everything instead and NVIDIA is
probably like that's fine with us we
make money either way but more to your
question of how it is in video get away
with it and I think it is a serious
long-term marketing scheme as well as
like you said obfuscation a bit of
manipulation going in there too I have
mentioned this back when an Nvidia first
launched the Titan which was $1,000
graphics card at the time when the most
expensive graphics cards were maybe five
and six hundred bucks each they launched
the Titan at that $1000 price and then
they said don't worry it's like a
prosumer product it's made for people
who are using it for scientific
applications and stuff like that and
that may be true to some extent I can
speak somewhat an totally from my time
back at Newegg when the original Titan
launched to say that those sold those
did not stop selling they were not a
Halo product that set and every once in
a while one of them would get sold but a
lot of times they were sold to
universities and institutions that were
using them for FB compute performance
and stuff like that at the same time
though that halo product that Titan
class graphics card was used by gamers
and it was put in like the highest of
the high end gaming PC's at the time so
there was sort of this creeping up in
the past five six seven eight years from
5 $600 graphics cards to the 1080i which
was like 650 $700 at 1081 at when it
launched was a was over $600 as well and
he could even point to the launch event
for the RT x-series when Jensen was up
on stage walking back and forth talking
about the power and performance of the
new graphics cards and very vague terms
but what was he comparing it to $68,000
workstation clash class machines which
does a couple things
one gives you the impression that the
power of this card is somehow equivalent
to those you know crazy expensive stuff
that the
price classes using and makes you think
like up maybe twelve hundred bucks isn't
that bad and you know I'm not saying you
all thought that most people were like
oh my gosh twelve hundred ollars is very
expensive but it's a long-term process
of getting people to pay more money for
stuff and I think constantly valuing the
new graphics cards at higher and higher
prices just slowly erodes people's
thoughts of like here's what a high-end
graphics card should cost versus now
what should a high-end graphics card
cost and point
case in point here this is a twenty atti
for a thousand or twelve hundred bucks
you've never had a graphics card that
was a consumer mainstream gaming
graphics card that cost that much but
prior to now everything was a Titan I
was like oh that you could use that for
gaming but you can also use that for
other stuff too and that's why it cost
so much this is just another step in the
process of getting people to pay more
money for graphics cards and the
economists and and whatnot and the
audience can argue that further but
that's I I agree with you I guess this
is my final comment on that next
question from phrase M why do we never
see a new major company that develops
CPUs or graphics cards there's always
big guys like Intel AMD and NVIDIA that
dominate the market no one challenges
them short answer here is that there is
a massive barrier to entry when it comes
to designing stuff like integrated
circuits CPUs GPUs they're incredibly
complex there's other factors that play
into it such as intellectual property
rights and patent law and since that's
international it's just very complex you
need like lawyers you need engineers you
need very smart people it costs a lot of
money to pay those people and therefore
there's just very few companies that
actually have the backing to manufacture
something like this also bear in mind
there are chip designers and their fabs
the fabs are where the chips are
actually produced and then you can have
design houses that then go and take
their designs and work with a fab like
tsmc or Global Foundries AMD for example
used to be both a chip designer and had
their own fabs but they spun off their
fab just GlobalFoundries back in the
2000s not going to dive down that but
that's a short answer to your question
it's very very very expensive to get
into this space so probably not going to
see any new players in this space for
the time being unless you look at China
maybe
China might come through with that but I
believe they have government's help next
question from Elvis Clark hey Paul of
the channel keep up the great work thank
you thank you very much Elvis he's built
his first gaming PC and he built it
during the mining craze so graphics
cards are very expensive but he's got an
ASUS Maximus nine code motherboard is
7700 K 16 gigs of g.skill memory a
crabber gauge seven quad Lumi and a
geforce 1050 TI GPU which is an adequate
GPU but definitely a little underpowered
compared to the rest of the rig NZXT
elite case and he's got a very nice
monitor here monitor is the asus rog
Strix XG 3 5 v q which is 35 inch curved
34 40 by 1440 ultra wide and it's got
free sink support 730 bucks you can get
this for right now this is just a
testament to like how much cheaper free
sink monitors are because this is kind
of in the same range as my Easter
predator x34 back there but a very nice
monitor and definitely you want to pair
this up with a free sink capable
graphics card and you can upgrade from
your 1050 Ti so I'm over on PC part
picker I'm looking at video cards and
I'm only looking at rx5 80s as well as
vague at 56 is in 64's the RX 588 gig
which is what you would want to upgrade
to is 220 bucks and that's very
reasonable that's much cheaper the
retail price for this is supposed to be
250 so it's great you can get at that
cheap that said this isn't gonna be a
huge upgrade it's a pretty decent
upgrade but not a huge upgrade over your
existing 1050 Ti so if you want to get a
little bit better you can scroll down to
the Vega 56 options which you can get as
cheap as 420 dollars right now just
reality checking yes this Radeon rx 580
is available for $240 and there's a $20
million rebate card also right now you
get a game pack with these AMD cards
which includes assassin's creed's
Odyssey strange Brigade and star control
origins maybe you're interested in those
games maybe or not but it's cool that
you can actually recommend AMD graphics
cards for reasonable prices now
Vega 56 the cheapest one I found for the
time being is 420 dollars also a very
good price for that card the other thing
you should probably look into is the
used market just bear in mind with AMD
cards in particular there's a very good
chance you're going to get a card that
was used for mining which might be
perfectly all right just reality check
see if you can
some additional information about the
cards use from the used cell you're
buying it from but hopefully that gives
you some options for now and start
taking advantage of that awesome monitor
you have just a couple questions still
left fsx toute asks i want to build a pc
with a 2200 g which is an AMD APU eight
gigs of ram and a 240 SSD could I use
these in a finished builds to edit 4k
video Wow
so short answer for you is yes you can
edit 4k video with that setup the longer
answer is you're gonna have kind of a
painful time I think you're actually
gonna have the most difficulty with your
SSD you're gonna run out of space
because 4k footage takes up a lot of
room and if you're editing off that
single drive it's just gonna be very
slow and choppy so yes it's possible to
do one thing you could do is take that
raw 4k video and then re encode it into
Sena form files and then use those as
proxies while you're editing Sena form
is unencoded which means it's much
simpler to simply read off of the drive
and display it on screen so it's a lot
faster when you're discovering around
the timeline and actually doing your
edit that said you're looking at a
pretty underpowered system for 4k video
editing so you could do this it's just
not going to be the best experience for
you but this is also a nice starter
system so if you need something to edit
with right now you could upgrade that
2200 g2a six core or an 8 core rise in
the processor in the future you could
upgrade here memory to 16 gigs or 32
gigs in the future that would be a big
boost in performance and of course you
can add more storage higher capacity
SSDs and especially hard drives for
massive long-term storage for all of
your raw footage and those will all be
very helpful upgrades for an editing
system just like this so best of luck to
you in the future and I hope that advice
has given you something to go off of
last question here from John and this
really isn't a question it's a comment
from last month and you just said
finally a video without music when
talking thank you and 22 people thought
enough to upload that comment so I
thought it would end this video with a
question for you guys for a video like
this where it's just kind of a talking
had me responding to questions or
whatever
should there be background music because
honestly it's more work to add
background music into any given video so
just wanted to get your guys feedback on
that whether you appreciate the
background music whether you think it
just shouldn't be there are we wasting
our time by editing that into our
video edits that we do because that is
all the time I have for now for a
probing Paul episode number 28 thank you
so much for watching this video hit the
thumbs up button if you enjoyed it and
leave me questions in the comment
section down below so I can answer them
next month in next month's probing Paul
it's been good to have been probed by
you all today and we'll see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
