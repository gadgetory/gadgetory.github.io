video of 2015 it has been an absolutely
wonderful year this has been my first
full year as an independent youtuber
with no other real job to speak of and
it's been absolutely fantastic I've
grown a lot I've learned a lot I've had
ups and downs of course and you guys
have been there with me the entire way
through so I wanted to start off by
saying a massive thank you to you guys
whether it's just viewing the videos
whether you are hitting the thumbs up
button if you like the videos or leaving
comments down in the comments section or
sending me stuff over on Twitter I
really appreciate all of it the positive
stuff is amazing of course it helps keep
me going even the constructive criticism
is really helpful as I hone and refine
my techniques and try to bring you guys
more videos along the lines of what you
want to see and that's really what I
have a lot of planned in 2016 let's
start off with a look back at the year
prior 2015 has been amazing as already
mentioned and I want to start off with
some hard statistics courtesy of social
blade the nice thing about doing a
YouTube channel is that there are quite
a few websites out there that are purely
dedicated to monitoring statistics for
YouTube so there's a couple that i like
to use Vince that's X as one of them I'm
going to be using social blade right now
to look at one year ago as of January
first 2 2015 up until now which is it
should be December 31st 2015 what is the
difference well a year ago I had 3.83
million total views now I have thirteen
point seven nine million that's right in
just one year I've gone from just shy of
four million so almost 10 million more
to thirteen point seven nine that's
pretty exciting back then I had 94
thousand four hundred subscribers
definitely a very nice number now i have
two hundred and eighteen thousand four
hundred subscribers so I've more than
doubled the number of subscribers to so
thanks tell you guys who have subscribed
as for average views per day I was at
about fifteen point two five thousand as
of a year ago and now i'm at forty five
point four thousand so that's about
three times the amount finally there is
another stat views per month and i was
doing about four hundred and seventy two
thousand as of a year ago now i'm at 1.1
million so more than double and healthy
numbers all around i'm very glad this
means that hopefully i'm doing something
right and if you guys want help me out
as far as those numbers go you can of
course
scribe to the channel if you're not
already and sharing my content with
other people only the videos you like of
course is also insanely helpful so I
really appreciate any time you do that
but what videos have I even been making
that you guys have been watching what
are my regular videos it's actually been
a question I've asked myself multiple
times throughout this year the simple
answer would be reviews and tutorials
that's kind of what are my bread and
butter would be is taking a product and
reviewing it or taking something like a
computer and showing you guys how to
build it or put it together I may be
doing something more specific like how
to install an SSD or something like that
I like also doing the review + tutorial
where I take a product and I kind of do
a tutorial around it but then I also
review that product as well kind of
slipped a few in here and there so I
like doing those two monthly builds live
is one of the regular segments that I
started doing a few months back actually
I started doing that all the way back in
2014 but I've made it a regular monthly
thing since about midway through this
year those are live videos that I shoot
here and I go over parts that I've
chosen out and then in a lot of
situations have actually built that
system later on in the month so let me
know in the comments section if you guys
like that segment it's definitely been
something that's getting a lot of views
and it's something that I can put
together on a regular basis so i'll be
bringing that back in 2016 provided of
course you guys continue to watch it
first 5 is another series that I've kind
of created this year which was kind of
my answer to top 5 lists top 5 lists are
everywhere they get lots of views but
sometimes they seem a little I don't
know they're little on the cheap side so
I was like oh I need some of that action
here but I don't want to call it top
five so with first five it's very subtle
and tricky of course I've done a few of
those I haven't done any recently but I
might bring those back as well if I get
some good subject matter for it garage
work logs are something that you've
probably seen a lot of especially
recently since I've been doing a
painting and shelf building an ongoing
project behind me I've gotten the bulk
of that major work done so I don't want
to be doing garage work logs as
frequently as i haven't say the last
three months of this year but i will be
doing some more of those as i'm
continually trying to upgrade my
situation here and make things better
and more fluid and easier to organize
and easier for workflow in particular
hopefully that's going to make me more
efficient to produce more videos i have
also been doing a specialty builder i
did a specialty build the Arctic Panther
which you can probably see back
behind me um I want to do another
high-end specialty build like Arctic
Panther I don't know whether it's going
to be a rebuild of that or whether i'm
just going to build a completely new
system so i would love to hear your
ideas for like a super high-end over the
top custom water-cooled system that i
could put together in 2016 whether it's
a theme a color scheme parts anything
like that leave me your ideas in the
comments and I will be gathering those
all together and mashing them into a
ball of goodness that becomes a video on
building a custom water-cooled system
it's gonna be awesome I promise I also
had the opportunity this year to do some
traveling I definitely love traveling
and aside from my excursions with my
wife I did some traveling for work I
would CES of course all the way back in
January in fact i'm going back to Las
Vegas in less than a week for CES 2016
lost my voice last year i'm gonna try to
avoid that this year but it was still a
lot of fun i love going to CES it's a
nice sort of local events since I'm in
California and I get to meet lots of
vendor people there and make contacts
and you know shake hands and all that
good stuff also it's Vegas have some
pretty good party so that's cool i'll be
bringing a bit of personal contents next
week for that i'm just going to do a
couple videos of behind-the-scenes stuff
as far as the product coverage for CES
2016 that i'm going to be helping textin
to get out with so text syndicate check
out their channel I post a link to it
down there and that's where i will be
doing actual reporting and i'll do some
shenanigans and stuff on my channel too
that's what the opportunity to go to
computex again i absolutely love
visiting taiwan I've traveled there
three or four times now it's a wonderful
country with delicious food and lovely
people and I'm definitely going back for
computex in 2016 as well I feel it's the
convention that is most in line with the
type of stuff that I talk about it's
where you get your actual component
level vendors out there displaying all
their newest technology it's where lots
of product launches are so i'll be doing
that again in 2016 and 2015 was an
absolute blast and my friend rachel
actually lives there now so she's like
learning the lay of the land she
promised she was gonna show us all with
the most wonderful things in taiwan when
we went there this year so stay tuned
for that and this video would not be
complete without mentioning awesome
hardware if you don't know what that is
it is a weekly live show
I do along with my good friend Kyle he's
forever a Kyle on Twitter or if you want
to check out his YouTube channel if you
don't already know it's awesomesauce
network we do technology discussion so
pcs and any kind of tech news that might
have popped up we get the chance to
interact with fans who are watching live
so we get to shout things at people who
say stuff in chat I guess is what that
means there's also some beer drinking
involved so that's just kind of become a
tradition for the show which the is is
not encouraged unless you're doing
responsibly of course but it does add a
bit of an extra spice to the show we've
done forty four episodes of awesome
hardware since the first one aired on
the februari 18 2015 the live viewership
has been growing steadily this entire
year and it's just a ton of fun Kyle and
I had this conversation every I don't
know month or two were like you're still
enjoying this right and we're like yeah
we both look forward to it every week we
look forward to talking to you guys
every week and we will be kicking off
awesome harder 2016 from Las Vegas next
week as we begin our CES coverage for
2016 and that is all for this video guys
that's all for my content in 2015 thank
you all so much once again for watching
my videos for hitting the like button

tons more videos coming in 2016 I
promise I'm going to be redoubling my

zen and am for platform actually coming
