morning to all you guys as well hope
you're having a good day today I am
excited because I am actually finally
going to finish up my video for my
monthly builds for January so that
technically this is January is build
back behind me although I didn't really
finish it till the end of the month I'm
just going to call up my my super epic
and classy RGB built because it's classy
and it's RGB it's also supposed to be a
pretty fast computer to normally these
videos this is the third part of that
video I already planned it and I built
it and I'll post links to those videos
in the description if you want to check
it out normally right now I just say hey
here's the build and I'm going to test
it and everything but actually have a
little bit more work to do because I
have a couple sort of late parts that
arrived I'm going to be integrating into
the build first before I move on to
testing so first off here I of course
have the G skill tried NZ r gb memory
this has arrived already be lighting
five LEDs across the top of each dim and
G scale has their own software for this
but I'm actually going to be using the
updated ACS Ora software which can
control these so we'll be checking that
out and giving you a little taste of
what is capable on that this is a 32 gig
kit so a huge thank you of course to 2g
skill for sending these over and those
would be installed ASAP I also contacted
EVGA because there was I don't know the
cabling on the power supply that I use
the 750 g2 supernova from EVGA is nice
it's all black it blends in pretty well
but since this build is a little bit
more fancy I'm going to say when it
comes to aesthetics I did want to I just
want to you know hopefully hopefully
finish things off and give it a nice
completed look at the end and I think
these will help out with that I also
haven't really used a cable kit directly
from EVGA yet but it seems like they're
doing a pretty good job here
no no heat shrink visible on the on the
connectors anything like that and I
think these should blend in pretty well
I thought this was going to be the 24
pin that I pull up this just appears to
be a bunch of peripheral SATA cables in
that kind of thing
anyway I'll give you a closer look at
that once it's all installed but here's
a quick montage just
get the build up to date
so I got the radiator swapped around
with fans two front fans are now on the
front for the intake so you can no
longer see the business end of them and
I think that definitely looks better and
now I want to show you my super ghetto
method for suspending my tubing for the
all-in-one for the Kraken X 62 basically
I used a really long post site and like
I can't in focus okay okay he's really
long twist tie which is right there at
the top you can only only just barely
see that part of it right there then I
just fed that through in between
directly in between the two top fans
comes around here at the top so I need
to do now is use a little clip tuck that
away and then no one will be the wiser
after you guys of course
well guys this is the point in the video
where my plans sort of start to change
mainly because I am out of time
I am so torn I'm so torn about the
situation with this build right now
because I'm in one hand everything is
looking great like the build has come
together if it wasn't for the lighting
situation I'd be letting this is sweet
everything's perfect here's your end
results here's all my testing and all
that kind of stuff but everything is
perfect like except for the RGB lighting
and I would normally just say like oh
whatever like we'll deal with that later
but the RGB was kind of a key part of
this build that's been in the title of
the whole time so don't really feel like
I can say it's completely finished
unless the RGB lighting is there as well
so what I'm going to do right now is
give you guys a rundown of the build as
it stands because I have made some
improvements and some upgrades that I
think are pretty key and are making a
pretty significant difference I'm going
to give you just a little bit of a taste
of the lighting situation right now but
unfortunately I can't show you like all
the different functionality and
everything because I'm dealing with
really early software versions of the
software for RGB lighting control that
have been sent by Asus as well as said
directly by g.skill I can't install both
of them at the same time they overwrite
each other because they're very similar
software's I can't show you the g.skill
software because they have made me
promise not to show anyone until it's
completely finished and the UI is
working so there it is I'm going to have
to do a third or I guess maybe a fourth
video for this particular series to come
back and take a look at that and give
you guys a full rundown of the lighting
options for now here is everything that
I've gotten done acceptable in its just
lighting first of all I have RGB LEDs on
the motherboard
of the Maximus 9 hero lights up here by
the IO as well as down underneath here
by the chipset and that's controlled by
asus aura software
asus or software can also of course
control the graphics card which is not
even being lit up at all right now again
this is this is an issue of the complex
with the software that I'm going back
and forth between and you know if this
is very much early adopter problems none
of the software is even publicly
available yet because they know that
it's not ready so I'm not necessarily
saying that the software sucks or
anything like that it's just it's a
little too early for it to be completely
out there and available in the market
my other dilemma is that I'm leaving
actually shortly in like an hour or so
to go on a trip with my wife so I would
like hit up Asus I'm sorry well actually
I need to hit up ESG skill and fantex
because the coordination with the case
isn't quite working as it should either
but it's Saturday they're probably going
to get back to me till Monday and I need
to get this video posted by hopefully
Monday maybe Tuesday the latest all
right so the RGB on the case is right
here down in this bar across the front
and then it's also connected with the
two LED strips which I have sort of
fixed with magnets and a couple twists
ties here as well as up the front side
of the case these LED strips and
actually the lights on the case
themselves are not properly reflecting
the Lighting's that is being sent by the
motherboard and I really am confused by
that one I can get it to represent blue
but if I try to make it do red it's more
of a pink and if I try to have a do
green it becomes more of a greenish
whitish yellow type thing so it seems
like the it's trained like it's got a
white instruction that's coming through
there along with everything else but
anyway I need to contact fan text and
figure that out a little bit better the
memory the g.skill memory is looking
pretty nice I mean it looks it looks
really cool it comes default out of the
box with the rainbow effect and then
there's several effects I've been trying
but again I can basically install the
software so I can control that memory
but everything else can it goes weird
like right now I try to just turn all
the lights off and like everything
turned off except for that
nice trips but everything should be off
the NZXT Kraken is functioning perfectly
thankfully but it has its separate piece
of software to control so I am working
with two bits of software the ACE is for
a suite as well as the NZXT cam software
which seem to play nice together for the
most part but again you can't really
synchronize between them so I was having
to figure out something that would match
with this particular lighting it
wouldn't match up this one anyway that's
that's the lighting situation right now
and again guys I'm gonna have to come
back to this and show you guys the full
demo once everything is working properly
let's talk about like everything else
alright so cabling I'm really glad that
I swapped out for these
EVGA custom sleeved cable kit are like
the this specialty sleeve cable kits
that they can they sell to go along with
their fully modular power supplies you
know it's not like the nicest sleeve
cabling but it's definitely pretty clean
that's a little bit thinner and it's not
like it's not like paracord but I was
able to do a little bit of training with
it I put some twist ties around here
just to hold it in place so it was sort
of stay like that and I think overall
turned out pretty nice and definitely a
nice upgrade from the defaults leaving
that came with it
performance-wise I have done some quick
overclocking I just used a I suite
software from Asus and the 7700 K got to
4.9 yogurts I don't think I have like a
golden ship or anything because a lot of
people are hitting size this one doesn't
seem to want to do five but I'm happy
with 4.9 GPU it's a 1080 of course so I
got about two thousand fifty two
thousand thirty five megahertz with my
basic overclocking that I did so far
I'll come back with some additional
gaming benchmarks later on and then of
course cable management was was a big
challenge here because it's a dual
tempered glass side panel case so the
cable management was very messy at first
I really wanted to make sure so if I was
looking down in this direction at this
gap here in the power supply shroud but
I wasn't going to see cables looped back
there and everything and I think I
managed to do that pretty well because
it looks pretty clean from this angle
also really glad that I did this little
thing to tie it up on the top to keep
the tubing from the Kraken from from
from falling down too much I think it
looks a little bit better that way and
now let's look at the cable management
side over here
and boom there's for cable management
super happy with how this turned out
again one of the nice things about
coming back and redoing cabling first
off you realize that this very nice case
when it comes kill management because I
was able to sort of rewire the entire
power supply without very much
difficulty at all the sleeves cabling
just looks a lot better here since it is
visible with the side panel on on the
other side and then I was able to tie up
a bit of the excess down here use a lot
of zip ties in here after I got the
velcro to hold everything in place I use
a zip ties to cinch things down just a
lot more to keep things cleaner and you
know it's not like everything's
completely completely 100% clean but I
think it's about as good as I could get
it without doing any like custom cutting
of cables or rewiring of things and
stuff like that
my ocz drive back here does stand out
quite a bit but I think again since it's
on the opposite side of the case it's
not a big deal at all but very clean a
very very happy that's how this all
turned out down here there's even plenty
of space down there in the basement for
additional stuff if I wanted to shove
additional stuff in there and oh and I
did keep the sticker on the power supply
on you guys can let me know if you think
that was a good idea and I just it's
blended in with everything and I wasn't
going for like a completely clean D
labeled build with this so I don't mind
keeping that on there too so people
could see that you know to get good
power supplies I have installed anyway
though guys I am going to wrap up this
video because I need to hit the road
ASAP I hope you have enjoyed this I hope
you don't mind that it's still a bit of
a work in progress but I will be coming
back and doing one more follow-up video
very specifically for the lighting Oh Oh
the one last thing I did want to mention
is noise this system is very very quiet
and that's a key factor for for me I
would say the noise is more important
than the lighting I think a lot of you
would agree with that
but even when this is under load staying
very quiet the most you can hear is like
when you get right up in there you can
hear just the tiniest bit of pump boys
from the crack in X 62 so not bad not
bad at all anyway guys thanks for
watching this video really appreciate it
the thumbs up button if you enjoyed it
links to all the parts I used or down in
the video's description and stay tuned
for more comment on this build as well
as my February build which I'm also
going to be assembling very soon thanks
for watching pauls hardware we'll see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
