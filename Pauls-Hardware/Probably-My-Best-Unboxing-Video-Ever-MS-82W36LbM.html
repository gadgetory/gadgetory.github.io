hardware it is Friday at least as of the
recording of this video so I decided
what better way to celebrate Friday than
by unboxing a bunch of packages that
have arrived I do unboxing videos from
time to time I know of some of the stuff
that's in some of these packages and I
know of one particular item that I think
I'm really really excited to unbox today
and that's what's in this cylindrical
tube right here so stick with me and
let's see what's in these packages item
number one ships from North Carolina
from a mysterious fulfillment center and
as mentioned I'm pretty sure I know what
this is but it is certainly packaged
well I will give it that it's gonna
start by saying this is the longest and
most cylindrical package of the opening
today but I don't think that actually is
the case but that's all that was inside
and met with the distinct smell of fresh
rubber and here we have a wrist
attachment so here's the instructions in
safety card this is an actual legit
product from gamers Nexus they've gone
so far as to do a piece of paper a
warranty look at that what's my warranty
Steve six months is a warranty that
you're provided by gamers Nexus 4 this
mod man right it's actually unravel the
thing oh there she is
wow that is as large look at that that
will fit across an entire day it's
actually too big it's too big for my
small desk right here so this is
obviously gonna be more suited for this
the work table over there so the mod mat
serves several functions first off it's
rubberized so provides you protective
surface to work on you can set products
on it's also an electrostatic discharge
tool so you can ground the mat itself
you have two cables that are included
this one here and it's actually got a
snap on the bottom so you can snap it
directly to the corner of the mod mats
if that's your thing and then you can
take this cable and route that over and
connect it up to something that's
grounded there's instructions in the
manual for connecting it to an outlets
the via the center screw on the outlet
assuming that outlet is grounded
properly of course and then once that is
connected you can also connect this up
to like a large metal object like a
table or something or even like a
- power supply I'll stick with the
gamers exes advice from the instruction
manual though and advice that you just
go with that and outlet for that you got
the alligator clip so you can use this
anti-static wrist strap like a normal
anti-static wrist strap and you can just
alligator clip that to a large metal
table or something that's grounded or
you can remove that clip and you get a
little plug here and then it can take
that plug insert it into the corner of
this and then you can actually have up
to two people working on the mod mat and
they're both granted practically
speaking if you're like me and like you
never ground yourself because you know
Yolo or whatever
god I just said yo look I'm sorry but
you can of course use all the printed
stuff here it's so you get measurements
that you have both inches and
centimeters we have Imperial and metric
that's nice if you're taking a part of
graphics card to put a water block on
you can put it right here
and use this to arrange stuff they have
a layouts of different thermal paste
application methods for thread ripper
risin sky like and coffee like all of
the modern CPUs they've got layouts of
the different MDOT two lengths so 22 110
all the way down to 20 to 30 that's just
the length one 1080 60 42 and 30 of
course the gamers Nexus logo dead center
there and then finally on the right side
we have layouts of typical pin outs for
GPU CPU PCI Express and ATX as well as
PWM fan molex connectors SATA pin outs
and your of course ever-important 24 pin
including the ideal place to do a jump
on the 24 pin just telling you where you
can connect up your jeopardy finally a
layout of the different screws that you
would typically encounter with a PC
build so all about pretty useful product
here I'd say for anyone who is a PC
enthusiast if you build lots of
computers useful multiple ways and just
to be clear here gamers Nexus sent me
this mod mat free of charge but they
didn't pay me anything for an
endorsement or anything like that Steve
did not promise me a lock of his hair
and there's definitely no way that a
lock of Steve's hair will grant me with
superhuman strength or intelligence or
anything like that so let's move on next
product arrives from Adorama camera if
maybe you can tell based on the box just
clarify this IRA know what it is it is
the hive watch 100 see a new light I did
a video on lighting
I went on a field trip over to Kyle
studio recently and this is just a few
of the products that I've ordered have
arrived not everything is here yet but
I'm so excited I wanted to do an
unboxing of it I also want to point out
that this is usually about a thousand
dollars for this lights I ordered it
from Adorama actually located it on
Amazon so I'm gonna post an Amazon link
in this video's description all my
Amazon links are typically affiliate
links if you weren't already aware but I
actually went and ordered this directly
from Adorama and I say this with full
knowledge that if you go and order
directly from Adorama I will not get an
affiliate Commission for that but I find
that since Amazon is such a massive
behemoth of online retail right now go
into some of the smaller details and
just retailers and just buying directly
from them I support so Adorama I've had
a good experience with in the past they
have not paid me for an endorsement or
anything like that
I bought this directly from them and
this was eight hundred and fifty bucks
at Adorama as opposed to the retail
price of a thousand so this is the wasp
1000c it is an LED lights it's also RGB
so I can change colors and hopefully
make things look a lot cleaner in here
there's the main housing here is the
reflector cup maximizing the light
output
we got a face piece right there alright
so um this seems pretty straightforward
I'm gonna go ahead and try to put it
together without referencing the manual
so they have a power supply brick here
with not an XLR plug but it's the same
housing as an XLR plug it's also keyed
so that's nice it'll only go in one way
a lot of length there on the cable so
I'm gonna have to figure out a good
place to sort of hang that brick off of
there
well it has active cooling there's
there's a fan that kicks on when I turn
this up sorry sorry Jess yeah right
alright so um it's a pretty this is a
pretty bright light I will say now that
I've Joe has it's getting brighter too
it's powering up slowly all right so
I've discovered I should click one at a
time and then wait for it to change it
takes just a second or two actually
affect the color change and I'm also
feeling like I should probably read the
manual and figure this thing out a
little bit more right so clearly there's
a lot more playing around to be done
with my wasp 100-seat you know what I
think would be most useful would be if I
had something to mount it on okay for
this part of the unboxing I will
definitely need to stand because putting
this on the table is probably not gonna
happen
this is a three pack of C stands the C
stands are made of steel there's three
of them and they all have an extra
extension arm to hang stuff off of or do
to suspended lights overhead and that
kind of thing they're all the same - so
I'm gonna spray you guys go open in all
of these and I'm just gonna open one of
them alright so see Stan comes in three
basic pieces this is the base also comes
with an allen wrench and the base can
collapse down this is this steel that I
mentioned it's steel that's why it's
heavy it's also a it's sturdy and
durable and that's also why it's able to
actually support a lot of weight so
there we go goes out three videos like
that tighten that down that gives us a
nice stand also great for sandbags
because the sandbag can just go pop like
that just hangs right over the edge and
it's it's a much better solution than
putting sandbags on the flimsy stands
that I currently have second piece here
vertical stand again larger eat more
easily accessible rotary points here
it's actually even kind of spring-loaded
so it'll provide
a little bit of assistance with the
weights as you are raising or lowering
stuff that's connected to the stand
there we have that's that's it's really
quite energetic there at the top and
that's pretty much the C stand with the
crossbar attached on top that can be
slid down or over whatever it's got
another attachment point right here so
this can be used between two C stands if
you're hanging something heavier or like
Hal has been using this just to drape
his diffusion gel over and then of
course with sandbags on the bottom this
thing's a lot sturdier it's even got a
nice soft grip here that you can lift it
and move it by I've done the barest
minimum to get the wasp the hive wasp
set up so let me know what you guys
think is it impacting the look at all
right now or do I need do I need to
spend more time on Avery and Chris and
set things up I should also read the
rest of the manual that would help this
box came from ASIS and I was not sure
what was it what was gonna be in there
it is a crosshair seven hero the new
socket am 4 X 4 70 motherboard successor
to the crafter 6 hero which I've used in
several builds and I already actually
already have one of these I got one of
these in the shipment that came directly
from AMD but here it is a quick look at
least at the crosshair 7 hero
this board has really good power
delivery I'm told it's just better than
the crosshair 6 the only thing that's
missing compared to the crosshair 6 it
does not have the am-3 mounts in the
crop that's what actually using the
crosshair 6 hero in order to mount an
older-style cooler the the CR 95 to get
a family's cooler on there for risin but
beyond that it's got pretty much better
everything a couple m dot two slots and
it does also feature the fixed IO shield
how much is a trend that I'm very happy
to say it's becoming more and more
popular so hopefully we'll see that's
basically take off and like there won't
be an IO shield anymore because they're
all just pre attached
and I have one final package for today
and this is a product that we saw
context it is the liquid fusion on one
CPU cooler and this one is unique
because they have a different design for
the pump and impeller and it's actually
got a flow indicator built into it and
they're also using addressable digital
RGB LEDs as opposed to you know the kind
that just has one RGB connection oh look
they've also included a coolant refill
this is the first time I've seen a
liquid cooler that comes with the
coolant refill I wonder if that is
something that they're gonna make a
standard or if they're expecting some
level of evaporation with this cooler to
take place not sure the interesting
thing about this one is that the pump is
actually out here this is the pump very
small unit so that needs its own little
plug for that it's turning 40 millimeter
radiator pretty standard size there and
then this over here was actually I
believe the fill port yeah so this is
where you can refill this if maybe it
starts to show air bubbles in here
something I'm not exactly sure they have
instructions that they've included as
well for the refill they want you to be
very careful and test it outside of the
case after you've done it but still
interesting and I'm not sure how many
people actually gonna go ahead and do
that beyond that though they've also
included some velcro straps which is
nice this is all of your installation
kit including some thermal paste and a
spreader as well as metal chromed back
plates here sick those are for Intel
sockets so that's included and then as
mentioned digital RGB LEDs so that means
they're Dressel so you can get a rainbow
throughout the thing rather than just
having it all be the same color so if
you happen to have a motherboard that
has the digital out I know like some
asus boards and some gigabyte words I've
seen have started including that it's
not the 4-pin RGB header it's a three
pin RGB header so it's got one for power
and then the two other connections are
just a digital connection so you get
more control over it and you can
individually address the LEDs this comes
with an inline controller as well as a
splitter so you can actually plug
individually the pump as well as each
fan into it so they're going to deal
with a decent amount of cabling for this
type of thing but
the included remote here just little
handheld one will let you cycle through
some basic color patterns which are
actually pretty nice and also I would
say different difference and distinct
from the typical just RGB rainbow cycle
that you would get so I would say that's
a distinct and different looking
all-in-one liquid cooler from inner max
here I can't speak to the performance of
it but definitely very unique when it
comes to aesthetics so and guys that
pretty much wraps it up for my unboxing
extravaganza today if I made perfectly
honest I really just wanted to do an
unboxing of the gamers Nexus mod matte
because I thought that would be a nice
troll for Steve so thumbs up and
everyone send this over to Steve and let
him know how badly i trolled him other
than that I'll post links to all the
stuff that I've unboxed where relevance
down in the video's description so check
that out if you're interested in any of
these products hit thumbs up button any
way out if you enjoyed this video and
I'll be back soon with more tech news
videos here on pulse hydrate thanks for
