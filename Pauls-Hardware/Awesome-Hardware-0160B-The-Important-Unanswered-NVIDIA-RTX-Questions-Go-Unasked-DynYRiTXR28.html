so you got this fam everything's perfect
you totes got this hi everyone welcome
to awesome hardware live show we talked
about technology we drink a few beers
beers
occasionally we use adult language so
adult adult language warning and Jax
extreme every Tuesday evening 5:30 p.m.
Pacific time we usually split the show
in half first half has already been
streamed on Kyle's YouTube channel bit
way so like that is in the description
if you missed it
second stream to my channel pulse
Hardware we're streaming the whole thing
to twitch dot TV / awesome hardware as
well and we are a little messed up today
because we just recently got back from
traveling visited Europe few places in
Europe and we are jet-lagged yeah I am
more jet lag than Kyle I am feeling it
though woods just had brings you up to
speed
yep so this is gonna be a relatively
quick half and you'll bear with us that
by next week we should be totally fine
yeah next week will be much better so I
I specifically in purposely chose
stories to discuss today that require
like minimal thoughts it's just basic
straightforward information that I can
just sort of feed to you kind of
regurgitate done and you just kind of be
like okay that's how it is so I'm gonna
keep it straightforward today move
through things and hopefully I will not
pass out mid-show if you are not
impressed no if you're impressed if
you're pretty you should be impressed
they're already just fawning over us
you'd be very impressed with the show so
far so of course you want to spend money
on us if you want to do that go to
pulsar burn at night you can buy stuff
for my store shirts mugs pint glasses
it's all super nice stuff we we
gratefully thank you if you buy things
from our stores you can also buy stuff
from Kyle bit weight tech slash doors
his
and if you buy stuff during the show at
the end of the show we will thank you
for it by saying Joe Johnson and your
name Johnson glorious that's how that
works
all right I think I think things are
going right so far getting through it
I'm feeling good so some tech news I do
have some tech news to share
whoo yeah we talked some tech news on
cows apps like new new Intel processors
yeah and video graphics cards and new
video graphics cards that's that's what
lots of people are talking about this is
new Nvidia graphics cards but that stuff
that we're starting with we're starting
with AMD second gen rising pro hmm an
Athlon pro these are supposedly
announcement slides that have leaked
this is published just today video cards
dot-com since these are leaks they are
not confirmed we're not sure if they're
true or not but these are the actual
things they appear to have watermarks of
HD technology on them because they were
sourced from PCE VA and HD technolog
technology yeah websites that's right
that's where video cards got this
information from so if this is true then
they are the people who leaked it but
rising Pro stuff what's the deal with
that very similar to the rise into stuff
already you'd like the 2700 X and
everything they just put the pro on the
end makes it professional sometimes the
frequencies are like a little bit lower
there might be slight variations like
the 2700 X Pro is a 95 watt TDP versus
the 2700 X which is 105 watt TDP and
it's like 200 megahertz slower but these
these have these often have
compatibility I believe with like the
to the TPM trusted platform stuff it's
it's their their their more advanced
features often for security and use in
an enterprise environments and that's
why a lot of times they make these
rising Pro processors they did the same
thing with the first gens de they're a
little bit more appropriate for your
enterprise use for people integrate that
way I think there's also some stuff with
like the longevity of the platform
that's promised with rising Pro cuz
that's often a concern for people who
are buying large you know hardware and
large scale they want to make sure that
they can get replacements for it
do I have longer warranties I don't I
don't know I mean I think the typical
warranty is what three years for a
processor so I don't know if the
warranty itself is different like that
would be um a selling point for approach
it they're also releasing something
called a risin Pro 200 GE 200 which is a
dual core with SMT so four threads two
cores four threads and it's got Vega
three graphics built into it with a 3.2
gigahertz base clock and a 35 watt TDP
so it's not a PU yes essentially it's a
neighbor who I believe it's it's based
on the right Raven Ridge first gen resin
didn't get a pro based apu did they
unless I missed it first gen risin
didn't really have ap use I mean they
had APU they had some ap use based on
not even Xen yeah the presents stuff but
think it was a bristol ridge whatever
that was but yeah but yeah so some
people might be interested in this the
thing that I was most interested about
this is is that there's some like maybe
the introduction of these pro skews
might might trickle down to well no
because they're not announced here
there's no pro AP use like the 2400 GE
and stuff so I don't know what the deals
according to the slides the announcement
for these is September 6th which is in
two days and the sales of them are
expected on September 18th which is in a
couple weeks
okay of course it's all probably lies
probably lies links to the Articles
we're talking about today are in the
description if you want to look at the
slides themselves that's published on
video cards next up though more more AMD
stuff 7 nanometre is the process note
that they're working on with their next
gen stuff both on the on the CPU side
and the GPU side with Xen 2 on the CPU
side and not the follow up to Vega for
GPU architecture which they've done some
demonstrations of seven nanometer
hardware they published this on their
just on the AMD website so just it's
just them being like seven nanometer
we're done with it we're going forward
with it and apparently they're promising
it still in 2018 they they are planning
to launch a 7 nanometre GPU in late 2018
which is good news I mean that's what
that's really like we've really liked
seeing what AMD competition has done and
the CPU side the past year and a half or
so I think since rise and lunched it'd
be great to see some of that on the GPU
side as well because especially after
that Nvidia Nvidia seems to have no need
to compete with itself by pricing its
new GPUs competitively with itself it's
just pricing them and a new tier yeah
higher up so maybe some competition from
na'vi might affect that but you know
this still remains a lot still remains
to be seen
you know it's possible that this year's
7 nanometre release would be on Vega
still or do you think that I don't think
so I mean I I think I think whatever
this is gonna be is gonna be Navi yeah I
mean a release according is that what it
says here yet it says second generation
Zen 2 CPU core and our new Navi GPU
architecture so it's that we've already
tapped out multiple 7 nanometre products
at tsmc including our first 17
GPU planned to live so later this year
and our first seven nanometers server
CPU their server CPU that we plan to
launch in 2019 I wonder I mean yeah
there's obviously the question of how
this is going to compare compete with
you know the high-end Nvidia offerings
mainly the RT X card 30 X 20 atti 28th
2017 2060 I don't know does AMD have
what it takes to compete at that level
because I mean even if they don't I mean
it would suck if they don't because then
you only have one option really at the
high end and then what we would probably
see is sort of like what we're seeing
now where AMD is kind of dominating the
or they're tackling the entry level and
mid-range market for 1080p and you know
to some degree 1440p gamers offering
decent prices and I think free sync is
also pretty appealing to a lot of gamers
cousin get monitors for cheap well I
don't know if there are any further
rumors as far as how like like I'm I'm
very curious as to what they're doing
for memory because yes there's a lot of
that's gonna affect the pricing a lot of
speculation was a lot of stuff was
holding Vega back was the fact that they
went with AJ in memory and and yields
for that or veil ability of that price
for that yeah NVIDIA has you know
they're next gen stuff he's using GD r 6
so I'd be curious to see if AMD has
changed up some stuff if they're going
with memory that's more readily
available or maybe more practical in
some ways you know a lot a lot of a lot
of that store mains to be seen but
hopefully this will represent some
competition other than that you know
it's all speculation but it's cool that
they're committing that they're gonna
have something out later this year cuz
it's already September so yeah that's in
the next 3-4 months at the latest yeah
so
that's that's that's all right anything
further than that no some Zen - so Zen -
CPUs will probably be faster and have
better overclocking maybe yeah there's
also speculation that and they might up
the core count on the mainstream
platform to equal the seats and 10 or 12
core CPUs to compete there it'd be
really cool to see better instructions
per clock and higher frequencies you
know what sendto so hopefully all that
stuff will happen all right
there was a case launch today the be
quite silent base 601 and I have linked
in the description the bit tech dotnet
review of it there's some mainly so I
can show you some pictures and stuff the
the solid base 600 that's pretty popular
case I don't know exactly what the
differences are with the 601 they said
they said we'd say a far better looking
you still get the choice of black orange
or silver highlights they're just in a
few accent areas around the sides
there's a look at the i/o there's the
Explorer we - the freshmen' does have
tempered glass now I would expect the
disks like the previous version they
would have a sign solid side panel and a
see-through and and a windowed version
because I know the original array 600
only had the acrylic it's got the cool
side panels that kind of wrap around the
top and pop off sound dampening still
got those orange grommets inside some
perforations and the power supply shad
so you can mount pumps and stuff and you
know they do have a window there's a
windowed version and use tempered glass
oh and it's got it's got a tray drawer
tray style thing for oh yeah breads and
stuff top modular breasts nice
that's cool something that means fans
maybe or yes so their conclusion was
that as as actually it's with some of
their initial pictures the front does
seem a little restricted when it comes
to airflow yeah and it was a pretty some
pretty dense filter filters that are
also built in so it's not the best when
it comes to cooling but it's super super
quiet so they still gave gave it the
recommended award right and that's
that's that's pretty much the quick
rundown of that again this this review
is linked in the description if you guys
want to check it out and don't put any
hot water proceed Amazon Huell worth one
trillion dollars winner was was briefly
worth one trillion dollars earlier today
they've stock traded as high as two
thousand and fifty dollars and fifty
cents per share which made made its
market cap over a trillion which is the
second US company to do that after Apple
did did also pass one trillion earlier
this year on August 2nd Wow so that's
that's impressive not I mean eventually
Amazon's gonna overtake Apple yes
they're there are no means my mind
because apples apples been public for 38
years
Amazon's been public for 21 years and
just also looking at recent trends they
they are on pace to overtake Apple oh
yeah here's here's a fun chart that you
know shows that that is insane Reds yeah
yeah the red ones God
so um beast you think with all that you
know they could pay their their
warehouse employees a reasonable salary
yeah we have heard about that how do we
is that I mean that's maybe something
they could look into you celebrate that
one trillion dollar mark right did drop
back down so they're not currently worth
of Chile and they were just just shy of
that then they can continue paying their
employees
so yeah I think obviously obviously in
order to reach that I need this is great
as much value as they can out of their
warehouse workers the only way we've
gotten where we are now paying our
bathroom breaks might also be someone if
they could celebrate um you know we're
finally reached a trillion bathroom
breaks for everyone today said back into
Kent your business so we'll do it again
when we hit two trillion all right
just something to shoot for what we got
T VGA so of course the RT X cards the
Nvidia RT x cards are are all what
people are talking about and stuff
whether people are talking about them
positively or talking about how they
hate in video because how dare they
charge such exorbitant prices for the
technology bastards and ray tracing
sucks but nevertheless and board
partners such as EVGA are rolling out
the third party designs which is kind of
cool I mean in the past there's been a
decent gap between when the actual GPU
launches and when we actually see the
signs like this so it's fun to see more
of them from the get-go and provide more
more potential options for people who
don't like the founder just founders
edition design that won't speak to
performance because we don't know what
the performance is yet when it comes
cooling no but your EVGA Jacob tweeted
picture earlier day of the new hybrid
r-tx twenty eighty from EVGA this is
sweet this is a picture of two-thirds of
the card because who wants to see the
rest of it yeah I don't know there's all
these stupid looks like as you can see
there are E's all over the fan blade the
fan looks like it has chickenpox it kind
of looks it's kinda gives me the
heebie-jeebies just a little bit right
like like tripping obeah like those
little things crawling over my skin
looks like a
Luna's pod just a little bit but as you
can see here there's liquid Oman liquid
cooling solution and a grated there this
is the hybrid series so features
all-in-one cooling EVG is quite a quite
a few all moan coolers recently I also
have this this one here which is the
hydro copper for the win three you know
they have assumed custom water block
designs the hydro copper for the one
three that we're looking at right here
which appears to be a wider design which
is most likely going to be for a custom
PCB especially designed PCB since it's
wider and then there's also a we already
saw that stupid hyper everyone who cares
about that
the hybrid copper XC which is a smaller
design which I'm I'm speculating is for
the reference design PCB for the twenty
eighty and twenty atti
see there in the corner hydro copper
tile hydro copper hydro meaning liquid
copper and copper meaningly conductive
material that's being used to that's
obviously they see a power of law
enforcement like you'll never you'll
never catch me copper right that's
that's what EVGA is go for that one jet
lag logic obviously they also have some
other of their designs that we've
already seen such as the triple triple
fan design and this final this one this
one blows this is a blower design haha
described is a vanilla blower type model
I'd like it vanilla blower and like a
model that blows wouldn't we all this is
like might this one actually cost the
low MSRP price that Jensen 9999 for the
2008 ETA V $9.99 for the for this awful
vanilla blower design yep not awful but
I mean just I'd like to see cards
actually selling
for those low quote-unquote prices that
yeah we're also listed along with the
with the founders edition designs right
there we go that's all that's all have
for news we're going to move on to the
next segment which just a classic sword
fight sword fight where's plow through
this where we argue all right first
question first question now this is a
question obviously Kyle night we were
off for a couple weeks we didn't do the
show and it came at a very poor time a
time when many of you were faced with a
question that you really needed an
answer to and probably could have used
our wisdom so I apologize for not being
able to address this earlier but we're
gonna address it now we're gonna we're
gonna we're gonna explain things for you
and and you're gonna be able to make a
decision for yourself at the end of this
to finally maybe get some closure
our TX on or off our TX on our TX off
it's what's been on everyone's mind for
the past two-plus weeks eating away at
your soul the question the question tile
on or off I'm gonna say our TX off be
quite jacks off says Kyle it's the easy
it's the easy answer I've kind of it's a
cop-out answer because obviously say
that with our TX off you'll be saving a
significant amount of performance and
performance at the end of the day is
what graphics cards are really about
primary focus and purpose of a graphics
card is to perform well in three
rendered situations and environments
RTX sure it'll make your image look
pretty and you'll look fancy and you'll
have cutting-edge graphics during your
gameplay but how much does that matter
if it's taking your performance so much
to the point or it's affecting your
gameplay and now all of a sudden your
gaming experience is less than ideal
because let's face it graphics have
never been the first and foremost
important part of game
it's the gameplay itself it's actually
being able to play and engage with the
game regardless of how it looks there
are games that were built 20 years ago
that that have performed better or have
been more highly reviewed across the
board than modern triple-a titles that
look super sexy
why because the gameplay is freaking
awesome and you know I don't know you
could turn our TX on you know have
better shadows and reflections in
battlefield 5 than all of the people
that are slaughtering you to the nth
degree because you cannot aim for shit
at 20 frames a second 1440p with our TX
I rest my case
you all know / Kyle is obviously wrong
the answer is our TX on because it's the
future and if we want light to work the
way light works then we need light to
work the way light works it's great
racing and it's not just ray tracing
there's not just the RT Kyle it's not
just RT ray tracing there's an X as well
and X represents the future the X
represents the unknown NEX represents
the potential for all mankind to come
together move forward
and to really to to grasp tomorrow
firmly and to just just give it a give
it a shake
give it a nice jiggle really feeling up
once that's why our th should be on
going that's what it comes down to okay
all right that was great I was gonna say
more than that but I really I just I
felt like I should cut myself up it's
probably for the best
alright what do we what did people think
RTX off or potentially in a
superposition of both on and off until
observed wow it's kind of staggering to
see how many people are saying just
screw or don't like our tanks great
racing you know it's it's good it's not
seeing a lot of opposition a lot of
opposition to to initial adoption it was
it's surprising until you plant a crisis
I'm glad I turn the AC on that's I put
the question AC off or a CIC on I think
we both would have argued our on it's so
much better
absolutely just feel it right now all
right we got one more question here
because the pixel three XL you see this
someone else left that pixel three XL in
the back of a lift
what yeah just just the pixels oh yes
yeah I saw it Quinn his picture text
about this see the nitrate bears yes
Suzanne smiley face the NOx looks like a
smiley face yeah like like big oh those
Quinn's tweet okay I got you okay genius
tweets looks like it's been used a
little bit it's got the finger is there
a Google rep maybe a Google employee
reviewer was this intentional it's
Austin Evans in the back of the car
really sure but what it was supposed to
happen though is that it's supposed to
have my pixels
I don't well I have mine mine's better
right cuz here's this functional out my
phone case pinched my beard
that really hurt I really hurt I'm in
pain
pixel three will I get it no I will not
because this phone still works until
this phone stops working or until I deem
it slow and obsolete I will continue
using it I like this phone I have the
pixel - I had a pixel one I'd probably
upgrade to the pixel three rut right
away because I think you know two years
at the rate things are changing the rate
smartphone tech is advancing like every
two years is adequate especially for
someone who's into tech obviously and
will utilize a lot of these features
Thank You Kyle for sure you don't wanna
dance while you were gone bullshitting
whatever you
we're doing what I do best hey here's
what it comes down to what said I don't
know how many people saw me tweet my
picture of this but this is my this is
my pixel excel it looks like it took a
bullet it looks like it seriously took a
freaking bullet it's but it really took
a battery it's in dire straits so this
is what happened this is this is like 30
hours before I was supposed to leave on
the trip to Germany and and other parts
of Europe it's just just horrible timing
so I had this battery pack this is a ten
thousand something milliamp hour battery
pack cut it for years it's fairly heavy
I've had it for years but it's very
trusty and it's got a 2 amp output so it
does fast charging so that's cool but
like I had it I was holding both of them
like this and it was plugged in charging
and I was distracted and it dropped
thought of my hands somehow the phone
landed and like this landed at the
corner of it right on there just just
like such bad luck that's my picks a
little XL and hurts it hurts me it cuts
me deep yeah I am not sure how bad the
damage is I mean the screen is is rest
was completely wrecked it was like still
trying to be on and like zapping a
little bit but like I'm still not
positive how that went but I do have a
replacement screen this is just arrived
today so this is my project for tomorrow
I'm going to be replacing the screen on
that because people keep asking me about
my solar panels and my follow-up video
on that I've been screen capping just at
various times the solar panel stuff on
this so my videos that I've screen
capped for my solar panel performance
from the Tesla app which I've been
saving on this are all on this phone
and that and they're not back because
it's it's an app I use and an that
backed up like the pictures are the
pictures get saved and it right so
that's why I need to have rescue that
phone that's nice
so hopefully I really hope you're fine
really up the screen replacement works
um if you know to get an extra month of
life out if nothing else but so anyway
the question that we were gonna argue
here is that should I get the pixel
three cuz that's coming out now you've
got the pixel to obviously so what do
you think I I went first last time okay
I'm gonna say yes I should I should get
the pixel three should get it it's new
it's a new thing to spend money on it my
pixel excels most my favorite phone ever
I did briefly get the pixel to excel
before I realize is just Pat as a poor
investment poor investment nobody should
get the pixel to you want to skip you
and go every other one it's like the
Star Trek movies you're under something
there
I am I am it doesn't it still doesn't
have a headphone jack right yeah didn't
bring that back I just I'm sad about
that I will be very sad about that oh
I'm over it now I've gotten so used to
so you've never been enough having it
but I mean do you meant do you primarily
use Bluetooth I do headphones now I have
my Bose QuietComfort tubes or whatever
quite pain to and that's the only time I
use headphones is with those headphones
and they're bluetooth I've just gotten
so used to just using bluetooth it's one
of those things you just get used to it
you get used to not having it
I guess my fear is that I would want to
I would want to be charging the phone
and also be using analog headphones with
the with the headphone jack at the same
time
I honestly get it janky dongle only
that's a great headphones with a with a
jack now all the other ones are
Bluetooth but yeah I get it the options
options it's all about options okay well
obviously know the nuts and that sucks
it's not sucks because I mean hey is
that really it seems like kind of like
it's phrased here as kind of a joke but
is this really a joke
like can't this be taken like a serious
as a serious option when a lot of people
in the PC space are buying components
strictly because they feature the right
kind of RGB lighting they contain and is
it not okay to say I'm not gonna buy
this phone simply based on how the
knotch looks like a semi winky cock-eyed
emoji is perfectly in line all right we
already do this constantly this is a
real valid option that I'm siding with
because Paul took the good option that I
would have ordinarily cited with that is
I rest my case I mainly wanted to see
what people think each other or not I
should get the pixel 3 XL so I said cock
that's true oh oh it's very very close
Wow we're within tuned we're within 2
votes so I think we'll have to give this
a little bit more time yeah more time
we'll come back to this in the future
all right yay that's all for my prepared
and stuff this is a heck to the yeah
this is a poorly planned half of the
show because of jet lag we're glad we're
blaming things on jet lag all right Sal
cut off the donations people in chat no
more donations they will not be read or
accounted for cut it up but we do

we can help by at least three or four
5-hour energies with that that's true
regain our strength always helpful
Phillip Braddock you sir $10 are you two
looking forward to read dead 2 coming
out next month
ooh yeah I beat the first one I fucking
love that game fun fact I haven't beat
GTA 5 or even GTA 4 at all you got close
but I've never bent the whole campaign
it's just too fun to just dick around I
never got the whole way through but I
did beat the first Red Dead Redemption
I beat GTA 5 on Xbox 360 that is it tall
order sir that's crazy is that it goes
back that far then eight like wow behold
and it was still viable a year plus four
for a head PC but yes Red Dead was one
of my favorite games at the time still
is can't wait I'm Michael Foreman for
sure
five dollars cute the good work guys
what am I your part to come in and my
new build is finally complete PS well an
H 110 I fit in an s3 40 LOL i dont know
LOL ugh 110 is a 280 right not to 40
grand which i think it will fit well it
might depend on the mother at the front
at the front I mean that's the only
place you can fit a 240 enough Brad I
think it will and that's 340 you you
want to double check though because I
know that the the Kraken X 62 will fit
if you orient it right in in the s3 for
cuz NZXT designed it to fit because it's
their own cooler I am there okay so
compatibility there works you just want
to make sure that the clearance on the
radiator and stuff is the same of
thicknesses all the same C so that your
rad doesn't run into the reservoir ball
bar you know old reservoir bar the s340
we passed yeah you should be good
without
if that's not an issue Robert at five
dollars while you were in a way while we
while you were in a way I think he means
while you were away
yes about a swordfight mousepad is
amazing
Chet what do you think we'll see first
cyberpunk 2077 released or Paul's htpc
well that was a tough call right there
assuming cyberpunk 2720 77 releases in
the Year 2077 I would say it's probably
about even that's about when it I like
that that gets me plenty of time plenty
of time see but also Robert you have a 5
star which seems to be a 5 star user
review on our desk mats man you should
all go buy a disk man or a mouse pad
there's true
they are very high quality I use one
every day gareth blundell 5 give up your
cap and forgot Matt Oh Matt Matt Lantry
Matt Landry $5 hey Colin Powell of you
guys looking to upgrade a 1080i but
waiting for the price dropped more what
do you think would be a good low price
for a 1080i you get one for like 600
bucks
that'd be 600 or be a good low price
that'd be awesome you know and that $600
be great
and then obviously yes as for right now
I wouldn't expect it to drop any lower
than that
I mean look for prices right now because
I'm into it they're supposed to be a lot
of image out there so they might be
suppose there there might be some deals
coming up for holiday season but but
yeah and I don't I'm not gonna expect it
to drop too much unless an AMD really
does like come out with navi and it's
really good
yeah vailable and all that true dad
thank you very much mr. LaMotte next we
got Gareth Blundell 5 hey guys I'm up
late in the UK upgrading my rig that was
inspired by Arctic the other I just have
been drinking and having real trouble
connecting fans piece that's drinking
and building yeah just cause some
conflict occasionally sometimes if you
do the drink end builds then it helps to
come back to it the next day and just
just make sure everything was all the
fans of the radio games like anything
you do when you're inking yeah check it
the next day sober give a little double
check car MOS j7t $10 hey guys I have a
2700 x MSI X 470 gaming 16 gigs of
course in memory at 3,400 Evo 970 256
boot drive and harddrive GPU dual XFX RX
5 80s 8 gigs in crossfire any upgrades I
need for need for next year games next
year's games I would consider a GPU
upgrade at some point I mean 5 80s in
crossfire is pretty nice but I feel like
you're gonna see diminishing utility for
the 2 way configuration yeah going
forward so you know a more powerful
single GPU might might be something to
consider
yeah oh yeah you got a real nice setup
so I think you're cool for now
everything else looks great tenor brush
Auber $5 a brush a burr brush Ebert ok
super good day service enunciation of it
any info on the new bit with logo
otherwise can Lyle and bucks the new
r-tx cards love you both I was thinking
about doing a drunken boxing for the
r-tx review
well yeah or a drunk review in general
like I just love the benchmarks like
clearly as one's better than this one
like just like really completely
plastered that could help you stand out
I also like to get drinks sometime but
the billet logo contest it did end maybe
a week or two ago I've been in Europe
for the last week or two as well so
that's why that's that's been lagging
but I haven't forgot about it
wifey sauce and I will be sifting
through the results or the entries
sometime this week and we'll be reaching
out to any of the designers who have
come up with them some logos we'd like
to work with and yes all the prizes and
stuff will be carried out I'm actually
thinking about upping the prize oh just
a bit
Loren's some more just for the walls or
pedigrees no it's already sealed off
just just you know for their efforts and
stuff I just feel like you know graphic
design work is good good graphic design
work is hard to come by and it should be
recognized appropriately but yes a new
bitly logo will be coming soon we have
to look through the entries so thanks
for hanging out up though Zaidan Zidan
exciting
typing claymore $5 what company would
you recommend for good value per dollar
on custom-built gaming computers I'm
looking for slight overclocking in solid
parts honestly I really liked the the
NZXT BLD experience it literally just
seemed like like a friend or someone I
trusted like built a PC for me and sent
it to me two days shipping was just
fucking unbeatable for a custom build
and and you get to sort of customize it
yourself
boot through the site you can even like
to pick whatever games that you while
you can pick up the three games and the
sort of FPS from performance that you
expect to get from those games and it'll
sort of like help part out a system for
you it's kind of a no-brainer so it'll
give you sort of a recommendation for
for an outfitted system but then from
there you can even customize it further
it's like you don't have to go with our
recommendation they can give you that
what they think is great and then you
can swap it out however you like I
haven't really had much personal
experience with other boutique
boutique manufacturers the only one I've
had a direct experience with recently
would be main gear and that's not who I
recommend for good value per dollar they
do have some entry-level systems that
you that you can get a better deal on
there like most of extreme but they tend
to be relatively you know a good deal
more expensive than you would spend if
you were putting it together yourself
yeah you could do really good work and
you know if you if you want something
that has like a long-term warranty and
like you know I think it's 24/7 support
and everything then then it's a good
solution but my fila consumer that's a
bit more of a balance between what
you're spending versus what do you get
then you know something like like like
the NZXT might feel better but think
he's I mean
yep and then psych psych 10/10 for $10
Tanner Bruce uber Hannover shabu-shabu
please say thank you it's reinforcing
that name that name drop and then $5
