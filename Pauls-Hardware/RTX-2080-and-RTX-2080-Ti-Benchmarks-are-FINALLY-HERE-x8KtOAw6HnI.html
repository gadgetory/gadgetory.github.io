learn more hello everyone and welcome at
last to my GeForce r-tx series review
video where I can finally share
benchmarks and testing results for the
r-tx 2080 and 2080 TI
my focus today is gonna be on the
founders editions versions of both GPUs
with comparisons to the GTX 1080 TI the
GTX 1080 and the AMD Radeon Vegas 64 I
tested in 4k 1440 and 1080 so if you're
impatient you can jump to the benchmarks
at that time code in this video for now
though let's briefly talk about the new
technology in these Touring based GPUs
and why I'm mostly ignoring it in this
review so the GTX 10 series was based on
the Pascal architecture and this
launched in 2016 but then in 2017 and
video developed new GPUs and was based
on the follow up Volta architecture but
they didn't actually launch any
consumer-focused volta products like
GPUs because there was nothing from
Radeon to compete with after Vegas
lackluster launch in 2017 so now in 2018
we have the touring architecture which
like volta features tensor cores for
hardware based AI acceleration and also
now rate racing or RT cores for hardware
accelerated real-time rate racing
the question is how it is AI or rate
racing affect your gaming experience or
the performance of Turing based GPUs so
for AI the practical application that
NVIDIA has demonstrated is DL SS or deep
learning super sampling per Nvidia DL SS
leverages a deep neural network to
extract multi-dimensional features of
the rendered scene and intelligently
combined details from multiple frames to
construct the high quality final image
simply put this allows the GPU to render
half of the pixels in any given frame
and then halve the tensor cores work out
how to intelligently fill in the rest of
the pixels based on what the AI has
learned over time resulting in reduced
GPU overhead and better performance
unfortunately outside of a Final Fantasy
15 demo that was distributed we can't
really test this in any real-world games
implementation is promised in about 25
existing or upcoming games so this will
be something to return to once the
software catches up now as for those RT
cores that were specially built for
ray-tracing we're kind of in the same
situation with the software and that we
really don't have any games available
that we can effectively test with
battlefield 5 is the game that Nvidia
demoed at the events creating a whole
archie X on our TX off meme in the
process but even that title won't
implement rate racing until a patch
sometime after launch and video is
currently listing ten games that are
promising real-time rate racing support
in the future and DirectX ray-tracing
for Windows itself is coming as part of
the Windows 10 October 2018 update so we
still have some time before ray-tracing
is a thing personally I do think
ray-tracing is good generally speaking
it's the next step in realistic lighting
for gaming and other applications but
the real question is does this bring
value to the consumer that justifies the
exorbitant cost of these graphics cards
and for now the answer to that is
definitely no and video needed to get
the hardware out there though to support
ray-tracing so hopefully now that the
hardware is out there for some people
software development will start to
implement support in a meaningful and
measurable way for future titles so
other than the tensor cores for AI and
the RT cores for ray tracing what else
is actually new with touring there is
some good news Nvidia says that Turing
sports a dramatic 1.5 X boost in shading
efficiency per kuduk or compared to
Pascal that's enabled by two key
architectural changes a new independent
integer data path allowing integer and
floating-point operations to run
concurrently which should boost
asynchronous compute performance
remember when talking about async
compute performance was all the rage
with GPUs as well as a new memory path
for each SM unit to unify shared memory
texture caching and memory load caching
into one unit also we've now upgraded to
GPU boost 4.0 which features a second
temperature inflection point to provide
an easing off of clock speeds in case of
overheating versus a more significant
drop to the GPUs base frequency which is
how it worked before so now let's move
on to benchmarks and for these
benchmarks I'm attempting to be
practical by focusing on existing
software and games that you can play
right now if you buy these graphics
cards with a mix of DirectX 11 and
DirectX 12 titles and I'm pretty much
ignoring the attend sir cores in the RT
cores and the RT x ops things because
they're not practical for home users
right now my test system though is going
to be an intel core i7 87
k64 12th red processor running at 4.6
gigahertz on all cores and then 4.8
gigahertz turbo on one or two cores the
motherboard is an asus rog Strix z 370 -
i yes its mini ITX it was supposed to be
portable and then the memory is a
g-scale flare x16 gig kits that's 2 by 8
gigs and dual channel mode ddr4 3200
speed cast latency 14 for cooler have
the Noctua NHL 12s low-profile cooler
within Noctua NF a 12 X 25 PWM 120
millimeter fan on top and then for a
main operating system drive the Samsung
960 pro nvme m2 512 gig SSD now for
comparison I have chosen manufacturer
overclocked graphics cards this is for a
couple reasons first of all it's been a
couple years since the 10 series
launched if you're gonna buy one of
these cards chances are you're gonna buy
a third-party adding board vendors
version of the cards and there's also a
decent chance that those cards are going
to be overclocked some even if you're
buying a reference design or a stock
clocked version of a 1080 or 1080 TI
overclocking them is very simple and
these are only going to be running at
about 1900 to 2000 megahertz which is a
very reasonable manufacturer overclocked
for just about anyone who buys one of
these cards so to that end of the asus
RG Strix gtx 10 80 TI 11 gig right here
this is the OC version and then I have
the EVGA GeForce GTX 280 for the win -
also a manufacturer overclocked version
eight gigs of memory on that one and
then for AMD I am comparing their
fastest currently available graphics
cards the Radeon Vegas 64 and this is
also the asus rog Strix version of that
which comes with a manufacturer
overclock of 1590 megahertz
on the GPU so my first slide here is
actually the frequencies that all the
cards are running at which is a good way
to start before we look at benchmark
result numbers each card has a boost
clock as well as a base clock then
there's the max frequency that it hit
and then the average frequency that it
was running at under load the r-tx 2080
founders Edition has a base clock of
1515 a boost of 1800 it was actually
boosting up to as high as 1980 but while
under load over time is running at
around 1905 the 20 atti founders Edition
has a base of 1350 a boost of 1635 was
boosting up to about 1950 but only
briefly as it was running at around 1740
megahertz under load and our first test
3dmark fire strike this is ultra mode in
4k and here we can see the dominance of
the 28
and this is going to continue a spoiler
alert the 28th ETI wins everything so
I'm gonna use that kind of as my zero
points that's hundred-percent
performance right there and if you
compare the other cards here and I'm
really just looking at the graphics
score twenty eighty founders Edition is
about twenty percent slower coming in
with the score of 60 for 52 whereas the
1080 TI was about 90 percent slower
scoring 7403 Vegas 64 unfortunately
coming in last with a score of $53.99
that's about 33% slower than the 2080 ti
next up is 3d mark times pi this is a
direct x12 test again the 2080 ti
founders edition coming in with a
massive thirteen thousand two hundred
and eighty six the highest score i've
ever achieved with a single GPU 2080
founders edition still performing quite
well with two score of ten thousand
seven hundred ninety nine here it does
outperform the Strix gtx 980ti
which might be an indication of the
asynchronous compute improved
performance and then finally for
synthetics is VR mark blue room a bit of
a virtual reality focused test here it
actually wants a score over a hundred
frames per second and I still haven't
achieved that with any GPU although the
twenty atti came very close with a score
of ninety eight point nine frames per
second and this is actually just about
double the score of the GTX 1080 and the
Vegas 64 next here is ashes of the
singularity escalation DirectX 12 test
and this is running on crazy presets at
4k here we have a score of seventy seven
point four frames per second all the way
down the line to the Vegas 64 coming in
with forty four point six frames per
second forty two percent behind the
score of the twenty atti now moving over
to 2560 by 1440 we can see a similar
breakdown when it comes to the overall
performance with the 2080 ti winning
again and since the 2080 Ti is really
running away with it here I think the
comparison is gonna be between your art
GX 2080 founders Edition which is 800
bucks and the GT x 1080 TI which you can
usually get for around 650 to 700
dollars I'm marking this one as 700
bucks so keep an eye on those two as we
switch over to 1920 by 1080 101 point
seven frames per second for the 2080 ti
but the 1080 TI is beating the 2080
founders Edition here with a score of 90
point nine frames per second and now
here's rise of the Tomb Raider in 4k
this is also DirectX 12 I did not test
shout of the
tomb raider for these benchmarks but I
will be testing that in the future 20
atti with a score of 71 point 8 frames
per second and here the 2080 and the
1080 TI are pretty much neck and neck
with a little over 57 fps here at 2560
by 1440 the 2080 ti runs away with it
once again with a hundred and thirty two
point four frames per second on average
and then the 2080 and 1080 TI are also
battling out at about a hundred and
seven fps both of these are 19% behind
the 2080 TI and that 1080 even with its
overclock is just half of the
performance of the 2080 ti so that's a
pretty impressive number there as well
finally for 1920 by 1080 hundred and
seventy FPS for that 2080 TI and here we
did get some additional performance out
of the 1080 Ti so it was able to beat
the 2080 with a score of hundred and
sixty-four point 2 frames per second and
now here's GTA 5 I will continue to run
this benchmark as long as it continues
to be a popular game the people are
playing which will probably last until
GTA 6 comes out that said at 4k 97
frames per second this is again the best
single GPU performance I've seen in this
game especially at 4k
although the 1080 Ti is showing an
impressive followup with 80 frames per
second moving over to 2560 by 1440 157
overall fps for the 2080 Ti and then
finally with the 1920 by 1080 squares we
can see that we're pretty much CPU
limited entirely with the 2080 ti 2080
and 1080 Ti scoring 864 fps and then
just a little bit of fall off for the
1080 while the biggest 64 comes in with
a respectable 128 FPS but still 22
percent behind the performance of the
2080 I founders Edition here is total
war Warhammer - or running the campaign
benchmark in the ultra presets and at
3840 by 2160 again 20 ATI wins was 69
frames per second 1080 TI and 2080 are
pretty much neck and neck here as well
although if we move over to 2560 by 1440
the 2080 founders Edition gains a little
bit of a lead with a 92 frames per
second score versus 84 FPS from the 1080
TI finally for a 1920 by 1080 were once
again hitting a some CPU limitations so
we're scoring about a hundred and 20
frames per second for the highest end
cards although we do still have a drop
for the 1080 and the poor Vegas 64
coming in with a 40% lower score than
they 2080
TI in this test but that's okay because
it does a little bit better in
battlefield one this is battlefield 1 at
4k DirectX 11 mode 20 80 80 TI comes in
with over 100 frames per second the
Vegas 64 is at least able to beat the
GTX 1080 in this test with a score of 60
one FPS versus 56 at 2560 by 1440 we
have a very impressive 171 fps by the
28th epi so for those of you looking at
1440 high refresh rate monitors I think
this might be a good choice for you if
you have the money of course and even
that's 2080 founders Edition coming in
with 138 FPS here but if we move over to
1920 by 1080 we're again a little bit
CPU limited scoring around 190 frames
per second for the 1080i and 20 atti
drops off a little bit with the 2080 and
then the for the win to 1080 coming in
144 frames per second and finally here's
overwatch for running with epic settings
so at 4k that actually is pretty
challenging for a lot of GPUs we could
see the Vegas 64 only managing 71 frames
per second here that is 43% behind the
2080 TI which comes in at 125 frames per
second and here again the 1080 TI is
pulling its weight with a score 111
frames per second handily beating out
the 2080 founders edition if we moved to
2560 by 1440 we can see some very
impressive high frame rates so again for
those of you guys who are looking at
higher frustrate monitors that is part
of the reason why I included these lower
resolution and benchmarks including 1920
by 1080 but 231 frames per second for
the 2080 ti again best single GP
performance that I have seen in this
test and finally here's your in 1920 by
1080 results we are hitting the actual
frame limit for the game itself 300 fps
with the 2080 Ti and the 1080 Ti we're
actually bumping into the game this
frame limit which is 300 FPS for this so
with a 2080 eye and the 1080i we're
pretty much right up against that drop
back a little bit for the 2080 founders
edition with 262 fps and the 1080 come
in with in with 224 and finally here are
some power draw numbers for you was
measured at peak as well as on average
during the 3d mark firestrike ultra
combined test I'd say the most
impressive thing here is that the 20
atti founders Edition has a lower
average power draw than the 1080 TI
while also sporting that much improved
performance as you've seen with the
tests we've just gone over 20 80
founders a day
is drawing a bit more than the 1084 the
wind - so maybe a little bit of a
drop-off in efficiency there but still
definitely not bad at all especially
when you compare it to the Vegas 64
which was drawing 470 on average with a
peak of over 550 watts as for
temperatures these are just the peak
temperatures I saw during my standard
testing 2080 founders Edition peaked at
78 Celsius the 28th ETI founders Edition
peaked at 80 I'm gonna do a little bit
more expansive temperature testing with
overclocking taken into account as well
when I do my overclocking video which is
gonna be coming up very soon so don't
forget to subscribe if you haven't
already for that one but that's pretty
much it for the numbers I have gathered
for you guys actually I take that back I
have a few more numbers for you guys
because I wanted to sort of gather all
this stuff up into a ball and sculpt it
into some form of addressable easily
digestible information for you guys so
so I took all the scores from every
single test that I ran and I gathered
them together to create some averages so
we can compare the performance as well
as the price to performance let's look
just a performance first of all if you
consider the 1080 to be your baseline so
that's like your 100% performance mark
across all of my tests the Vegas 64 was
10% slower which is kind of sad so we're
looking forward to AMD's new stuff which
hopefully be coming will be coming in q4
1080 TI is 31% faster than the 1080 the
2080 founders Edition is 25% faster so
it did come in a little bit slower
overall than the 1080 TI and then the
2080 ti founders Edition was 50% faster
so going from 1080 to 2080 about a 25%
performance increase that's not too bad
that's actually what we would expect
maybe a little bit more than you'd
expect going from generation to
generation or maybe a little bit less
than you'd expect if you're considering
that it's been two years since the last
generation if we use the 1080 Ti though
as our baseline that's your 100% mark
for performance the Vega 64 is 69% of
that the 1080 is 76% of that the 2080
founders Edition is 95% of that so 5%
slower and the 20 80 TI founders Edition
is 114 percent as fast so 14 percent
improvement going from 10 80 TI to 20 80
TI but we can't just look at the
performance numbers in a vacuum we have
to compare them to the price that they
are charging for these cards so for the
three comparison cards I looked right
now to
and good prices for what they're
charging right now for the cards Vegas
64 you can get for about five hundred
and eighty bucks the ten eighty you can
get for about five hundred bucks but if
you're going for a higher-end
overclocked manufacturer designed
versions about five hundred fifty bucks
is the price I'm using for that seven
hundred bucks for the Strix gtx 980ti
i was actually harder to find right now
but since you can get him for his
cheapest 650 I thought 700 bucks was a
good price for a manufacturer
overclocked one and then the twenty
eighty founders Edition costs $800 and
the twenty atti founders Edition costs
$1,200
there are potentially going to be lower
prices for the twenty eighty and twenty
eighty I but I'm not going to take those
prices into account unless they're
actually selling for those prices I'm
not going to be fooled like I was with
the 1070 which supposedly was gonna be
three hundred and seventy bucks when it
launched and never actually was so here
again if we take the 1080 as the
baseline price the Vegas 64 is about 5%
more the 1080i is about 27% more the
2080 founders edition of it's about
forty five percent more and the twenty
atti founders edition is a hundred and
eighteen percent more so line that up
with the performance and for the twenty
eighty you're paying forty five percent
more for about twenty five percent more
performance on this scale sticking with
the ten eighty as the baseline for the
twenty eight ETI
you're paying one hundred and eighteen
percent more for 50 percent more
performance but that's not quite as fair
if we switch over and use the ten eighty
TI price as the baseline then you're
paying fourteen percent more for a
twenty eighty four five percent less
performance or you're paying seventy one
percent more for a twenty eighty TI for
fourteen percent more performance and
that I think really is the story of it
when it comes down to these GPUs and
what NVIDIA has done with the pricing my
actual thought process as I was going
through these numbers and especially
comparing the price to performance is
that Nvidia shouldn't have called these
twenty eighty and twenty atti they
should have made a new Titan class
differentiate Titan with a few different
versions I mean they already have the
Titan X and the XP and all those call
these that and then people might be like
okay a $1200 Titan we've seen that
before and it's somewhat within the
range of reason but I have critiqued
Nvidia before for their titan class
cards and how they've used those as sort
of halo products to sort of gradually
increase the cost of the mainstream
consumer
focus graphics cards and now we've
jumped from the most expensive consumer
focused graphics card being say 700 ish
dollars outside of the special edition
versions to $1200 that's a pretty
significant bump and for anyone who's
looking at price to performance or is on
a budget at all it's just very difficult
to recommend these cards the 2080 maybe
is a little bit more of a reasonable
offer but unless you just got money
falling out of your but then the 2080 TI
is really not gonna be the way to go
that said all the pre-orders have sold
out everywhere so obviously lots of
people must have money falling out of
their butts but that's pretty much all I
have for this video you guys I hope all
of these numbers and analysis and
everything have helped you guys I am
still just digesting them as myself so I
do have a follow up video with some
overclocking plans and I'm of course
gonna be doing further coverage on these
cards as well as special third-party
adding board versions of these cards
like this Asus Strix version of the 2080
ti which has a 2.7 slot cooler and the
new fan design and its manufacturer
overclocked to but more on that in a
future video if you guys enjoyed this
one definitely hit the thumbs up button
