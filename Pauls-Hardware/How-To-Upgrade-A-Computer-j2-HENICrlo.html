Pauls hardware this video is going to be
part two of my four-part kind of mini
series on how to build a computer from a
beginner's perspective in part one I
built this computer for about $500 have
a full beginner's step-by-step guide so
click the card up there or the link down
in the description if you want to check
out that video as well as lists of all
the parts that I'm using today as well
as back then these parts here I'll be
using to upgrade this system today so
I'm going to be going over how to
upgrade a CPU upgrade memory upgrade
your graphics card add a system fan as
well as adding additional system storage
and then into more videos coming up soon
I'll be going over the first things that
I do after the system is built as in
installing windows and getting
everything figured the way I want it as
well as a comparison between the
performance of this build right here as
well as the upgraded build once all
these parts are installed I have already
tested the system as is and I can say
it's pretty impressive for the price but
I think we can do a little bit better
let's run down the upgrade parts I'll be
using this little project now if you
were to buy these parts outright as well
as most of the parts from this system at
least the ones that aren't being
replaced by these it would cost you
between seven hundred and twenty to
seven hundred and sixty or so US dollars
that's not including a Windows license I
am maybe or maybe not including the
price of the hard drives because these
are salvaged I just have a couple
different examples from old builds or
old systems so again if you have an old
500 gig - one or two terabyte hard drive
lying around you can easily pop that
into the system
save yourself 40 or 50 bucks as for
upgrading though going from the easiest
parts to upgrade to the more difficult
parts memory of course is simplest just
adding a second stick of memory beyond
that it's a this stuff here is a little
bit more difficult graphics cards pretty
easy to pop in and then we just need to
connect the power connector fan we do
need to mount to the side panel and then
just plug in the three pin power hard
drives need a power cable from the power
supply and to say that data cable from
the motherboard and then the CPU is
what's going to be most difficult simply
because we need to remove the old CPU
and then we're going to be dealing with
some cleaning of thermal paste but it's
not all that challenging especially if
you are prepared so apart from the
original build that I have right there
and I'm going to be slightly
disassembling I have my accessories and
tools from the
original kits my rubber mat to keep
things safe on surface I'm working on
scissors and a screwdriver from my
motherboard accessories I have a single
SATA cable the other one that came in
the package as well as all the screws
and everything that came with the case
accessories now we won't be using these
for today's video but you should
definitely have them if you're doing a
system build one is going to be a USB
Drive just a small one you need a
minimum of 4 gigabytes that's just to
make our Windows 10 installer I like
having an external drive just to plug in
and make sure everything that might be
on the computer that we are changing or
updating or upgrading is backed up and
making a system image is also a great
way to get back on your feet and finally
like it or not we are going to need
another computer because we need
something that's internet connected with
a USB port in order to make our Windows
10 installer again I'll be covering that
in the next video so stay tuned for it
maybe hit the subscribe button if you
want to be appraised when that one goes
live finally for our CPU removal and
replacement I have a kit here to deal
with the thermal paste now I have this
stuff from Arctic clean for removing and
cleaning the thermal paste in the
thermal contact area if you don't have
that you can use alcohol I have 91% here
you got high percentage alcohol but
maybe you had not quite 100% hundred
percent a lot I also have some stuff for
cleaning the thermal paste I like to use
coffee filters if you have them
available if not paper towels work just
fine just make sure they don't get lint
and fibers everywhere also some q-tips
are very helpful to that and of course I
need some replacement thermal paste for
when we replace the CPU heatsink fan
so let's start off with the easiest
upgrade that's going to be system memory
I originally had a single 8 gig ddr4
dimm in here I chose that because the
original motherboard I used had only two
DIMM slots and that would allow you to
get 8 gigs now and then add a gigs later
if you are buying the system outright I
might consider going with a 2 by 4 gig
kit to give yourself dual channel right
out of the gate or maybe just buy the 16
gigs right away so what you need to be
concerned about when you're upgrading
memory is going to be making sure that
the sticks are gonna play nice together
and as long as you have ddr4 it should
at least work at the minimum speeds
which is going to be just fine for a
motherboard that you can't do
overclocking with anyway like this
you're not going to be able to access
XMP settings on this for example so what
I'm installing is just the second stick
from my two by 8 gig kit if you don't
have a to buy whatever gig kit outright
then make sure you buy the exact same
stick of memory once again if that's not
available just make sure that at least
well that it's ddr4 that it is the same
capacity so if you're adding another 8
gig stick or if you're adding another
stick make sure it's another 8 gig stick
along with that one at least the ones
that are met and matched channels and
then finally at least try to make sure
that the speed is going to be equal this
one for example is 2666
but you might be looking at 2130 3 or
2400 the only other thing you have to
worry about is double checking that
manual to make sure that you're
installing it in the right slots usually
for dual channel capability it's going
to be every other slot so it's pretty
tough to get wrong but beyond that we're
just going to install just like we did
with the original system build by
popping that latch out making sure once
again that our notch is aligned dropping
that down straight and evenly and then
applying firm pressure on both sides to
snap it into place and tada we have
upgraded our memory next let's install
this case fan and with a lot of budget
cases you will get a minimal amount of
fans installed that is the case with
this case AHA which only came with
120-millimeter fan upfront which was
again perfectly adequate for the system
as is with a dual core and a fairly low
power only drawing 75 watt GPU
since there's no extra power for it for
this one only 75 watts is what it gets
through the PCI Express bus
I digress as though adding another fan
will give us a bit of extra airflow for
everything in here and keep everything a
bit cooler since we're upgrading to
parts that will generate a little bit
more heat when we're adding a fan we
have to pay attention to airflow so
right now we have an intake in the front
and we have two other locations we can
put a fan a lot of cases we'll have vans
at the top here for this case has the
power supply at the top sometimes power
supplies at the bottom and you'll have
some places for exhaust at the top this
one has a place back here which would
probably also be used for exhaust coming
out that way this is a smaller fan mount
that I believe it's a 92 millimeter so I
didn't want to put a fan there instead
I'm going to add the fan to the side
panel right here popping on this side
panel we can see it's got a hundred 20
millimeter mount right there it is not
filtered so that is a downside it is
going to gather some dust right here but
we can clean it off fairly easily and
all I'm going to need to do is Mount the
fan via these four points on the four
corners make sure it's oriented the
right way I want it drawing air in
pushing air into the case towards the
GPU right there and having the intake
here and intake here will create
positive pressure inside the case with
both of those intakes and then the power
supply at the top is going to be drawing
and pushing some air out as well as just
air going out the back there because of
the positive pressure just about any fan
you buy should come with mounting screws
these are the standard fan mounting
screws they're a bit heavier or wider
thread than the ones you typically use
for computer cases and those screws are
actually meant to sort of dig into each
corner of the fan that you mount it into
if you're not sure which direction your
fan is going to spin or which direction
the air is going to flow look at the
side of the fan there will be often an
arrow indicating so that arrow is the
direction that the fans can spin in that
direction and then that arrow is the way
that the air is going to flow so that
way if it doesn't have the arrows almost
always the bracket going across the back
will be where the air comes out or the
exhaust and then the open side will be
the intake where air goes in
and so with our fan mounted onto the
side panel all that is left is to plug
into that other three pin fan header and
there is a fan header available for it
just above the graphics card in there I
also want to point out that this adds
another 25 millimeters of thickness or
so to the inside of this side panel and
if you look at our graphics card right
there you might notice that well it's
not that it's out of space but there is
definitely less space there now than
there was before that is one of the
limitations of this case and one of the
reasons why if you're shopping for
graphics cards to upgrade make sure that
although they can be longer this
direction that they are not taller in
this direction there are some thicker
graphics cards like EVGA for the win and
that kind of thing which will not fit in
this case especially if you have a side
fan installed as well another thing to
keep in mind in terms of space is going
to be this bracket right here which is
going to hold your couple drives and I
already have a 2.5 inch the SSD mounted
right up here to the top but again with
a longer graphics card which the GTX
1060 gigabyte version that I have
definitely is it's going to go out and
again potentially conflict with drives
that are right here and with the the
gigabyte card I also have to pay
attention to the fact that there is
going to be a power connector which is
going to be right down there pointing
out that way so what I'm going to do is
move that 2.5 inch drive down to the
lower part of the bracket here so it's a
lot thinner then say the 3.5 inch drive
over there and I'll install a 3.5 inch
drive up top that should give us enough
clearance but again we're starting to
see some of the limitations that you get
with a more budget oriented case like
this a $40.00 case it is smaller and you
know fits everything into a smaller
footprint but when you start expanding
and adding stuff you start to run out of
space fairly quickly
you
and with that we're down to our final
three parts to install a CPU graphics
card storage but first off just to point
out since I do have two mechanical hard
drives right here I'm only going to be
using one of these I'll do the 3.5 inch
drive since I think that's probably a
little bit easier to come by if you guys
are trying to use an older part but of
course a 3 or a 2.5 inch mechanical
drive would work just as well and would
give you a little bit more room with
that bracket across there at the same
time anyway we'll go with the 2.5 I'm
sorry the 3.5 inch 2 terabyte drive and
honestly if I was doing what should be
done next I would probably do the CPU
upgrade and then the graphics card and
then these drives but since I said I was
going to do the CPU last I'll wait and
do that last for the graphics card I
just need to remove the old graphics
card same way that I installed it by
removing the two thumb screws here at
the bracket up and that little latch
over and then just sliding it out which
shouldn't take too much effort next I'll
turn my attention to the power and since
I'm going to need power for a couple of
these devices coming out I'll just make
sure that that's all set up and good to
go
so the SATA plugs the SATA power plugs
from the power supply that I already
used when I installed the 2.5 inch SSD
originally come on a little chain with
three of them so I'll keep using the one
for the SSD actually I probably bring
that down to the lower end then I'll
just use another one I'll probably need
to skip this one in the middle then use
this third one to plug in the hard drive
up there at top and then I'm also going
to need to pull out this little bunch of
cables and get a PCI Express power
connector out of there so the new
graphics card is going to be going right
in here and it is quite a bit longer
than the old graphics card so one other
thing I'm going to do here before I
install that is get this serial ata
cable and plug it in for my second drive
now my SATA ports are right down there
one's already plugged in this one I
can't really use because this plug has a
right angle plug on one side the
90-degree one right there and there's
not much to be done about that so the
right angle plug I'm going to use on the
motherboard and I'm just going to
position that in one of these upper
right facing slots
one-handed so again bearing in mind this
is a l-shaped style plug got to make
sure it goes in the right way and the
latch on top is usually the case for
this so I'm just going to pop that in
snaps into place now I am blocking the
lower SATA port here but since there's
not enough space for more drives in this
build anyway or not really much unless I
use those five and a quarter inch base
at the top I do have a couple more
available right there and if it really
comes down to it I would just need to
change SATA cables to get one that
didn't have a 90 degree plug on one inch
and then again we have this block
waiting for the hard drive on the other
side next I'm going to mount both of the
drive to this brackets
I have repositioned these little rubber
or silicone grommets at the top those
are specifically for mechanical spinning
drives they provide a little bit of
sound dampening also when it comes to
mechanical drives or well any 2.5 inch
or three-point Drive 3.5 inch drives at
all you'll note that they have mounting
points on the sides as well as on the
bottom so one two three and four are
your actual drive mount points for this
one and those should line up with the
four silicone or rubber guys that I just
put on there and then they will mount
through those little holes with these
screws here which are a little bit
longer than your typical mounting screws
that's just to love them to pass through
the grommets and again pull bit sound
dampening which is nice for spinning
Drive
so I really should move on to the CPU at
this point but just to be clear where
we're at so that we can sort of rest
everything in here once we're good to go
coming from the power supply up on this
side I have a three SATA power plug
cable that's for the two drives I also
have a PCI Express power cable that I'm
only going to be using one of these
plugs I need a 8 pin for the GPU I have
chosen but as you can see this wouldn't
be able to handle two plugs if the GP
required that and then finally I've got
two serial ata cables also plugged into
the motherboard here and that's again
for both of the storage drives however
if I were to like install that there
with with this with this bracket over
here which actually is lining up okay
thankfully just like that so we can see
that there is enough room for example
over on this side of the drives to those
plugs to actually plug in without
conflicting like with that fan or
anything there's a little there's enough
room there but also once that graphics
card goes in once again it's going to be
like that except over here and as you
can see that eight pin plug down on the
end definitely needs some space like
right in here so that's going to be a
little bit of a tight squeeze but anyway
with all this good to install I'm gonna
go ahead and move on to the CPU removal
of a stock Intel CPU heatsink fan isn't
all that tough you do need a flathead
screwdriver Society didn't include that
any accessories but most people have
that if you look at these four mounting
points you'll notice that they have
arrows on all four of them that's
actually for removal so turn each in the
direction of the arrow it'll turn about
a quarter turn that will kind of
disengage that little plug part at the
very bottom which pops through the
bottom of the motherboard and holds
everything in place you of course do
also want to remove that four pin CPU
power and then each of these little
plugs will just kind of lift up a little
bit that'll get disengage again that
plastic piece that's poking through the
bottom of the motherboard with all those
just kind of lifted you should be able
to just give it a little bit of a jiggle
and lift it off now you'll notice it did
stick just a little bit that's because
the thermal paste one
it gets hot kind of melts up and makes a
good coverage over the top of the CPU so
our next step is going to be to clean
that up so when we reinstall a new heat
sink fan it will it'll make good contact
we don't want any air bubbles or any old
residue left in there so if you're doing
this upgrade from a core i3 to a core i5
you might take your old CPU heatsink fan
and think to yourself I can just reuse
this right maybe I'll just pop it back
on there and then I'll have an extra
heat sink fan but I do not recommend
that for one thing if you look just at
the sizes of the boxes themselves you
might notice that one of them is
slightly bigger I thought that was going
to indicate a significant difference
between these two heatsink fans but it
wasn't really all that much they are
different though even though they might
look the same they may look physically
the same they even look physically the
same size this one has a little bit more
powerful fan this one also has a
different arrangement at least for the
aluminum fins going out there at the
side some of them that are higher end
will also have copper at the center and
that's just to allow for a bit of
additional heat transference if the CPU
is something that is more powerful or
that is going to generate more heat so
always use the stock heatsink fan that
came with the CPU you're installing if
that is the case this is the 6500 and
the one that came with it and for the
purposes of today's demonstration even
though this one did again come with pre
applied thermal paste I'm actually going
to clean this off and then I'll show you
guys how to apply thermal paste if
you're doing it from scratch or if you
just don't have that pre applied stuff
on there well let's uninstall this CPU
so we can do all of our thermal paste
cleaning at the same time it's just the
same process as installation was but
can't even reverse so again lift that
little lever arm pull it back the
closing latch down cover should lift up
again grab it by the sides I find that
from from the top and the bottom works
best and lift it off being as careful as
possible not to mess with any of those
contact points down at the bottom now we
will again take our new CPU which is the
exact same shape and size and everything
like that it just says 2060 500 on
instead of 6100 and of course it's quad
core in there again same procedure for
the installation
Gold triangle at the corner line that up
with the gold triangle in the socket
drop it down in there you've done this
before you're your professional at this
point then we will be closed the lid
push that latch lever back down back
into place
and we're good to go now if you're
planning on reusing your old CPU or just
storing it for a while or even returning
it it's definitely a good idea to clean
the thermal paste off first
if using rubbing alcohol just dump a
little bit onto your coffee filters and
then you can apply that to the surface
that works pretty well I like this stuff
for mark to clean though you just put a
couple drops onto the thermal material
trying to spill it of course rub that
around a little bit and that'll kind of
loosen everything up break it up so
it'll get absorbed pretty easily by the
coffee filter now we'll get it mostly
clean and then then they give you the
thermal surface purifier which you drop
on after that and that will make sure
that everything's super cleaned off of
there in order to prepare it for the
next installation prepare that surface
for thermal mating which also sounds
like hot lovin and finally if you want
to be really particular about things
that's where the q-tip comes in and you
can use that to kind of just go along
the edges the grooves so to speak and
get any of that thermal paste that might
have gone over the side making it look
pristine
good as new so again ready for return
and resale handing down to somebody else
or whatnot just again make sure you hang
on to the little plastic container that
it came with because that's one of the
best places to squirt
so our CPU is installed ready to go we
have our heat sink fan which does not
have thermal paste on it that is
important and we are going to apply our
own so I have my little tube here this
is just some stuff from ek most thermal
paste is good that I know at the time
people ask me what kind of thermal paste
to use all the time and I you know most
of the thermal paste will work within a
few degrees of each other
so it all has a little blob right there
in the middle that was really fast but
there it is I advocate something between
a grain of rice and the size of a pea
about that much is going to be pretty
good that's actually a pretty good
amount on there right now that might be
a little bit too much but again the blob
in the middle will be spread out by the
pressure of the heat sink fan heat sink
fan once again we're going to line up
intel logo facing up that's not really
important but then you know if you can't
do that you might as well and again
we're going to line up those four prongs
on the bottom with the four mounting
points on there also you should sort of
pay a little bit of attention to this
cable hanging out the side sometimes
they wrap it around in a key get caught
in that little fan thanks for anyone who
pointed that out in the comments on the
build video by the way and we're just
going to drop that strength down on top
put that lined up you'll you will feel
that thermal paste squish around a
little bit but we want to try to keep
this as level as possible and then again
starting with opposite corners just put
straight down and you'll hear it snap
into place one two three four it's nice
and secure and we're good to go oh wait
we also have to plug in the CPU fan
header so the see if you installed
moving on to dropping everything back
into place since we're pretty much good
to go
graphics card went in again just like it
did with the original build it's just a
little bit longer but it snaps into
place the PCI Express slot latch at the
bottom can slide over to lock it in
place and then two mounting thumb screws
at the back of the computer to make sure
it's secured this 1060 does require
extra power from the power supply so
here is our six plus two pin PCI Express
graphics power connector these will
usually say PCIe on them
and they're the only six plus to pin
type connectors also bear in mind there
is a latch on one side sometimes it's on
the top on the graphics card side
sometimes it's on the bottom this one is
on the top and that latch will engage
with this little latch right here on the
plug itself of course these final steps
took a decent amount of finagling just
dropping this in having that PCI Express
power connector be routed properly I had
to kind of bend it over but fortunately
there's still a decent amount of
clearance between the drive cage and
that plug the plugs for the storage
drives themselves are kind of wedged up
here at the front but I was able to get
that mostly over in here there's some
ugliness with cables down in that area
but you can't really see it
unfortunately everything in front of
that main system fan for the intake is
pretty clear
so I can drop air directly back for the
CPU and the graphics card last little
bit here is to install the side panel
and hopefully plug in that that three
pin see if I can do this with one hand I
did it yay normally we wouldn't put the
side panel back on right now but since
we've already booted the system up once
it should be okay so now I've come down
to it once again the moment of truth
again oh yeah power switch
it works hurray
fans are spinning
I can't even pop out the side panel here
you can even kind of see the gigabyte
LED logos on the graphics card through
the side which is super fun that's
that's a high-end feature that you
wouldn't expect with something like the
fractal core 1100 but guys that's all
for this video I hope you have learned a
little bit more about how to upgrade a
computer whether you're doing an upgrade
immediately from the $500 build that I
already showed you or you're just
looking for some tips on upgrading
individual parts yourself but I'm once
again leaving you guys with a bit of a
cliffhanger which is that I've built the
system powered it on and then said cool
everything's fine but where do you go
from here should you go into the UEFI
should you immediately start installing
windows thankfully I have another video
on that coming up very soon if it's out
it'll be linked in the description if
it's not out yet you'll have to wait
just a few more days that's gonna be
talking about first steps for getting
the system configured properly
installation of windows and just some of
the stuff that I do right off the bat
thanks again for watching oh and then
finally we'll have a comparison video
where I do benchmarks and comparisons
between the $500 version of this build
and this version of this bill which
would cost between 720 and 778 dollars
right now depending on whether or not
you're forking over cash for a brand new
hard drive thanks again for watching
this video though guys hit the thumbs up
button if you did enjoy it links again
to all this stuff is down in the
description below we'll see you all next
