remember when you used to like whistle
or hammer and omim tunes and I'd be like
why are you doing Christmas carols and
you'd be like what yeah - toy dia what
noise I don't even make everybody
whistling Christmas girls it's
involuntary purple the doctor hits your
knee and it just like goes up and just
happens alright I think we are alive now
so hello everyone and welcome to awesome
hardware this is episode number 122 122
times we've done this that's crazy it's
a live show with stream it's two
twitch.tv slash awesome hardware and we
also stream it to each of our YouTube
channels this is the second half of
episode 122 first half episode 122 a was
on Kyle's channel bit wit it was crazy
that's that's crazy things happen wait
the devils toe I put lipstick on gave
Kyle kiss on cheek there's a paramedic
anyway check that out if you want links
just should be in the description other
than that we talk about technology
mostly computer stuff we drink some beer
we have a good time
occasionally we curse so sorry about
that if it happens and yeah thanks all
of you guys for here if you're watching
live or if you're watching it in the
future we really appreciate it
hope you gained a slight bit of
entertainment and perhaps even learn a
thing or two about what's going on in
the tech world so umm to start the show
first off if you want to help support us
feel free to do so by purchasing some
stuff from our stores my store is at
Pulsar Burnett and I have just added
some hats to my store now so you can get
my ever-popular thumbscrew logo on a
hats also got mugs pint glasses mugs are
on sale we have an ongoing t-shirt
design contest so if you guys want to
help design some stuff for us send us
your submissions there's links to the at
the top of each of our stores about that
Kyle store is bit wit tech slash store
woo yep he also has stuff female shirts
are now in ladies tees beanies hoodies
if it's cold wherever you live it's not
here because we're in California but you
know keeps you warm and stuff hats fifty
spinners other things it's all
high-quality it's all stuff you get buy
it on get yourself some merch
you help us out and it's good things but
but if you don't want to do that or it's
okay if you want to do something a
little bit more helpful and productive
right now we we generally get a decent
amount of donation comments on YouTube
while we do the show today we're gonna
be taking all those donations and we're
gonna be sending that over to the
victims of Hurricane Maria in Puerto
Rico Maria's a bitch
they're having a really tough time right
now they're completely no power on the
entire island we're gonna be
specifically donating to the United for
Puerto Rico fund which is spearheaded by
the first lady of Puerto Rico so more
information on that on the PBS news hour
link that's in this video's description
so again your donations we're gonna
donate and then I'm gonna match any
donations from my half up to 500 bucks
me too
Kyle already did that in the past his
happen I think we got pretty close to
500 bucks for Kyle's have seemed like we
had a couple although although I was
telling people that it was gonna cost a
hundred dot 100 bucks to see me give
Kyle a big fat kiss on the cheek so I
think that might have had something to
do with it but we gonna up the ante yeah
have something else that we do I don't
think I have anything that can come
anywhere close what would you do to me
for five hundred dollars ball well you
know Vegas that'll go a long way woo
we're not hey one last donation I meant
I'm sorry one last announcement I meant
to announce this on Kyle's f2 but I am
starting a giveaway booth tomorrow move
that computer
oh nice the main gear one right there's
a main really nice one Razer Edition
yeah it's it's like if you were to six
right that computer out of buy it on the
main gear website I'd be five thousand
dollars plus I'm not exactly true a
specific price but it's got a it's got
an AMD risin 1800 X processor two way
GTX 1080s and SLI a full custom water
cooling loop with mostly EK stuff from
the blocks and some bits power fittings
super system cool lance
quick disconnects on there it's like a
really really nicely parted out system
Samsung 960 pro 512 gig so yeah that's
gonna kick off tomorrow I'm opposed to
be up for that
it's probably me in the afternoon
sometime usually check that out moving
on to news and let's start out with
AMD's n to the N to use em - yes and we
crap Zen itself the initial the first
run of AMD's zen architecture which was
has been used in Rison cores which is in
rise ins processors starter for minis an
epic Andy's said that basically their
expectations for the performance of Zen
were kind of bare minimum as far as what
it hits like what they thought the
architecture could do and what they
actually put out was kind of a
worst-case scenario and that's a weird
way of phrasing it but it was just kind
of a worst-case scenario and in terms of
what frequency they thought they were
gonna be able to hit expectation reality
and the performance they were gonna be
able to get out of it so there are clear
areas for improvements according to this
article from tech power up that AMD's
engineers are aware of and were aware of
even as they were taping out the first
Zen based CPUs
so there's features and improvements
that were left on the chopping block
probably due to time and budget
constraints because eventually you got
to cut things off and say look we need
to bring this part product to market so
stop designing it let's start making it
these slides come from Spanish Website
infra matica Seto and informatica Soto
these are supposed to be theoretically
directly from AMD but this is a rumor so
bear that in mind the grain of salt
could be fake could be made-up nonsense
but they say if this is real this that
AMD CPU roadmap says in 2019 we'll be
seeing products based on the same - in
2018 they have listed pinnacle Ridge
which is still going to be using the
same summit ridge architecture so the
existing Zin 1 architecture but will be
a performance of uplift so maybe we're
gonna see some new products based on Zen
one in 2018 maybe it was higher clock
speeds or something like that
higher
see you know maybe like maybe like an
1850 ex or something like that I can see
AMD coming out with but that kind of
thing but 2019 codename Matisse they're
changing up their code name is too
because you might also notice their
desktop and notebook K AP use which are
gonna be based on Raven Ridge starting
next year are gonna be called Picasso
also based on the rear energy
architecture but also they're continuing
the use of the am for socket so that is
one nice thing that AMD promised pretty
early on was that a m4 was gonna be a
viable mainstream socket that they were
bringing products to the market for
through 2020 so I could see Zen to being
kind of the second generation of parts
that still work with that socket and
then probably after 2020 is then to it
probably you know if they do is then
three after that would probably one
needs a new socket and something replace
it we have a nice though that Andy's not
forcing their users to upgrade the
chipset or motherboard for their new
family of processors that certainly is a
critique that could be leveled against
their competition right now just and in
particular so yeah
Matisse's into there's also some rumors
and also slide here about it being
twelve nanometer potentially so they
might be shrinking the process ever so
slightly from 14 nanometer which would
be interesting I'd be interested to see
what kind of how like it doesn't seem
like that much of a die shrink going
from from 14 to to 12 or live that much
of a process shrink I should say but it
will be interesting to see like if that
simplifies the transition at all but
obviously if they're still using the
same core architecture then it's not
that much different but yeah there's no
mention of increased threads so you
might notice that from here this
specifically talks about how many Xen
threads are in it was then two cores
they're not saying and up to 24 threads
now or anything like that so no hints or
indication from this that AMD is going
to be increasing the core count on the
mainstream but honestly with 8 and 16
right now that's seems about where they
should be yeah you know since they've
got the high end started for platform
covering people who need
twelve or more you know that sense
sounds reasonable but there it is
also they're changing their code names
from ridges to art to painters summit
ridge and events it seems a little bit
more inspiring Matisse and Picasso very
well-respected in their fields okay
let's move on the next story is about
Intel's eighth generation core coffee
lake desktop processors now this was
sort of an interesting developments just
a couple days ago or I guess yeah yeah
roughly 48 hours ago Intel had done a
product demonstration or they did a call
with people they have ebon are they had
a webinar they had a deck of slides they
told people about I waited in that did
you participate in that all these slides
and they're they're cropped in this we
did the phone those I didn't see any of
the slides I was just on the phone oh
you do watch thing I was in the car when
I I think an an tech might have cropped
these or or something but all these said
October 5th embargo lipstick well that
was on there they probably changed it or
something yeah so there's a bunch of
information that was provided to
reviewers about this about this launch
coming up and I was all under embargo
tisha Hollander embargo its October 5th
but it was leaked someone somewhere and
this I haven't I haven't figured out who
exactly it was aware it was published or
anything like that I'm sure somebody
knows could have been anyone but I don't
but it was leaked it went out so Intel
was like alright it's out there it's
like they instead of being like we're
gonna pretend that doesn't exist for the
next week and a half they're like all
right they sent two supplemental email
out to everyone said all right you guys
can talk about this now so this is why
there's a bunch of articles up about
this I was working on the 79 80 XE video
at the time so I didn't even see this
until the articles went out which is
kind of interesting but hey here is the
8th generation Core processors that
they've talked about there's AI threes i
5s and i7
the i3s are not gonna be quad cores the
United fives are now gonna be six cores
and the I sevens are gonna be six cores
with hyper-threading so that means
there's no place anymore for quad cores
with hyper-threading which would be kind
of an interesting thing that they're
under this mix but who knows
like the i-5 like the flagship i-5
should have had in my opinion yeah just
take again it's totally unlike anything
until stone in the past it with it Rison
now but an i-5 with hyper-threading then
competes with your i7 without
hyper-threading so then how do you price
those so blower clock speed maybe
perhaps lower TDP potentially but I
don't know yeah that's how this is how
Intel's decided to do it yeah and
pricing is here as well to 8700 K 359
8700 303 8600 K to 57 8400 is 182
8350 K the quad-core 168 seems be in
line with you to be like yeah it's it's
it's in line with K be like it's it's a
mini little bit more so you'll notice
you'll notice like a $20.00 increase on
the 8700 K compared to the 7700 K right
you're getting more redstone you are
getting more cores yes yes um the price
jump I noticed that that stuck out the
most to me was like oh you can get a
quad core down here yeah listen I
actually 8100 417 dollars that seems
pretty reasonable to me it seems like
allow for a hundred and seventeen
dollars then I feel like I want to pay
like 20 bucks more and get the unlocked
overclockable version nope 168
yeah is a huge gap 168 if you want to
overclock without sentimental jumps that
is a twisty $1.00 jump from
percentage-wise that's huge
yeah that's like a third a third of the
cost right there so that kind of sucks
so you're probably better off front bang
for the buck sticking with your 3.9 Gert
side 370 100 down there yeah so that's
gonna be a bargain chip yeah this is
probably gonna be the the bang for the
buck kind of performance comparison to
do 46 for the rise in three processors
um the 40 but the Pentium 45 60 that's
doesn't dual-core right
oh there's well there's we're gonna talk
about that no dual cores potentially
coming out on x2 98 I suppose dude oh
yeah yeah but anyway so this just yet
there's your initial layout this is
what's coming out October 5th is the
dates Intel stating 25% more frames per
second and 45% better performance win
mega tasking with the 8700 K this is a
term that Intel made up what they're
trying to talk about is doing multiple
things at once
streaming being wild gaming streaming
recurring in gaming at the same time and
encoding which is a very viable use case
and something that they have been kind
of getting smacked around with when you
compare them to the like the six core
and eight core isin options that are
very price competitive with like the 77
out of K it's still multitasking though
just call it multitasking it's mega
tasking mega just so silly if you say
well I'm very good Chesky god-wife gods
like big attacks key gaming sports
edition okay so yeah there are some
price increases here if you compare them
directly to the generation of
regeneration last the 7000 series in the
8000 series however you are getting more
coarse so it's up to you whether you
think that's a price increase or whether
they're just like hey it's only 20 bucks
more first gym or course even the
top-end i-5 though has jumped from two
forty two dollars two hundred forty two
dollars to 200 d7 it's a six percent
price increase and Baron main bear in
mind that the price is listed here are
bulk prices so that's if you buy a
thousand of these CPUs at the same time
so you probably see slightly higher
prices at retail expectation potentially
for the 8700 k + 359 for the bulk price
so probably 400 ish maybe maybe 380 who
knows we'll see but you know what's
interesting is that you know until even
after Aizen came out still is sort of
the champion when it comes to
purely gaming performance but it always
fell short when it came to the corn
thread-count but now that we have 6
cores 12 threads and if we're still
rocking the same or even greater at IPC
that we saw with Katy Lake then maybe we
have some fierce competition against
rise and finally from Team Blue
but it does seem like these are gonna be
much more reasonable like performance
comparisons with Rison right now because
let's face it Intel didn't do much with
seventh-generation stuff we're after
rise and lunch they didn't really change
pricing or anything like that so it's
kind of like alright you can make this
gaming argument for it but if you're
looking at all rounds performance it's
kind of getting smacked around by the
Rises so we'll see how this all goes
that kind of makes you a little bit
salty because since this launch comes
just eight months after Katy like like
you kind of know that Intel had the
ability to create and release a six core
CPU pretty much at any time probably
like years ago and they just kept
holding out because there was really no
competition from AMD side but now that
rise ins here in 2017 they're feeling
the heat of bed so now there Morton yeah
there's more pressure on them to release
higher core count CPU stacks yes
actually that was one of the I missed
this little bit in my notes but I wanted
to point it out as I believe Ryan Forman
antic it was this article by Ryan Ryan
to this article yes Ryan Freeman in tech
Ryan and Brett from an antic pointed out
2006 was when Intel first which quad
core with the court to extremes and 706
Intel's like quad cores guys 11 years
they've been milking that pad for 11
years okay granted they've had six six
core prior to prior to now but they've
always ended on the intent on the
enthusiast platform that's at a
significant higher price so yeah it's
nice to see this coming out all right
speaking of nice to see this coming up
we have of course leaked potentially not
correct information but you know you
guys look at it and judge for yourselves
an early review that was posted on video
cards calm this was actually from
XP review.com with a preview X preview I
saw a video somewhere sunders X preview
yeah so that's a Chinese language site
so that's linked in this this in this
article but yeah there's a 7700 K and
8700 K side-by-side as comment should I
said his half of the show they're
physically the same when it comes to the
socket so you can slot one into the
other socket but they're not compatible
with each other's motherboards 7700 K
you gotta use 200 series motherboard or
100 series motherboard with 87 or K you
need a 300 series motherboard with most
likely AZ 370 if you want to overclock
it here are the actual performance
numbers as theoretically posted by X
preview or exp review what do you expert
you experience I like exp for experience
actually experienced reviews all right
anyway they have numbers here and the
benchmarks are being run the 77 or k
8700 k and 7800 x which is a six core
enthusiast platform processor everything
running at 4.5 gigahertz so they
equalize the frequency across all of
them further down there is also
benchmarks with the CPU is running at
clock speeds but basically like I kind
of ran down these and if you look at the
8700 K column versus the 7800 X column
they're very very similar you get some
slight edges by the 8700 K from time to
time so like 3d Martin Meyer strikes the
scores a little bit better physics core
a little bit better but I mean it's it's
it's like a few percentage points right
and going down the line kind of kind of
similar here we hear you get some better
gaming performance witcher 3 getting
definitely a nice bump so when it comes
to the productivity and synthetics
you're seeing really some similar
numbers with the 8700 k in these 1770
800 x when it comes to synthetics
the only real difference was incise off
sandra which actually showed better
performance by the 7800 x so that might
have been a memory issued memory thing
you do have quad-channel memory
available on the 70
so that's potentially part of it but
there you go according to these
benchmarks basically what you're getting
is a CPU that's got the gaming chops of
a 7700 K probably even a little bit more
so since you've got all those cores and
the the CPU were going to compute
performance the productivity performance
of like a 7800 X it's pretty cute it's
pretty nice so definitely seems like
there's a lot of potential here of
course it's really gonna boil down to
what you can get out of that what you
can get out of Rison options at the same
price repairing the two but interesting
make some interesting reviews yeah
because this is unlike any other
mainstream CPU family that Intel's
launched in the past indeed all right
speaking of Intel launching CPUs they
just launched the 79 80 X II they did
yesterday morning at 12:01 a.m. Pacific
Standard Time 18 core bastard we have
the 18 core and they're bauer god bless
him do baddest loading do bad our DeBerg
god bless him has been deleting intel's
processors for quite some time now
because they're using more they're using
not the best thermal interface material
and in fact these are fairly an inferior
thermal interface material on Kyle's
half of the show we talked about the
gamers Nexus article which pointed out
very specifically to Intel that like hey
guys if you invested a few more bucks on
the manufacturing side of this you can
get significantly better performance
they were seeing 10 degrees plus Celsius
drop-off which led to better better
turbo-boost frequencies and whatnot with
the 7800 XE 79 80 XE I'm sorry so do
Bauer um basically deleted his because
he's got a kit for it now actually I'm
kind of want to hit him up about that
and he then overclocked it to 6.1
gigahertz yeah that was AA course it was
using ln2 for cooling
he used thermal paste on the entire CPU
let me see if I can jump to the point in
the video where it shows that
this is the interesting thing about like
he goop goop tit everywhere beyond yeah
yeah died so not just on the die but
also on the PCB surrounding it and
everything just to get the maximum
amount of thermal transfer between
everything that's under that die and
what he's got going on above it so that
is pretty crazy and there's another shot
of it so oh he actually went in and cut
out that was my idea I told him that I'm
gonna claim credit for that alright I'm
taking credit for this literally this is
my idea to cut out no I told him to cut
out the IHS I'm sure he could have
easily thought of this himself but he so
we had this discussion at Computex rant
incoming I'm not ranting okay because no
I'm like if this really like I'll talk
to him about Alaska but if this really
did originate with me I'll be kind of
proud of it but he's talking about the
difficulty of D letting these high court
count processors from in cell because
the dies are way bigger and there's a
lot less space a lot less gap between
where the heat spreader makes contact
with the PCB and where there's important
stuff on there like capacitors or the
dye itself so he was saying you know
he's got to get a device on there that
clamps down that has another device that
gets just on the heat spreader that
shifts it to the side in order to break
the contact between the IHS and the PCB
beneath it and he's just saying it's
really challenging because when you
shift it like that the chances that
you're gonna hit something and break it
and kill your processor just become a
lot higher so I was like thought at the
time it's like what if you took
something like a dremel or you know it's
like a cutting tool and just cut around
where you know the dye is on the heat
spreader then you could get a something
cut out there so where you could maybe
lift just that and you wouldn't have to
worry about the thing around it and I'm
just saying that looks like exactly what
he did here again it may or may not have
been Paul inspired but um but doesn't
who's deleting tools around a point that
like fix all that
no his deleting tool does not do this no
I mean but any like to actually like cuz
why would you cut it out just to take
this I believe this was his
customization very specifically for
maximum overclocking because he's trying
to get
to put himself in a situation where you
can clamp the cooler down on there but
also put a massive amount of thermal
paste on there you need I'm about
honestly I could totally be wrong about
that so I said yeah there we go anyway
trabajar has video about this but what
he just did there cutting out the middle
part is that essentially the same effect
the end the same angle as deleting on as
you're revealing the die honestly I feel
bad that I have not watched the entire
video in its entirety to get more info
about that this might also have been
something that he did when he was trying
to figure out how to properly deal it it
in the safest manner so I'm not sure
about that I can't I can't say for sure
but they anyway de perak deleted it he
then over clocked at six point one
gigahertz the power delivery are the
power requirements for 79 80 XE and they
79 60 X go pretty crazy at stock speeds
they're actually really efficient that's
what I found in my testing because I
only tested at stock hmm but that's
Intel kind of finding the sweet spot I
feel like for these processors as soon
as you start cranking things up it
starts to draw a ton of power and starts
to put out a lot of heat which is why of
course the d-lighting processor is very
important with Cinebench r15 and the i9
79 80 XE de Brouwer overclocked it's to
5.6 gigahertz and scored 5635
compare that to his 1950 X maximum
overclock which got to 5.4 gigahertz and
scored 4514 so people in China are
saying that he cut out the IHS so that
he could cool the die directly with
Yellin to so he did do that specifically
it's actively cool it yeah but still
have the IHS there to properly mount
those I would guess it I mean old-school
D letting you would you would mount a
cooler directly to the die but that's
very dangerous because applying pressure
right there if it's uneven can can
easily crack it or damage it so I'm
guessing that was to provide some
stability around
for them whatever cool eat look or the
pots for his L and to pot to go on there
I guess but anyway yeah the videos like
the description guys so no more than s
and watch it or watch it and then you'll
know more than s I guess anyway at five
point five gigahertz he was blowing 70
amps through the 12 volt rail so the CPU
by itself was drying 840 watts which is
insane and that's what the 1.45 volt V
core which is high for this platform but
not insane or anything like that at five
point eight and six gigahertz he was
drawing a thousand watts just for the
CPU which is also pretty crazy and then
because he used to Bower and he's a
crazy overclocker he added a Titan XP
GPU LM told the GPU to cooled the GPU as
well and set single card 3d mark records
forty five thousand seven hundred and
five and thirty mark eleven thirty five
thousand seven hundred and eighty two in
3d mark fire strike and one hundred and
one hundred and twenty thousand four
hundred twenty five and 3dmark Vantage
correct
so uh good work your Bower I need a man
keep it up move it up all right
the 73 60 X a dual-core CPU 4x 299 or so
video cards comm would have you believe
why why why it makes no sense very
clearly listed in this description
there's videos articles title is was why
it makes why it could make sense Paul so
Intel has received nothing but flak and
negative feedback for their decision to
include the 74 what if I have a me like
X the kami like X processor it's the
court I banish the the numbers from my
mind so why in god's name would they
decide to launch a dual-core on this
platform this is a high-end platform
this is X 299 motherboards this is like
you've got to spend 250 bucks minimum
for just a motherboard on this platform
and that motherboard will probably be
equipped to handle quad channel memory
which
can't do with this the KB like X C if
you use only Abdul channel so you lose
half that Bank of memory you also lose
access to a bunch of other stuff as far
as connectivity on the motherboard
because you're limited in PCI Express
lanes to slot you only get 16
so expansion there is just severely
truncated so in an environment where you
have a mainstream platform with
motherboards that are much cheaper that
have way less features for installing a
CPU like this why would you further push
your already hated KB like X line up
down to the i3 73 60 X maybe there are
certain like applications that require
no that's all the i/o like like like
quad channel memory and and m dot 2
storage but don't really require a ton
of CPU power I mean that's I can't think
of any application of the time I had
that need them but that's the only
reason I can think of of why this chip
exists it could anyone in chat name
something where you don't need much CPU
power and you don't need many cores or
threads but you need a lot of i/o I I
can't I can't even count even so the 73
60 X would be a successor to the 73 50 K
Intel's mainstream dual-core
overclockable unlocked CPU with
hyper-threading which was an interesting
chip when it launched but it was grossly
overpriced at like a hundred and eighty
or a hundred and ninety dollars so never
made any sense and was a terrible seller
as well from my understanding why would
they make another one if you had an even
worse platform it's 100 megahertz faster
so it's a hundred megahertz faster than
the 73 50k turbos up to four point three
gigahertz
the TDP jumps to 112 watts so almost
double the TDP 77356 T watt TDP this one
would be a hundred and twelve watts and
according to the original poster which
this information originally came from
Baidu also from China
he said the I 370 360 X is one point two
five percent faster
the 73 50k Wow and the price is around
1699 yuan which is 220 US dollars Lent
which is like wow when you can when you
can buy a six core rise in CPU for less
than 200 anyway this makes no sense and
the article doesn't say bidding I would
assume based on KB like X specs for the
74 40 X or whatever and so whatever the
hell those CPUs are that it has 16 PCIe
lanes and dual channel ddr3 my
assumption that's my assumption that
it's not listening pca Elaine's ddr4
isn't listed in the article that's just
if the CPU exists if they're actually
gonna launch it I can't imagine having
anything other than that maybe less than
that must make it even crappier but they
yeah stupid product Intel I don't like
it
PC world has an article from Brad
sharkus about AMD phasing out the
crossfire brands so multi-gpu has been
one of those things that's been I don't
know getting more and more limited
lately if that three-way and four-way
configurations were your thing
Nvidia has already stated that they're
only going to be supporting dual core
for the future and apart for apart from
some very specific benchmark
applications that have support for just
benchmark numbers only three and four
way support like 3d mark you're not
getting support for any games for any
benefits tangibly when going beyond two
GPUs in a system so AMD is following
suits or at least we can so assume from
this article now the 17 point 9.2
drivers that recently launched or where
this comes from
excuse me so 17 book 9.2 drivers enabled
a two-way crossfire with Vega GPUs it
wasn't available prior to now and PC
world happened to notice there was no
mention of crossfire in that so they hit
up AMD directly I was like hey why
aren't you guys saying crossfire anymore
AMD PR said crossfire isn't mentioned
because it technically refers to DirectX
eleven applications in DirectX 12 we
referenced multi-gpu as applications
must support M GPU M GPU as a shorthand
for multi-gpu and DirectX 12
whereas AMD has to create profiles for
DirectX 11 so DirectX 11 and prior more
reliance on profiles provided directly
by AMD or by Nvidia for those setups in
order for the games to perform well
basically the onus is more on the
developers with DirectX 12 to support
multi-gpu whereas the onus was more on
the GPU manufacturers and specifically
their software driver developer teams
with DirectX 11 and the old way of doing
multi-gpu anyway they say this is a
branding change not a technical one so
it's not like they're suddenly
abandoning multi-gpu support it's just
they're not calling it crossfire anymore
and then you know it's M GPU which is
kind of just more the generic term for
multi-gpu with DirectX 12 and but
there's no AMD specific terminology for
multi-gpu no it doesn't appear doesn't
that doesn't appear to be the case so
MVP use an umbrella term that can be
applied to AMD or Nvidia multi graphics
cards but as of now crossfire is done
away with and only Invidia has an
exclusive term that represents multi-gpu
seems to be the case article
specifically says like it's kind of
weird because crossfire it's a it's a
brand it's a branded term you say
crossfire yeah people are really
familiar with the industry said
crossfire that's more than what an AMD
GPU and the multi-gpu configuration
right so it's kind of weird that they
suddenly be like alright we don't need
that anymore maybe they have their
reasons internally or that kind of thing
but yeah also it's not really mentioned
in this story but AMD as already
mentioned doesn't seem to be keen on
supporting more than to a GPU
configurations down the road so we're
probably gonna see 3-way 4-way gaming
GPU setups kind of dry up and disappear
because there's no practical reason to
do it right which makes sense in a lot
of ways I mean if
looking at from edit from anything from
like the super enthusiast perspective
it's like I need to when just much
hardware into the computer as possible
like the development isn't there the
uptake isn't there from users like the
actual multi-gpu install base is so
small it just doesn't make a practical
sense for the these companies to invest
time to support it so I'm okay with
two-way being the thing yeah I don't I
don't mind crossfire though I don't I
don't think crossfire so just suddenly
go away no as long as there's my here's
my two biggest 64 is in em GPU it
doesn't have a nice ring to it
I'm here's my Vegas 64 is in crossfire
sounds awesome that sounds way better
I'm Way behind that plus there's that
like eighties there may be may be 90s
game crossfire crossfire you all get
caught up in the crossfire all you
nineties kids with me oh yeah alright
quick mention here just to follow up on
Equifax because it's kind of one of
those big stories vaguely tech related
because it was a big hack situation and
it sucks for most people in the United
States but the CEO of Equifax is
retiring because that's what you do when
you're in charge of a company for a long
time and then suddenly it's like hey
your company screwed over like like
hundreds more than a hundred million
u.s. citizens and now you've lost their
information and stuff like that Richard
Smith the Equifax CEO has stepped down
from his post
aka go fire his retirement is effective
today the Board of Directors has already
appointed mark Fiedler as a who was a
board member to serve as non-executive
chairman Pauline Pauline Odori the regal
barbs horino doriga barrows junior Cunha
who was previously the president of the
presidents of Equifax ASA asia-pacific
is stepping in as interim CEO all this
is to say Equifax sucks and it's very
frustrating to see when something like
this happens and you have culpability
with the company that's done a really
crappy thing suddenly like all the
people who internship it's like we're
just not murder we're walking away we're
not hurt it's like they just blew up a
car with a bunch of puppies in it and
then they're just like we're gonna walk
the other way down the road here no
one's gonna notice the thing that sucks
it's lame anyway if you guys are
concerned about the Equifax breach we
talked about it a bit on my half of the
show last week but basically
recommendations to you by earning
bearing in mind that weirdness is this
is basically what they're doing yeah
it's Homer Homer walking back into the
bush bush is just just really know the
classic mean nope
but yeah brief recommendations for you
if you go to last week's episode on my
half there's a link in the description
that has a bunch of very good
recommendations there get your credit
report right now go to
annualcreditreport.com that's the only
website that's actually the website that
the government has required they the the
effects sorry the credit reporting
companies to provide once a year a
credit report to you free of charge
you won't get your score so if anyone's
like what's your score I need your score
you don't get your score they don't give
you that but they don't give you your
full history and you can get yours from
Experian and the t1 just BAM - I can't
that Equifax Experian that's the third
one and supreme it's a brain for it's a
brain fair enough
TransUnion yes final state - thank you
transient reduce anyway you can get you
can get Experian and TransUnion online
Equifax surprise-surprise is requiring
you to mail them in stuff but don't let
that stop you do it anyway get your
credit report right now so that any
nonsense that happens in the next six
months year two years five years since
all of your information security and
social security number and whatnot is
out in the wild now you can be like look
when I saw this happen I got my credit
report and I've done nothing since then
anything that's happened that after that
is your problem because you lost my
information and you failed the you
failed the citizens of America also
don't use LifeLock apparently there's
been like a six times up taken people
signing up for a life lock because like
I need to protect my secure my
information my online security and
everything up
really that's awesome sorry onna
honestly just do we make so one of us
make this our profiles very good I've
updated my profile picture on Twitter
Thank You cap and go check it out that's
perfect
LifeLock goes through Equifax like it's
part of Equifax they pay pending Equifax
money if you use like luck
anyway annualcreditreport.com and
freezer credit those are our suggestions
again we're not maybe I shouldn't have
never got our credit card just could
have all been avoided
no you couldn't avoid it that if you do
anything in the United States your your
beer in the system it's pretty stupid
anyway let's move on to hot heavy hurry
I'm gonna try to try to burn through
this quickly cuz you agree alright so
hot have you heard heard we're starting
out with some a bit of a kerfuffle
js2 since you guys may know him as Jay's
two cents anyway he did a video he got
the Vegas 64 the asus strix edition of
the Vegas 64 which has been someone
anticipated I don't know Vega launch has
been pretty messy generally speaking but
a lot of people have been like when the
third-party cards come they will save us
that's what will happen so Jay got an
asus strix vegas 64 and he did a bunch
of testing with it basically he wasn't
seeing the numbers that he was expecting
talked with Asus directly did further
testing he ended up just posting his
video because I've been in the same
situation too at a certain time when
you've invested him enough time and
you're checking out a product you gotta
like be like here was my experience with
it so he posted that and basically his
aftermarket custom designed specially
ace aces cool graphics card performed
less less had had less performance than
the defaults air cooled Vegas 64 the one
he's holding in sand right here the
reference model basically yeah
so that was kind of surprising
um there's some there's something with
the V BIOS
according to Asus I got an email from me
because I was cards to ace you said
there's an issue with the V bios and
they're gonna have to rework it out but
basically it's affecting the power
limitation of the card and that's what's
causing it to not ramp up to the same
clock speeds that we're seeing with the
reference design yeah so they actually
asked that me hold off on our reviews
for now until they get it sorted out
they should have it done you know sort
of that within the day or two but so
that's what J was experiencing firsthand
in his video so ASA said they're gonna
fix this
and anyone who maybe they've got an
initial impression from J's video maybe
a follow-up might be worth taking a look
at definitely guru 3d has also posted a
review on it they experienced I don't
say exactly the same situation as J but
a similar situation the card did not
perform it did not outperform the
reference model of the Vegas 64 by any
significant margin to where you can say
yes it's worth paying more for this card
or yes right it's visibly evidence what
what has gone on here in order to to say
yes I should buy your card rather than
buying that card regardless it's not
gonna matter at all if all of these are
selling for 200 bucks more than MSRP or
whatever but it's at least worth keeping
an eye on because hopefully eventually
the prices will even out yeah although
today on Newegg it didn't did not today
today on Newegg the vega 56 is were all
500 bucks and the Vegas 64 us we're all
600 to 700 bucks so yeah
that's what AMD is tweeting about Hey
look these tech cards on sale her cards
are in stock my carts are on silk
hundred dollars more than three that's
what we told you didn't yeah all right
RGB everyone loves RGB right I do
everyone's favorite addition to a
computer g.skill who can't with the
Trenton Z RGB kit which is one of the
most I think I was one of the earliest
kind of widely implemented RGB kits as
far as the software goes from the
different motherboard manufacturers and
they are now expanding it with a Rison
version see I didn't realize that there
was an like the one that we've had all
this time was the Intel version I didn't
either I mean I have a I have a I have
like 3200 Kessler and c14 kit that's
worked its risin perfectly fine for but
you know what's interesting is that I
recently tested or I examined the thread
Ripper build that Austin and I did on on
that stupid yacht and was wondering why
I was getting all these post code errors
and I started looking up online in
different forums and noticing that other
people were having the exact same post
code errors like 4 or 5 accounts and
they all had one thing in common they
were all using g.skill tried NZ r gb
memory like four or five accounts and I
was like ok Austin I didn't actually
 up the computer there's some
compatibility
I was totally about valid and now that
we have a risin kit of this as I
was about to say what's the point when
the kits have been performing just fine
this is this is the kit that's most
frequently sent out to reviewers it's
more expensive because it's a tighter
timings they do have a 3200 speed cast
latency 16 or 17 kit as well that's a
little bit cheaper but this is what I've
been using this is the timings I've been
using for pretty much all of my Intel
and rise in and threader protesting
recently it's worked fine for me but if
there is incompatibility depending on
your processor and that's something
that's considered worth considering the
model numbers are basically the same
they're just adding an X to the end for
the AMD versions they look the same
basically it seems like they have the
same timings and everything and
roughly the same number of kits
available although there's some that are
specifically for Rison so you're not
going to be able to see all the same
memory capacity configurations in there
well they don't have a hundred and
twenty eight gig kit Verizon yeah oh
yeah that's still missing it still
missing by sixteen geez
but yeah so there you go if you're
looking to buy a build the Rison system
or a third Ripper system and you're
specifically like I want to get that RGB
ddr4 goodness then maybe that's
something to take a gander at from
g.skill meantime Corsair is is also kind
of expanding their RGB memory line up
with a all-white kit the Vengeance RGB
who this is a single picture that I have
here Kyle it's pretty sexy like it's all
the people home at home a little bit
more uh yeah so um this is basically the
same thing as course there's existing
vengeance LED ramped except the modules
are now white the heat sinks are now
White's same excellent RGB
implementation same brightness and
customizability with the software but
the heat spreaders are now what that's
all I know because I didn't read this
article because no you did perfect you
did perfect so that's what I'm seeing
here
they're now white I just needed you to a
stall this stall little dance right so
this video doesn't have the white one
this would look really good in like a
white belt like a you know but splash
page has been up to it alright so here's
here's a good version of it so there
yeah there you go the white with RGB
this is good because previously the only
like white kit of RAM that I would ever
opt for for a white build would be
coursers vengeance lpx yeah serious but
now we've got the RGB so that's cool and
then that stands out pretty well
yeah nice contrast with the colouring so
I'm sure this is gonna be popular so
there you go of course they're expanding
their lineup a little bit the white the
white white parts tend to absorb and
refer yeah reflecting the the light the
RGB
a little bit better than the black black
kind of absorbs it all in the end the
the white reflects it so that's why
white RGB pcs typically look a bit more
colorful than the black ones yep
all right add one other story here and I
don't have notes on this but we've
talked a little bit about the Atari box
in past episodes the entire box is
apparently going to be a little bit
fancier than was initially expected it's
actually gonna have an AMD CPU and the
Linux operating system so it is going to
have current generation to some degree
PC hardware in there the projected price
is about 250 to 300 dollars so you're
not gonna expect this to have you know
an eight-core rise in the cpu with the
d'vega 56 or anything like that but
something comparable
I would guess something in the APU range
maybe not even Xen maybe something based
on their previous generation
architecture but um still expensive
enough that you might be able to do a
little bit more with it than just play
ported old Atari games but might be
something to keep an eye on yeah just in
the space if you're into retro stuff
especially if you were like one of those
people who really like the mini NES or
mini Super Nintendo might be an
interesting product but also something
that you could use a little bit more
expansively than just to play a few
missed object games yeah that's pretty
cool all right
um we're gonna do sword fight next but
I'd like to do this really really
quickly
yeah just because I'm hungry me too
sorry I can't I argue about something on
Kyle's half of the show we already
discussed the player knowns
battlegrounds creators being unhappy
with fortnight battle for you out which
is a game that's already exists that's
developed by fortnight player known as
battlegrounds their developers are Blue
Hole but they all use Unreal Engine 4 so
the same game same underlying game
engine fortnight Battle Royale is
basically the fortnight game with a
battle royale version
that is extremely similar to the
gameplay and player a nun's milligrams
which is massive battlegrounds that a
bunch of people start out in presumably
parachute down into at least according
to this video and then it's just a
deathmatch to see who the last man
standing is which has proven to be an
incredibly addictive version of gameplay
from four player unknowns battlegrounds
but player knows about guns they're
considering further action potentially
getting a little similar tease the
teacher let you just take teaches
potentially filing a lawsuit against
against them to say like hey you're
stealing our stuff let it give you so
the question we're gonna answer at least
try to get a little bit more down to
really quickly here is should game
developers be able to do this if there
is a game developer it makes a game and
they see another game developer make a
game that's very similar to their game
should they be able to sue them or take
legal action against them granny that's
down to the courts to actually decide
that but we can argue this and decide
right now just whether or not it should
be a thing because maybe maybe maybe
there's lawyers watching and they'll be
like you're right and then they'll go
and make that happen
that's our assumption what happens every
time so what do you think yes or no Oh
Vic sixty second argument for okay one
side or the other I'm going to say yes
I'm gonna play devil's advocate yes it's
the right to predict their IP and
copycats are lame how would you feel
Paul if I started a new segment called
garage work logs that are the best on
YouTube be flattered garage more clocks
that are better than YouTube by bit wait
wouldn't you feel a little bit how else
did you feel a little bit like a little
saltiness I feel like would get poured
onto that wound and then additionally
you know I I start doing a segment
called probing Kyle you know it's not
exactly the same as scrubbing Paul but
you know all the same basic fundamental
elements are there created off of
something that you initially made on
own channel you felt it was a protected
safe and unique and you know an
elemental part of your channel that sets
you apart from the competition and and
all of a sudden I come in
swoop in and steal your your thunder
basically um I don't think that would be
very well-received on your end and I
feel like you would have some legal
grounds in court to sue the out of
me
I personally think originality is key
and if a company feels like they their
creativity is being encroached upon by
some copycat they have a right to at
least take them to court to to to to
hash it out to hash it out and figure
out whether or not it is infringing on
their rights or not you know I'm not
saying that you know pub G or Blue Hole
is in the right here I'm saying that
they have a right to take the fortnight
people at the games to court and just
hash it out and see and see if they
really are picking them over and you
gotta love that promo - did you watch
the promo trailer promo but if I can
second them guys fortnight they were
like we've loved like we were a huge fan
of the Battle Royale genre like games
like h1z1 and pub G they actually named
they listed pub G in their promo as if
to say like hey blue wholewheat we gave
you guys a shout out in our promo
trailer so you can't really come at us
so you know it's saying that we copied
you guys cuz we're homies rights I mean
we're giving you all this you know all
this publicity all this visibility on
our promo video we're cool right yeah
 off fortnight you're a bunch of
dicks okay well keep it short okay so as
Chesley this chants already pointed out
pretty extensively here h1z1 called and
they'd like their game concept back but
even beyond that the the basic game
concept of pub G is not one that's all
that crazy or out there or hasn't been
done before there's plenty of games that
have had that style of game play in the
past and the fact that
they're taking another game that's so
similar and potentially going and saying
we're gonna see you
seems a little disingenuous when a lot
of their original original ideas for the
their games were already derived from
other games that already existed and
we've seen this happen time and time
again in the past like League of Legends
and those types of games were all
derived from a mod for I believe believe
it was a warcraft mod be wrong about
that I'm probably wrong about that
anyway point is everything is derivative
so you're not gonna be able to take any
idea and say this is unique and
completely different and completely
original everything sort of derived from
other stuff and you take it and you make
it slightly different or slightly better
or just slightly different or just
slightly something that Warcraft 3 yes
thank you Thank You Chet thank you very
much
I was right I said oh no I said Warcraft
I was close enough Notah yes defense of
the agents damn agents or defensive
defensive the haz
yeah so we've seen this happen plenty of
times before it's gonna keep happening
in the future it doesn't even happen
just in games like like it's stuff like
hardware like look at look at
innovations with like AMD has come out
with like dual channel memory and and
bringing that I'm starting out dual
channel my bringing the bringing the
memory controller on to the on to the
CPU die or PCI Express controller or
going 64-bit or something like that
it happens other companies pick it up
because it's a good idea and then they
keep doing that because it doesn't
matter that you were first or that you
can say that's mine and I want it and
you can't have it it matters what's
works best for people or that's how it
should work and so like my bottle gift
yeah I shouldn't try to hoard it to
myself I should share it
exactly the world see I've convinced you
I win wait no no you're wrong
now you have you know you have to wear
everything Paul says rubbish all right
see what the result say people say no
they agree with me I win
64 percent damn you it's epic it's
unprecedented all right laughs Gina
I don't like any video again I want to
have you ever want to have a timer I'm
like I can play a video game right now
I played see us go for like the last two
nights oh yeah it's been awesome it's so
fun that's fun
well I'm I'm packing up my the game
system I would be gaming on and sidon
and I'm gonna give it away to someone so
I need a notice to put there I will come
very soon all right what are we what are
we what's that donations we do have some
donations thank you to all of you guys
who have donated and again I'm gonna
take all your donation money and I'm
gonna match it and I'm gonna donate that
out to Puerto Rico what do we go we go
we're planning and and our thoughts and
submit Italian and prayers and hopefully
some money to goes out to this sort of
citizens there who are dealing with a
very different leftover from Kyle's hat
for my half nine to five hardware five
dollars hey guys oh yeah upgrade from my
59 30k and if so what should I upgrade
to keep up the good work
59 30 K it's pretty solid yeah you're
fine yeah you're good stick with that
yep are you gonna do any meal time while
I'm doing this baby I'll save mine for
next week because yeah that makes it
yeah
Paul's a Nations are a Joseph t-shirt
thank you folks just evening out the
donation from last round and helping
Puerto Rico it's also it's always more
fun when you get to help people up Thank
You Jose the true thank you very much
sir much appreciated Michael drum five
bucks the Turk and JD of YouTube hashtag
I love hashtag scrubs don't ever say
that again
never happened never happened never
happened Omar's
no I think Omar is the guy who sends the
lollipop yeah thanks Omar Omar ten
dollars just put the lollipop all the
way in your mouth and let it sit for a
few seconds oh my god no no I want to
leave this place alive without fire in
my neck so it's so bad such a bad advice
yeah it's so brutal yeah Heather Hansen
$5 Paul since you didn't reapply your
lipstick you must apply some to Kyle's
lips or he just like a dinner tonight
love
wifey sauce I will I'll gladly eat
dinner with Paul instead we're going to
get sushi yeah he's getting sushi
whether I'm coming or not so I mean hey
if he doesn't put lipstick on me I'll
just Alba to see with him
you you decide is the ball is in your
court woman and cows balls I'm probably
gonna come home so I home please save me
burrito whatever oh my god NB 67 be six
dollars thank you cause in a great show
thanks MB bunch of real assemblage VA
3mh beat California Canadian $5 fine
Canadian no have five California nice
california Canadians thank you very much
sir kissy seven five dollars when was
the first or the last time either of you
used a net burst PC I'm watching on a
new Pentium II II 965 bill that
amazingly can handle 1080p 60 that's a
message that I've never used it at first
PC nothing ever yeah I would I have time
wise I'd have to I have to go back and
look at a calendar because that's it
okay that's info I can pull up old
school stuff but yeah like mm no Extreme
Edition 965 that's not that's not too
old I want to say 2006 but I okay so
about a decade ten years or so net first
is never snippers the manufacturer neper
netburst refers to the architecture I
believe oh wow okay yeah that's way
before my time
I feel so young it's like this is the
type of discussion where I'm like I need
to reference Wikipedia to make sure that
the information I have in my head is
correct is it goes away so quick quiz
good call
yeah calls got Dilbeck 666 pala make
balloon animals on our necks for
donations Kyle breathe if you don't if
you agreed to put me on pin my PC next
week I all I'm continuing to breathe air
continuing I guess I'm agreeing to it
and Paul's gonna do balloon animals yeah
it would be fun I'll get some
Rohit's and balloons for you to blow up
do you still you need to remember you
remember all that yeah and I'd know how
to do it
you don't forget that something like I
feel like I'd forget like it's muscle
memory
yeah can I guess it would be comes back
to you I'll be fun
l have you ready $10 thank you very much

Marcus charity donations for a good

awful things to be done by either of you
since we've seen enough that is very
good of you
very good go ahead both the viewers of
this dream as well as the people of
Puerto Rico Goodman and I'm the hammer
to $5 hey guys love the content I need a
GPU for a rise in 1600 and 500 watt PSU
with the Coolermaster liquid 120 I have
3 180 monitors - 223 and one or two 23
and 1 27 inches guessing he means 3 1080
monitors 310 a team honors yeah what's a
180 monitor all right for your needs I'm
still going gtx 1070 right now yeah yeah
anything else is pretty over price yeah
I haven't looked at 10 60 prices and
recently have those come down I am look
to either I'd have to look but yeah yeah
it's a it's in 70 probably match up
pretty well with that no uh the best
yeah be Argentinian a nice show have you
ever used or heard about the swappable
slash upgrade path of the electronics
laptop brand they use desktop CPU with
sake I my only experience with
electronics is I bought one of their
SATA based SSDs m2 SSDs for the $400
gaming PC I did recently on the channel
no that's the only time I've ever heard
of them or used a product of theirs well
I have not heard of them
okay I've heard I've heard really found
laptop manufacturers that use desktop
parts and make some swappable and stuff
like that right I've found that
interesting but not not so practical I
don't know I'd have to have to take a
closer look to actually render an
opinion but it's good we don't know
check the reviews if there are any yeah
to see what other people think
Giovani lick'em le from the $10 hey guys
I need some help with my new setup I
have a gtx I have GTX 10 or I'm sorry
970 for the wins in sli with a 1600 X
Rison I'm having consistent FPS drops
under 25 FPS at 1080p on high even in
GTA latest drivers fresh Windows SLI
enabled help under 25 fps seems
suspiciously what are you saying even in
GTA yeah whatever does that mean other
games as well cuz like what I would be
doing is testing multiple games because
you know you're gonna have very desolate
performance depending on what game
you're playing beyond that I would maybe
take a look at memory if if it's
something like that maybe you look at a
power supply yeah we might you might be
having
we need a full list of your specs really
to figure out what's going on yeah if
you've got a really cheap power supply
maybe something like that it's it's
suddenly it's it's dropping the amperage
or something like that and you know
you're not getting enough power
delivered not enough to like turn the
system off but enough to drop
performance yeah said beat I mean based
on what you said that those would be the
first two things that look at but yeah I
hope that helps make sure that your your
UEFI is updated to the latest version as
well
Rison and stuff yeah make make sure
you're in high performance mode or that
you have the rise and
the resin bounced mode for your with the
free windows power plan yes Leon Corsa
$10 pulp I want more
man-on-man action like in Kyle's Twitter
pinnacle well you'll have to watch next
week's episode of awesome hardware hey
it took a hundred dollars for him to
kiss me I know we have to fess up merely
like a hundred dollars my thought was
200 because it was $100 the donation and
$100 that you would have to pay - oh
yeah that's that hos my thought process
instead of just do that for a hundred
bucks any more than that here cheap date
leo el primo $5 I heard Experian was
getting hacked - lighter note Kyle what
happened to the BitFenix Enzo you
sounded kind of odd at the last
competition content things Enzo I will
be getting a sneak peak early access
look at that case how come it'll
actually be no I probably won't I was
gonna say everybody it'll be on ultra a
week cuz I did a thing I agreed we made
an agreement with BitFenix that I'd be
able to post the Enzo review a week
early on ultra my paid subscription
channel but I just found out today for
someone who tweeted me that YouTube is
completely doing away with paid channels
and yeah and so they'll an Ultra is
going to die in like a month
that's not early November 1st bit ultra
is is dead so I have to figure out what
the hell to supplement that with but I
will still be reviewing the end so
probably on its launch date which I
don't know if I can reveal right now so
I'm not going to but it's coming CV

silver lining
listen for the fiver
Australian lady yes good day guys thank
you for the many hours of binge watching
try an Aussie beer sometime uh dry
hooroo I did I was opened raisin that
one I was at BevMo today and and they do
it there's an Australian section really
so I don't know much about Australian
beer just like Foster's yeah I've had a
Foster's that's probably like there it's
the one that's been marketed in the US
as Australian beers cold and dry though
keep an eye out for it yeah
dipper I yeah yeah Leon Corsa I got Leah
in $200 totally bail is I want that man
on man action okay really we just have
to have what is the price what is it was

same time not even wearing me know I
don't bring that back up he's that
didn't say anything about saying so I'm
gonna turn that out you two-faced
oh my god me alright how about this
we'll plan will plan something with baby
oil at some point all right I don't know
what it's gonna be yet save like the
baby oil will be involved okay
how about that I'm making that more
specific it's just because it's it's
unfair for you to throw this impromptu
man-on-man action request on us when we
haven't really even mentally prepared
for it so what why don't we give you
this is consider this an IOU from us to
you because I got nothing anything I can
possibly think of right now that you
know that spices for man-on-man action
also does not probably fall within
twitches Terms of Service so we're gonna
leave it at that all right no no we're
gonna kiss shut up that ball let me go
I'll ban everyone selbst animal I see I
feel like you were forced to do
something on your half so I don't want
to I know you're just perpetuating right

donated well Fosters is not an Aussie
beer no one drink fosters really never
touched V B stands for vaginal backwash
Carlton or great North neither just to
be clear I wasn't recommending Foster oh
definitely one that there's been
commercials up so we're like Oh Foster's
Australian for beer whatever yes so yeah
