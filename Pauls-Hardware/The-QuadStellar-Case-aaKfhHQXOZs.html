2017 coverage I of course want to start
off by thanking my sponsors gigabytes
ocz a Toshiba company as well as deep
cool and that's where I'm at right now
is the deep cool suite and they have
tons of stuff to show off so I'm going
to start off with these fans over here
I'm sure you guys I was going to make a
fan pun but I gave up never mind about
that
these are RGB fans that our control will
lie this little unit up top and they're
sold in sets of three so for $89 you can
get three fans and this controller
mounts in a 2.5 inch Bay or it will come
with adhesive as well as well but you
can control the lighting as you can
probably see right here via apps
available for Android or iOS there's a
ton of different features in there as
far as different lighting effects you
can do whether you want breathing or
flashing or rainbow colors or all that
kind of thing and you'll notice there's
actually two different types so this one
over here on the left is going to give
you just just a tiny little bit better
performance about one degree difference
they're telling us because this does
have a circular shroud or guard going
around the outside of its helped to
direct the airflow a little bit more
this one over here I think you guys will
find pretty interesting because it's
basically frameless it's got this kind
of frame going across the front of it
but there's nothing going around the
side the other nice thing about these is
they are fluid dynamic bearing fans you
can pop the fan off easily if you need
to clean it out or that kind of thing
and it's a very distinct and different
look than you typically get with the
typical 120 millimeter fan or that kind
of thing these should be out very soon
April 2017 and again sold in sets of
three let's move on this way next we
have the bearing case so this is a new
case from deep cool part of their gamer
storm series and this case is actually
going to be available with integrated
deep cool liquid cooling because of
course they have the captain's series of
all-in-one liquid coolers that they make
this one has one integrated already so
basically it comes pre-installed and you
just got a wire that up and connect it
to your motherboard your cooling
solution they've actually taken the
liquid and routed it through a little
flow indicator down here RGB lighting of
course is also available they put a nice
SSD mount right up here above that so
you can have that visible and you know
show off your SSD it does have a acrylic
side panel but it is sort of a smoked
glass look and a very nice finish on
this as well for acrylic in particular
so that keeps way down and shipping
costs down and it's all
very durable it just fell over and then
apart from that there's a unique power
supply situation with this one you could
mount your power supply in the bottom
down here and go with a micro ATX
motherboard or you can move the power
supply up to the top which is how they
have it configured right now and then
you can fit a full-size ATX motherboard
in there that's pretty nice also it's
metal on the front and the top it's a
very nice painted finish as well and of
course you have typical aiyyo aiyyo up
there and that kind of thing let's move
over here that last bearing case by the
way is 120 $9.99 MSRP and it should be
out in a couple months possibly three
months maybe April timeframe next up is
the Earle case liquid here you have a
similar situation but a larger style
case made for full ATX chassis so you
have a power supply shroud down there at
the bottom a couple SSD mounts of course
and then again the integrated liquid
cooling solution this one in particular
has a red accents both on the LED strip
at the bottom as well as the fan up on
top it's got a hundred and forty
millimeter radiator right there and then
again they've integrated a cool flow
indicator right there so everything's
all connected there so you can look at
cool your CPU right out of the box
other than that a fairly standard
configuration as far as the look of the
case overall a box style chassis a bit
of an accent here on the front panel and
then again we have that smoked acrylic
panel that goes on the side so you can
get a look in at your build once it's
all set up configured and good to go
this one is going to retail for a
hundred and fifty dollars and bear in
mind again you're getting the case and
the liquid cooler but they're telling us
that they're also going to later on down
the line release versions of these cases
that don't have the liquid cooling and
they will be significantly less
expensive you can you can just guess
what it's going to cost because I don't
know right now $70 next new case is the
new arc 90 a new version of the arc 90
so this one is a lot more high-end you
might say it's got tempered glass panels
across the front the side and at the top
and then of course the side panel here
is also tempered glass it has a really
cool radiator going up the front here
they have red fluid it and it right now
and I believe that's what it's going to
ship with but it also has an LED array
or strip that goes down the front here
as well as over the top you can control
that as well as with the controls the
gamers storm logo down
there it's a little flow indicator down
here in the front too I thought that
looked pretty cool and inside they have
this cooling array it comes with a 288
millimeter radiator that's installed in
there already they have three fans going
across it and then on the opposite side
over here the side panel has a bunch of
slots sort of cut out of it looks really
cool and that allows for direct
ventilation of the heat from that
radiator so a very good way of keeping
the heat out of the rest of your system
because it's not even come back there
and affect the rest of the system
speaking the rest of the system that's
an AM for motherboard if you guys didn't
notice maybe even a rise in CPU and
there we're not really sure
and that motherboard is just there to
show that these new coolers from deep
cool are going to be fully a m4
compatible so if you're looking forward
to rising and you're looking forward to
water cooling your eyes and chip then
maybe look to a deep cool cooler also
there is an extension here for your PCI
Express slot so you can take your
graphics card and either do it directly
into the slot or you can bring it out
and have it shown up there write it
right out front through your side panel
so it looks pretty one more thing to
show you get no two more things will
save the best for last
a quick update for the deep cool captain
all-in-one liquid cooling series is an
RGB version of it that they have right
here so you might see RGB lighting going
on there in the back if not I can
control it with the remote control wait
where the remote control go ha ha ha ha
ha ha ha ha ha ha ok I found the remote
here so it's actually got a color wheel
on it so I can just spin around change
the color and you might notice that the
color of the lights on the cooler is
changing along with this RGB strip so
basically what they've upgraded this
with is added an RGB LED strip added the
ability to connect that strip to the
deep cool captain liquid cooler as well
calling it deep cool captain e.x RGB
because RGB makes sense and everyone
knows what that is now and then a
magnetic strip right here which you can
of course attached to any steel exposed
part of your chassis and get yourself
some RGB action just by upgrading your
liquid cooler alright the best thing is
next it's right through here
so this is the deep cool quad stellar
which if you guys are familiar with the
Tri stellar
it's just the next logical thing to do
is make it quad so I assume they're
going to have a Penta stellar at one
point but we'll leave that up to you
guys for future speculation anyway the
quad stellar right here instead
being a mini ITX chassis like the Tri
stellar was supports full size actually
ATX Andy ATX motherboards so the actual
like plain of the motherboard sits this
way along this rail right here this
compartment up on top can be removed and
then you can add your graphics cards up
there via PCIe risers you can fit a
3-way SLI configuration up here or if
you're looking into doing something else
like maybe putting radiators up here
something you can remove that and then
you can put up to four-way SLI or
whatever you're doing down there in the
actual interior of the chassis so lots
of configurations for high ends graphics
cards and that kind of thing and since
this entire like - - parts of the quad
are mainly your motherboard layout and
everything like that the top of it up
here is left for hard drive and you can
fit up to nine 3.5 inch hard drives via
the bays up there and of course has some
RGB lighting across here on the front
down in this quadrant
you have a power supply area and then
they also have some RGB lighting in
there they're still working on this as a
prototype so they're planning coming out
with it in a few months now but they're
aiming for a $300 price point on this
which is less than the Tri stellar was
and for a case like this since I mean
very looks very custom designed and very
different than your typical standard ATX
chassis that's pretty cool
additional features also include the
ability to supply or ESET extended size
motherboards but you can fit really
really large motherboards in here and
then these panels here on the front are
actually thermally controlled so there's
a temperature sensor inside the case I
think they have multiple temperature
sensors and if it gets too warm these
will open up and actually vent more warm
air then once the system cools down the
close up on their own which is pretty
cool there are some other accent
lighting points on here that they've
been working on as well again prototypes
so not everything is working perfectly
and then again tempered glass panels
that are up here as well as down on the
sides so you can get a nice look in at
your system once you get it all set up
and good to go so that's the quad
stellar and I want to know what you guys
think of this case because I think it's
pretty badass I mean if you have enough
space for it of course you can make a
really cool looking system and $300 for
something like this I think is quite
reasonable so let me know what you guys
think in the comments section down below
I will be back with more coverage of CES
2017 really
- like really soon we're already gone to
so many places and met so many people
they're all lovely so I hit the thumbs
up button leave me comments and I will
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
