that's what we're demonstrating right
from my understanding we should be live
right about now so hello everyone and
welcome oh this is awesome hardware it
is a live show and we discuss technology
we drink some beer we have a good time
we do it every Tuesday evening at 5:30
p.m. Pacific time and we stream live to
our YouTube channels as well as
twitch.tv slash awesome hardware right
now we're doing the first half of
episode 154 and we're streaming it to my
channel on YouTube that's Paul's
hardware and an hour or so we'll switch
to the second half which will be
streamed to Kyle's channel bit wit and
the entire thing you just streamed on
Twitch so thanks to all of you guys who
are joining us live today and we have
some very exciting stuff to talk about
and it's modest it's moderately exciting
some of its obviously tell me that's
okay it makes the other news sound
really cool but if nothing else we're
just gonna hang out and drink a few
beers and have a good time speaking of
drinking beer we drink beer
on the show so occasionally we do also
use adult language so if you do have
small children or other people who are
offended by that sort of thing maybe
kick them out or plug up their ears with
something so they don't hear it today
we're drinking provided by wifey sauce
yep this is modern times stout the
coffee roasted out to be specific yes
I'm finishing off my chronic ale amber
from Pizza port brewing they're both
very good they're delicious
she did she did a good job delicious
thanks right he's asked Cheers so thanks
to you guys for joining us and let us
kick off the show with uh with the quick
announcement yeah we are gonna be at
Comic Con and we are going to be at the
BYO PC area there's a bring your own PC
event there it's not BYO PC let's not
bring your own PC they're already gonna
have the system set up so you want a
system already said there's a PC gaming
area though and we're gonna be hanging
out there and as far as I know it's the
first year that comic-con has ever had a
LAN presence like a PC gaming presence
so it's pretty cool yeah um but yeah
we're gonna be there so we'll tweet
about stuff where we are and whatnot
we're gonna be at the land area I
believe specifically on Saturday
let's plan oh I don't know if it's well
we'll be there Friday and Saturday but I
think one of the days we actually have a
specific meetup time okay
details forthcoming about the exact
specific meetup time yeah but we'll
figure that all that out animal tweeted
and stuff so if you guys are going to
Comic Con feel absolutely you should
stop by the PC gaming area and you
should also come say hi to us yeah I
don't think either of us replied to
Brian in his email five days ago but he
mentioned this shine we should thank
Brian as well as angel or angels our
friend to kind of hook this up and Brian
actually provide us with the passes so
thanks Brian yeah and we suck at email
we're sorry really I'm sorry I can't
really I constantly feel bad about how
bad a MIDI you know but apparently not
bad enough to do any better at it so fun
fun fact Brian actually got our
attention initially through donating on
this show though he attached oh yeah
that was he was like he gave his own
like the Lana thon that he does like a
few times a year a shout-out on the show
he's again you guys should come by Comic
Con and we just read it as like some you
know Rando comment or whatever but he
had like previously apparently tried to
either email us or message us on Twitter
events down in San Diego area yeah so
there you go yeah stay tuned for details
on Comic Con all right we don't have a
quick plug for our stores if you guys
wanna help support us and you like our
live shows or the other content we post
on YouTube and we're go ahead and buy
stuff Paul Cybernet is my store I don't
know what else to say about it high
quality merchandise we have some awesome
hardware merch as well as other stuff
mugs pint glasses shirts some hoodies
some stuff is sold out because it's so
darn popular also big weight that tech
slash store is Kyle store you commercial
buy stuff there it all comes from the
same location so it's all real nice
super super nice to this and thanks to
you guys to support us if you do buy
stuff we will shout out to Johnson at
you at the end of each show which is a
ritual that we do which confuses people
it's mainly we do it's the main reason
why we continue to do it is for people
like what hell is going on ROH you all
all right let's jump any news please
driving in a technology news it was a
feel like it was a little light on news
this week but there's yeah there's some
up stemming up stemming cuff wow Rd this
is already happy of coming stuff the
strong beer there's some upcoming stuff
that we can sort of start to get the
rumor mill turn in for turn in for a
burnin or at least have some discussion
about so AMD announced third up or two
at Computex they confirmed it they
actually said its launching in August so
that's not like new news what is kind of
new news and this is a hardware calm
article is the actual launch date
according to this article which is still
a rumor so this is that we're not
reporting this as fact or anything but
August 13th supposedly is when you will
be able to buy yourself a second gen
Rison thread Ripper these are these are
going to be awesome for multiple reasons
mainly lots more cores the core war has
officially launched and more cores is
more power and surrender faster render
stuff faster content creation great
stuff make things Intel of course
attempted to preempt am these third
refer to announcement back at Computex
with the much maligned and discussed 28
core demo the intel did of their 28 core
cpu that they said will launch later
this year and it was doing five
gigahertz but more on that in just a
second supposedly that did affect Intel
I'm sorry that did affect Andy's
announcement though because AMD
supposedly was originally like in some
of the earlier media materials that went
out they only had listed up to a twenty
four core mmm
but that when they actually announced
like not we're doing 32 and we know
they've been capable of doing 32 because
that's what epic has been doing for
quite some time and epic uses the same
base level rise in cores that that that
rise in processors and therfore
processors use so it's possible and
they're gonna do it and if nothing else
Intel's 28 core demo maybe did push them
to drop 32 cores so that's cool the
action
all SKUs that are tough they're talking
about that will be available at launch
is the twenty nine ninety X is what
they're calling the the highest end one
the 32 core mess so they'll have 32
cores in 64 threads and then there's the
29 50 X which is 24 cores and 48 threads
still no word yet on the whether they'll
be if it's gonna I guess would be 16 to
24 to 32 that makes sense I don't know
if they're gonna do anything else in
between they're probably not that I
don't think they really they really need
to you know and it did the 20 the 29 90
X did briefly appear online late last
months and a European I'm sorry German
retailer but Kansas is Europe priced at
1509 euros so again that was like a
pre-order at a retail website so again
that's really info not confirmed but
that seems a reasonable price 1509 euros
is one thousand seven hundred and fifty
five US dollars and that would be a
decent undercut of intel's 79 80 extreme
edition which is the 18 core 36 thread
which currently sells for $2,000 so
suddenly you can get 32 cores for around
1750 then that seems like a better deal
than 18 cores for mm thank ya does I'm
29 and X supposedly will have a base
clock of 3 gigahertz all core max
frequency of 3.4 gigahertz 3.4 gigahertz
on 32 cores is pretty nice I would
assume it also be overclockable but I'm
not to see what it comes to when we talk
them about the amount of heat generated
and and like TDP ratings and where they
go when you start overclocking precision
because clock will go up to 4 gigahertz
so three Meg's of l1 cache 16 Meg's of
l2 cache 64 Meg's of l3 cache and a 250
watt TDP that's so cool no more further
details on that 24 core version other
than the name I guess 29 50x
I was kind of thinking like if they do a
2950 X it would be a 16 core thread
rapport to version and then they'd have
to have like a 2019 70 X that would be
the 24 core and then a 29 90 X but
whatever they want to you they want to
you know they want to change the core
count that's matches with the 50 it's
not like any we're used to confusing
product names yeah exactly
none of the naming schemes were here and
the piece makes sense already so
industry hey why should they start now
but back over to the knee the Intel
thing so until did that 20 core CPU demo
at Computex they got a lot of flack for
it because the way they demonstrated on
stage and they didn't mention
overclocking and they had like a 1500
watt water cooler that was positioned
down underneath it they didn't really
show but all that said what is it and is
it actually gonna watch so cascade Lake
X is the name that's being tossed around
although again that's not actually a
name that Intel is used it's just what
people are calling it because after they
did the 28 core processor demo and they
got some inquisitive people asking about
some of the details for it that they
didn't reveal they did clarify that it
is a 14 nanometer architecture CPU then
it was overclocked to 5 gigahertz
yeah but of course with that crazy
cooler that they had on it so we can
assume it's it's it's at least derived
from a current generation product so
most likely a cascade Lake X or what
would be called cascade leaks X if it is
the CPU that people think it is which
based on the socket that we actually
managed to get some pictures of when we
saw the motherboards and in person was
LGA 36:47 that's the xeon socket so
likely the cpu that was used according
to gamers Nexus as well as a few other
people who sort of deduced this was the
$10,000 Xeon Platinum 80 176 CPU which
is a 28 core Xeon and they probably took
that and did some shenanigans with it
and unlocked the overclock enos of it
and overclocked it and and that was what
they demoed now according to Intel
they're going to launch a 28 core CPU on
their high-end desktop by the end of the
year that's what they've said and really
all of the information in this article
which is from techradar.com by the way
that's the only thing that is that that
like they've said in as confirmed but
who knows how confirmed that is because
it's a product on a platform that like
we don't know the details about yet
we're already in q3 so we're looking at
q4 it's just we're not sure if there's
going to be enough time or they're
actually gonna launch it we're not sure
if it's gonna be some derivation of this
actually lg8 36:47 are they gonna do a
big socket high-end desktop and launch a
new desk high-end desktop platform for
it or are they like I can't see them
doing this on LG I 2066 it doesn't seem
physically possible do you think it's
still gonna be 14 nanometer it does seem
like it will yes still be 14 nanometer
so if they take existing Xeon the
engineering work they've done on Xeon
and they poured it over to desktop then
that might be what cascade Lake X is as
part of me like justjust from the past
year to has seen Intel just rush demos
and announcements so so much and so
badly and desperately that I wouldn't
even be surprised if like they showcase
this 40 nanometer chips as like they're
20 was a 28 or 24 core 24 core demo
without it even really being ready and
like the actual release is gonna be a
different process or something like that
and like they just really wanted to have
an impressive demo way ahead of schedule
to compete with AMD well the demo
question is is for sure I mean that's
exactly what they did for the Compu tech
stuff and they didn't really do anything
else at Computex when it comes to
announcements for high-end desktop or
much in general when it comes to the CPU
side so yeah it like all we have to go
on is but as what they said but there
apparently was also a an extreme a
report from extreme tech also mentioned
in the article that said Intel's road
map shows cascade Lake X high-end
desktop processors debuting next year so
2019 excuse me if that was the case then
we might see a cascade Lake X
launched at roughly the same time as
cannon Lake but they would be different
process notes because cascade Lake X
would be on 14 nanometer + + + Cannon
Lake is on 10 nanometer there's also a
rumor 22 Corps mentioned in the article
to possibly go along to provide sort of
a step up from your I currently up they
go up to 18 so be the 18 to 22 to 28
but yeah so for all other speculative
things written in the article if you
guys want to check it out but ultimately
they concluded and I would tend to agree
that if Intel wants to renew their
competitiveness in the high-end desktop
space because people do seem to be more
have been more excited about threader
for this past year then about skylake X
is to make their processors in their
platform more affordable yeah
competition has been brought and they
could do that with a new with the new
with launching a new lineup but we'll
see if they actually follow through with
that well yeah a couple more a couple
more tech stories here first off China
is actually manufacturing producing x86
processors this is kind of an
interesting story because well China's
been trying to get into the chip
manufacturing business for a while the
processors themselves referenced in the
article are called diana d hya na and
they are based on AMD zen
microarchitecture and they're beginning
to surface from chinese chip producer hi
gan then if you're looking at this and
thinking to yourself wait wait a minute
Intel actually opens x86 and AMD has a
cross-licensing agreement with Intel to
produce x86 processors how is this AMD
then giving this Chinese company the
ability to produce these processors the
article goes into it but we'll get back
to that in a second AMD according to the
article does not sell its final trip
designs to its China based partners
instead it allows them to design their
own processors tailored for the
Chinese server market that's what they
say but the sea views themselves are so
similar to AM DS epic processors that
Linux kernel developers have listed
vendor IDs and family series numbers as
the only difference so they seem to be
like almost copies but a AMD allows them
to use their design because it's only
for the Chinese market is that what I'm
getting it's it's limited to a regional
use um and that's how that's how they're
able to use it it's it's it's not
because of that I'll get to that okay so
just a second I mean I I don't from what
I from what I can tell I don't think
these processors are going to be sold
globally but yeah you never know on eBay
but this the joint venture was actually
announced back in 2016 and at the time
AMD was kind of having a tough time they
had I've been operating at a loss for
six quarters prior to that and infused
AMD with 293 million dollars of cash and
AMD then took that and used it to invest
in the frizzing of their Rison line so a
lot of the stuff that AMD has been
coming out with I'm sure is at least in
part possible by the fact that they
actually had this capital infusion but
back to the tricky way that they got
around the Intel AMD cross licensing
agreements according to the article and
again there's more detail than what I'm
about to say but AMD holds a 51% stake
in HM C which I believe is the actual
fan while Ken Jin tae Gwang Holdings
hold owns 49% meanwhile AMD owns 30% of
heigen which is the the company and
tangen high long holdings owns 70% so
HFC owns the x86 IP and ends up
producing the chips which satisfies the
AMD Intel x86 cross licensing agreements
because the IP remains with a company
primarily owned by AMD so it seems to be
clever manipulation of who actually owns
the who actually has a larger holding
and the companies that are producing the
chips again guys more more details in
the article this is
not the most exciting thing ever so
let's move on I'm ravenous more news
from China micron we talked about micron
last week there one of the big three
chip manufacturers and we've discussed
their potential price-fixing and other
things with them recently
but just like last week there was a
ruling in China that actually was
forcing micron to not sell it prevented
its Chinese subsidiaries from
manufacturing selling or importing some
DRAM modules and solid-state drives this
was last week and Kyle talked about it
last week the foods whoa whoo-chow
whoo-chow whoo-chow
Intermediate People's Court in China's
Fujian Province handed down this
preliminary injunction micron technology
and this is just an update on it they're
planning to appeal it not surprisingly
the original injunction was a response
to patent infringement suits not in fact
price-fixing so a patent issue is what
the source of this is and that was filed
by Taiwanese foundry UMC micron however
mint maintains that its products do not
infringe on the UMC Penn's
claim to files by UMC and it's Chinese
subsidiary of Fujian Xinhua integrated
circuit company and retaliation for
accusations by micron that you don't see
missus appropriated micron trade secrets
so it's kind of like a they're saying
it's retaliation basically that's where
it's first from that resulted in a civil
lawsuit filed by micron and US District
Court and criminal indictments against
UMC and three of its employees brought
by Taiwanese authorities in the meantime
micron will comply with the ruling while
they request that the Foo Shou court
reconsider or state's decision and it
expects the injunction to reduce its
sales for the current quarter by about
1% 1% reduction in micron sales which
doesn't seem like that much right
well they're still expecting sales
percent of what between eight billion
and eight point four billion million and
1.1 percent of that is about 80 million
80 to 84 million dollars you could buy a
car with that just which doesn't seem
like a lot relative to microns overall
sales but 84 million dollars is a lot of
money millions a million money is money
that's true and if you if your doesn't
matter if you like I feel like the
bigger the company you are the more you
care about every last penny I don't know
yeah they gotta be you gotta be stingy
right the more you have yeah exactly
that's why they have so much money
because they don't take shit like this
customers more and other yeah yep all
right let's move on to something
slightly more interesting last story in
the news department this is AMD's b3x
like beef 450 motherboards which might
be exciting to you if you're interested
in building a computer and you wanted
something that's new and fresh and its
provides overclocking capability and has
support for first and second generation
and is also inexpensive be 350 has been
extremely popular because you can get
motherboards for like 80 bucks or so
that really do a decent job getting
stuff done that you need you need done
and also provides some overclocking
granted that's not always the best
overclocking because the power delivery
does does affect overclocking too but
it's definitely usable you can
definitely overclock with it yes so
we're expecting some be 450 motherboards
that will provide some improvements over
there be 350 motherboard counterparts
and yeah and they should all have
out-of-the-box support Verizon 2006
processors which is steadily becoming
less and less of a concern but it is
potentially an issue if you get a 300
series motherboard and a rise in the
second gen processor this is the be 450
tomahawk motherboard MSI demoed this at
Computex it actually has appeared in a
listing on Amazon us according to
overclocked 3d net which is where this
article came from article didn't list
the price which I thought was stupid but
here's at least
picture this like if it's listed in
Amazon maybe it was just a placeholder
price or something like that just called
everyone at overclocked 3d done net
stupid I didn't say they were stupid I
said in essence I'm out and getting it
back shut your mouth ain't a small piece
of peanut brittle
we're gonna give a cease and desist on
this shit anyway it did the support for
up to thirty four sixty six megahertz
memory and a XMP OSI mode no price
though but there is a second article
also in the description with the this is
from an antic and this is talking about
bunch of other motherboards so that
first one was just the MSI one but
there's there's many more in this
article multiple stores in Austria and
Germany are taking pre-orders on amd-v
450 motherboards from as issues as rock
ASAC soon as rock according to guys
hallstatt EU guys guys guys house just
doing great with my Chinese and German
pronunciation in this episode alright so
there's an asus prime v 450 this is a
Strix where's the prime that's a gift oh
yeah okay is it are we to buy it you
could try but yes I turned up I can try
turning the game up a little bit on that
I'm gonna guess brace your ears I'm
gonna keep talking cows going to
attempts to turn the volume up ever so
slightly on the mic so you guys can
hopefully hear us a little bit better
yeah the door is really squeaky the door
makes a lot of noise what was I talking
about though where is that Asus Prem
that's an ass rock
Gaming talks about theses crime doesn't
show a picture well shucks this is the
Strix be 450 - F gaming which is one of
the asus listings that this one they
have the Strix be 450 - I gaming which I
would assume as mini ITX the tough be
450 plus gaming which is that one no
that's a gigabyte where it's a tough
that's asrock here's the tough stuff be
450 plus gaming that's that's that right
there it's pretty good pink accents pink
yellow yellow accents
what's wrong with my brain first you
can't pronounce it can't pronounce
German and Chinese pronounce now you're
colorblind the hell's wrong with you
just huge penis mistook the yellow for
pink you have no more peanut brittle
beautiful peanut brittle for you
throwing you off
it's your kryptonite there's also the
prime B 450 M - a the prime V 450 plus
and the prime B 450 mm - K so Hazen says
a pretty wide line up prices for all
those AC ASUS motherboards ranged from
86 euro to 186 euro which is about a
hundred to two hundred and seventeen US
dollars seems a little bit on the high
side the grandes who throws a lot of
stuff if they're hiring boards
especially like the ROG and Strix stuff
so we'll see we'll see what what these
boards had that make them stand out a
little bit more you know it's always
interesting to me like it like like it
just goes to show like how popular and
feature-rich be 450 and be 350 are
because you see board partners like
really making them look like they could
be premium boards like that first asus
board that was at the top that's the
Strix
yeah I mean it looked it looked like it
could have easily been like past for
like an X 470 board like you don't
really see the you know the non Z
platforms from Intel I feel like there
are many board makers who are like
making them look that nice because you
can't overclock on them you know you
can't overclock on them and people
aren't buying that like not as many
enthusiasts are investing into those
cheaper platforms
like they are with AMD's cheaper
platforms because you're getting you
know you should still give me faster
memory support and that's one of the
places that that AMD has attacked and
tell because intel has always placed a
decent price premium on the higher-end
enthusiast stuff whether that's the
high-end desktop or the enthusiast
overclocking on the mainstream side z
series chipsets are always like fifty
bucks more expensive than their
alternatives and you have to get get
that nerd overclock and they look
infinitely better I don't think we can
ignore that that's often the case but
for 50 good yeah here's as rock board
just a couple more this is the V 450 M -
HD v this one's only gonna be $84 84 84
bucks I see an MDOT - right here only -
there's another on the back only to dim
dim slots this is a interesting micro
ATX layout and then there's a gigabyte
board this is the B 450 MDS 3h almost
looks like a tough board without just
like a couple little yellow accents also
a micro board where's the where's the
MDOT - isn't I would expect there to be
an MDOT - on you
I am so huge I have no idea if this is
the case or not but like a little micro
ATX board like this I would be happy to
see like 2 m dot 2 slots on the back of
this thing yeah why not what's wrong
with that you know I got it slightly
less accessible once everything's
installed but I mean there'd be slightly
less and maybe less he concerned then
like tucking it underneath it oh this is
an MDOT T right here what am I am blind
basically above the the GPU slot but
anyway yeah then we'd need case makers
to make larger cpu cooler cutouts so we
could access the MDOT two slots on the
back of the board
like a really big CPU cutout and you
could actually get at it yeah I think
I've had that happens with some mini ATX
motherboards yeah be 450 interestingly
enough is still officially unannounced
by AMD even though boards were showing
off a Computex and everyone knows that
it's coming but of course just rundown
features again expect C CPU overclocking
six PCI Express 2.0 lanes for adding
cards in addition to eight or 16 lanes
supported by the AP use of the CPUs
depending what you install to USB 3.1
gen2 ports two USB 3.1 gen2 six USB 2.0
headers and enhanced CPU boosting
techniques like xfr to except bar to
enhanced and precision boost overdrive
stuff that came out when they second gen
rise and stuff lunch super exciting all
right cool let's move on to our next
segments which is not awesomesauce news
I should just leave that though
awesomesauce for life or we're gonna do
some tales from space a brief a brief
what's that
it still says awesome we are the best
twitch streamers in the world I was at
which partners but we're not even
partners we have such a fancy set up was
like we do things that pop up when
people subscribe and stuff oh how much
better actually be can they be like a
border up here with like it's like mr.
daddy's matter I don't know what people
put on there all the garbage that's
littered around this screen fruit right
it's news if I have a tracker for
everything like how many times I've
blinked yeah oh there's another one as
absurd some like little gift dances
around every time I blink or there's
like a stock ticker and like can you
take a sip great we can track that we
need to sit down display that real-time
information for you guys so you can keep
up to date and we have sell throw
assessing looking to see you can keep
track of all of our blinks and sips a
cell needs to know thanks for meaning we
love you so and hi Steve oh well ask
just ask you some he has to use
something you ignored him
we're in Jack I didn't ignore him I
didn't see any hate cell where you can
play the ignore
I think it might have been on Twitter a
Twitter DM oh I see it yeah yeah I'll do
that right now okay I'm late
crafty heck yes we're adding you as a
twitch mods up crafty thanks for being
here
doing it so you know they took us like
40 minutes all right cool oh wait I'm
not logged into our twitch I'm elected
my personal oh you said and I don't have
the password on me for then so I can't
actually are you logged in are they no
you can report him just report him yeah
what the hell your admin privileges have
been revoked ah on your own channel
right just - lame passwords we're sorry
crafty we'll get you on the next or
maybe after we cut after we do this half
for some reason yeah do do them commands
all right yes yes yay for commander
thank you you should be able to mod it's
an a dog and tuna har har who provided
me with the actual commands that we
needed to do as you can see well I'm
glad that works because for some reason
the icon for making him a mod well he's
in there he's just gonna insta ban
everyone in chat now check goes dead
just fall silent hey to the James Webb
telescope the James Webb Space Telescope
do you remember when when we first
talked about the James Webb Space
Telescope Cal do you remember that yes
do you remember what live show we talked
about that on yeah resilient it was a
pretty sure it was awesome harder
no no that was not oh it was Oh was this
the new egg one the one we did anyway
yeah you remember you remember what the
new egg life show is called no I don't
wait why can I enroll it was cold it was
help tab right yes the alt tab show yes
oh no a glass show was when we when we
first brought this up because we like to
bring up science science related stories
and stuff but that's right anyway it's
been delayed like tons and tons of times
which kind of sucks and now potentially
delayed so much that the rocket that it
was originally designed to be launched
on which is the area and five launcher
which NASA chose because it was a proven
rocket and had launched more than a
hundred times is gonna be phased out
potentially before the James Webb
telescope is actually ready ready to be
launched
and that that kind of sucks oh there's
no more good pictures of what a shame
yeah so um the actual agreement to use
the Ariane 5 for the James Webb
telescope was made back in 2015 that's
why we discussed it so long ago when the
expected Webb telescope launched was in
2018 yeah huh
what seems I just I was like pictures of
the James Webb telescope because it's
got like these hex there's no there's
not good pictures some good images it's
got all the golden you memory gamer
these pictures yes yeah I don't think
golden hexagons and all these these all
have to be like a lines super super
precisely and everything mm-hmm here's
it hey stop it
here's an artist concept of it actually
in space which may never actually happen
all this work for nothing but yeah there
there's some there's there's a lot of
major good stuff that could do if it
actually gets up there but it was laid
and it was delayed into 2019 after
originally being delayed till 2018 and
has since been delayed twice more to
2020 in that now twenty twenty twenty
one dam which is the same year that the
Ariane 5 rocket is supposed to be
decommissioned just like that flying is
like it's like coffee like and if you're
designing something like this
specifically for use with a specific
rocket then it's not like it's a easy
task to just move it over to a different
rocket now Arian area and space is
developing a Arian six rocket so there
is a possibility that they could go with
that one instead but the head of the
Arian group Elaine share mobile was not
aware of any discussions with NASA on
launching the Webb telescope on the area
in six so I keep getting ripped out with
my the word Aryan Aryan because yeah I
keep thinking like Aryan race AR ia and
II okay well how it's spelled that I can
see the show doc but they can so I just
want to make sure that we're not gonna
appear like on headlines tomorrow like
all I'm gathered lost some part of the
tech news show discusses savage racism
and master race issues or something so
I've done nothing remotely close to that
you just you're right you're just trying
to did you I need you know you don't fit
the description at all I'm trying to
distract people from science with racism
that's like that's always been my mo
like America but but moving I'm in
America alright um hopefully they figure
that out because the amount alone people
and chatter like that's how I heard it
that's I see I saved are both of our
asses mainly yours
alright you're welcome next up my Aryan
brother uh SpaceX has won its first
Falcon Heavy contract with the Air Force
now I want to point out there's actually
two articles on this uh no description
spaceflight now is a little bit more
accurate with their headline that the US
Air Force has certified the Falcon Heavy
rocket and has awarded it with a launch
contract
there's the Vulcan heavy launch which
was super awesome now to clarify the
Falcon Heavy will be doing a couple
launches in between what this is talking
about and so it won't be the first
launch with the air force the second
launch of the Falcon Heavy rocket is
scheduled for November of this year from
Kennedy Space Center carrying numerous
satellites into different orbits for the
US military NASA and research
institutions and then there's a third
falcon heavy mission set for liftoff
late this year or an early night 2019
which will launch the lockheed martin
builds arabs at six a commercial
communications for Saudi or Saudi
Arabia's Arab set just short for Arabia
and satellite I'm pretty sure but the
the Falcon Heavy the the big Falcon
rocket as it is affectionately
affectionately known launched back in
February if you guys don't recall that
that was as I watched that I thought
that was exciting it was cool big ol big
ol launch of the the Tesla Roadster
up into up into flight into the solar
system where at least man whatever sort
of orbit they put it in around the Sun
but the Air Force was watching that
closely of course and the launch itself
was enough for the Air Force to certify
the Falcon Heavy for carrying the
military's most precious cargo cargo
into orbit
babies not babies military super
soldiers that must be raised in low
Earth orbits in order to be bombarded
with gamma rays gamma radiation no I'm a
starter don't thank you that would be
kind of ended of that began it crazy
that everyone assumes it's some bunch of
technology that they've made this
contract for what if it is just babies
just babies super soldier babies that's
what I think it might actually be being
to be on mass killers yes so the Air
Force's launched that that the article
is actually talking about will beam in
2020 they're paying SpaceX a cool
hundred and thirty million dollars but
the contract awarded to them for this
launch and it is a classified mission AF
SPC fifty two is the mission and it
looks like June June's my first oh no no
it said sorry they announced it on June
twenty first so this this information is
a few weeks old but there was a
competition between SpaceX and ula
Boeing Lockheed make you make you LA but
SpaceX one and now they're scheduling
the launch in 2020
it's from the pad 39a at NASA's Kennedy
Space Center in Florida before the end
of September 2020
so cool go fucking heavy hmm well maybe
we'll find out what the precious cargo
is buy 20 phony I hope so I mean I have
to imagine that the babies will have
broken free of that chrysalis is by then
because they're probably inland like
eggs right now being incubated that's
how the super-soldier program works
final story here just a rehash from last
week we'll just leet-speak a reminder
that's a massive object devastated
during this a long time ago and it never
fully recovered wait didn't we
didn't we talk about this yeah it's just
I just said this is a rehash from last
week all right mister I wanted to bring
this back up and remind people yes yes
that a massive object devastated Uranus
a long time ago never forget that and
it's really it's hard to mind it's hard
to forget it's seared into many of our
memories and pain receptors okay all
right to be perfectly honest that's all
of the like arranged content I have from
my half of the show so from here on out
we're gonna be winging it I'll be honest
we've been winging it most of this time
already but as we let's let's finish the
show as we usually do by answering some
questions that people have asked us
along with monetary donations in chat
you're not required to donate money for
us to answer your question but we love
you more if you do but we've never
answered a question from somebody who
didn't donate money what we used to and
though they got too many questions yeah
we used to but then there were all the
money donations and we're like well
people with money obviously
should they we have more of a
responsibility to answer them hey we
don't care about money but we'll be
raising the minimum donation amount
everyone in twitch is pressing f to pay
respects what do we owe for Uranus I
don't know or they just have to pay
respects for Uranus
- according to this we're still
streaming just to it just just twitch -
fine so we're all gravy plate which is
doing the EPS chillin YouTube's cool
youtubes they're not quite alright so
William Jensen what of dollars what back
would you recommend to go with the
Sennheiser HD 707 a lot of Dax I haven't
done a lot of DAC dabbling yeah I
haven't done enough that I could be like
this is the exact one you should go with
I know Mayflower electronics I've used
I've used one or two of their models
before I've always found those are
satisfying units to work with and right
they're handmade in the USA so you can't
go wrong there if any one one wants
didn't you yeah yeah while back okay
Asus has some really high end ones but
they tend to be a little bit more on the
expensive side but the nice easiest ones
that I don't know the model name and the
names of but they're like 300 bucks each
those are pretty sweet everyone's saying
that shit audio is really good shit Dax
anybody shit DAC that's schi IT Nazi
HIIT not that's awesome I think that's
what I mean if this person spelling it
right
shit stack is good check them out
judging from their name I don't know
everyone and everyone in chat is just
don't get easy for shit hit have the
best they have the best shit so there
you go Mayflower and shit take your pick
glad we can be so much help bazinga
Zynga $5 challenge $100 in two weeks but
it goes down to $10 every minute you are
late on YouTube wait the challenge is
$100 in two weeks but it goes down $10
every late on YouTube so we have to
design just mean we have to be on time
and then you'll do that two weeks from
now so the episode from here from your
from your office in two weeks is what I
hope you remember that sure I'll make a
note alright bazinga ex you
one hundred dollars if we're right on
time does that mean that for more than
ten minutes late that we go have money
or if we're early then you give us more
$10 we should just start like an hour
[Laughter]
six hundred extra dollars more money
all right Ron and ruch wire schwa
thank you for your five dollars Canadian
donation hi guys thanks for showing my
PC missed live do two no internet I hit
the cap oh no I mean that cap suck yeah
and being engrossed in the game will be
adding custom cables plus dusting are we
this is from last week that he's
thanking us or are you talking about his
computer on your half no no he last week
okay yeah I remember him yep beautiful
thank you Andrew
Andrew and I'm glad we were able to
critique your computer add them cables I
don't - it I don't remember it hey
cables in dusty I usually don't remember
little cables and dusting can do water
sprayers wait us I'll do cheese dude $5
so lewd my favorite YouTube channels by
far you take it we doe you're by far our
favorite fan that's really those high
praise feelings are so many YouTube
channels out there wearing a bit wit
trucker hat awesome hardware shirt got
recognized on the train you have fans of
Boston yeah Oh Boston
Boston's Greek I have some I have some
fond memories of Boston mmm I've been
back there in a while yeah it's some
really good food never want to drive
there never want to drive anywhere I
lost it oh it's Dana it's dangerous city
tunnels for attempting to drive anywhere
too many phenols there's like there's
like rivers and estuaries and stuff like
that the tunnels go under and like a
bunch of blood vessels are you in the
wrong place nope really good clam
chowder then thank you greet up Tyler
sorry sorry singer Tyler Sayer $5
Kyle Heather do you like the litter
robot three you did a video on about
seven months ago is it worth the high
price yes we we actually love it still
using it still using it every day I
haven't changed a litter box in like
seven months that's what we got it's
pretty awesome I mean granted it still
work because you still have to take up
take the tray out
and replace the the trash bag right line
the trash bag and you put it back in but
you're doing that like once a week maybe
once every two weeks depending on if you
have one cat or two cats instead of like
literally scooping it every day or every
other day so it does help a lot but that
she gets nasty so you have to clean it
out every once a while like just like
actually sort of take one or two pieces
apart and like actually get like a hose
out take it out in the backyard or front
yard and hose it down probably do that
maybe once a month once every other
month
wifey sauce takes care of that job I
take care of the the trash removal and
stuff but it works out and if if you
have I would say it's worth it if you
have two cats because the litter box
will fill up twice as fast if you have
two cats
two or more then it's worth it if you
only have one then you probably want
it's only worth it if you're extremely
lazy so it's good for a multi-cat
household yes
Thank You Tyler but zing X $15 thank you
for your additional donation right yeah
don't any more money thank you hmm Paul
great show as always oh great comments
and donation as always visiting x-bow
Zynga right back at you
david cherry peach out $5 I guess I have
to read you got to read it I guess
that's tradition I always read Phoebe's
donation can gosh cool cats it's an
offer the five gigahertz a Wi-Fi router
they gave me gets me 100 megabits per
second I wired an Ethernet from it to an
Asus router
I got 150 megabyte per second what he
actually said what with inferior Wow
what what what like Angkor Wat yeah
that's been dank or what not anchor the
battery bank company but no anger one
good coring the core Angkor core what we
are so cultured Thank You TV you're
right that's garbage
and yeah you should never use the router
that your internet service provider know
provides for you because they're always
horrible yeah I've gotta fix the hop

bazinga X another donation my god twenty
dollars this time Paul money towards a
gym membership I was able to carry a
courser I'm sitting in 1,000 its box up
the steps by myself and unbox it myself
you need to pump at the gym I can carry
it by itself like that's okay it's once
you put stuff in it it becomes oh yeah
really really any of those like mega
towers like the enfili was the same way
you pick it up by itself fine but access
to computers in it now there's a bunch
of radiators and I haven't even yeah
fill them with water yet in there it's
really yeah it's really gonna be put on
your house but I will definitely go to
the gym Heather and I just cancelled our
gym membership that we've had not go to
the gym years so we can potentially join
another one Oh Maria
we're like promising each other we'll do
it right after comic-con so I'm saying
it on I'm saying it on the street now
you have to do it'll hold myself account
has seen and borne witness to this
promise you have made set in stone yep
like an after comic-con yell at me
College sign up for the new gym please
are you exercising now are you becoming
less of a fat ass you guys you guys keep
me honest my my simple goal is to start
taking hero for walks again because I
have been really bad about that since we
got back from that's like a two for two
because then here it gets to go outside
and stuff
I want yes it is it's been so hot lately
though
but yeah MB six or seven mister
lenticular thank you for your 13 dollars
and 37 cents donation just elite Cheers
cheers to you as well host Jason
Kristoff $9.99 hey Paul so my CPU
voltage has always been between 4.4 and
4.6 know it has it know what hesitation
I think you mean 1.4 on 1.6 yeah I
turned off EP you power saving and now I
have a decent OC between three people
maybe he's talking about frequency
turned off a few parts I mean I have a
decent OC between 3.9 4.0 but the bus
says keep it on off if OC your opinion
okay wait okay
I'm trying to break this then Jason your
your message is not 100% understandable
here but I think I get the gist of what
you're saying first off voltage just as
a general rule right now if you're
talking AMD in particular I don't know
if you're talking about AMD or Intel
here that's another potential issue been
ranked 1.4 is the max I would go try to
keep it less than 1.4 if you're going a
couple generations back on Intel then I
would say like 1.25 or 1.3 is the max
that you want to go but Verizon resin
can handle 1.4 okay I didn't try to keep
a little less than that if possible he's
probably talking about an AMD based on
the clock speeds he's giving us yeah I
guess a 3.9 good out of work at your
Hertz but if you are and again if you
are talking about AMD and if you're
talking about first generation rise it
in particular than 3.9 or 4 gigahertz is
perfectly fine and that's what you
should expect yeah if you're talking
about all core overclocking
yeah EP power-saving though i believe is
a asus feature and i would keep that on
unless it is affecting your ability to
maintain those clock speeds because
Power Save Paris is always good speaking
of saving power
Kyle saving something right now oh no
screaming why is your just in time for
my half of the show my gosh what's going
on razor blade Pro this is the first
blue screen of farad from this laptop
and I only use this laptop for awesome
hardware and sometimes event travel my
half of the show is just too awesome I
think it broke the hardware f to pay
respects broken hours where Cal's blue
screen yeah now you can do the Astro now
everyone F everyone f-f-f-f-f-f-f off
and chat if this shit uh so Jason I hope
that information has helped you to some
degree I just I'll just look at all the
ups in your chat now right bazinga X
with another nation you've been very
generous this show so thank you once
again he says oh but have I have faith
you've never started outside we have we
have to started on time yeah are you
gonna restart it no I'm gonna let it
restart itself it's a hundred percent
complete so it restarts it says well
then we'll restart for you sometimes
that does and sometimes it doesn't
I know give it a chance but he's
confirming yes two weeks from tonight is
when bazinga X's $100.00 potential
donation will be available to us as long
as we start on time okay sounds like
he's already given you $100 this show
that'll probably be good Laura Lee down
to me since I need to get here - Kyle's
studio on on Tuesday in two weeks but
we'll keep that in mind thank you for
saying X once again for your generosity
this show speed slays final donation $10
Canadian if you guys do to further
donations will cover them on Kyle's half
of the show
