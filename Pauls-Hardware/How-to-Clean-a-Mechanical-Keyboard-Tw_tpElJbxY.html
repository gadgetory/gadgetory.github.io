back to Pauls hardware today I am doing
a tutorial video on how to clean a
mechanical keyboard and there's quite a
few reasons why you might want to clean
a mechanical keyboard for one thing
they're quite expensive or they tend to
be much more expensive than rubber dome
keyboards for that reason you might want
to take some time to help extend their
lifespan by keeping them clean of dust
debris or other contaminants that might
happen while you're using your computer
or engaging other various activities
before this purpose I have a Corsair
Vengeance k95 which was a very nice
mechanical keyboard which happens to
have coffee spilled all over it I have
no idea how this happened but whether
you're talking about a spill like the
one I'm dealing with today or just a
lifetime of contaminants in debris that
have built up on your keyboard keep
watching I'll show you how to clean it
up so first off I want to give credit
where credit is due so big thanks to all
the reddit contributors over at our
slash mechanical keyboards in particular
the keyboards spill guide that was
posted there by rip store 55 this video
here would not be nearly as in-depth as
it is without their contributions so
thanks to all you guys and links in the
video description of course if you guys
want to check it out if you're watching
this video let's start with tools for
the job and the job by the way if it
wasn't clear in the intro is to clean up
sticky stuff dirt grime particularly to
free up stuck keys or keys that aren't
registering properly as a result of dirt
buildup or of spills so you're going to
want some paper towels and or coffee
filters
I also recommend some q-tips or swabs a
small brush or a toothbrush is also very
helpful you're going to want some canned
air or an air compressor that's just for
light dusting and cleaning you can also
use a vacuum across the top of the
keyboard to get dust and light stuff
that's not stuck off of there you want
some cleaning solution and for this I
just recommend a warm or almost hot
water that's what's best to use if that
is not strong enough to remove the
sticky stuff then you will want some
isopropyl alcohol and I usually dilute
this with water so it's not as strong
50/50 mix can work quite well please
note here for alcohol or other cleaners
you might be considering for keyboards
that have a UV coating it can cause
discoloration so definitely try water
first
and if you're going to use alcohols or
cleaners use them sparingly test them
first to make sure they're not going to
cause any problems with the plastic and
wipe them off immediately do not let
them sit on the plastic of your key caps
you will also want to straw I'm also
going to be using a colander and then
you also might want a big bag of rice or
kitty litter if you want to dry things
out a bit quicker that's optional I'm
not going to be using that personally
here another optional item is a key cap
puller again you don't need this but it
can make pulling the key caps off a lot
easier you might also want some
lubricant this is another optional tool
for the job and this is really only
going to be necessary if you're using
stuff like alcohol which can remove some
of the lubricant that is on the switches
and stabilizers that's all for tools for
the job
next just some quick notes on some other
methods of cleaning besides what I'm
showing you here today you might have
heard that recommended to put your
keyboard in a dishwasher and some
keyboards I think Logitech actually has
one where they recommend this for
mechanical keyboards I do not recommend
full liquid submersion or putting it in
a dishwasher at all basically for
mechanicals just stay away from that if
all the other methods that are listed
here have failed if you try them in the
keyboard still not working then you can
possibly go with submersion or a
dishwasher method but again only as a
last measure and if the keyboard was
just going to be thrown away
otherwise if you do put it in a
dishwasher use a setting with as little
or as low heat as possible
skip the drying cycle please and then
also make sure that your keyboard is
fully dry for at least two to three days
before testing and then if you're going
with this method remember you're
probably going to need to relocate the
switches as well as the stabilizers
another question that comes up is will I
be avoiding my warranty by cleaning my
keyboard for the basic message that
methods I'm showing you here you
probably won't but in many cases it will
be yes you will void your warranty
that's if you damage the keyboard which
often isn't covered or if you clean off
like late the labels or the printing or
the serial number or something like that
then you probably be able to get your
warranty coverage let's begin with the
tragedy I've just spilled something all
over my keyboard kind of like the coffee
that I totally spilled intentionally on
this keyboard right that was intentional
okay so if you spilled something on your
keyboard first thing to do
okay I'm plugging right away then you're
going to want to flip it upside down
drain out as much of that liquid as you
can clean up as much of the spill as you
can with dry towels or paper paper
towels with that sort of thing and then
leave the keyboard to dry the rest of
the way you can go right ahead with
cleaning but usually it's best to let it
dry just to be on the safe side once
you've done your initial cleanup after
the spill it's time for cleaning step
one is going to be to pull off all of
the key caps you might want to look up a
keyboard map or snap a quick picture of
your keyboard first up so you can put
them back in the proper order
particularly if it's the only keyboard
to your only computer but to pull off
the key caps you can use a key cap
puller if you have one of these
available and I know not everyone does
although a lot of mechanical keyboards
will come with one that's the best
method to use if you don't have that
then simply use caution don't force the
key caps off make sure that you're
pulling upwards in one direction and
that you're not pulling at a strange
angle you want the normal keys to lift
straight up off of the keyboard
you might wiggle them a little bit if
they're not pulling off immediately I
recommend starting at the edges so you
can get kind of a good grip on those and
then if you have larger keys pull the
key caps off around those so you can get
better access to them by our mind that
keys with stabilizers the larger Keys
like a space bar or the enter button can
be left on if they're not dirty or
they're not sticky but if you do need to
pull them off then use a little bit of
extra caution because there's different
types of stabilizers and you want to
make sure that you can pull the key cap
off cleanly without pulling the
stabilizers off as well
step two is going to be to wash the key
caps and here's where I will be using
the colander just take all the key caps
you pulled off put them in a colander
wash them thoroughly with warm water if
they are more stickier there's more
residue use some dish soap on them just
a little bit and then make sure you
rinse them thoroughly and as with
everything here allow them to dry
completely
step three is going to be the tray or
the base plate of the keyboard itself
there's a lot of different designs for
mechanical keyboards so they're not all
going to look just like this but here I
would just use some paper towels or
coffee filters paper towels if you need
more material coffee filters I like
because they don't tend to leave quite
as much fibers and then just warm water
to start out again you're going to want
to go with warm almost hot water for all
the cleaning here initially and then
only
move on to something stronger if
necessary you can use q-tips or swabs
for the nooks and crannies of the
keyboard and then make sure you use
enough water just to get your cloth a
towel or q-tip damp avoid dripping
because you don't want to add more water
or more liquid to the equation here
watch out for the gaps that might lead
through to the inside of the keyboard
housing if the liquid or coffee or
whatnot has gotten through into there
you might want to consider a deep
cleaning via disassembly but we're not
going to be covering that particular
method in this video step four is going
to be to clean the switches themselves
here's where you're probably going to
have the most issue with stickiness and
switches not working properly so first
off just clean the exterior of the
switch keep an eye out for LEDs if they
are there but again as long as you're
not using too much liquid you should be
fine check for stickiness or residue on
the exterior of the switch here you can
use the hot water straw trick so just
use your drinking straw get some warm
almost hot water get a little bit of
water in the tip of the straw and then
push it down onto the switch then just
span the key a bunch of times to get
that water moving around and hopefully
clear away any stickiness or residue you
can also use a q-tip with just enough
water or alcohol solution to get the tip
of the q-tip damp you want to depress
the switch down and then use just the
tip of the q-tip or swab to clean the
inside edges because the chances are
that's where the stickiness is occurring
if the key still sticks or it does not
travel properly after you've dried it
then you can use a small amount of the
oil or spray lubricants that we
recommended earlier in the video to free
that up and again here if you're using
oil or spray lubricant let it dry
completely before you plug it in and do
testing and then finally here for the
switches are the stabilizers for the
larger switches again here just clean it
carefully with the swab and some water
or you can use a 50/50 water alcohol mix
if they're really sticky and again just
use your best judgement because they're
different designs for these make sure
you clean them thoroughly but that
you're not going to do any damage just
be gentle and lastly for cleaning step 5
is dry time and this is very very very
important do not attempt to test your
keyboard even plug it in until it's
completely dry
two days is the minimum recommended dry
time some people have recommended
leaving your keyboard like out in the
Sun or near heat source to speed this up
I would say just be patient
be safe don't leave it in the
son because it could discolor your whole
keyboard and then once your keyboards
dry you can move on to testing so go
ahead and replace your key caps and just
the same way you remove them be careful
don't use force test all the keys to
make sure that they register after
you've plugged in the keyboard and also
that they're traveling properly you
don't want to plug the keyboard back in
and then find out you have one key
that's still not working and have to go
through the whole cleaning and drying
process over again now if all of this
process did not work if you've still got
some keys that are sticky or not
registering you're not completely out of
luck there's some detailed notes on
advanced methods of cleaning like fully
disassembling the keyboard and removing
the interior PCB or submerging it in a
solvent bath or cleaning other types of
keyboards such as rubber dome switch
keyboards you can find those via the
link to rip stirs cleaning guide from
reddit's that's in this video's
description so go ahead and check that
out if you want some more information
and that's gonna wrap it up for this
video guys hopefully you've learned a
little bit more about keeping your
mechanical keyboard clean and free of
sticky gooey goo enos because we know
how that likes to work its way in there
