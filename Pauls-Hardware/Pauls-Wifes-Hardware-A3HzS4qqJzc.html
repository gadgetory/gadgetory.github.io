again to Paul's hardware this is my
third episode and just about time for me
to stop saying which episode it is every
time I do a new video but anyway we're
here to see some more of my hardware and
I've got some of that here this is
actually well my wife's hardware I could
say that I built this computer for her
just recently sorry I didn't record the
building process but I did want to show
you guys the parts that are inside as
well as a little bit of my handiwork and
that's about it oh also I got a light so
once again this is the NZXT phantom 410
Madera computer case this is the special
one that has the new egg orange
highlights on black of course and yeah
it's pretty cool case I've worked with
it a few times my wife again wanted an
orange computer and this was about the
closest I could come that uh that I was
kind of willing to live with she
actually found this one she senator
romaine said oh maybe I do want a new
case so I was like okay I'll go join a
computer yeah let's take a look inside
so the interior is pretty much all black
I've wanted to kind of go with that sort
of setup for it I've removed the front
drive cage right there so that I can
allow more airflow I have the orange
fans installed as you can see those are
the Cougar hydro bearing fans and the
orange and black matches really well
I've got 140 millimeter in the front 140
up top 120 in the back and then another
140 on the side door that you probably
saw in the white chat power supply down
there reels will Libertas it's a 650
watt it's modular it's black actually
well rated Rose well power supply I
should mention not one of the ones that
they blow up or anything
this one is a crucial M for SSD so
should gets in your SATA 3 going on and
of course it's Center we got the esri
oxy 68 extreme for Gen 3 I got a 2500 K
installed up there that is underneath
the Zelman cmts 9900 X cooler which is a
really cool gray color matches with
everything in the case very nicely that
actually lights up blue so overall it's
got a blue and orange theme but it
actually matches pretty well
happens to be nui colors and I swear
it's blacks in it and of course we've
got some Coursera memory that's eight
gigs of ddr3 1600 I believe and they
might notice there's no video card
installed right now that is because her
video card still in her old computer and
we're going to switch that over pretty
soon so just when were running off the
internal GPU for now and I also wanted
to take a look at the other side of the
motherboard tray because cable
management it's always important and I
yeah you know cows were posting some
videos lately over on his his
awesomesauce news channel and he's shown
his computer a few times and I just want
to point out a few things actually just
one thing Kyle
yeah he's learned a few things from me
as far as computer really goes and one
thing I will say I did not teach him
this is cable management I did not teach
Kyle how to do cable management and I
just wanted to you know set that to rest
and finally here's a look at the
computer turned up I can see that orange
on the front blue heat sink fan in the
middle right through the window there
looks pretty cool and is what my room
looks like without that big bright white
light so I'm yeah it's good thing I got
that otherwise didn't really see much
that's gonna be all for this video guys
thanks for stopping by and check it out
my wife's new computer if you wanna see
more please subscribe the channel
construct under construction right now
but I'll be putting up videos as often
as I possibly can the response so far
has been amazing thank you all for
watching and we'll see you next time
I'll Paul's hard work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
