to you by gigabyte Coolermaster team
group and Thermaltake guys I'm over at
alpha cool they make water cooling parts
for custom cooling loops and normally
I'd be like I'm going to come here and
show you some new products that they
have but if you remember my thread
Ripper build project Riptide in the
Corsair 1000 deed massive $10,000 system
I promise you guys I'd be water cooling
that's alpha cool is going to be
supplying the parts so I'm here to go
shopping so let's start with reservoirs
alpha cool has a wide selection of these
and they're all copper I should mention
everything that's metal that alpha cool
makes is copper and these are actually a
single piece of copper so when you hold
the reservoirs like the base of them
they're incredibly heavy which I'm happy
about because that means they're quality
which I'm also kind of afraid of because
the system's already insanely heavy and
it's going to get heavier that's okay
I'll invest in a dolly everything will
be fine now since I have the water theme
the slight blue accent theme I think
what we're gonna do here let's go with
the helix helix as badass I'm probably
gonna go with maybe the black cap and
then still do like the blue interior for
like the fluid to go through I think
that would look really cool and I'm
gonna have two of these side by side
because I'm going to do two separate
loops
how cool is a wide variety of pumps and
pump reservoir combos well I've already
decided in the reservoir for the pump
I'm gonna go with the Defiant variants
tread the DDC it makes a little bit more
noise and I want this to be as quiet as
possible so go with a couple d5 probably
going to go with the standard mount here
and I might actually separate the pump
from the reservoir but that still
remains to be seen I was able to took a
look at this combo unit right here this
it's got a reservoir on top and a pump
on the bottom the top is actually made
of a nylon and apparently it's
indestructible maybe though this is a
crazy $10,000 over-the-top build I'm
trying to make it functional so I
decided I'm gonna go soft tubing that's
right stop tubing and I kind of like
what they have here it's a sort of semi
opaque so even though I'm probably gonna
also use just standard water for the
fluid and not diet at all cuz I don't
have to worry about blocks getting
messed up with dye or anything like that
it still has a sort of a refractive
property so I think it'll look good
since I got lots of RGB LEDs in the case
I think it'll pick up on the tubing and
look pretty nice as for fitting sales
have a wide variety of different color
options different anodized metals it's
all copper of course still I think I'm
gonna stick with black I want to keep
things simple a fairly industrial look
and a really cool thing that they had is
quick disconnect so when I'm quick
disconnects on all of the vital parts so
that if I need to remove the CPU water
block to maybe upgrade to the thread
refer to in a couple months I can do
that without too much insane level
difficulty the quick disconnects they
have are made of copper as well also
having also very durable not even like
spring-loaded when you release them they
kind of pop off which is kind of
exciting just make sure you don't drop
them you know if you get an optin SSD
alpha cool now makes water blocks for
that yeah water cool your SSD very I
don't know what kind of performance
increase you get with an obtain SSD and
more cooling it but this is a again
really solidly designed block very
pretty so if you want to show off your
SSD 900 feet and go ahead and get one of
those I don't have one of those though
what I actually need though is a
solution for the MDOT two because I'm
going to add a second MDOT to be a PCI
Express slot that's because I'm using
the 2400 G rise in APU which doesn't
have quite as many PCI Express Lanes
long story short I'm gonna need a riser
card and alpha cool actually has these
passively cooled riser card it's got a
front plate and back plates and an MDOT
2 slot and it's going to be positioned
in a pretty nice spot in the case so
I'll be able to get a look at this and
it will also leave it open so I can
still get a look at the Mini ITX build
it's at the bottom of the case I think
that's gonna work out just great I'm
going to allow myself to quickly be
distracted by this beautiful build that
mike from alpha cool did oh my god
this company is EC customs so go to EC
customs da PE to see more epic builds
like this lots of attention to detail I
like the cabling work he 3d princess
cable combs it's so hot right now I am
now further distracted by this very
industrial serious looking alpha cool
radiator it is copper but they've
nickel-plated everything even all the
fins in between so the nickel plating
actually goes down in there if you look
at it from the side you can't really see
any copper they also put stainless steel
on the side so you can polish it up and
make it look shiny
you want to this is a 280 millimeter
radiator and it just looks very serious
but I'm getting distracted again I
digress as Jay might say it's a new
product in the ice bear line it's an ice
bear extreme and they're actually using
a full-on
like just this great alpha cool XTX
block on there it's also got quick quick
disconnects I like what they've done
here with the tubing the entire thing is
black it's super serious get the job
done
tight build and they're not conflicting
with any ace tech patents because the
pump and reservoir is up there built
into the radiator it's 280 millimeter
radiator but bear in mind you will
probably not have standard compatibility
with 280 millimeter cases because there
is a bit of an extension on the end
there
but if you're looking for a hefty water
cooler expandable to maybe add a GPU
block via the quick disconnects this is
the ice bear extreme and we're expecting
it later this year no exact dates and
unfortunately no price estimation right
now but it looks pretty beastly Apple
has been working on some new blocks some
that used some acrylic so you can see
through to pretty lights or see if you
have colored fluid I think they're doing
a nice job on these but since I have a 2
Strix GTX 1080p is I need to stick with
what's compatible so this is actually
the block from one of their ice wolf or
one liquid coolers which has the pump
integrated to it right there but it's
pretty much the same look this is what
I'm going for big fins there's actually
a bunch of surface area on there for
heat dissipation it is functional and
it's pretty and it will match and fit
with my graphics cards at least a 1080i
version here's some alpha cool block
covers for their XTX block now the block
isn't specifically made for thread
repair and I do have a thread refer CPU
but it does have brackets for it and
their blocks are naturally large they
have a lot of surface area on there so
I'm going to go ahead and stick with an
alpha cool block for now I'm hoping
possibly in the future that's again
thread over to might be an option for an
upgrade in this build an optical is
working on a thread ripper dedicated
block so this will be OK for now and
then in the future I might upgrade to an
shredder per block and maybe also in
like a 24 or 32 for 304 to be nice
another great moment of distraction how
cool is making some RGB LED fans 120
millimeters I've got one with some more
diffusion around it up there or are
these that you can see the LEDs a little
bit more clear yeah I'm going to be
doing flexible tubing with my build but
I thought I'd at least show you out
vocals crazy over the top
ice copper tube bending kitten if you're
using a PE Tiki or acrylic tubing this
is what you need if you want to get into
it professionally so there's a massive
steel plate at the bottom with a bunch
of connection points where you can
connect these and you can use those to
position wherever you wants and
different bending angles it also comes
with this so if you happen to get in
some sort of injury you need to hack off
a limb you know to prevents gangrene or
the spread of that that's what this is
right and the last thing I'll need to
complete the loop is radiators so
alcohol has a wide selection of those
again all copper and I'm going to be
using two 480 millimeter radiators up at
the front as well as up at the top but
they actually have the largest radiator
here that I've ever seen it is a four by
hundred and forty millimeters so that's
five hundred and sixty millimeter it's
80 millimeters thick it's actually it
seems like it's bigger than this awesome
build right here that bombed my mods did
little mini ITX bill which is absolutely
gorgeous
I'm having so much fun here cupcakes so
I guess this is probably a good place to
leave you look at that mod by mods build
good job on my mods it's so compact it's
so tiny they did such a good job on the
cabling the guys that's all the time I
have for this video so hit the thumbs up
button if you enjoyed it and of course a
big thank you to my sponsors for
Computex 20 18 gigabyte Thermaltake
Coolermaster and team group i have more
copy text videos coming at you very soon
so definitely subscribe as well if
you're not already necks again and we'll
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
