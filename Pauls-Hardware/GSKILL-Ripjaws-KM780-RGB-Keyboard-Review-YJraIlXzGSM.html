for the longest time a buying one was
pretty simple you pay about $15 for a
cheap 104 key rubber dome keyboard and
when that one breaks or perhaps becomes
too gooey for further use you recycle it
and you buy another one but over the
past five to ten years the premium
keyboard market has really taken off
thanks largely in part to the use of
mechanical switches that last way longer
than rubber dome switches have a much
more satisfying feel while typing and it
also comes in a variety of flavors that
determine key press resistance click
enos and whether or not there's a little
tactile bump on each key as you push it
down g.skill known to many of you as a
memory maker is the latest manufacturer
to dive into the extremely competitive
and fairly crowded mechanical keyboard
market with the Ripjaws km 780 RGB
gaming keyboard that were taking a look
at today it's available with genuine
Cherry MX red or brown switches looking
at the brown version that we have here
and if the 160 dollars selling price is
a little bit rich for your blood there's
also a version called the Ripjaws km 780
MX which has red backlighting and it's
only 120 dollars MSRP but no RGB all the
other features remain the same now the
first thing you might notice when taking
a look at the km 780 is the gamer II
design gamer II that's a word especially
when compared to Corsairs keyboards for
example which are much more squared-off
an industrial looking the angular style
and aggressive lines just scream this is
the look we think gamers are into and
who knows they could be right I'm more
of a function over form guy myself so I
will leave it up to you to decide if you
like the look and feel free to let G
scale and me know what you think in the
comments section down below climb on the
topic of YouTube feedback feel free to
hit that like button - if you enjoyed
this video
back to functions though let's start off
with the stuff around the edges it's got
USB 2.0 pass-through which is a feature
that I really like on a keyboard whether
it's to daisy-chain your mouse to it or
to act as a conveniently accessible port
for flash drives there's also an
analogue mic and headphone pass-through
as well as an option switch to go
between n key and six key rollover modes
which can be very helpful if you're
having trouble getting the keyboard to
talk nice with your motherboard
especially in pre operating system
like changing settings in your UEFI or
BIOS you of course get full and key roll
over and anti-ghosting which is to be
expected for a keyboard that costs as
much as this one does and then moving to
the top of the keyboard there's a set of
six programmable macro buttons along the
left side up top there's a dedicated
macro record button next to the three
profile select options windows lock and
brightness buttons and there's a timer
button there which will work with
g.skill software which we'll take a look
at in just a moment on the right top
side there are media controls which are
always nice to have a volume of roller
wheel cylinder thing which I also like
having there despite not knowing exactly
what to call it and an LED volume
display these are all great features and
you don't always get them with high-end
mechanical keyboards I just wish that
the LEDs for the media controls and that
volume indicator were RGB as well
instead of just solid red or just give
us the ability to turn them off in the
software g.skill so that they don't
clash with our super sweet RGB lighting
schemes that we set up now I have to
give g.skill a lot of credit for the
build quality of the km 780 it's very
sturdy thanks in part to the functional
and visually appealing reinforced metal
pipe that goes all the way around the
outside you can use this to attach the
included accessory box it also holds the
foldable cable holder right up here on
the top right that will hold your mouse
cable to control the slack in the mouse
which honestly is a simple yet very very
nice feature I was thinking that also if
you have maybe a hook on your wall or
something and you like to keep your
setup really clean when you're not using
it you can maybe use that wraparound
pipe to like hang the keyboard up when
you're not using it who know it's just a
thought finally there's a black brush
Lumina metal top plate that's the cover
that goes up between the keys and the
actual keyboard and I prefer this style
to the recessed top plate that you see
in some keyboards since it's just way
easier to clean and get down in there
between the keys as for accessories you
get a detachable soft touch wrist rest
which is nice and comfy comfy and
optional if you don't like what wrist
rests 10 extra gaming key caps as well
and that will help you find the WASD
keys for example since they're angled
and a little bit more texture on those
you can swap those out and then it can
keep them in this little case when
you're not using them the case also
snaps onto the edge
the little piper on the outside so you
can store it there or if you don't want
to keep the keep caps in there maybe
keep something else in there snacks it's
always nice to have snacks now I believe
I've already pointed out that the km 780
has perky RGB backlighting that's kind
of the point of an RGB mechanical switch
keyboard but all the keys are also fully
programmable and g-scale does provide a
downloadable software to control all of
these functions in their g.skill unified
driver system let's take a look at the
most recent version of this software
next just look at the software guys
software's up top I also have an image
of the keyboard down on the bottom bear
in mind as you're watching this there's
a flicker on the backlighting of the
keyboard that is not apparent when
you're looking at it that's just the
recording because they're recording it
at certain frames per second and it's
refreshing at certain frames per second
and it leads to a flicker in the
recording anyway the software up here on
the top left you got your macros button
and your lighting profiles so consider
these two top buttons the buttons where
you go and kind of set up macros the way
you want them you can also you can
record macros you can you can add them
here you name them and then they're
available via drop-down you can get rid
of them with the delete butter with the
trashcan button and then you can also
copy import or export macros as well you
can also do a delay no delay record
button at all appears over there and
it's pretty functional as a lot of macro
recording utilities are you can also do
text macros as well so if you just want
to punch a button to type in some text
you can do that too moving on to the
lighting profiles area here's where we
have access to kind of the special
lighting features if you don't just want
like standard lighting to be on all the
time you have a wave option a ripple
option a reactive option which means as
you hit a button it's going to spread
out from there and a breathing option
but bear in mind that as you're over
here when you're messing with these and
doing them and stuff it's saving these
to the software but then these bub
buttons up here customize settings and
lighting or where you actually go to
implement them so just bear that in mind
so for instance if we wanted to create a
wave setting we'd hit + create wave -
and then we could go in here and mess
around with the colors if we wanted you
can like add other areas to the wave and
drag them around with this little guy
here or
change the level of brightness and that
kind of thing so it's pretty I mean it's
pretty functional you can you can move
stuff around a lot so like here let's
make a wave that goes from red to white
to yellow to green to blue wave to and
after you do everything it saves it
immediately that's another thing that I
think g.skill could help themselves out
with here is doing something that like
says apply or okay or something like
that anyway it works the same way with
ripples or reactive typing all the
reactive typing you only get choose one
color and then breathing and you can
have it breathe between multiple colors
as well so we've just done that wave
thing so let's go over here to lighting
and once we're on any of the lighting
setting or customize you'll see the
actual profiles over here on the left
side and different modes you can choose
so we're in mode two we want to do
effect lighting so we click effect
lighting and then it asks us which of
the effects we want to do so I'm going
to choose that wave two that I just
created and hit OK and then it should it
should immediately pop up there if I did
it right but maybe I'd maybe I didn't do
it right this is a bug that I have
encountered once or twice and I seem to
be able to bypass it by clicking
disabled lighting and then we enable in
lighting again and then it pops up okay
so as already kind of alluded to this
software it still seems like it needs a
little bit of work from g.skill but you
can't get it to work sorry there there's
a little wave function if you wanted to
just individually assign the different
keys you can do that as well so you can
like choose a color down here and just
start plugging away at whatever you want
to do oh right now I have it to set to
also all our single not set to single so
I can choose specific keys that I want
to light up that color choose them here
or you can even drag get a grouping of
them scatter some blue in here as well
there's some blue and now we want pink
this is a very specific keyboard layout
that's designed for people who switch
between mmo's MOBAs and flight Sims and
this is very very popular layout and as
you can see selecting keys all that kind
of stuff to just light stuff up the way
the way that you would assume it would
light it up
apart from that let's look at the other
lighting effects that are available so
back over here profiles you got your
ripple so there's ripple one right there
let's go back to lighting and check out
what that looks like we go to effect
lighting and we choose the ripple and
then there's our ripple one in the mid
okay and it's dark again I'm gonna
disable and re-enable and there it is
what does the ripple do oh look at that
it's kind of fun
you got a type a key and then it and
then it ripple expands out from where
you type that's interesting I'm kind of
curious if you're typing fast
I must confuse it a little bit that's
that's still kind of fun anyway moving
back to reactive is a pretty pretty
pretty standard reactive typing but
let's check that out real quick moving
to reactive try reactive one do that
disable one read re-enable thing again
and then whenever you type whenever you
hit a key it gives you a little yeah it
expands out from there a pretty cool
effect there as well and then one last
lighting thing that you can do just show
ya is breathing breathing effect and
that's a that's very popular so let's
choose that and there now it's breathing
all in color and of course in the
lighting lighting profiles you can
adjust different things like the
breathing for how long the duration is
and what colors it breathes between and
all that good stuff so a pretty good
amount of customization you can do in
here for sure there's just some quirks
here and there you can kind of tell the
software is still in its earlier stages
but I like the different modes you can
assign you can also do a bunch of
different profiles you can create more
profiles here than actually available in
the different modes but the modes you
can do one two and three and then those
are specifically matched up with the
mode keys at the top so jumping to mode
3 right there you can see immediately
reflects in the software and I'm owed
three is is popping up as well this is
my lightning ripple effect by the way it
says this is the arm side of the wave if
my wave effect with a one second thing
which is very very fast very frenetic
but there's a quick run down guys of the
software again functional but could use
a little bit of updating
maybe oh and then I can't forget the
settings menu as well where you can just
your more
our basic stuff that you might expect
such as polling rate and key rollover
alert mode sleep mode repeat rate
acceleration and repeat delay so to wrap
this review up let's compare the km 782
offerings from Corsair the competition
offerings from the competition Corsair
being primary among the competitors of
course since up through last year they
had an exclusive deal with cherry and
were the only providers of RGB backlit
cherry MX keyboards as of the making of
this video you could get the corsair k70
for a hundred and seventy dollars the
g.skill km 780 for 160 or the new
corsair strafe for 150 all mechanical
Cherry MX RGB backlit keyboards the K 70
has media controls but it does not have
a USB or audio pass-through whereas the
strafe does have that USB pass-through
but no dedicated media controls so it's
a trade-off
then there's the design which is subject
to your preference and finally the
software comparison between Corsair
would win in my opinion the Corsair
software versus the G scale the Corsair
software is just been around a lot
longer it's more developed even though
it's got a learning curve there's just
more you can do with it so the final
verdict is that the km 780 provides
excellent build quality a great feature
set and capable if not ideal software
with some rough edges that G scale could
work to improve over time it's great to
see some more competition for the likes
of Corsair and razer in the high-end
keyboard space and who knows maybe we'll
even see the pricing drop a bit over
time probably not but who knows if
you're in the market for a premium
mechanical RGB keyboard the km 780
warrants serious consideration and
