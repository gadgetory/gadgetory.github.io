video I'm going to be doing a review of
the Nith Rockets newest gaming mouse
with a special trick it's frickin
modular I actually first spotted this
mouse back at Computex in June and I was
immediately impressed by its ability to
swap out the thumb button keys for crazy
amount of customization does this
flexibility justify the Nitz hefty
hundred and twenty US dollar MSRP though
should you click the like button on this
video let's investigate further to
separate fact from myth myth here's a
quick look at the retail box for
starters this is the black and gray
version of the myth and were promised a
white version as well in November beyond
the marketing and specifications info on
the outside and the peekaboo window
there's some actual useful stuff in here
like a QuickStart guide and warranty
info some stickers that allow you to set
the rules and a replacement side grip
which rocket says is hot swappable I
really like this side grip since it's
magnetic it pops on and off easily and
that actually stays in place once it's
on there and I prefer the wider stance
grip that gives you a ring finger rest
and an ideally placed rubber strip
that's perfectly situated to grip with
your pinky when lifting the mouse up off
of your mousing surface hot-swappable
though I guess you have to imagine some
MLG scenario where the protagonist is
getting worked at whatever game they're
playing I don't know buddy I can't keep
up and then the coach comes in to the
sides like yeah finished but then they
swap off the side grip on the fly and
pop in the new one and then they come
back and win the whole thing that's
that's what that's that's what plays out
in my head at least okay I get
distracted from the accessories so the
last thing you get in this box is the
plastic carrying case box which you
actually really need because it holds
your other side grip and all of the
replaceable thumb buttons which you
could easily lose otherwise also these
little guys are definitely choking
hazards so keep them away from your
toddlers please I will come back to the
thumb buttons in a bit though for now
the knit overall has an elegantly
contoured body with the same soft touch
finish on the outside of the mouse that
you might recognize from the rocket I
odd it feels fantastic and if the tie on
is any indication I'm sure it is also
quite durable this is unapologetically a
right-handed Mouse so my condolences to
lefties out there
thanks to that swappable side panel
though I think this mouse will work with
any type of grip claw grippers will
likely prefer the narrow narrower setup
and palm grippers or folks like me who
are kind of between palm and claw will
probably go for the wider configuration
like I have setup right here
finally there's a tightly braided one
point 8 meter USB cable for plugging the
mouse in as for specs the Nith has a
twin tech r1 laser sensor that can go
all the way up to 12,000 dpi sensitivity
high DPI or CPI is one of the benefits
of a laser sensor but 12,000 dear god I
can't imagine anyone actually going that
high and playing a game you can even
adjust in 1 dpi increments for that
laser mouse aficionado and your family
who's desperately been searching for a
10,000 739 dpi sensors that's the sweet
spot right there it's really just
marketing though big numbers are good in
theory realistically at more reasonable
dpi settings and actual use it tracked
beautifully and smoothly thanks to the
fast 1 millisecond response time there
are 18 frickin buttons on the net let's
count them left and right click you have
12 buttons on the side of the thumb area
zone you also have the easy shift button
and the scroll wheel click up here
that's 16 as well as the dorsal fin at
the top the switch which clicks both
ways so it counts as 2 I never got into
the habit of using the dorsal fin on the
tie on which also has it right there but
Kyle actually has gotten so used to
using it to side scroll and actually do
application switching that he gets mad
when he doesn't have it and he has to
take his time with him wherever he goes
so it can be useful if you train
yourself to use it
speaking of training yourself with 18
buttons I imagine this mouse will take
some getting used to if you want to make
full use of all them features the scroll
wheel itself feels lightweight but wide
and sturdy it has distinct detents as
you turn it okay and a very grippy
rubber finish that I approve of so the
thumb button area is the super modular
part of this Mouse by sliding the slider
on the bottom of the Nith all the
buttons can pop out you can then replace
each button with a blank if you don't
want to use that button or you can swap
two buttons with one of the double wide
buttons that Rocket provides in the
little accessory box if you want a more
important and larger button if you
mm Oh or a MOBA player and you want all
those buttons though the default
configuration with all 12 does seem
fairly usable as the buttons are
recessed more towards the top - kind of
like a staircase and the buttons
themselves are contoured with edges to
help you determine which ones you're
actually pressing if you have very large
hands you might have a hard time
pressing the buttons closest to you with
the base of your thumb but I was pretty
much okay with my larger-than-average
mitts just if you have really big hands
you might have a hard time with that
out-of-the-box rocket will tell you that
these buttons can be arranged in thirty
six thousand seven hundred and thirty
eight different ways add the easy shift
button which you press to activate a
secondary set of functions for each
button and math plus numbers equals 10
to the 24th or one sextillion possible
hardware software layout and function
combinations well a sextillion is
probably the sexiest number that exists
it's also pretty impractical to grasp so
let's just say that you'll probably be
able to find a configuration that you
like among all those and if you still
can't rocket has just opened up their 3d
printing library through Shapeways where
you can order custom printed replacement
buttons to expand your options even
further you can order these directly
from Shapeways for between twelve to
seventeen dollars for a set or you can
download the 3d data files directly from
rocket if you have a 3d printer and
modeling programs and you want to get
creative and kind of build your own
which i think is the coolest part rocket
has basically taken the custom keycaps
market for mechanical keyboards and
applied it to the myth and while this is
a niche feature i actually think it's
pretty freakin cool let's round things
out with a look at rockets swarm
software which handles drivers firmware
updates and programming changing those
thumb buttons out is part one part two
is actually assigning the buttons in the
software and telling the myth how you've
configured the hardware it's actually a
really simple drag-and-drop UI and very
straightforward and easy to work with
and of course you can assign any of the
buttons to do any of the things from a
complex macro to a simple keybinding
swarm lets you configure all of your
rocket hardware if you happen to have a
rocket keyboard too for example so you
could possibly use rocket talk to assign
an easy shift button on your keyboard
that then engages the EG easy shift
button for the mouse and then you can
reassign that easy shift button which i
probably would be assigned to dpi
switching or something like that anyway
it also does the rest of the standard
Mouse related things that you might
expect including changing the polling
rate click
speed scroll speed acceleration lift off
distance recording macros saving all the
settings to profile so you can easily
switch between them or even assigning
the profile to a game so it changes
automatically to that profile when the
game is launched also of course you can
adjust the mouse's RGB LED lighting here
and you can individually choose colors
for the rocket logo on the palm and the
edge lighting along the base settings
are saved internally to the Nith
supported by at 72 megahertz turbo core
v2 32-bit ARM based processor and 576
kilobytes up onboard memory so then if
impressed me with its overall feel and
performance the unique modular thumb
button area and the flexibility of the
easily swappable side grips
I like the nod to user customization
with 3d printing support and the swarm
software easily stands up to the
software from the competition
competition is really where there's a
challenge though as this is not the
first multi buttoned MMO and MOBA Mouse
on the market there's the venerable
Razer Naga which can be found for 70 or
80 bucks right now of course at Corsair
has their m95 which I also found for
about 80 bucks as well as they're yet to
be released scimitar which we recently
looked at at PAX Prime which also costs
$80 or is going to Logitech g600 can be
found for $50 so a price drop on the
Nith might make it a more viable option
for gamers on a budget but that's for
you guys to decide and that is all for
this video so let me know if you think
the nits
feature set warrants its price tag links
