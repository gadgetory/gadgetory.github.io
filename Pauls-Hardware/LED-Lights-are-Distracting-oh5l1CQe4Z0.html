in and today I'm doing a video and I'm
actually not really sure what this video
is gonna be about I was setting up for
it and I was kind of looking at
everything I have going on and I have a
lot of stuffs I've talked about in past
videos that I haven't quite finished yet
for instance I got a couple Asus boards
over here they're z87 Pro z87 sabertooth
I'm gonna be doing some follow up videos
with those thank you very much for all
the comments you guys posted on those
unboxings I will be doing some system
builds with that
I've also got a 4770k which is in this
AMD case which you know it's funny right
I also have like the h2 20 back there
I've got my water cooling comparison
video that I was working on I actually
did get that started I got two of the
three CPU coolers done testing in the
case which is over there but you
probably can't see it right now got that
done before I left for Taiwan litsa
Taiwan and then I don't know what's been
going on since I got back from Taiwan
and I kind of bouncing all over the
place I've actually been spending a lot
of time looking at houses because my
wife and I have recently decided that we
should move into a house and stop paying
rent and start getting a mortgage and
all that I'm happy to say that we've
recently got a house we had our offer
accepted so I'm gonna be moving actually
I think I'm like a month I don't know
there's escrow and stuff like that I've
never bought a house before it's all
good news got the house I'm gonna
actually be able to have a either a room
or the garage I'm not quite sure yet
that I'll be setting up to do videos in
so I won't have to sort of rearrange my
our computer room here every time we do
that so that's exciting but for this
video I'm not really sure what I should
be talking about I should I should
mention this since I have taken so long
to get the CPU cooler comparison done
I'm gonna be adding this guy right here
this is the cooler master iceberg 240 L
which is a copper that's got a copper
radiator and you can you can you can
expand the loop if you want to and I
pretty cool unit so I'm excited to test
that out so it'll be doing for CPU
coolers in my testing when I do complete
it which I'm planning on doing this week
also those boards to set up and
everything lots lots
to do and moving and everything - um
I've even got I've got all these right
here these are these are LED strips that
I got in Taiwan found out that I can get
these for like about 4 bucks each there
so I just kind of went crazy and bought
a pile of them actually still need to go
through Revell I've sorted a few of
these and kind of tested a couple I need
to test all of them make sure they all
work so maybe maybe I should just maybe
I should just do that
I did want to show an LED strip in
action so here's a quick look at my
wife's computer the orange system that
you guys might have seen me put together
LED strip is installed it is actually
like right along here so you can see it
throws some light over the top of the
video card and gives a little bit more
light to the motherboard I'm sorry I'm
shooting this during the day so there's
a lot of reflection going on but should
give you an idea of how they look it
gives us a nice life to system
particularly one that has a open sight
window there you go guys a quick testing
of some of my LED strips they're all
they're all really cool they're really
bright I like the one I put in my wife's
computer over there it looks pretty cool
it's got the orange the orange glow
thing going on and I've decided that
every single one of these LED strips
should now become a build so like I've
got a green I've got a green one right
here that means I need to do an nvidia
build obviously around it right that's
four dollar LED strip maybe a thousand
two thousand dollar computer makes sense
to me but yeah I guess that's gonna wrap
it up for this video once again thank
you very much for watching thanks for
bearing with me over the past couple
months cuz I know it's been sporadic but
stay tunes once I moved in everything I
got some dedicated space I can set up my
lights I can I can get like a monitor
going for my camera so I can see what
I'm doing it's gonna be awesome I'm
really excited I hope you guys stay
tuned for all that I check out new egg
TV cuz that's my you know I still do
that on a day-to-day basis it works so
we're still doing posting lots of
exciting videos over there they've been
doing some 760 benchmarks and I guess I
guess other stuff too oh we're going to
Comic well no we're not going to
comic-con we're going like next to
comic-con up this next week so I guess
stay tuned for that exciting stuff but
yeah I I'm taking way too long to close
this video so subscribe like the video
