generally on point with most stuff but
her love of hell opinions is it was just
egregiously she can probably kick your
ass me over watch to which which also
makes her more trustworthy than you in
the sense that that doesn't matter okay
it sounds like you're meant to say that
sighs that's irrelevant this shit you're
a little bit through the argument that
we're having right now okay you're alive
so hello everyone and welcome this is
awesome hardware if you're not familiar
this is a live show we stream every
Tuesday evening at 5:30 p.m. Pacific
time and we stream to switch TV /
awesome hardware and you're watching
live on Twitch hello and welcome and
thanks for sticking with us through the
first half of the show this is episode
number hundred and fifty seven one five
seven which incidentally we did not have
a random ever and it is the 37th prime
number as we all as we all know of
course 157 common 37th prime number
which makes this a very special show
we've already streamed the first half of
episode 157 to Cal's channel so that's
linked to the description so if you're
watching this in the future and you want
to figure out how we got to where we are
and maybe catch yourself up to how many
drinks we've had check that out link in
the description speaking of drinks we do
drink alcohol in the show and
occasionally we use adult language so
please don't hang out if you're offended
by that sort of thing and maybe hide
your your children or people who are
offended by throw some by occasional
occasional curse words you know try to
make this like a you know it's like
we're a bunch of sailors hear anything
but no no we're just trying to we're
clearly on land we're just trying to
protect two people from being offended
yeah as we cared about
this is this is going smoothly if you
would like to help support our YouTube
channels and our endeavors check out our
stores if you happen to buy something
during the show we'll shout out your
name and johnson at the end of this half
of the show i have shirts mugs pint
glasses as well as other paraphernalia
they're all very high quality and very
well made but look at that beautiful
awesome hardware star wars-themed shirt
look at Ryan design with that that's
still one of my favorite shirts that we
have on either perspiration
it's so good Kyle's drinking a mug
incidentally yeah no never mind
different design on that mouse also
designed by Brian though we'll figure it
out it and also awesome Armour theme you
can buy awesome Hardware merch from
either of our stores get we split the
profits either way so don't worry about
showing favoritism to one of us or the
other using the or don't feel guilty
about like buying from your favorite of
either of us and then being like well
Kyle didn't get anybody only letting you
say that cuz it's your actually the show
yeah I'll let you have your moment of
illusions of grandeur
Kyle's stories bit with tech slash store
and he's also got really high rich and I
rich guys John and we love John he's
great thank you John thanks John I'm
sorry I'm better remember you can just
go to bed with tech now you don't have
to go to the slash bit with that saves
you like 5 or 6 characters it's very
helpful much marker alright let's move
into the first segment of awesome
hardware episode 157 half B we doing
we're talking news we're continuing the
news segment wait hold on there there we
go some news and I have a theme for my
news segment ok do you yes we have
themed new theme that's new and the
theme is he citing the vicissitudes of
Intel vicissitude vicissitudes yes that
was the word that I couldn't pronounce
when I was giving a preview of your half
and I was like a little explaining to
this Institute mmm simply put the ups
and downs of fortune is what the
vicissitudes Institutes of life I'm
trying to expand people's vocabulary the
vicissitude of being a youtuber so there
we go so the vicissitudes it's also
great I also was like this is gonna be a
challenge it's gonna be the second half
of the show I'm gonna have a drink or
two I'm gonna have to save this
institude okay that'd be a good band
name that were the vicissitude dudes
assistant where the vicissitudes we're
forming it now so starting on the plus
side intel has announced recently just
last week their quarter to second
quarter of 2018 results they've set some
records incidentally this was last
Thursday 17 billion dollars in revenue
for the first quarter of 2018 you've got
people in your YouTube chat right I
think so okay I think I saw someone who
said maybe your YouTube wasn't whopping
up or something I made its public great
it should be public I mean everything as
far as I'm aware of was was done
properly according to okay it looks it
looks like there's people in chat yeah
we're good all right cool
just making sure yes double check it
right so Intel made a decent amount
money in the first quarter of course
they did they're into the 2018 but this
is also part of the the industry as a
whole
doing well sure more people are now
buying new computers there's a lot of
people who were sort of getting by with
computers that they got in like the
mid-2000s mid to late 2000s who have now
decided our industry upgrade people who
were like alright I don't need a new
computer anymore because I've got a
smartphone or I've got a tablet or
whatever who are like you know it's it's
still good to have a desktop computer
with some solid long-term storage you
know yeah anything so Intel did pretty
good in the first quarter
it's what I'm trying to get at 17
billion in revenue 5 billion in net
income which is pretty good amount
that's 2.2 billion up you're over here
if you look in it the same quarter a
year ago if you're looking at quarter to
quarter you're just comparing q1 to q2
they're at point nine billion so pretty
much any way you look at it until had
pretty good you know yeah do we have
this revenue q2 revenue would be point
nine billion less than q1 revenue oh
really
according to this they dropped down no
they know they do better they did better
in q2 than they did in q1 okay which
isn't which isn't which is normal you
know the Q one's not the best quarter
for sales okay yeah sure their biggest
concern right now is going to be the
stalls development of their 10 nanometer
process technology the cop the cannon
lake step that we've talked about many
different times here in the show
but still in the realm of rumor and
speculation there's there's only one
real cannon Lake based product that's
actually out on the market that launched
this year more on that in just a sec
though so yeah it's another detail in
this article that we're gonna also loop
back to is that Intel said cannon Lake
products aren't expected to ship until
2019 which is next year and not just
2019 but the second half of 2019 so then
there's a little bit of a disappointment
but rich I stay positive here so here
look at these charts you got I'm fine
with that
q1 2017 to q2 2018 q1 2018 to q2 2018 as
you can see numbers looking pretty good
but
this is the vicissitudes of Intel though
so Intel shares as far as their stock
price actually slipped in this past week
oh oh and this is based on fears of AMD
data center chip challenges challenges
met met by AMD aka
competition so they previously had none
of in this market yes so on Friday as
the article reports Intel shares fell
nine percent and this is after their
positive reports as we just referred to
in the first article we talked about why
did the set up in the new went down the
upbeat quarter two results were over
shattered by concerns that AMD may be
chiseling off market share from its high
margin data center business and the data
center business is pretty substantial
profit and revenue beat Wall Street
targets so Intel's like hey what Wall
Street was predicting for us we actually
did better than but double-digit growth
in its data center chip business fell
short of analysts expectations so they
were looking for more growth in the data
center space but they didn't see it
there AMD meanwhile shares are up 8%
Xeon basically from Intel has dominated
the server and data center market for
the past ten years or so but after a
decade Andy has rent re-entered that
business with the epic processors
they've launched in the past year so
they have been positively reviewed they
have outperformed a Xeon processors and
also provided better performance per
dollar
damn son which is really aimed he's like
thinking that I cave made this processor
it can do everything that the Intel
processors do and it's less expensive
that kind of thing catches on really
anyway and and and at this point with
all the Zen based stuff that AMD has
launched there has been no like alright
there's some you you you could you
couldn't speak a little bit to like the
specter stuff but that's affected both
Intel and AMD
arguably has affected Intel more right
but there's been no like actually AMD
these cheap processors you're selling
have this like critical flaw and like
you know nothing one time out of every
hundred they spit out completely wrong
big inches or whatever but like they do
it so if there's competition then until
it's going to lose market share day it's
an AMD that just makes them short but
AMD is also already sampling their 7
nanometre stuff sent seven nanometer
processors which the Zen to based ships
are supposed to be to be based on and
we're still we've seen speculation that
we might see Zen to based CPUs on their
current and poor platform I'm not
betting on that I'm not sure about that
we don't know it's been a rumor and
speculation well aim for is supposed to
be a viable platform through 2020 so
we're supposed to have a couple more
years events but I could you know I
could see them stretching out the rise
and to stuff to be like right that's
that's our aim for platform stuff and
then in 2020 as a import is petering out
they launch new platform or or maybe or
maybe we will see 7 nanometre Xen 2
based CPUs that launched 10 are
completely compatible with am Ford I'd
be really cool and and a be 350
motherboard that you bought in 2017 will
be upgradable to a10 core you know send
to 7 nanometre base CPU in 2019 I've we
don't know again if that'd be pretty
cool if any we had to do indeed if
you're watching and you can do that
that'd be pretty bad bad STM to be doing
you've given AMD lots of props for
creating platform with an upgrade path
and everything yeah if they do that too
that's that's pretty freakin sweet so
how much will the beam well out the wait
and see of course what actually happens
with that but the fact they're already
sampling 7 nanometre processors based
for epic for whatever the next
generation of epic is as well as
potentially
generation stuff it's pretty impressive
Intel meanwhile has their 10 10
nanometer stuff scheduled to hit the
market next year 2019
not even later this year but next year
how is this actually affected stuff if
you're looking if you're if you're
looking at the stocks this Intel stock
let's look at the 5k oh there it is
so the nine percent drop your top gear
you're reading about in the articles
right here from Thursday to Friday
that's a big old cliff it dropped off
it's been kind of petering around you
know it hasn't recovered much I guess
it's basically what you can say based on
that meanwhile AMD wait let's look at
Andy so it says 47 dollars right now
yeah
AMD meanwhile if you look at the
five-day they had a nice jump nice jump
back there so this is the big piece
today and be got if you were a if you do
stock trading and you were also
following the tech market and you were
anticipating this maybe you could have
made a decent amount of money but we
don't usually try to offer 2-minute too
much in the way of stock tips
we just note our Forte but the market
does have an impact on the companies and
development of products and everything
so it's worth at least being a pre stuff
so when that's and that's adapt that's a
negative that's an overall negative for
Intel butts
but let's switch back this is the
vicissitudes of Intel trying to stick
with that vicissitudes indeed Z 390 by
the way did you already know that word
or did you like look it up I already
knew that word of course you did I mean
I assumed you did but it's like a word
that I have never heard until today
there's only you could have shed light
on me that's a great word vicissitude
yeah that's why like I want to find a
situation where I can use it like throw
it out there and casual conversation
just see you let them just see what I
see what people's responses
use of life yeah just the vicissitudes
really wearing me down
lately I will I think we all will now
Paul thank you you're welcome
thank you so much alright so we've
talked about Z 390 right now if you're
buying Intel mainstream platform your
highest end chipset is Z 370 word and Z
370 has been accused by more people than
just us of being rushed being not as
fully featured for example as the
follow-up ships at chipsets that came
like beef 360 which are theoretically
lower end but include stuff like use 802
that 11 AC Wi-Fi and USB 3.1 gen2 so
there's been various rumors and
speculation as to what Intel is going to
do with their highest end mainstream
chipset if they're going to refresh it
or what right now though we seem to have
some some confirmation this is an an and
tech article and this is information
that asus has published which is a list
of its upcoming motherboards powered by
Intel's Z 290 chipset so there you go
got the Maximus 10 hero the asus prime z
370 - right now that's that right so is
e 390 basically just gonna have all the
features that be 360 hats
so that that's like one of the questions
right now so either Z 390 so we talked
about this I think a couple weeks ago I
either z 390 is going to be a new
chipset manufactured on a 14 nanometer
process that includes all the features
of Z 370 but also upgrades to include
the features of you 360 um be 360 like a
dojo lemon ACN and the USB 3.0 you got
my shirt - or Intel is simply creating a
new
brand and a new SKU for a Z 390 and the
chipsets themselves will still
effectively be Z 370 chipsets but the
motherboards will be required to include
the features 802 the 11 AC Wi-Fi and USB
3.1 gen2 such of the user it doesn't
really make a difference what it is
they'll still theories right now if
you're if you're looking into like
benchmarking and stuff native chipset
support for features like that will
almost like in my experience always
provide better better performance or
you're talking about like the theories
the two schools of thought right now is
the 390 is either gonna be native
chipset or add-on controllers yeah
basically for all the things stapled on
to it yeah so we don't know for sure but
we also didn't know for sure like if
they're gonna call it Z 390 or if
they're just gonna call it Z 370 Gen 2
or something like that so for sure how
they're going to go about this launch
and branding stuff and what new CPUs are
gonna be available and what chipsets
or are going to be required for support
for Gracie because we don't know yet but
what we do know is that Asus has
published this list of Z 390
motherboards
which to me seems to indicate that Z 390
is going to be a chipset again
variables surrounding that are in
questions so we'll we'll wait and see
but this is a pretty expansive list and
the articles linked in the description
all the articles I'm talking about -
they're linked in the description if you
guys want more info but on the ROG side
we've got our G Maximus Rd Strix they
actually have five families of other
boards our G Maximus our G Strix tough
prime and dragon dragon dragon I had an
MS ice thing it does kind of seem like
like it is but I don't know what so we
don't know what dragon is maybe it's a
maybe it's a new Asus push for like a
budget entry-level option that
has a cool name to convince people that
it wouldn't that be like a low-key dis
to MSI maybe our dragons our budget our
cheapest century is basically the logo
of maybe competitors interesting
marketing and that's a completely viable
possibility cap on the high-end side
though for the RG we got the apex the
code the extreme the formula the hero
and the hero Wi-Fi which is capable glad
to see that doing both an extreme and a
formula but to see what actual feature
sets these include on the strict side we
have Z 390 - e gaming - F gaming and - H
gaming and I'm sure these are gonna have
you know a few extra features for each
step up in the tier on the top side Z
through 90 plus gaming how dare you say
F gaming + gaming Wi-Fi and root of you
I also said he gaming an H gaming calvo
and the top c90 d3 90 pro gaming which
is interesting for them though they put
gaming and all these nevermind gaming
isn't the name of course of course
there's like they did it's like tough
our brand for people who want like a
long life span kings access whatever
love a good for gaming those a little
bit women gaming games to put the word
gaming in add the word gaming more sales
that's what happens we've got some
XIII's 390 - a and - p on the prime side
even some micro ATX and mini ITX options
it looks like if you want mini ITX
you'll have to go with the ROG Strix Z
390 - I gaming and then some micro ATX
options for tough and prime so there you
go
not a whole lot of further details about
these but this this veers towards like
the more legitimate info dump for me so
yeah my
anticipated upcoming stuff from Intel
right now includes it was e3 90 again
which for a while I was thinking maybe
they're gonna ditch that right but our
actual it's official people excited for
new Z 390 stuff but let's let's go back
let's go back down we just rode we just
rode the roller coaster off now we're
gonna ride it back to the emotional
roller coaster you're taking you some
nano meter Kenlake processors have been
delayed again until the second half of
2019 so some people were kind of excited
this year because back in May two months
back Canon link was actually available
in a product from Lenovo actually
they're IdeaPad 330 so your tablet
laptop thing yeah it had a 10 nanometer
Intel i3 8121 you processor and everyone
was like oh my god good old mobile 10 10
10 nanometer it's gonna be awesome
Intel's family got this figured out
Intel has been developing 10 nanometer
their tenant this architecture on the 10
nanometer process for a really long time
yeah more time than you would usually
expect we heard about it as far back as
2015 we've had launches promised as
early as 2016 they were pushed back to
2017 and 2018 and now we're hearing 2019
and not just 2019 but the second half of
2019 so coffee lake 14 nanometer is what
we're expecting to see from Intel for
the time being for the rest of this year
and it seems like also most of next year
crazy on the mainstream platform raise a
that does seem a little crazy given how
long it's been in development now
assuming I have like some my stance on
this my view of this is like right if
Intel's really gonna be telling us right
now in July of 2018 that this stuff is
coming at the end of 2019 then it seems
like they're hopefully pretty confident
in that especially given it's been
development for so long so hopefully
this is at least an accurate assessment
of when products based on this meant
when CPUs based on this manufacturing
process are actually going to be
available you would think you would
think but I mean who knows it's it's
still over a year off so yeah not only
are we talking the second half of 2019
so second half of 2019 could be as early
as one year from now July
Birk be as late as a year and a half
from now December do you think to fill
that gap since 10 nanometers being
delayed even further that Intel will
have some family of CPUs that builds
upon like the 9000 series even like now
yeah yeah they're absolutely about to
launch another generation of GB lake 14
nanometer + + + + I'm sorry coffee
coffee like coffee like yeah coffee like
second copy Lake mark - weird I got plus
plus plus they've been really like
they've been riding the 14 nanometer
Shane for so long now it's because
they've been able to without yeah I know
much competition from the CPU side until
Verizon's taken off and now they're like
holy shit we gotta have get our shit
together I feel like they've been just
like they've been like Intel's just been
coasting until just been coasting until
AMD finally lit a fire under their ass
and they're like oh shit we need to like
reinvent the wheel now again like we had
been in the past we got awakened off her
ass in this department the thing that's
confused me and that has continued to
kind of baffle me was that I feel I felt
like Intel was so far ahead that
whatever Intel whatever AMD did come out
with Intel would be like alright we've
had this in a black pocket for the past
year that we just one-up them instantly
here you go here's that here's a better
product right but that doesn't seem to
be the case it does seem to be like
Intel was focusing on other areas or
diverse
buying rate which which is fine you know
like that's a business's decision that
they could make but now that AMD has
come back with some viable architecture
and with seemingly a multi-year plan to
move forward with that architecture and
refine it and develop new ones and to
shrink their process architecture down
because they've got seven nanometer
stuff in the work now and the works now
um until it really seems to be going
from being far ahead to either trying to
keep up or almost playing catch-up to
some degree but we'll have to see what
happens at the end of this year
all that said yeah z 390 does seem to be
in the works and for now 10 nanometers
stuff we shouldn't expect until what
Intel is saying the holiday timeframe of
next year so does that mean October or
December I don't know but the holiday
timeframe is a good time to launch stuff
I just wish it was this year instead of
next year word this information was
revealed via Intel executives and a
conference call with analysts earlier or
last week I should say and there's also
server based 10 nanometer Xeon chips
that are in development those are
expected to follow shortly after the
mainstream consumer counterparts but
that does mean that 10 nanometer Xeon
stuff could be pushed out as far as 2020
and as we were already discussed
anybody's kind of knocking on the door
with their epic chips so going back to
the final back and forth with the
vicissitudes of Intel AMD has announced
their cue to 2018 results kind of like
what we started this hat this app with
talking about Intel cute suits 1:18 for
AMD was the best quarter in seven years
now just to clarify and provide a bit of
context compared to Intel their numbers
are much much smaller we're talking
about one point seven six billion
dollars in revenue right which is a lot
unless you compare it to Intel billion
or something
Intel was over they again 17 billion Oh
17 17 okay
17 billion versus one point so about 10
times she's much yeah but AMD is clawing
their way back whereas Intel is in a
position of market dominance for quite
some time relevant but this amount of
revenue is the greatest revenue that and
the AMD has had in quite some time it
beat there seasonally strong quarter for
from last year so the fact that in q2 of
this year they're reading q4 of last
year pretty crazy
it's pretty impressive and it even beat
the cryptocurrency fueled q1 of this
year which included a lot of excessive
GPU sales due to cryptocurrency
excitement that's that's really good
because it shows that it has longer legs
than just some cryptocurrency hi that is
very volatile and just and and the fact
that AMD's like this positive news about
AMD was enough to tank Intel's market
until stock price by 9%
yeah it's problems you know it's pretty
it's pretty telling when it comes to the
potential that AMD or recouping even
more market share just by the very fact
that they have a viable product to sell
which is cool that's a fifty three
percent jump in revenue year four am the
quarterly sequential basis if you're
comparing q1 to q2 a 7% increase and
their profits and gross margins are both
up their net income rose by heaven 58
million year-over-year 216 million
soddin 58 million increase is because
they were actually negative 42 million a
year ago so a lot of this is pretty cool
because it looks a lot of the sort of
long-term planning that AMD has done
when it comes to their development of
Zen
but it's cool to see it actually playing
out in a positive way for them yeah and
competition of course is good for
consumers so we everyone wins we we're
in favor of it stepped in to accept
Intel just not able to charge $350 for a
four core processor anyway alright
alright let's move on with you the next
next segment which is sort of a third
fight that's real right we're watching
this this series for legitimate
technical information it's cutting off
now you can stop watching everyone leave
there's nothing further like I don't
know how much we provided up to this
point there's nothing further technical
information is to be provided at this
point we're just having fun asking some
questions of the audience and of course
sword fight where Kyle and I argue about
something and we try to convince you of
one thing or another okay I have two
questions we're gonna ask you guys today
I can't wait to argue first question
it's pretty important one oh yeah for
anyone building their own computer which
is what's the best the best type of PC
cooling no what do you think I have more
options here to choose from
thank you cell thank you so process cell
processing our moderator posting links
and
he's you know what after after my
experience with the elite build just
having to deal with it like the elite
bill didn't even leak it didn't even
like it was a perfectly functioning CPU
cooling loop but it was just such a pain
to drain both of those loops as a dual
loop system to paint a drain having to
drain the minutes like a 200-pound
system and as a daily driver if we're if
we're talking about this question as a
system we're referring to as a daily
driver something that you're using day
in and day out air cooling just air why
would anyone put liquid in a baby like
you basically read my mind and those are
my eggs were my exact thoughts as I was
draining the elite build thinking to
myself why did I build this $12,000 PC
to have liquid in it when I'm used when
I'm planning to use it every day and if
something any one thing were to go wrong
with it it would be a whole day's worth
of troubleshooting and draining and and
just a mud fucking pain in the ass quite
frankly excuse my french but it's just
true cooling your chair just to clarify
here I'm choosing air okay because air
is literally close to zero risk if not
absolutely zero risk and you know we're
all we're all just too busy these days
we're all just too damn busy to deal
with the liquid yeah I get it you get to
break some World Records and overclock
to little delay to the CP that's great
I'm gonna call me an old man but I I've
lost the affinity for you know just
extravagant just you have it get cooling
solutions you mix your red ale with your
with you stout I didn't hot just this is
natural color I considered it but I was
a sheriff it in the end decided against
it okay so just just freaking cool it on
air again this is just there's just my
opinions for the swordfight I'm still
using the elite Bowl to edit even the
CPUs overheating
no need to dream again yeah that's
awkward I don't know just just a little
bit with the deal alright so Kyle chose
what I would probably have chosen tell
me how is what I think the answer will
be about me not at all what I think will
be the second answer which will be all
in one liquid cooling that's right Kyle
your air cooling is dick Aeolus
inadequate dick you won't fully
insubstantial and also indicates that
your might be lacking in the manhood
area is just just slightly because
obviously you don't have the balls to go
all out with liquid cooling now
obviously custom water cooling is an
expense that most of us can't afford
exotic cooling I mean come on let's be
reasonable nobody can maintain that over
a long period of time if you're trying
to build a computer that you're actually
gonna use but if you want the best
combination of cooling costs and lack of
maintenance then you're gonna want just
some hog one liquid coolers Kyle yeah
your cpu on your air cooling is on max
load it's gonna be running it 70 or 80
degrees Celsius while I'm running in a
nice cool like 48 completely false yeah
I'm full load on all my cores whatever
helps you sleep at night with my own one
liquid cooler lying back plenty of GPUs
available as well right now with the
almond liquid cooler built into it just
position your radiators and efficiently
cooling positions around your case the
sickness spreads false information
that's all the segment is just false you
just false information ever no it's
completely legitimate okay everyone
using all my liquid coolers we're
obviously going to be voting in the
straw poll they're going to agree with
me just before they inevitably leak and
damage all of their precious hardware
all of on liquid coolers don't leak I'll
see it now oh never happens okay okay
before just to give you guys a few more
moments to to vote if you want to in the
straw poll we're going to jump ahead and
quickly go over this next draw poll
perhaps a little bit less serious but no
no that's comport --nt but all the more
important so obviously being a tech
youtuber very very competitive and
obviously you have lots of other people
but you compete with and you want to
always do better than them so you can
prove that you're a better tech youtuber
right so if you are a tech youtuber you
size up the other tech youtubers and try
to figure out like maybe could I take
that guy maybe I could the question here
is less about the one-on-one fight
though
and more about these your teacher to
teacher ease to teacher you and the
ruthless the ruthless like cut through
cold now I didn't miss that's required
short for a free-for-all we're talking
battle royale motor here yeah Oh
fortnight all these tech youtubers get
dropped into a massive arena and find it
out to the death I'm assuming there's
lethal weapons available to them of
course maybe maybe some some alliances
are made maybe there's some back
stabbing stabbing involved it seems like
it would make an excellent battle right
now but if anyone makes this movie my
director and produces by Paul's battle
royale teched-out yeah it took that
right just go with that okay so I
answered the first question I think so
you you you guessed this one first okay
I will get first go on this but first
before that
let's take a look at the responses for
the best type of PC cool and the type of
PC cooling that you should use to cool
your PC at home
clearly air cooling anyone lays it wrong
but wow I'd be you my low percents let
the record show that my over the straw
poll I was winning by one percent that's
impressive there though just saying that
is very cool we have a 3 volt difference
here
38 percent to 39 percent three whole
votes baby Kyle did get them winning
response I so did but I'm pressed with
all my a i/o users out there cuz anyone
would have been my second choice and
anyone who actually though that was my
my only saving like Isaac right is
actually using an olive wood liquid cool
it's gonna vote that after of course
yeah play it on the fanboy ISM that's
that's pretty hard there and those
popular yeah no I mean I use an a I owe
myself and but I still lost technically
so you did drink up I'll take a drink of
my beer alright so the second question
was who would win in a tech fight brawl
free-for-all did you I didn't choose it
okay you choose first its first right
and even better maybe we would we could
decide who would boil down to the only
two the two remaining the quota would
come down to it so we'll both choose
right now we'll see what the answer is
trip and then the final two about to
make a new straw poll okay then you can
do that sure I figure that okay so I am
gonna say alright I'll be honest here my
final two the two the two that I'm
debating between here and this is this
is I mean we're talking about a physical
battle here sure obviously strength size
and strengths are gonna play just belt
it out a major factor so I'm I am on the
fence between Wendell and J okay that's
that's who I'm but you have to pick one
all right so I'm gonna go with J okay he
has more he has more YouTube subscribers
I think you think it might be making
actors into his strength I got it you
know you're stronger I gotta play the
strategy here okay you know yeah who
might who might be involved in
everything so okay what what's your
what's your thought on that um J would
have been my first pick - just from his
sheer size range he's he's a strong he's
also he's very strongly opinionated and
they feel like he's the first to defend
like anything he stands up for he's very
opinionated and very strong-willed as
he's demonstrated on his YouTube channel
on his Twitter account he's very like he
doesn't take shit from no one and I feel
like a personality personality like that
is generally backed up with with a bite
it's not just bark but there's bite to
it as well I feel like Jay definitely
has the bark and the bite to fit with
Jay there's a slightly higher chance
that he might be armed he could very
well have a gun and kill someone which
is very likely but assuming that I can't
take Jay because you already had that
picked huh I would have picked Randall
as my second pick too but I feel like
that's now a cop-out because you've
already said him so I would go with the
second pick and say jeez it's a it's a
crapshoot at this point
and see what the other ones are I'm
gonna say Steve from gamers Nexus I feel
like Steve has a lot of vigor and
strength and he he also like Jay does
not take shit from people I've seen them
in the comments he's maybe a bit more
diplomatic with how he says it but he
does not take shit from no one and I
realize that's a double negative
thank you he's resourceful he's quite
resourceful again he could call upon his
minions so I'm gonna say Steve GN all
right I'm creating the pool are we
welcome oh oh oh sorry we're gonna see
what people actually okay say ok and
then we'll narrow down we're gonna take
a look at the results right now guys
thank you all for voting for those who
have drew win of course Steve or Steve
gets seconds all right so I was at least
the best I could have been attached
never commutative yeah I couldn't
picture you so and then Luke got three
look up I would have guessed Luke Luke
appiah would have guessed the beat
Lyoness he is of course is larger and
way bigger than Luke - and less of an
all the way down here is way stronger
Bieber Bieber Bieber with the 4% per a
burr but but see this this whole voting
system what this jerk would be inverted
if it was like who'd be the nicest
that's true Ebert and this whole thing
would be inverted aquila Bieber still
exists of all the youtubes here yeah
Austin Steve this is pretty hey it would
be the least nice he's the least nice
did you dick hole Jay I thought Luke
might be higher as a nice list I fit
yeah yeah definitely higher than - it
just goes to show that strength does not
correlate directly with with next
message
so yeah refresher your Jay still winning
with 33% of the votes
all right Kyle's gonna make a final vote
yeah between Jay and Steve so Jay versus
Steve guys this is the this is the final
battle for all the marbles in the
meantime he's gonna post that in chat
we're gonna go over some what do we do
first
Q&amp;amp;A yes getting so so some questions
have been asked
this this is from the first half hold on
all right here we go pull that go here
just go in and chat all right tal's
posting that link in chat free up those
of you who want to to vote right now in
the meantime mr. Richter donated $20 and
did not post a comment Thank You mr.
wick for your $20 donation much
appreciated you filthy casual donated $5
she said how about a 1/2 to you Mini ITX
monster build because rackmount
well why not I feel like if your rack
mounting why why would you limit
yourself to Mini ITX if you're
recommending true that's that's kind of
my stance is counter-intuitive micro ATX
I feel like is a popular rec melt form
factor with a little bit more expansion
and more practicality yeah so the head
that's where I would come come from for
that honestly I haven't really done much
in rec Mountain at all but I feel like a
standard rackmount sizes all right a
little bit bigger so I feel like I feel
like the Mini ITX limitation might be
yeah but yeah I'll try to keep that in
mind maybe maybe I'll consider a rack
Mouse build in the future
that'd be cool yeah bazinga X $15 pulp
for almost making it through Kyle's
Laser laser versus fire laser the Jam
the lady's vagina rant intercepts thank
you for seeing X that was you know I
always appreciate what I'm able to laugh
that much and I was a pretty good laugh
I was like we knew - that's good luck I
have no regrets on that glad I got mbmb
67 mister lenticular with the 1337 the
leap donation Paul just curious how well
is the tesla powerwall doing choose the
tesla powerwall is doing a great job
making sure that I make a take advantage
of
every single little bit of solar power
that is sucked up by my solar panels
that said it's generating about 30 wait
wait wat our mega ye kilowatt hours gosh
whatever kWh I'm saying the wrong number
right here but it's generating about 30
and I'm using about 40 to 50 so I am not
covering my electricity usage right now
but it's helping up to a degree but it
is certainly helping I'm using a lot
less than I would have otherwise and
then this is the time of year when
according to the charts they gave me
when they sort of plot it out it's cuz
it's summer and it's really hot you're
entitled summer so I'm using more than
and generating right I'll make that back
but that's easy and in the in the middle
months when I'm when it's cooler yeah
but yeah I'm I've been doing some
capturing of the actual usage as it goes
along and I do it I do plan a follow-up
video at some point in the next few
weeks or months probably the world
deserves to know okay beautiful John II
shall let's this July thank you giant
with a 10 euro donation got a secondhand
Vega 56 never worked previous owner must
have bricked it anything I can do ATF
flash vault find it
thanks and keep it up but love you both
choose from Greece uh Johnny that's
that's a tough call sell it to someone
who thinks it's still work if you're
getting zero recognition from software
that might recognize it I'm guessing
you're using a different graphics card
and installing that as a secondary
graphics card and seeing if you can just
recognize it at all
the oven trick maybe but that's really
an outside possibility but if you have a
piece of hardware that's not working at
all anyway the oven trick is basically
like look up some details on it but
basically put it in the oven you heat it
up enough to the point where some of the
solder might get a little bit softer and
that might help to reconnect some of the
solder points on it if that's something
that actually caused the graphics card
to fail in the first place other than
that I don't know what to tell you but I
hope you're able to get that working
again because if they get 56 is a very
solid graphics card but sync X $5 Paul
when will you get on to the office and
wagon Jake I'll tech Jesus gamers Nexus
now all have an office I don't have any
current plans to get an office because
honestly I like working from home yeah I
know it's kind of weird it's not but I
like my garage I like working from home
I like working on stuff that I think
will improve my home environments and
you have dogs and I have more of that
planned in the future I'd have dogs so
if that helps
tremendous to help dogs but it has to
help trendies me company and they're
very positive but more so like you're
there for them throughout the day like
dogs are high maintenance and like for
them to be alone all day like you have
to pay for like go out of bladder all
that stuff like it makes sense like I
important yeah if I had a full garage
I'd probably work from home too so it's
just a matter of space and it's not like
like gamers exes has like a full team
like that bit like he's like stats like
five people yeah he's got five dudes you
know like Paul is just Paul and he's got
Joe who comes in couple times a week but
it's not like his whole house is crammed
with every inch and cranny full of
hardware and test benches and stuff like
that like could be you're doing fine it
could be but that you have adequate
spaces feels like
garages and stuff that's fairly well
organized and it just depends on every
every youtuber is different the thing
that just just just give you the direct
answer for me it's about maintaining my
positive attitude and I've been feeling
very positive about Mike my entire
arrangement here and I think that's been
helpful for me just to produce the
videos and keep stuff coming up so it's
it's working for me so for now I'm gonna
stick with it I have no plans to get an
office that's where I'm at
okay maybe lots of money to the handling
Hellcat
that's an interesting handle ten dollar
donation PC reboots randomly under both
load or idle CPU GPU temps under 60 C
loaded stock 1950 X Vega 64 32 gigs of
ram which is on the qvl list 960 evil HX
1200 eye power supply X 399 gaming 7
motherboard about to lose my effing mind
Oh God
that's this change out your RAM handle a
hill cat you have a situation that I and
many PC builders dread which is reboots
random reboots in a situation where you
had like PSU you have probably at least
10 plus potential things that could be
causing your issue here I would say PSU
it's probably one of your pieces of
hardware that's causing this issue maybe
one of your sticks of RAM it's probably
not your processor but I would I would
at least hold that out for very late in
the potential like like you know getting
rid of that as a
a point of failure options but what
you're gonna really need to do is get
replacement hardware for the potential
points of failure that you can test with
in order to make in order to see if you
can eliminate your random reboots which
means getting a different graphics card
that you can install and play with for a
while and still get the random reboots
ok different power supply it's kind of
you can install power supply is a very
potential very high on the list of
potential failure points here it's it's
probably a seven year old unit 2hx it's
an H x-series unit HX 1200 is a very
solid power supply and next I just mean
if he's been using it for the last seven
years that's all okay okay so yeah
you're good on your troubleshoot is
really what you're gonna want to do find
a replacement part that you know works
in a completely different system swap it
in see if you still get that that
failure point that restart and then swap
in something else so you can try
individual sticks of RAM you can run
your system on a single stick of RAM no
problem and and I wish you the best of
luck in narrowing down what's causing
you issues because I completely
sympathize with to you about losing your
effing mind with that what's a build
like that and that kind of issues okay
should we cut off donations because they
keep flowing in we have they complain
page left oh my god we got to get
through these guys so we're gonna have
to give you shorter responses so we
can't come off but please don't donate
any more I guess we appreciate it was
that we can't all right fulfill bite my
bits $5 donation realized I haven't
tickled your wallet in a while so coming
through to say hi also hail excess sing
me a song song song song network I don't
know I've been fine I've never tried to
hey Alexa but thank you by my bits for
your federal donation you awesome March
10 euros he says you're awesome 4770k
980ti 16 gigs of ddr3 excuse me can
achieve 60fps + but I'm quite sensitive
to FPS fluctuations so far she is vsync
but the lag is sometimes all too real
how good is g-sync free sync march
amazing it's awesome you have a pretty
solid configuration that doesn't
necessarily need an upgrade right now so
I would seriously look into like a Jason
you might need to pay a decent amount
like five hundred bucks plus but like at
1440 g-sync monitor would be a great
pairing with your situation worth it
which would give you G sync across
everything but your 980ti
and some games is going to be able to
push 100 plus frames per second and
you'll be able to see that and in some
situations you might get down to 50 60
FPS which with vsync would cause it to
drop to 30 FPS but what do you think
we'll maintain in the 50 60 FPS range
and would totally give you a better
experience and also provide you a nice
upgrade stepping stone to the next level
because a 1440 g-sync monitor would
still be a nice pairing with like a 1080
TI
right yeah okay cool I mean unless
you're you could also opt for maybe a
fake up graphics card and go for a free
sync panel that would be another option
up swap your 980ti for like an RX 580
and get a free sync panel that might be
less expensive also a viable option for
you word okay I'll have their reviews
five dollar donation Congrats again
under 800 K subs Paul thank you thank
you mr. Jeff I appreciate that
by the way if you guys aren't already
entered I have a giveaway going on on my

cheers premier boy Fe well I'll choose
peers right back at you they'll have a
thank you thanks man next we have Nathan
Hardy $5.00 received email today the
game stops doing away with their elite
membership kyle any time frame on your
Dan case build I'd like anyone also I
have not received any further updates
from the Dan case and when it's gonna be
arriving it should be here within the
next two to three weeks and then I'll
probably like I want to get that project
done as soon as the case comes in
probably within that same week so it'll
be on flow plane for a week so I would
say maybe within a month to a month and
a half they'll see a Dan case a four
build pretty soon on the channel I
cannot wait I cannot wait it's gonna be
freaking awesome
you know I you guys know I get a hard-on
for
small form-factor bills so I'm excited
Wow Kyle Jesus oh my god wait wait how
did that even happen
Oh God hold on he's gonna get it freakin
no Jesus I'm gonna undo the Oh God
oh there's so much beer there's so much
blood oh no okay this is not a prank
party foul
yes clip it clip it oh my god here we go
again another spill yep okay so we're
gonna we're gonna benchmark the
waterproofness or the beer proof ness of
the msi gs70 a good sport yeah we'll
give me a new one oh my god oh my god my
no no it's the bottoms dry it should
just the keys it's just the keys that
are see it's just the keys the only most
important thing about a laptop is its
keyboard oh my god seeing it first I'm
like oh haha
Kyle potentially has ruined just his
equipments and then I was like wait no
this is my my set hey you know I spilled
beer all over my no this is only gonna
make your sensible give a like delicious
red ale okay Jesus it's like a nice
stained lovely you know yeah you just
stand it for you
Wow usually a pizza must be working
still let's just find out spike in a
second here flip it hold on need to flip
it flip it need any more paper towels
yeah just just one more all right
sorry chat you're upside down right now
they're probably so disoriented
oh no there's like you're falling over a
shadow there
ah guys who can't see very awesome oh
Jesus
okay now you're pushing buttons it's
okay sorry chat if I type anything weird
in chat it's because I'm trying to draw
everyone will forgive you it's okay all
good okay
all right I'm gonna just like turn what
are you talking about I'm turning it off
killing the power now alright we did Al
jefe el jefe thank you like it never
happened
finish my first bill which is Radisson
in February explained about why he
should buy stock and be before 2000
series about is this this is this trip
ulcer from El Jefe yes that's all out
all right I'll have faith posted some
extra things think so jefe we don't have
time so sorry ahem hey but thank you so
much for your donation we have to move
on
des Jones $10 donation hey guys do you
think there will be a refresh on the
current gen-x 399 motherboards if so do
you think they'll be available at launch
of Turner / for Gen 2 really hoping for
a refresh of the xc-99
em by as rocky does Jones those are very
very good questions thank you for your
donation none of which we have answers
to bazinga x5 tarnation God look the
coolie works if you know what you're
doing oh that's harsh
Asher harsh man shut up bazinga lol J
would be ashamed of you Wow my god well
you know what James J Jay is ashamed of
all of us really it would only be
ashamed of himself his Jay talk Kyle
everything he knows so calstrs up it
means Jay screws tell you ensure if L
that's I'm self-taught mother effort
okay I have not really learned anything
it's all just been by trial by fire but
you know what you know what bazinga X
Wow all I gotta say is well that's okay
you know what I've made some great
videos off of my water-cooling successes
and failures all the same and I feel
like being able to
show an audience what not to do is
equally valuable as showing them what to
do so in many ways you're welcome and I
stand by that statement sounds
reasonable to me damn right is this it
Kumi Nakajima it could mean done video
but the $10 donation says Linus because
he cheats this is in the tech youtuber
well of course what does that even mean
he was saying Linus would win the tech
youtuber brawl because he cheats I
forgot to set that up as well by the way
the reason Kyle and I weren't on the
list was cuz Kyle and I are supposed to
be presiding over this entire write
worthy judges we're up there being the
audience and like giving the thumbs-up
two thumbs down all the youtubers down
below us
fighting sure to the death but that
makes sense but that said we're the
gatekeepers it Kumi I actually believe
you're correct and Linus - escheat okay
although he was number four on the list
his cheating would have taken him to at
least number but 42 votes at 8% of the
overall total I do think Linus stirred
treachery would probably have at least
come close to being number one he's like
little thing you might not have actually
won because obviously treachery Jacob
sat on but yeah you know he's smirking I
could be Nakajima with another $5
donation but Lew plays hockey and is
very tough - maybe my real answer blue
didn't score very high on our shirt he
was only got 16 votes but I think he
would stand a good chance I think he
would stand a good chance he's a tough
guy he does his Canadian does play
hockey he being the rank of the top
three here yeah so he'd definitely be
out Linus it's just a mercy it's a
popular vote so we can't McKenzie flash
yeah unknown text for 99
I vote lightest because he would hide
under a table and then stab the winner
in the back you're absolutely correct -
tats here on the back especially after
they've poured their heart and soul into
a competition see you can build the best
computer on Craigslist on Craigslist
after you know and then and then just
cheat their way just be like hey revoke
these these rules that we instructed you
to follow at the beginning they only
apply to you and us we will not follow
them then we'll hold them against we
will cheat ourselves and then when you
commit the most minor of errors which we
will which didn't affect here your
scores at all right we'll somehow claim
that you fired forfeiting your here win
for that and claim the victory for
ourselves Oh once better at all all
whilst using our own name and brand to
get the best deals on executor Hardware
that we claim is most innocently decided
by bet Hey
but April Bonet that dude that
recognized Linus didn't give him any
good deals no not at all did my girls
like shit out of his brain nope at all
when deciding those prices clearly after
realizing who Linus was did not ever
give him a break in the slightest on
deals and just said yeah my boss is
gonna be cool with all this Thank You
ntek for your four dollars and then you
appreciate it next donation from Andrew
Swire five dollars Canadian any news on

Brandeis there's your processor hey what
are you doing with it it has a piece of
blue tape on it it says 6600 K from
Andrew SH wire to test schwa yeah if
that's not as good as mean testing it
and actually telling you whether or not
it's functional I don't know what could
what could be better
I mean there's a piece of tape on it
identifying what it is and what's to be
done with it what more do you need my
work is done
you rest this case but thank you Andrew

$5.00 you hey Paul what's come out with
this GPC we're going on to you it's not
two years it's one year in one year no
one here as soon as you pass C but city
passed one year doesn't immediately make
it two years okay
but seeing one year at this point on the
internet if you've gone that long
without something people will just
immediately believe anyone who says I

donation if money that you gave to me
thank you all or hand thank you thank
you so much people Kevin Guzman $5
donation does upgrading a be 350
motherboard to a be 450 make any sense
not really
yeah Kevin unless you really really hard
up for like AMD sense mi which is
available reported serious stuff but
my previous stuff like not really no no
maybe there's a little bit better memory
compatibility but if you already have a
memory kit that's working for you three
thousand and thirty two hundred to do
all the things yeah it's all the same
probably not if you're buying new if
you're buying something brand new right
now I was long ago for then you should
look at both of them if you can get a
really good deal on a be 350 motherboard
that has good power delivery then I
might go for it but the be 450 stuff
because it's new might make a little bit
more sense right now if you're buying
new right Nathan Hardy wait you already
