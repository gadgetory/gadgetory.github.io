always I have one false start target
post so x99 has just launched haswell-e
has just launched and if you're watching
this video then you're probably
interesting and finding out more
information to that end I have a special
guest here it's JJ from Asus how you
doing JT I'm doing right now
Thank You Frasca fantastic thank you so
much for being here I also want to say a
big thank you to Jay as of Jay's two
cents because if you haven't noticed I'm
not in my usual location we're actually
Jay's house so thanks Jay as if I had a
choice thanks Jay we forced him to do
that a film you know prod animal so this
video is going to be short and we're
going to really just focus on the
motherboard so if you guys are
interested in a little bit more
information about the CPUs I'm going to
have a video up specifically on those if
you're interested more information on
ddr4 because these new motherboards use
ddr4 memory and I have a video
specifically on that as well so check
those out also if you're interested in a
much more in-depth video on Asus
products with JJ we're also going to be
doing one of those so stay tuned for
that but JJ these motherboards all
feature the x99 chipset mmm and let's
just start from a high-level overview
not specifically an Asus but generally
speaking what is new about x99 let's say
compared to the last enthusiast platform
from intel x79 I would actually almost
say every aspect everything that's new
yeah almost every aspect of the platform
has really been actually extended upon I
mean of course you're going to have
traditional things like you would expect
like SATA and PCI Express and that it
uses memory so it's not like we're
fundamentally changing whole platform
architectural characteristics ok um but
as a whole in terms of the kind of key
specifications that a lot of users might
be interested in all of those things
have pretty much been evolved and
upgraded to either at least be parity
with z97 or even actually be superior in
some ways to that so if we take a look
at it from the number of PCI Express
Lanes that the platform has to offer
which you know an enthusiast platform
that's really important you know how
many cards can you populate how many can
you actively run at one time you know
how many devices that are on the
motherboard as a whole can essentially
be run actively that's all enabled by
PCI Express Lanes okay so with this
platform you know you're talking at a
minimum 28 to 40 PCI Express Lanes that
the motherboard
support depending on the CPU so that's a
big upgrade a lot of add-on cards
correct but that's also a change from
x79 x79 all the CPUs had actually a the
same exact PCI Express line count but
this platform is a little bit different
and how that affects you on the kind of
the motherboard side or the chipset side
is that the layouts might be a little
bit different depending on that so
that's something kind of considered
between the CPU and the board that
you're going to be getting outside of
that storage is uh gone ahead and been I
think really beefed up for this pot that
is going to be my next question so we
have excellent storage options not only
do we have more SATA connectivity but we
also have some next generation storage
yeah and pretty much the way I look at
it is every about every storage
connection that you could want exists on
the boards okay so you've got everything
from an extensive complement of SATA 6g
connectivity to m dot to specifications
support PCI Express support built into
the chipset with a with what's called
the irst driver the option ROM that's
part of the serial ata and the PCH so
all the way around you've got pretty
much all the connections you could ask
for we have like what 10 10 SATA 6g or
doesn't that's correct yes a 6 we also
have the let's talk a little bit more
about those new new memory I'm sorry new
storage interconnect so SATA Express
correct how does that work so SATA
Express and m2 are both actually
interconnects that leverage the PCI
Express bus so pretty much what that
just means is that we're able to bypass
the SATA limitation and be able to offer
much faster throughput lower latency and
also have support for next generation
storage devices which aren't right now
on the market but they're going to be
coming at laters timeframe they can use
what's called mb m e this is a newer
type of kind of communication protocol
which is directly designed for flash
storage so this is like the successor to
HCI that's correct so that's that's
something that's really awesome and
we're going to see helping to progress
the overall foundation of what you can
have with high performance storage so
that's really exciting and that's
something specifically designed for
non-volatile memory that's nvm right
yeah and
and not necessarily held back by some of
the stuff that mechanical hard drives
yeah the AAA protocol it's been around
action for very very long time since the
advent of the original SATA spec so
overall time to progress and move
towards something that can really take
advantage of the flash performance that
isn't currently offered on you know all
these different types of storage devices
whether they're SSDs or m2 based devices
or PCI Express basis as these I think
continue in that same storage note
another improvement of course is USB 3
integrations built into the chipset so
no more number relying on add-on shifts
for that you gonna have it natively yeah
you're gonna have it natively but you
know add-on controllers actually always
to a degree actually conserve some
functionality in terms of not only
performance but compatibility so at
least for you know the boards you look
at might not always not be something
that's a just as pure as having the
chips that built into it but by paper
you know any board that you're going to
buy is at least always going to have USB
3 the best thing that you can look at is
that in all specifications you bumped up
to the most current specs that includes
PCI Express so you got PCI Express 3.0
across the boards though you got the
most bandwidth for whether you're going
to be running you know high-performance
SSDs high-performance graphics graphics
cards capture cards or any type of
devices that need and can utilize the
fastest PCI Express and I was of the
enthusiast platform from Intel because
it has such a long life span yeah but as
a results x79 is so old now that we've
seen so many new features introduced
with with Haswell and even with Sandy
Bridge and Ivy Bridge that we're now
just finally able to take advantage of
so that's that's really exciting now I'm
one more quick note before we jump on it
to the Asus specific things and that as
you mentioned the gosh irst empty so
we're actually capable of doing stuff
that we saw actually like with Sandy
Bridge nipple issue with z68
we saw for instance Smart Response
technology so now we have that
capability as well yeah you have that
entirely available to you so that all
the way around like I said the storage
on really xx 99 is really really
enthusiast class about everything you
could possibly want to do is available
to you there and then of course you know
one of the last touchstone points is
that DDR for inclusion also helps to
really complement storage and a lot of
interesting ways because you know with
the densities and the frequency and the
bandwidth it's available you know Ram
caches and Ram disks and things along
those lines get really interesting and
really
excellent now what we've been talking
about thus far kind of applies to pretty
much any x99 board that you might be
looking at but JJ's from Asus and Asus
so you guys take some pride in the kind
of special sauce that you drop into
these boards so right now in front of us
we have three boards that are going to
either be available at launch for x99 or
soon thereafter so we have the x99
deluxe over here which is kind of the
mainstream wart in white and black in
here we got the X 99 WS workstation
board which Jay has been drooling over
pretty much all day today not that I
haven't does well and of course we have
the r5 e the rampage 5 extreme over here
for you rog lovers now what sort of sort
of special things that you wouldn't
necessarily find on other x99 boards has
Asus dropped into say any one of these
boards what are your favorites you know
that's really hard to say as always you
know we put in a huge amount of design
work in terms of special features and
functionality but one really exciting
one is going to be a specialized
hardware design implementation relative
to what we're able to do when we really
aggressively push the CPU in the memory
so it's a really special design
implementation that we've got on all
these boards that I'll be interested to
see if people can actually figure out on
what we're able to do to allow us to
actually have some really impressive
cash ratio performance and DRAM clocking
on I was very mysterious so we're gonna
so he's saying that when we have the
overclocking the inevitable overclocking
competitions with x99 you think asus is
going to have some some top to your
performance I think our track record
speaks for itself
that's what excellent alright let's
let's move on to something else what
else do you have them so for us I think
we take you know bigger pride and you
know the the class of the fan controls
for one is of course always a big point
we've got that built in to the
motherboards and enabling you know a
level of control across every single fan
header being able to have that DCM PWM
output control being able to map to
multiple temperature input sources is
extremely impressive even Thunderbolt
right none of these boards have
negatively thunderbolt on x79 I know a
lot of guys that we're doing
concentration were like wow I would love
to have Thunderbolt on there right but
now every single one of these boards has
support for our Thunderbolt 2 e x
expansion card so you can go ahead and
drop it in there and you can be rocking
and rolling with that fastest i/o
connection and we were going to wrap
this up in this video up now but you can
pretty much say that if
familiar with the the special asus
features from the mainstream platform
that we've seen with z97 as well as even
with with z87 and and and those words
that have come out if you look at the
segmentation so for instance 5 way
optimization is available on the deluxe
as well as the workstation a lot of the
ROG features specific to like extreme
high-level overclocking that sort of
thing you're going to find those here
stuff that you were looking for in the
dizziest platform for the past four or
five years apart from of course from the
XML and refresh boards that you guys did
a great job with you can now get in the
newest platform with new CPUs ddr4
memory and all that good stuff so it is
it is glorious day for enthusiasts not
for high-end PC users for anyone who
does content creation work with video or
if you're if you're just looking to
build the baddest thing out there you
want speedy and you don't care about
anything else and you want this to be as
fast and is built as possible
this is the platform for you all right
so I'm again guys check out my youtube
channel because we're going to do
another video here where I'm just let JJ
talk and it's probably to be really long
but it's gonna be full of information so
if you want more detail about all these
boards check that out if you want to see
more from Asus the PC DIY channel you
can go to the website yeah PC diy.com or
you can check us out a course on our own
YouTube channel alright beautiful so
check those out if you wanna see more of
JJ thank you guys so much for watching
this video don't forget take the like
button don't forget to subscribe we'll
see you all later
goodbye
