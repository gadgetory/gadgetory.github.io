live event the good old all right cool
beautiful it looks like it looks like
according to this I am live hey oh cool
there I am alright beautiful I love when
things actually function so hey everyone
and welcome to Paul's hardware today's
video is a little bit different than a
normal video for one thing the video
quality that you're watching right now
might not be the best and that's because
this entire video is being hosted and
controlled by my $900 gaming and
streaming builds that I set up actually
been kind of working on this build since
the beginning of this year I originally
put it together as a $500 PC and then I
upgraded it just a month or two ago and
now I'm actually using it to do gaming
and streaming at the same time so this
is kind of my different take on a test a
follow-up test video for this build is
to just actually livestream to my
youtube channel playing games on the
system my plan is to go for about an
hour today and to try out four different
games and to show you guys the
performance of the games as I play them
and I this is the first time I've done
this so I have to double-check and make
sure everything is going alright hey hey
YouTube chat how's it going I'm hearing
that I'm a bit quiet I don't know that
there's much I can do about that my mic
is turned up all the way excuse me my
mic has turned up all the way here well
it's at 98 now it's at 100 I don't want
to do the boost because the busca tends
to add some distortion so cool yeah I'm
not going to fix the screen ratio let me
continue my explanation here so you guys
know exactly what's going on the system
I put together is a $900 PC and there
are the specs for it so you guys can
take a look now I'll admit to you guys
up front here this PC aspect out right
here is a little bit heavy on
the cpu side a little bit light on the
GPU side the reason is because when I
put it together
well graphics cards are very expensive
graphics cards are still very expensive
but I do want to point out that if
you're looking at this system and you're
considering about a $900 PC if you're if
you've got a couple hundred more dollars
if you if you can spend $400 on a
graphics card rather than $200 you can
easily swap out this gtx 10:50 TI for a
gtx 1070 right now and at least if you
go to Best Buy you can buy founders
Edition 10 seventies for $400 at least
right now hopefully 10 70s will continue
to be reasonably priced and will will
continue to have a reasonable way of
getting more graphics processing into
our systems for now though the system is
admittedly a little bit weak on the GPU
side but since I'm only using it to play
at 1080 it should be just fine and since
I've got the more powerful CPU with the
2600 X which is a 6 core 12 thread as
well as some decent memory in there and
I've also upgraded to 16 gigs now from
the 8 gig kick kit that I had in the
$500 version of this build and also now
since there's a 1050 Ti a discrete
graphics card we're not giving up some
of our system memory in order to power
the graphics cards so that's one of the
nice upgrades and differences as well so
need to not lose track of what the heck
I'm talking about I am planning and
doing a follow up video that's going to
be a more edited concise video going
over this performance referencing this
stream as well and everything but for
now I wanted to show you guys that for
nine hundred bucks you can build this
system I'm using a few extra pieces of
equipments here in order to game and
stream on the system at the same time so
of course you're going to need a decent
internet connection with a decent uplink
speed depending on the settings that
you're using right now I'm streaming at
1920 by 1080 and I'm doing 60 frames per
second and because I'm just showing you
the webcam right now it probably doesn't
look all that sharp but there it is
59.94 and I'm about 7500 kilobits per
second when it comes to my encoding
settings I can possibly show you my Obi
set up here let me just clean up my desk
top slightly first okay so oops wrong
one alright so here's a look at the
desktop and we've got the picture in
picture because I'm using OBS to stream
OBS so we can see everything going on
there but I thought I'd at least really
quickly pull up my settings so I can
show you guys that's for the stream oh
sorry for the outputs 1920 by 1080 oh
you know what this adjusted this just
changed itself this is supposed to be
7500 glad i double-checked this to
confirm for you guys I hope it can
update that on the fly hey it did cool
all right maybe the stream looks cleaner
now because I just I just improve the
bitrate let's go back to settings here
that again
so x264 means that it's using the CPU to
encode and that's part of the reason why
going with a more powerful CPU like 2600
X 6 cores and 12 threads does a better
job at something like this gaming and
streaming at the same time as opposed to
something like say 7700 K 7600 K those
quad cores even the quad cores with
hyper-threading from intel and this has
been demonstrated by gamers Nexus and a
few other people who have tested it out
they're just not as good at game gaming
and streaming at the same time so that's
part of the reason why I felt like for
this system in particular it's a good
use case scenario to try both gaming and
streaming let's go back to this alright
now apart from the hardware that you see
listed here I have a few other
components that I have added to this
setup just so I can actually do this all
at the same time speaking of which I
haven't even plug this one in I'm going
to play some GTA 5 which means I have a
controller this is just an Xbox
controller Xbox 360 hold on
plugging in bingo alright
so that's good and then what I'm
actually showing you is the webcam so
I'm using a Logitech c920 there's
different updated upgraded solutions for
streaming video at the same time a
webcam is a good way to start because
they're generally plug-and-play they're
not too difficult to control I will
point out that if you're using the
logitech webcam you probably do want to
possibly grab their software for it
which you can kind of see right here
this will allow you to for instance go
in there and manually control like
turning off autofocus so you don't get
that breathing going the whole time and
then you can also go in here and adjust
the gain brightness and everything set
it to a standard settings so while you
are streaming you don't get stuff moving
around and at least try to give yourself
the best possible situation you can with
the webcam beyond that I just have a
mouse and keyboard that I've added to
the setup I'm using a master keys light
l-little mouse which is actually very
tiny and inexpensive mouse coolermaster
sent over
I like this mouse because it's super
basic you got all the buttons you need
standard forward and back gotta have
forward and back it's got decent
tracking with the optical sensor and
it's even got like RGB lighting on it so
so there we go
so that's pretty much all you need for
this setup for what you for what I'm
doing right now and then of course the
software OBS and then you can get
yourself going with a streaming career
and yeah that's pretty much it
drivers listed on here in video 3 97.6 4
and then finally to show you guys what's
going on with the system itself as I'm
playing I also have rivatuner as well as
MSI Afterburner going so oh gosh the one
thing that is a challenge for me right
now is I'm also doing this all on a
single 1920 by 1080 monitor which does
make it slightly more confusing
depending on what I'm doing alright
let's get that out of the way so I can
show you guys this actually let's move
this to for really quickly
all right so task manager over here we
can see what's going on with the CPU I
like to keep this up and running
especially when I'm testing a system for
the first time we can see all of our
cores and threads right click on the
graph if you want to change from overall
to logical by the way and here we can
see if like is the CPU getting bogged
down that kind of thing we can also see
the memory that's currently being used
so pull that up right there and you can
check it out I can also check your
Ethernet and and all that good stuff not
too worried about that but over on the
right side here I've got hardware info
64 this is giving us some more detailed
information about the system so for
instance we can see all of our core
speeds over here it's gonna ramp up when
it's we're using a single one or two
cores at the same time and it'll
actually get the CPU stock I'm just
using the stock CPU cooler too right now
up to 4.1 or 4.1 5 gigahertz which is
pretty nice overall when we're running
it's gonna be running more about 3.9 to
4 gigahertz when it's using all cores at
the same time down here we can also get
a look at like the voltage that's going
it'll peak pretty high like one point
four one point four seven but you also
notice most of the time it's in a more
nominal range of 1.3 to 1.4 and then
finally here we can also keep track of
important stuff like our CPU temperature
we can scroll down over here and we can
take a look at some of the details about
our graphics cards such as the graphics
card temperature clock speed and all
that good stuff now I have been doing
too long of an intro now so give me just
a minute here and I will switch back
over let's do that first
right now I just realized I can't I
can't adjust things at the same time
that I'm doing that so there we go
alright I need to load up a game though
which is we're gonna start out with
Grand Theft Auto and my mo here is to
play for about 15 minutes per game and
to play the same games that I played on
this system when I tested it and it's
$500 orientation I'm also going to be
showing you guys as I play on screen
statistics and top left-hand corner of
the screen so you can sort of follow
along and monitor what's going on and
the performance
all that stuff pretty much is being
pulled by rivatuner the software from
from hardware info 64 and then there's
there's a control panel you can go in
there to adjust things and make it look
pretty and slightly more legible so GTA
5 is loading up right now I'm just gonna
play single-player mostly gonna be doing
single-player here except we're multi I
guess
GTA 5 I'm going to be doing the
single-player pub G fortnight and
overwatch will be multiplayer alright
let's try to figure out why my why this
is so laggy here and can you guys see
anything that's on screen right now
maybe not hold on oh wait yes you can
see that's my problem with them my
problem with this being delayed a little
bit hold on I need to check one more
thing guys bear with me
some reason there's a bunch of nvidia oh
alright thank you
how's it go chat this is an AMD console
it's kind of it I mean it's a it's an
AMD based system all right let's start
off by taking a look at my settings
we're at full screen 1920 by 1080 60
Hertz is our first rate for the monitor
set so grain before fxaa is on oh all
this stuff is way too high I forgot to
turn all this down hold on I'm gonna try
to switch back to the same settings I
was using for that original test system
which was pretty much no wait I wrote it
down over here so I could double-check
FXAA on sliders at minimum and pretty
much normal settings for everything else
okay
normal this is probably gonna make me
we're gonna make it restart once I
switch this
okay okay
yes it's making me restart it means I
get to regale you guys with stories
again or something like that well well
GTA 5 restarts GTA 5 takes way too long
to restart it's been a constant issue
for me if you're running lots of
benchmark so for some reason when you
run the GTA 5 benchmark little awkward
for me but anyway thanks you guys for
watching wow we got like twelve twelve
hundred and almost thirteen hundred
people going on right now so thank you
guys so much I also want to point out
the reason I decided to stream this
directly to my youtube channel as well
is because we didn't do the live stream
this week that's usually goes on Tuesday
and it's usually a little bit looser and
longer and a live stream so I wanted to
follow that up with with an actual live
stream replacement okay beautiful we've
got a restart here let's go back to the
game and let's actually try some stuff
out I'll also try to point out to you
guys these settings that you're gonna
see in the top corner and what how to
interpret them I guess is what I'm
trying to say yeah also if you guys are
watching this on youtube all the all the
products at least the hardware that I'm
streaming on is listed in the video
description so there's links down there
to Amazon and stuff too oh yeah that's
much smoother alright so if you're
taking a look at what's going on here
and the top left direct3d 11 is the
frame rate so 45 frames per second is
what we're achieving right now our goal
is to get above 60 frames per second
depending on the gamer playing and
everything you also might notice CPU
frequency so that'll update as the CPU
frequency changes again should be around
3.9 gigahertz or so also CPU load is
listed right there that's the percentage
and CPU temperature
Braham as far as how much memory is
being used is up there and again
remember I'm not just playing the game
right now I'm gaming and streaming at
the same time so the CPU is also
handling the encoding of the video
stream and then the shooting it back out
over to YouTube so you guys can can
watch it GPU is below that we can see
the GPU temperature frequency that's
running at percentage load then GPU vram
finally how much VM is being used and
how much total leg right now it's it's
capping it at one oh no it went up a
little bit there I wanted to make sure
it wasn't somehow capping it amounts of
memory that I don't like forget now
let's have to turn the radio off too so
I make sure that I don't get this video
content all right here we go I'm sorry
about that
this is the Trevor section of grand
theft auto 5 you know I feel kind of sad
about is when GTA 5 originally
originally came out whenever the heck
that was like five years ago I played
through the whole thing on Xbox 360 and
then it finally came out on PC and I've
played it a lot on pc but i still
haven't actually gotten through the
entire storyline which sometimes i but
yeah we're getting a real solid 45
frames per second here which I will have
to say is decent it's not ideal because
I do sense a little bit of tearing but
you know what you'll find when you're
not using like g-sync or precinct or
something like that and you're playing a
game and the frame rate is less than
fresh rate in the monitor is eventually
you'll see tearing potentially
stuttering usually stuttering occurs
when there's actual drop-off I'm not
sure how much of this you guys are
seeing although I will say because I'm
trying to monitor not just I'm trying to
monitor not just what I'm seeing here in
front of them also what you guys are
seeing on the stream which I'm watching
on a different computer right over here
so it's not interfering with the
performance of the system that I've used
but yeah that framerate is I almost feel
like that
oh no it's moving and moved a little bit
I'm into 46 frames per second alright
let's run down the other stuff CPU
temperature is fluctuating a little bit
it is peaking it's getting up towards
the upper 70s and I think what you might
notice there is the frequency drop off
so if the CPU gets a little bit warmer
it'll it'll knock down the frequency a
little bit when that happens I can't say
this for sure right now but when it
happens in real life depending on the
settings using for a stream at the same
time you might notice a little hiccup or
something like that but of course it
depends on the CPU
again I'm using the stock cooler the
Wraiths expired that came with this CPU
so there's definitely some upgraded CPU
performance that could be had by the
cooling solution with this I also want
to point out memory usage
we're hitting pretty close to eight
Meg's of RAM so this is definitely not
something I would really attempt or try
out with that original system that only
had a quad core or even potentially well
talk about the memory so that original
system only had eight gigs of memory so
obviously reusing
all right streams asking about GPU
percentage usage it does seem to be only
hitting about 34 percent 32 percents a
little bit higher so I can't exactly
tell you what's going on with that such
a fight wait why are people shooting it
I should play the game he's trying to
kill me why why are you trying to kill
me dude
jump out he's dead
all right so I get this change
I don't think there's anything wrong
with the heatsink I just I just
installed this just steal this guy's
motorcycle
no okay now the cops are on me now
someone in chat pointed out the rise in
CPUs have a 20-degree offsets that's
actually not the case for the rise of
two CPUs
they they got rid of that for the rise
and to stuff although maybe that would
help in this situation
cranking up to the fan speed for the CPU
cooler I keep it a little bit cooler
right now I have headphones on so you
know it's making a decent amount of
noise but it's not too bad okay
not sure how long I should spend in gta5
that's making me so nostalgic though for
all the hours that I have spent playing
GTA 5 in the past that I don't do
anymore but all right I think that is at
least since I spent too much time doing
an intro for this entire thing today I
said I was going to spend 15 minutes
playing HD and good night
okay I want to oh yeah I'm in
single-player so I can pause how useful
all right let's see what the game
settings are there's anything in here
that might be affecting ignore suggested
limits is on so that's usually what
causes it to cap things where a
full-screen automatic aspect ratio and I
say is on vsync is off yeah I'm not
seeing anything in here that immediately
indicates to me that for some reason
we're getting caps somehow my guess
would be when it comes to that CPU CPU
usage is that there's some sort of load
balancing going on right now
operating system because there is a
decent amount of CPU time that's being
used by OBS to do the encoding
apply GPU usage I have less of an
explanation for but that might be
something that actually turning up the
settings on the game could affect
although I don't know if I want to do
that right now getting about 45 frames
for a second if I was speaking to you as
a game streamer who was playing this and
thinking like alright what can I do here
to maybe change some things if you want
to actually get up above 60 frames per
second you might consider streaming out
at 720
instead of 1080 that's usually pretty
acceptable for streamers I decided to
stream this one at 1080 60 frames per
second because I'm planning to pull the
footage off of YouTube once it's
streamed to there to use for a follow up
video on the system that's part of my
decision-making process there so you
might be able to take a little bit of
load off the CPU and then give the GPU a
little bit something more to do but then
again sometimes it just depends on the
game and Grand Theft Auto is a game that
does like a decent amount of CPU
horsepower here we go oh my gosh
someone's watching for Trinidad and
Tobago Tobago
I say Tobago you say to Bob oh thank you
thank you for joining and I think that's
probably about good for grand theft auto
5 so guys I'm going to jump out of the
game here switch back to the full screen
and we'll move over to the next game get
out an exit Grand Theft Auto game exit
yes yes okay yeah I thought the FPS
Center counter might be stuck there too
but it was really really steady at 45 it
was it was ticking up to 46 here and
there I'm not 100% sure what the deal
was with that play but that there it is
all right let's try some pub G little
player unknowns battlegrounds thank you
guys for joining the stream though this
morning I I I'm glad you're here I'm
gonna be streaming for hopefully another
half hour 45 minutes I'm gonna jump into
a few more games give you guys a little
taste of the actual live gaming and
streaming performance of this little
$900 system that I've put together it's
got a 2600 X CPU from AMD and it's got a
GTX 1050 Ti
GTX 950 ti4 MSI is there an arrow OC
version okay I'm just gonna hit start
going I should sue efficiency sakes
alright so for pub G again I'm just
going with the I'm starting off with the
same settings that I used for the five
hundred dollar version of this
building's integrated graphics so
overall quality is just very low that
pretty much since everything's very low
here motion Florida's office just search
go randomly into a match Jason was
wondering I'm not in any way trying to
tell you guys I'm good at video games
I'm very mediocre at video games but
hopefully my mediocre video game play
will show you guys at least how the game
performs even if I am doing poorly at
playing the game that shouldn't affect
the actual
systems the capability for rendering the
game yeah doesn't matter if you die
dying doesn't affect your frame rate
from my understanding lucky luke asked
why I picked the 650 watt PSU I was just
trying to list the actual hardware
that's in the system the build itself if
you look at the it's the $500 system and
then I upgraded it to and then I tested
it I listed it as a $400 470 dollar
system in the testing video because it's
how much it was selling for at the time
and then I did a follow-up upgrade of
that system so the power supply I
recommend is a 550 watt Corsair ZX unit
that's 80 plus bronze raid which will
power the system no problem even if you
were to upgrade to like a gtx 1070 or
even a 1080 i wouldn't have a problem
with in this system just to tell you
guys more specifically what i'm using in
this actual build I listen to actual
power supply that I used which is a
cooler master v6 50 which is a bit more
expensive so I don't necessarily
recommend getting that specific power
supply you can get away with the Corsair
units
all right if any of you guys are just
joining this livestream thank you very
much
before hopping in the saying hello wow
we're up to 1,500 people thanks you guys
so to recap if you're not aware I am
streaming and gaming on the same system
it's a $900 PC the gtx 1050 Tianna 2600
X I'm using MSI Afterburner and
rivatuner to show you guys on screen to
to statistics while I play so up at the
top top left hand side at screen there
you can see the frame rates
it's the CPU performance including
frequency percentage load and
temperature you can see the RAM usage
you can see the GPU usage when it comes
to temperature frequency load as well as
be RAM usage code below that so I'm just
playing some pub G and I'm probably
gonna suck at this so here goes I didn't
even look at where I was ejecting I'm
nowhere near anything towards these
ruins here
brilliant
maybe there's something in the ruins
alright
beyond the $900 system that I put
together I'm using the keyboard and
mouse of course a 1920 by 1080 monitor
which is also the only thing I'm using
the street and I have connected up a
headsets so I can hear stuff and it has
a microphone so I can talk to you guys
and then I plugged in an Xbox controller
but I'm probably not gonna use that
anymore because I really only use that
for grand theft auto 5 apparently works
for pub G as well Hey look boxes oh my
gosh Andrew it wasn't expecting
donations but thank you
hey I got a police vest already which
means I'm already winning I also have
what is this it's just like a a grenade
of some sort and I'm being shot at
running towards nothing in particular
right now guys settings are pretty low
on this game and my main goal is to try
to live Wow look how this water looks
alright I'm gonna attempt to hide over
here for a quick second I hope I hope
nothing's trying to chase me and see if
I can change my settings we're getting
up in the ATV frames per second range so
I'm gonna see overall quality view
distance I'm gonna move too low I just
move overall quality low let's see let's
see how that works see if that gives us
much of a hit
slightly less horrendous there's some
opacity to it now that's nice
and we're only lost it looks like maybe
10 10 ish frames per second there so
that's that's cool playing on a 60 Hertz
monitor so the goal is to be playing at
about 60 frames per second or ideally a
bit above that so that when there's dips
we don't get tearing or that kind of
thing
and then of course since I am gaming in
Street on up there's gunshots of course
since I'm gaming and streaming at the
same time there is an additional
workload on this system what is that
again crowbar yeah I can't even remember
yeah okay yeah I have a gun all right
super useful no one's gonna mess with me
now fortunately I am inside the drop
zone so that's cool too and we're
staying above sixty frames per second so
that's nice oh look at that CPU
temperature thank you for pointing that
out chat we are getting pretty warm in
the CPU temperature modern CPUs have the
capability built into them to throttle
themselves just a little bit so you'll
notice when it's getting really hot
you'll see a little bit of drop-off in
the frequency which should allow the
temperature to even out just a little
bit I'm using the stock heatsink fan
that came with the CPU so bear that in
mind this is just a race fire so it is
an adequate CPU cooler if not the best
and definitely some additional cooling
would probably keep that cooler or
abetik and aftermarket cooler something
like that heck liquid cooling even but
for someone who's looking at a 2600 X I
would recommend checking out the 2700 X
before you bother doing something like
spending you know hundred bucks on a
liquid cooler
I would rather have the raw CV
performance before I go for the overdone
coolie
some fly drop or one of the things where
they drop bombs on everyone it's hard to
tell sometimes I look I found a building
I kind of wish I didn't have my xbox
controller plugged in because it's
giving me all the Xbox a backpack
another backpack helmet is that a helmet
no that's a pot well they make pots look
like helmets I do at least now know that
if I find a frying pan I should pick it
up just usually when I play player
knowns battlegrounds it ends up with me
just hiding in a bathroom somewhere
doesn't look like energy drinks stock
extended mag all right this is where I
am never should give me a highlight
right if I can actually use this
lightweight grip but I can't use that oh
I hear someone I hear someone they're
right there
where'd they go what I'm out of ammo why
didn't I put ammo in this thing
I could've sworn I put ammo in this in
this gun I'm surprised I'm still alive I
have four bullets left and I'm going to
chase this person down and kill them
everyone's like reload did I switch I
think I switched guns without even
without even paying attention to it
because I'm pretty sure that first
pistol I pulled up I put I reloaded
sorry for the dog barking and I lost I
lost that person all back
okay hold on one sec guys
sorry sorry sorry okay
trying to do multiple things in one day
and how am I still alive I have no idea
I'm still alive this is not going well
alright so utility inspectors are here
which should be a good thing because
they're inspecting my solar system and
everything that it's just got installed
and they gave me a four-hour window from
noon to 4:00 and they showed up at 11:30
so like that's normally the type of
thing I should be happy about it how did
I do that i MLG oh my god how did I do
that I take back everything I said about
sucking at video games where is this
person I must loot their body should I
be taking all your stuff person who I
shot I don't know what any of this stuff
is totally built and then I died from
who who killed me thank you thank you I
got headshot that's my that is yeah okay
that seems like a good place to end I at
least gotta kill showed off my mad
skills
I didn't reload I wouldn't yeah alright
exiting to lobby hold on one sec guys
yeah I don't
okay that's like that's like me playing
golf I'm not good at golf I don't play
golf often at all but whenever I do play
golf like out of an entire round I'll
have like one shot that'll actually go
where I want it to and that'll make me
feel like a while good at golf okay
continuing on thank you guys all for
sticking with me here and I'm now
switching over to petting the dog
because he has decided that he wants
attention here oh don't don't do that
okay next game what is the next game
we're gonna do overwatch and for tonight
let's do let's do for tonight first hey
epic games I'm cha
all right I did attempt to to update and
install these games oh I don't do that
don't tell me that fortnight I have to
do this yesterday I updated this
yesterday and now there's a 2.4 gig
patch super awesome fortunately I have
fiber so it's going relatively quickly
and I'm just going to keep the
livestream going so I guess in the
meantime I can answer questions if you
guys have them or something like that ok
what's going on CC is working good on
YouTube that was that close closed
captioning yeah ok no I'm playing for at
night sorry I got a I got a play for
tonight sorry
it's it's just just briefly I it's
there's there's there's a constant ebb
and flow with games it's like a game
gets popular and or and then it's too
popular and so people start to like beg
no it's just too many people playing
that and it's always kind of interesting
people's like how long it takes for
something to for people to get over
something like like yesterday the the
Laurel was at Laura Lyle
Laurel and Yandy or whatever the heck
that thing was I was immediately over
that thing first my first thought I was
like no this isn't doing me much
no the solar is not working yet that's
part of where the inspection is here
today they need to inspect the system
excuse me they need to inspect the
system and then give me permission to
operate hopefully coming soon my fiber
connection speed is a hundred up and a
hundred down right now
so I got plenty of bandwidth yes it
could be faster than that because it's
fiber but it's frontier and they charge
you more for more bandwidth so that's
how that goes and now halfway done done
downloading the fortnight patch so thing
for being with me there and yeah I don't
have battlefield one installed so sorry
we're gonna do fortnight and then
overwatch or my two plans to follow the
reason I'm playing the games that I've
chosen to play today is because they're
the same games that I played on this
system when it was in its earlier form
when it was about a $500 PC before I
updated it updated and upgraded all
right how is it that's my question is
downloading at about 10 megabytes per
second and somehow writing to the disk
at 480 megabytes per second it's
confusing epic games anyway it's
probably does some compression and then
it decompresses it and stuff
alright that's what's going on hero is
here has actually just gone over and
settled in his bed so I'm gonna let him
stay there cuz he he's when he when he
gets in the mood for attention he can be
very pushy and especially when I'm
playing if I'm playing a video game like
with my my mouse hand over here he comes
over to my my elbow and just kind of
like pushes his head up into the elbow
and it makes it difficult to click on
things just challenging Patrick asked
what webcam I'm using I can I can do
this again so for anyone who's just
joining this livestream thanks for being
here it looks like we got about 1400
people watching right now so you guys
are all awesome this livestream looks a
little bit funky because the entire
stream is being handled by the $900 PC
that I just recently built actually
built it as a $500 PC with an AMD risin
2200 G the APU then I updated it
upgraded it with going from 8 gigs to 16
gigs of memory going from the 2200 G to
the 2600 X processor so going from a 4
core for thread processor to a 6 core 12
thread processor and then also adding a
discrete graphics card in the form of a
1050 Ti now I didn't want to just build
that system I wanted to show you guys
how it performs while using it
and one of the main reasons or I say a
good reason for somebody to update from
I say a quad-core to a six core with
simultaneous multi-threading like the
2600 X is if you're going to do more
with your CPU doing more with your CPU
is a good use case for doing more with
your CPUs to play games and stream at
the same time because the game will be
rendered by the graphics card well let's
just let me click launch launch yay
excuse me so the game will be rendered
by the graphics card but then it needs
to take that flat video that the
graphics card outputs and then it needs
to encode that the CPU encodes that at
least if you're using the CPU for
encoding and then it sends that out to
twitch or to YouTube or wherever you are
streaming to and that takes more CPU
processing horsepower and it's been
proven by several people have done some
pretty in-depth testing that going with
a higher-end six core processor it's
gonna do a lot better than the quad
cores especially well depending on the
game you're playing in settings and all
that kind of thing but that's the idea
for today so this is gonna be a long and
so much wandering stream because I'm
loading of games in between this current
delay has been caused by Fortnight
needing a 2.5 gig update that apparently
just popped up this morning very good
timing
and then I also wanted to point out
besides the system all I have added to
it to complete the streaming setup is
ten any butter made since when
gamecontroller is optional I like to use
that for
gta5 also added and webcams that's the
somewhat potato quality webcam you're
looking at right now the Logitech c920
but a good webcam for like 50 60
have an updated version that's for cable
and finally have an awesome keyboard
of course air
the cooler master it's the CM storm I
wrap a tie and the master master key
flight which is actually very like
great budget Mouse
all right let's play some battle royale
for tonight need to load the game up and
make sure that's
okay it's just a quick look at settings
again aiming for 60 frames per second
since I'm playing on a 60 Hertz refresh
rate monitor 1920 by 1080 right now I'm
using the same settings that I was using
with a few votes
everything is up low I have a feeling
like for tonight I'm going to be able to
it's update that and possibly give us
some better
video settings but I'll jump into the
game for now to show you guys hopefully
how much better framerate we're getting
sound is loud I was the sound loud for
fortnight
that
and
look at my nose skin
gotta break down that car and okay see
if I remember how to play for
all right people seem to appreciate the
sound volume being turned down they Wow
they've also been I haven't played for
tonight in a few weeks now these for
anything beyond some quick benchmarking
so I am NOT under percent sure what all
the changes are that have been made
there's a big old gash in the middle of
the map now I don't know where I should
go hopefully somewhere that gives me
quick and painless death that's what I'm
expecting
because if you're just joining you can
you can check out the stats for the
system in the top left corner remember
it's not just playing the game
it is also doing the stream at the same
time so framerate and the top line there
CP performance in blue just below that
Ram performance and usage so basically
RAM usage just below that and then we
got GPU overall settings and hopefully
see in fortnight the they come
pre-loaded the weapons need to like
build stuff I've barely played fortnight
so you're probably gonna see me doing
lots of new stuff then like you know
like I don't know what's going on that's
okay me sucking will not affect the game
performance I'd it does seem like we're
capped at 60 frames per second now right
now so I'm gonna hope that nobody
follows me in here let's see if oh yeah
frame rate limits on unlimited let's do
that there we go that's that's slightly
better that jumped up just a little bit
we're now up over 200 frames per second
and what is this another pistol can I do
wield
I'm inside the zone of of death so
that's good
I guess I'm inside the zone of staying
alive no no person's gonna kill me
awful gaming Pro alright so obviously
frame rate that was pretty good so I
think I'm going to update to medium look
at that
let's try another match you guys can't
see the frame Oh No why isn't that why
isn't that picking up
uh-uh hold on guys I am not sure why
that is doing that come on rivatuner
wake up yeah cuz I can see the overlay
for me but apparently you guys can which
which sucks
let's try this
I'm going to reload the game it might
have been something to do with that
update but we'll see doo-doo-doo-doo
here come the friends requests all right
see if that fixed it
yeah III wasn't aware that the framerate
wasn't going out to you guys because I
can see it on my screen so it's got
something to do with rivatuner has to
hook for tonight and it does like it's
supposed to automatically detect the
game
it also might have something to do with
OBS yeah it also it's still not showing
their shucks all right I have an idea
we'll see if it works
shoot still not over lay well that
certainly hurts my abilities here to
show you can perform in Sanskrit and
everything alright I think what I
probably will need to do just because
time is of the essence here and I am
like live streaming right now is just
move on to overwatch
so sorry about that guys I'm gonna
switch over to overwatch and hopefully
that will play nice with the rivatuner
overlay so you guys can see what's going
on cuz it's kind of the whole point to
login to battlenet now and yeah I guess
I know there is an in-game framerate
counter that can be turned on but um I
my whole goal was to show the entire
system performance as well as memory
usage and all that kind of stuff so you
guys could get an idea of what's going
on and stupid another patch wow I I was
way too confident in my setup abilities
prior to now because I had loaded up all
these games thinking like I'm gonna make
sure all these games are loaded and none
of them have patches that are gonna try
to apply while I'm live and they all
have patches that are trying to apply
while I'm live so that's how it goes
that's how it goes it's okay though this
is only a 500 Meg patch for overwatch so
hopefully it will just completely nerve
fall my favorite heroes stuff like that
of this video and this livestream is to
do a video that's completely powered by
this $900 PC that I have just just
recently put together put it together as
a $500 system with an APU upgraded it
with the discrete graphics card and a
2600 X CPU and now I'm just trying to
use it for
what I deemed to be a good use case for
this PC which is to game in stream at
the same time and if you didn't catch
the beginning I also pointed out we're
running out of GTX 1050 TI which I
recommended for this system because it
was one of the more reasonably priced
graphics cards discrete graphics cards
when I set the system up which is a
couple months back
now that prices have dropped down this
is this could go from a pretty solid
1080 gaming $900 PC to like a really
nice mid to high-end gaming system for
$1100 just go from 200 bucks for the
1050 Ti to 400 bucks for a gtx 1070 and
right now at least well as of yesterday
on Best Buy you could get a Founders
Edition 1070 for $400 and they were in
stock and everything so that's nice
I don't want pink mercy but apparently I
got a reward for breast cancer okay
let's see if this say this is working
all right I can see my rivatuner overlay
well OBS pick up my rivatuner overlay
that is the question I'm double checking
the livestream to make sure everything's
okay
oh it's not there gosh well I'm not
positive what I need to do in order to
get that up and running again I have a
feeling that this has something to do
with the fact that rivatuner is trying
to grab the video stream to put the
overlay on it but OBS is also trying to
grab the video stream
so maybe OBS got out of order
and I don't know how I would update that
so I guess I could just the overlay was
their OBS is not on display capture it's
just using the game capture but um I
know I know the like the way I would
normally do this is I would actually
play on hit here and I would I would
capture with the other system and that
would all you know that would make sure
the overlay was always there but um
shoot all right
display capture might get the overlay so
I guess I could try that
I have display capture setup hold on my
third layout oh I haven't even been
showing this either I should show this
more often
there's my actual testing hard
Christopher and some more details about
my current setup if you guys want to
take a look but what I'm gonna do is get
rid of that just show display capture
which I should be okay sure right now
always never showing the whole display
all right let's see let's see how this
how it likes that
all right I can see the game and the
capture you guys can now see it worked
oh my gosh
thank you to whoever said that in chat
it has scrolled by now beautiful
alright I'm happy about that let me let
me just adjust my my webcam yeah all
right I do this copy that and delete it
and then paste it back yeah let's I love
I love one copy and paste worked
properly okay I'm now overlapping into
my schedule time for an inspection to be
here for let's just do quickly glorious
alright so guys now playing some
overwatch although it looks like the
framerate thing might be on again top
left top left-hand side of the screen
you will be able to reference the frame
rates up top there's also the CPU usage
just below that in blue RAM usage and
green GPU usage in light red and vram
GPU VRAM usage in darker red and as I go
along and play you should be able to you
should be able to see how the system
performance that's the whole idea here
yeah I think fps it's either FPS capped
in the menu or it might just be in the
game having a quick play this used to is
used to like jump you into the game in
like seconds so much for quick
yeah if anyone's watching and you're
referencing like the system performance
CPU usage GPU usage that kind of thing
bear in mind that the system is running
the game so we're playing the game
itself and also the system is running
OBS in the background to capture the
game and stream it out I'm also using
rivatuner to monitor the statistics I'm
also running MSI Afterburner little MSI
Afterburner and rave a tuner kind of
tied together I'm using hardware info 64
for a lot of these readouts that are on
the screen right now and apparently
Blizzard knows that I'm live streaming
right now so it's just taking its sweet
time to have me join a game I'm a single
player I'm a single player trying to
join the game if player rating of 63
it's not exactly all that hot so a stack
attack I have not heard about the next
stack attack although Kyle does try to
do them every month just fun to go and
play last time just switch to full
screen CPU is not overclocked I am using
the stock rate spire cooler for its oh
there's the game music the stock stock
race fire spire cooler for it so you'll
notice the temperatures are a little on
the high side they have gotten up over
80 I think I think when I was in pub he
was getting it got close to 90 at some
point but hooray for a game to join
that's really all I was looking for I
think we have confirmed that the frame
rate cap isn't on because we just jumped
up to 70
what the heck happened to the overlay oh
my gosh doesn't seem right at all
dang it let me try to get closer to the
start here so I'm not abandoning my team
and then let's see if I can fix this
really quickly oh that's why I am stupid
all right that should have fixed it
sorry guys I switched back to the Game
Capture instead of the screen capture
sending the objective hope that worked
yes it worked dying
the heck is that thing
I'm not familiar with that thing it's
it's been a little too long since I
played overwatch
yeah hey I hope to kill someone all
right
whoever watches fun so we're still
capped at 70 frames per second so maybe
I should shed video phew that's why
custom okay alright sorry about that
framerate lock is off that's better
that's much more reasonable yeah a bit
it went back to the defaults display
based limit I also forgot to show you
guys I've forgot to show you guys the
settings that I'm using so again I don't
want to abandon my team or anything like
that so I will try to catch up to them
before I mess with any of my settings
that I might
mr. dying there yeah kill the game
Oh No
okay trying to slightly pay attention to
chat every now and then yeah so again
gtx 750ti
and it looks like in the heat of battle
we're getting maybe eighty on the low
side and the framerate and 100 on the
high side which is very nice actually
I know we're about to lose less nice and
we're not losing look we're just being
pushed back
you can check junk rat
these moving shields I'm fascinated with
do the moving shields hurt you
okay all right what I feel bad having
that done is showing you guys my system
settings like there's a battle going on
and I could I could be changing but I'm
I am I not doing well with Farah I try
to mix up who I use from time to time
but I find Farah and Zarya are the ones
who I tend to go back to triple kill
least I made use of my ultimate my ultra
their press Shift what am i just but
okay forgetting to press shift oh yeah
settings settings let me show you
settings really quick video settings
alright we're at full screen custom
graphics quality is set to high and
we're at a hundred percent render scale
so there you go high quality is what
we're playing out here so this has even
already better settings than that
original system had had on it so that's
cool
and also forgetting that I could I could
change characters at some point but so
much to keep track of right now oh that
was a junk rat thing right yeah
let's feel slightly less bad getting
killed by my Ultimates oh I forgot to
change characters again
hi that's a good thing it's a good thing
for them I was reloading right there
oh she killed me you're super chat I'm
sorry I'm sorry it's very challenging to
keep track of all this going on right
now paladins paladin's as paladin's
explain to me what you mean by paladins
well maybe no what'd you talk about
yay I'm helping
yay killstreak okay sorry sorry I was
distracted by gameplay there no fire in
the hole he'll hate jump crap oh I
launched right into it apparently so it
goes yes playing all right if you're
just now joining I'm playing at 1920 by
1080 60 frames per second is frame rate
and aiming for I'm gaming and streaming
on the same system and this is the
system I recently upgraded it's about a
$900 system total if you're gonna buy
everything straight up GG x 1050 TI for
the graphics card and a AMD Rison 520
600 X for the CPU which is a 6 for 12
turret processing all the parts are
listed in the video's description if
you're interested and yeah I'm just I'm
Emily just wanted to play some video
games today so that's why I set this all
up I think I will hold out until the end
of this round if I can and then I will
probably call it quits because I have
system I believe Tesla has a person here
and there's also a city inspector here
for my solar system that just got
installed I think they're waiting on me
hey I killed the turret it's always
useful
no stupid dragons all right we can do it
it can win house he's not dead
I could die
haha no all right this is an intense
final part of the game so give me just a
second and I'll try to catch up a chat
then I will see if I can explain what's
going on I had defend defend Oh No aah
damn it so close all right there it is
overwatch Oh should we watch the play of
the game
guess that was an okay play of the game
all right well guys you just exit the
game here and we will finish things off
with a look at stats right that's that's
my that was my plan this whole time
there's hardware info Oh
and there's CPU performance all right
cool all right so hardware info 64 has
been running this entire time and I just
wanted to look at some of the max specs
so in this chart you got current min max
an average currently it's just sort of
settling down after having finished the
epic round of overwatch we can see that
maximum we're hitting about four point
one to four point one five gigahertz per
core you guys of course were probably
watching on the livestream to see the
performance does it kind of bounced up
and down in between temperatures were a
little warm you can see up in this chart
here max it peaked that was eighty eight
point five degrees Celsius which is a
little on the warm side but um you know
see people throttle off a little bit
when that happens so it might be
something to consider if you were
actually gonna put together a system
like this for gaming and streaming at
the same time to maybe consider some
additional cooling for the CPU
especially for long sessions if you're
gonna try to game in stream for hours
and hours at a time it's important to
make sure that that CPU stays cool so
you have a decent amount airflow on it
going through your room or that kind of
thing finally we have the graphics card
stats which are over here GPU max 70
degrees Celsius and it was running at
about seven well 1800 megahertz max
frequency on the GPU clock so cool
hardware in 464 is a nice little piece
of software for monitoring stuff it also
ties in and hooks with rivatuner if you
want to do on-screen statistics and
stuff like I have been showing you guys
today but that is pretty much going to
wrap it up for this live stream you guys
thank you so much for joining me today I
am gonna be doing a follow-up on this
where I actually have an edited piece of
content that's a little bit easier to
find out about and digest comparing the
system to the original system some of
the performance numbers and that kind of
thing so stay tuned for that when it
comes out if you enjoyed this video hit
the thumbs up button of course and links
to all the products in this build are
