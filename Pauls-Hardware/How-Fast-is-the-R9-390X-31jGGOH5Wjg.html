they do
excellent welcome back everyone
today I've got a graphics card review
for you MSI's take on the AMD r9 390x
the new GPU that requires you to use air
quotes when you say new because let's be
honest it's not really a new GPU it's a
slightly more refined 290x I do actually
have a couple AMD fury X cards which are
new but you'll have to subscribe to see
my upcoming video on that the r9 390x
uses a Hawaii GPU based on 28 nanometer
GCN architecture and aside from AMD
changing the codename from Hawaii to
Grenada eking out a little bit more
clock speed on the GPU and a gddr5 and
doubling the standard memory allocation
from 4 gigabytes all the way up to 8
gigabytes there's not a ton of
difference between the 290 X and the 390
X well actually there is the price at
four hundred and thirty dollars this
card sits right between nvidia gtx 970
and gtx 980 maybe a little bit too close
to them at times which makes them
nervous and uncomfortable should Nvidia
be concerned let's find out now I think
MSI deserves a lot of credit for
design here on the gaming HG because
this card looks beautiful from the edgy
aggressive silhouette of the Twin Frozr
5 custom cooler to the sleek black back
plates it's got the aesthetic chops to
look nice and powerful in any high-end
gaming system particularly if that
gaming system is read in black of course
MSI also designed their own custom PCB
for this card which uses military class
4 components like solid caps and
Superferry chokes to ensure long term
lifespan and reliability I've been a fan
of MSI's Twin Frozr coolers for quite
some time and although we have seen
version 5 here on a few other cards it
does a very effective job at cooling and
it's certainly not as long in the tooth
as say in videos reference design that's
been around since the original Titan you
have two Torx fans with a special
dispersion fan blade design which is
basically designed to maximize airflow
over the heatsinks what msi calls their
super pipe technology which is a fancy
way of saying that they've optimized the
location of the heat pipes and the
layout of the heat pipes to maximize
cooling efficiency and of course the
dense aluminum Finn are down there
giving you flirtatious looks from behind
the bread and black shroud now these two
fans do not spin up at all until the GPU
hits 60 degrees Celsius which MSI calls
zero frozer and the fans can also spin
independently of one another depending
on where cooling is needed which msi
calls hybrid frozer in practice this
card never got hotter than about 77
degrees Celsius even with a bit of an
overclock the fans do ramp up a touch at
that temperature but the noise level was
still very low and would barely be
noticeable if it was installed in the
case I was testing on an open test bed
beyond the cooler though there is an 8
pin and a 6 pin peg connector for power
no crossfire fingers because those are
for poor people with Priya why e-cards
they're not needed anymore although I
guess I should point out that this is
capable up to 4-way crossfire
theoretically just keep in mind that
this is a three slot cooler so probably
two or maybe three Way will be the
maximum number of this card that you
will be able to fit in any one computer
you've also got video outs on the video
out n including two dual link DVIs a
DisplayPort 1.2 and an HDMI 1.4 sorry no
HDMI 2.0 here so stick to the
DisplayPort out
if you want 4k at 60 Hertz msi also
brings their gaming app to the party and
while I can't say I adore it as much as
MSI's afterburner utility which you can
of course still use to overclock this
card manually the gaming app does have
easy tuning buttons which enable preset
OC gaming and silent modes that will
bump up reduce the clock speed to give a
bit more power or to keep things a bit
quieter there's a max fan button which
will give the card a blast of air for a
few moments to cool it down quickly and
you can also change between the
different display color profiles to
reduce blue light fatigue with the eye
rest
feature finally you have some control
over the LED light on the card and you
can switch between five modes there's
flashing double flashing and random I
can't really see myself using these
personally but I will say that on
breathing and off do seem useful to me
let's run down the vital stats before we
proceed to some benchmarks if you
remember a couple minutes ago I said
that the 390x memory amount has been
doubled to eight gigabytes that's still
on a 512 bit bus but it has been cranked
up to 6000 megahertz effective speed and
MSI turns that up a little bit more to
60 100 megahertz for an out-of-the-box
6.1 gigabits per second of available
bandwidth the GPU clock speed for the
390 X was increased from 1,000 megahertz
to 1050 megahertz MSI again goes beyond
that with their custom card running at
1,100 megahertz in OC mode everything
else remains pretty much the same as the
290x with 2,816 stream processors 176
texture units 64 our Opie's and 44
compute units for my benchmarking
testbed I'm running an Intel 59 30k
overclocked to 4.4 gigahertz 16
gigabytes of g.skill ripjaws for ddr4
memory at 2666 and EVGA x99 classified
motherboard a Kingston HyperX savage 240
gigabyte SSD a Rosewill tachyon thousand
watt power supply and Windows 8.1 64-bit
I'll be comparing the msi r9 390x to the
closest competition on the nvidia side
the gtx 970 and gtx 980 from EVGA and
since I have factory overclocked GPUs
all around I'm going to just leave them
at their out-of-the-box factory
overclock speeds for testing and now
here they are the benchmarks
and those were benchmarks so based on
the price point the 390x is performing
right about where it should be it's
beating out the 970 and pretty much
every test and sneaking up just behind
the 980 like fractal josh should well
pretty much anywhere i guess the
location doesn't really matter when
fractal josh is sneaking it behind you
on the plus side for the 390x though
you've got performance it comes very
very close to the gtx 980 and even beat
it alone crysis 3 at least you've also
got the sexy design in the backplate and
a price that seems much more competitive
than the 290x of last year more than the
290x in just a moment though on the
minus side 8 gigabytes of gddr5 is nice
but where you'll really need it which is
4k the GPU is going to lag behind I do
have to wonder about the crossfire
situation with this card though that
could be interesting there's also the
bulkier 2.5 or you might as well say 3
slot card design which is just larger
than average and probably the biggest
negative is that the power consumption
is still high for this card I was
heading around 500 watts of power draw
maximum for the whole system with a 390
X whereas the 980 would only pull maybe
3 6
380 max ultimately I am just really torn
about this car I mean it's sexy its
powerful it's got tons of memory and it
doesn't really put out too much noise
the same time though the power draw is
still pretty high and the 390 X can't be
recommended for 4k gaming with graphics
intensive titles at least making the
eight gigs of gddr5 less useful it's
nice to see that with some refinements
the grenaded ship formerly known as
Hawaii can nip at the 980 s coattails
and even surpass it on occasion I will
say this though if your GPU budget is
around $400 and especially if you're
gaming at 1440 which i think is a good
resolution to be gaming at right now
Nvidia doesn't really have an answer for
the 390x unless power draw is a major
concern for you the 390x can give you a
lot of bang for your buck and I have no
problem recommending MSI's take on it
before you pull the trigger though do
yourself a favor and check on the 290 X
because they're selling for a lot less
now and if you get a third-party design
you can probably overclock it to
magically make it at 390 X only with 4
gigs of memory instead of eight one last
consideration is that AMD has recently
enabled crossfire between the two ninety
and 290 X and the 390 and 390 X so if
you've already got one
you maybe now have a few more crossfire
options if you're looking to upgrade but
let me know what you guys think of this
card in the comments hit that like
button while you're down in that general
area and you can also check the
description for links to my store for
shirts and mugs and glasses my Amazon
affiliate code link is also down there
you can click on that before you buy
things if you are awesome that's all for
this video though ladies and gentlemen
and as always thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
