click the sponsor link in the
description to learn more what's up guys
welcome back to Pauls hardware today's
video is going to be an unboxing of this
motherboard and I want to start off with
a few pointers one I don't always do
unboxing videos but every once in a
while I have the opportunity to unbox
something prior to it actually being
available now I've asked the viewers at
home whether you guys like to see these
types of videos because they're kind of
like hype videos for a product that's
unreleased yet by and large the answer
has been yes people would rather see
this than not see it but just to be very
clear I do not recommend pre-ordering
this stuff either the motherboards or
the CPUs that are gonna go in them
please wait for independent reviews for
now we're just getting a first look and
maybe getting a little bit excited about
the potential for what these
motherboards have to offer that said
let's open her up so a big THANK YOU to
msi for sending this over so we could
get an early look and we got first off
this is Meg MSI is renaming their
motherboard series we have em EG m AG
and MPG so we should be saying m EG here
not meg but i probably will still say
made quite a few times and we can see
how the front
supports intel core inside supports
obtain c 390 chipset and this again is
going to support the 9000 series of
intel cpus so we can finally confirm we
have a 9900 k which is an 8 core 16
thread processor we have a 9700 k which
is 8 cores and 8 threads and we have a
9600 k which is 6 cores and 6 threads
the smart cache has also been improved
and can go up to 16 megabytes for the
9900 k boost goes up to 5 gigahertz
which is pretty crazy as well and then
thanks to the chipset does e 390 chips
that we now have the integration of
advanced features like USB 3.1 gen2
natively as well as 8o 2.11 AC Wi-Fi the
chips also have a 95 watt TDP and they
have soldered IHS --is so we won't need
to deal it them anymore thankfully
that's really nice and that's probably
where they're getting some of that extra
frequency since this is a cannon Lake
refresh it's still based on the 14
nanometer manufacturing process and
we'll still use LGA 1151 socket
motherboards like this one here if
you're interested in compatibility there
is cross compatibility with older 300
series chipset motherboards you can
update the BIOS and still slot in the
9000 series CPUs and with the new 300
series motherboards you can still use
8th gen 8000 series CPUs with that so
there's cross compatibility between
those but this motherboard specifically
has IO shielding mystic lights killer
extends they you know Intel installed
their own ADA 2.11 AC Wi-Fi and then msi
was like now we're going to use the
killer stuff we got heat shields for the
turbo 1.2 s and extreme Audio DAC steel
armor on the ddr4 and the PCI Express
slots and then core boost which is this
little knob here that goes to 11 also
these accessories which are listed as
accessories I'm actually going to be
kind of curious if they're included in
the box here alright now to remove from
the box I didn't show the window there
but honestly it wouldn't been able to
see much because they have a review
sheet in here so this is something that
you wouldn't get in a retail version of
this this is a media sample performance
qualification and MSI does this they
actually have tested this motherboard
run through some benchmarks with their
own configuration and showed me the
scores that they've gotten those links
still like the info kits and where I can
download the latest bios if I need
that's here's the motherboard and its
own little box I'm gonna set that aside
so we can come back to it because I am
very curious about those accessories
they mentioned it looks like they are
included streaming boost here look a
cd-rom think they've gotten over those I
look such convenient timing for this
launch also did you happen to notice
that the GeForce r-tx 20 series recently
launched to layout of the motherboard
which is actually pretty helpful here
pointing out what is what with a color
picture other documentation includes
case badge thank you for choosing MSI
products make sure to register them you
get some labels for your cables which
can be handy quick install guide as well
as the full manual
here's a two-way SLI high bandwidth
bridge and this is this would be for 10
serious cards from Nvidia so they're not
giving you an envy link bridge in the
box but that is somewhat understandable
those are a little bit more expensive
you also have a set of Wi-Fi antenna
here with a little stand on
for the integrated 8:02 that 11 HD Wi-Fi
that's a killer NIC in there it's not
using the Intel integrated Wi-Fi I
thought this was kind of nice I mean if
if it matches your color scheme these
are SATA cables and they're individually
braided black with some red accents
braided sable SATA cables you don't see
too often and they are kind of a premium
feeling thing and they're all this the
same cable so again I like that but it's
black and red so I guess you'd better be
going with a black and red color scheme
if you're gonna use those again a driver
disk Wow okay and then what's in this
begi more cables alright extra bag was
basically a bunch of adapter cables and
this is because this board has a lot of
RGB support it has 12 volts standard RGB
it's got five volt addressable RGB and
it's also got a small addressable plug
specifically made to work with Corsairs
RGB components and then they give you a
little quarter-inch to eight inch audio
adapter since there is a large
quarter-inch audio plug on the back of
the motherboards i/o and not everyone
has that adapter handy these accessories
are actually pretty nice
which might fall in line with the price
of this motherboard so this is a little
PCI Express expansion card which is a
capture card I believe right HDMI in
right there and it looks like it
supports 1080 and I can't tell exactly
if this has an OEM like an ever media or
something like that where it actually
originates from but it does work with
xsplit OBS Wirecast Media encoder and
vmix so there you go 1080 capture card
and lastly here we have a little riser
card for MDOT - gives you two additional
m dot two slots
slotted into one of the PCI Express
slots on the board and you can have many
many M to devices since there's already
three surface mounted on the board
itself this gives you two more for a
total of five and now for the actual
god-like meg Meg m EG i keep saying meg
i know i was gonna do that to get out of
the box you have some film some film
under padding and I suppose if I'm gonna
give this the full treatment I should
peel off all these little pili things
there's quite a few of them actually one
over here this is a RGB lighting area
it's kind of has a mirror effect so it's
kind of gives some depth to it
so where do we begin here I want to say
power delivery that's
the more most serious and part of the
board that might affect overclocking
options in the future ms has gone with a
16 + 2 phase power delivery
configuration 16 for the CPU 2 for the
memory it is a digital power delivery
design and thanks to that they're able
to integrate this game boost feature
down here which is a little knobby guy
and this knob has 11 positions the knob
actually does go all the way up to 11 so
that's a smart there little spinal tap
reference from MSI but this is the game
boost feature that's basically an auto
overclocking thing they're saying with
the 9900 K the game boosts can boost a
single-core up to 5.7 gigahertz 5.6
gigahertz with a 9700 km 5.3 gigahertz
with a 9600 K these auto overclocking
things tend to be a little hit or miss
in my experience I tend to just go with
manual overclocking but for some people
they are useful and for a lot of people
they can use that to sort of get an idea
sort of a starting off point and then
take the settings that it might do
automatically and then start to tweak
from there as for the board's layout
this is an e ATX board so you get a bit
more space here over on the right side
there is a digital readout over here so
that can display actual stuff on it
versus just having like a standard led
and it's got RGB effects including that
mirror effect on this one up here and
then there's some RGB accents on the
chipset heatsink as well four dimm slots
of course and then four PCI Express
expansion you've got four full length by
16 slots still no info in the manual
that I have about PCI Express Lanes on
these new chips so that info will be
coming in the future I'm imagining a
depending on what you have connected to
this board with all the m2 and the PCIe
some stuffs going to turn on or off
depending on what's being used there's
also a turbo u dot two port down here
which is also a PCI Express connection
just a different actual connector so
works similar to m dot two but if you
happen to have a u dot two device
already on hand and that's probably
going to be something useful for you for
front io connectivity you've got two USB
3.0 front panel headers and two of the
new USB 3.1 gen2
front panel connectors and that's a
rarity on motherboards actually in the
manual they specifically list
compatibility with the Corsair 1000d
which is the first case I've had that
has two of those plugs
$3.99 motherboard I only have one of
those so I guess I might need to swap
this board in or something there's
trade-offs there of course but two of
those is nice that's a definite upgrade
for IO and then I also like they still
have two USB 2.0 headers in there it's
it's nice that they're not ditching
those another nice feature that's
becoming more and more common as the
fixed IO shield here on the back so you
can never forget to install your i/o
shield again and here's where I want to
point out my five favorite motherboard
features which is a video I did feel
like it here your plus ago and I want to
point out that this motherboard has
pretty much all of them as far as I can
tell so one of them is an external clear
BIOS button which that has right here
BIOS reset button with that right there
another one of those five favorite
features is a BIOS flashback option or
the ability to update the BIOS without a
CPU memory installed MSI calls that BIOS
flashback plus and that is also
available via this button right here so
you do need to check in the manual to
make sure you plug your USB with the
bhau's file into the right slot there
feature number three of five is the
surface mounted power and reset buttons
and it has both of those right down here
by the OC knob and then also I like to
have an LED post readout and this
actually has well more than that it's
got the LED post readout itself with
just a little two digit LED code and
then it's also got that o LED display
that I already mentioned and that can be
customized and it can even show little
animations on it like the msi dragon and
stuff which is kind of cool the fifth
and final feature was advanced fan
controls and this board does have a lot
of fan headers on it including a 2 amp
header for a pump which is cool I'm not
sure if it can do a fan stop mode but
they do advertise their full fan
controls with their total fan control
software so I'll have to come back and
follow up and maybe test that software
and see what it is capable of in the
future so guys I know this has just been
an unboxing in a first look but that's
all I have for you today once again this
has been the msi m EG god-like gaming
motherboard with the new zi 390 chipset
from intel supporting Intel's new 9000
series processors the coffee-like
S series which should be available very
soon so stay tuned for that I have more
content coming on this subject of course
in the future so subscribe if you are
not already and let me comment in the
comment section down below let me know
what you think of this motherboard let
me know what you think this motherboard
because I do not have a price for this
as of yet but it's a flagship so it's
probably gonna be a little more on the
high end MSI has a full lineup of a-z
390 motherboards coming out those so
check those out too if you're interested
thanks again for watching guys we'll see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
