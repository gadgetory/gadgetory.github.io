another Paul's hardware dining room
table Edition this time I'm going to be
unboxing my first-ever SteelSeries
product on my personal channel this is
the SteelSeries sensei raw rubber
surface gaming mouse this is available
in a couple different textures or
coatings on the surface this is the
rubberized Edition which I'm going to
say right from the get-go I know I'm
going to prefer there's also a glossy
plastic finish available for this one
which I'm not a fan of when it comes to
mice but if you are that's also
available so I'll just start off with a
quick look at the box but so you can get
an idea of how its laid out and
everything I'll show that text up close
in just a second you do have a little
peekaboo window right there that you can
open up and see that winning is
everything that's that's the mantra
we're going with right here you can also
see the mouse right there this is an
ambidextrous design for a mouse which is
also something that I've not been
particularly a big fan of in the past so
we'll see if this mouse is able to
change my mind when it comes to that
particular thing let's start with some
specs right here as you can see they're
all listed we got frames per second
twelve thousand counts per inch or CPI
anywhere between ninety and five
thousand six hundred and seventy which
is a lot CPI and dpi for all practical
purposes are interchangeable this is a
laser sensor mouse that we're dealing
with right here but 150 inches per
second 30 grams lateral acceleration
I'm sorry 30g lateral acceleration so
you can move the mouse really fast lift
distance of roughly two millimeters
eight button Mouse so you get two side
buttons on either side left and right
center click as well as a eight button
which is used for changing your CPI you
have two options that you can store
within the mouse and a 2 meter braided
cable and there's kind of a look at it
as well
the SteelSeries sensei raw is compared
to the SteelSeries sensei original is
basically a less expensive and slightly
less blingy version if I can say that
basically you get a lot of the cool
elements such as the the sensor they're
using the Avago a DNS 9500 same one
that's used in the sensei and then also
here you get Imran switches for the left
right and center as well as TTC switches
for the side buttons gaming grade
switches power bi SteelSeries engine so
you can still use their software
although you're not going to have quite
as much a ability to access the more
detailed features because this one does
not include actually there's a really
handy chart right here if you're
wondering the difference between the
sensei raw and the original sensei you
get
SteelSeries exact tech the metal coated
grip the you get with with just a sensei
braided cables with both you don't get
all the illumination possibilities so
this one will only illuminate in white
versus all the multicolor illumination
that's available with the RGB on the
original sensei pro grade laser sensor
though available on both for example
sensitivity of CPI and DCPI
just CPI available in this so again just
more of a plug-and-play mouse with not
quite as many of the professional
adjustment features so no LCD menu
system on the bottom of the mouse for
example and one on board profile
available for storage versus five with
the sensei so oh and then the 32-bit ARM
processor so that's a reason why you're
not getting quite as much of the
flexibility that you do with the sensei
but for some people who just want a
simple mouse that works and that you can
just plug in and use which is often the
case and then I've experienced this
should be a good option so let me pull
this out of the box
missing anything we have the SteelSeries
sensei raw Quick Start Guide let's take
a closer look at that
all right Quick Start Guide is going to
tell you oh you also get a SteelSeries
sticker always nice to have a package
contents for example system requirements
compatible Windows 7 Windows Vista
Windows XP Mac OS 10 ten point six you
need 100 Meg's of free hard drive space
if you're going to install the software
and then you get 100 and what you want
828 megabytes of RAM which hopefully you
have
and a USB port plugin and of course
getting started let's just flip through
this Oh another languages so that's
pretty much it for manual and then the
mouse itself which is packaged up here
alright so there you have the mouse
initial impressions for me I love this I
love the coding I love the rubberized
coating this is my preferred coating for
lots of different electronics products
the only downside to this possibly in
the future is after many many clicks or
even a few weeks or months I'm not sure
depending on how the quality of the
coating you can't have it start to wear
off which doesn't look all that nice but
this is just an unboxing but hopefully
this is going to be one of those mice
that holds up over time with that
awesome that awesome coating on it the
bottom you have a bit of a clear
see-through thing so you can see some of
the PCB layout on the inside as well as
your product information some big old
PTFE Teflon feet on the bottoms of nice
easy movement to the mouse across your
chosen surface this is going to light up
in white the SteelSeries image there at
the back then you've also got this
little item here which will light up for
to indicate the CPI changes which you
can make by default with this little
button right there scroll wheel it's at
the top so nice two tents available and
that seems pretty sturdy as well left
and right click button feel in the hand
is pretty good pretty good for starters
one thing that I've encountered with
mice in the past that have buttons like
this on both sides in particular with an
abode extras mice is if you're going to
push these buttons you're gripping the
mouse from the side and you might
accidentally push the other buttons on
the side but this feels like at least
upon initial inspection that my finger
is going to want to push right here and
not necessarily up against these buttons
so it doesn't seem like it would be a
problem although maybe I should put it
on the table yeah it feels pretty good
again especially for an ambidextrous
Mouse and I know this is just a first
impression but pretty good feel in the
hand mouse is fairly lightweight you
don't have any weight weighting options
with this but you know
I think from a weight perspective it's
it's not heavy I would say it's a little
bit more towards medium to lightweight
from nice to that other my said I've
tried you can see the side buttons here
on one side forward and back I'm
guessing for the default some other more
some other buttons over on this side
which you can program using the software
and then the cable which is kind of a
black and white braided it looks to be
the nylon and not plastic braiding which
is always nice to me ters of that and
then up to the knots gold-plated us oh
thank you steel series for not making
this gold-plated I mean it's not bad to
have a gold-plated but it doesn't do
anything so I'm glad that they didn't
have to do gold plating anyway but yeah
nice cable looks to be a nice Mouse
right out of the box so that's a quick
closer look at SteelSeries sensei raw
with the rubber surface thanks a lot for
watching this video guys if you want to
see more don't forget to subscribe to my
