what's up guys how's it going welcome to
Paul's hardware today's video is a
follow-up to this build video which I
just recently posted so check that out
if you didn't see me assemble the system
it is a small but powerful gaming and
multi-purpose gaming and streaming
gaming and workstation mini ITX system
that is also portable with the handle on
top and can fit in carry-on luggage to
be taken on the go I have a very limited
amount of time to test this because I'm
actually gonna be delivering it to my
good friend Rachel there's gonna be
taking it away on a fantastic trip
overseas maybe she'll you shall blog it
or something for you guys but in the
meantime I'm gonna make sure you Windows
is installed and set up and good to go
and also hopefully do some basic tests
here to check out the thermals as well
as maybe a little bit of performance so
my first step was to update the BIOS it
shipped with version f3 I updated that
to f5 and then I went into the BIOS and
set the XMP profile for the memory which
is ddr4 3000 it was actually running at
29 33 because that is the divider that's
available with Verizon next I attempted
a modest overclock I initially aimed for
about 3.8 gigahertz because that's
pretty reasonable to overclock to on
most Rison cpus however it is a small
form-factor system which with a pretty
small cooler so encountered instability
the back to 3.75 yuka hurts and then 3.7
gigahertz 3.7 seemed pretty stable at
first but it actually failed under the
stress test with a temperature getting
up above 83 degrees Celsius and still
climbing
so from there I switched to stock which
is 3.2 gigahertz base frequency and 3.6
gigahertz turbo frequency on the Rison 5
1600 and with xfr defender frequency
range if temperatures are okay it can
hit 3.7 gigahertz on one or two cores
and actually in my testing I was hitting
about 3.7 3 gigahertz max on a single
core or even a couple tours at the same
time so that's pretty nice and no need
to actually overclock it there so I feel
like with the thermal Slough
and I have in this system the stock
frequency that the r5 1600 chipset is
pretty much where you want to be from
there I tested the I 264 stress test
temperatures climbed pretty steadily as
you can maybe see from the chart and
actually peaked at just under 90 degrees
Celsius after about 15 minutes of that
burn test now bear in mind it was pretty
warm in the garage about 84 degrees
Fahrenheit or 29 degrees Celsius was the
ambience I know it's still warm here in
Southern California but it is getting
towards fall but I suspect that the
culprit actually for those high
temperatures when it comes to the CPU is
the lack of air flow there's these side
panels that have a mesh screen in front
of them that's intended to provide a
dust filter but it doesn't actually
provide much active air flow through
them since there's no fan that's up
against those dust filters to pull air
through so it's blocking air rather than
allowing it in and since there's no
other active fans on the outside of the
case pulling cool air in temperatures
just get warmer and warmer and actually
peak pretty warm so I actually removed
the side panel dust filter and
immediately saw the temperatures start
to drop it went from 89 degrees or so
down to 84 and it was still dropping
after a few minutes again I was really
limited on testing time so I'm sorry I
didn't go much further beyond that but
if temperatures are a problem and you're
building in this case highly recommended
to just remove the dust filters from the
side panel it allows a lot more airflow
through if I did have this case and I
wanted to use a little bit more and
possibly test some solutions I might
consider something like a 120 millimeter
slim fan and actually mounting that
somehow directly to the side panel to
provide some active airflow being pulled
in through that dust filter that could
be a way to actually get the use of the
dust filters and the temperatures
without having to choose one or the
other when it comes to temperatures
though again the CPU was hitting about
45 degrees Celsius at idle and this is
with those dust filters on and then when
stress testing again just shy of 90
degrees 89.9 was actually what it hits
that's for the levels otech gtx 1070
mini graphics card it was running at 60
degrees Celsius at idle but that is with
zero fan mode and in a
so when the graphics card isn't doing
anything and it's not too hot
fans don't spin so that's pretty normal
as far as an idle temp this is testing
them with the side filters on by the way
and then I did a union Jin Valley
15-minute loop and the GPU got up to 83
degrees Celsius max and it was sitting
about 82% fan speed which is about 3050
rpms so not the quietest experience but
it was able to keep the GPU cool enough
and the GPU clock speed wasn't falling
off too much it was fluctuating between
about 1770 and 1820 megahertz
I did notice that when I removed the
side panel dust filter from the GPU side
that the clock speeds stabilized at just
over 1820s so you can get a little bit
more performance out of the GPU with a
little bit better airflow but the
fall-off really wasn't too bad it's only
a matter for about 50 megahertz or so
during the GPU stress test the CPU hit a
max temp of 77 degrees Celsius which is
a little warm but it was running at
about 2 point I'm sorry 3 point 6 5
gigahertz on two cores which is a pretty
nice speed when it comes to CPU gaming
frequency I did do one final test
because I wanted to simulate gaming and
streaming at the same time because
that's kind of the argument for going
with a 6 core Rison processor for gaming
specifically you can get a little bit
better performance when it comes to
gaming out of your graphics cards of
course depending on the situation and
the resolution in the game but you can
get a little bit more out of your
graphics card with a 4 core Intel
processor like a 7700 K chest better IPC
performance however if you're going to
go with the six core Eisen and you're
considering gaming and streaming at the
same time that has been objectively
shown to have better performance
smoother experience not just for gaming
but also for the stream that is output
and gamers Nexus actually did a great
test on that just recently so helpless
link that in the comments but again this
final test was kind of simulated because
I was a time crunch but I was running
Unigine valley that was my game and then
I was using OBS to capture Unigine
valley and then write it locally to the
disc so rather than doing the encoding
and spitting that stream out over the
internet I was doing the encoding on the
CPU and then spitting that stream out to
the disc which is roughly the same and
that shouldn't be too much different
when it comes to actual performance and
in this test I saw sort of an expected
combination of the result
from the CPU stress test and the gaming
test which was that the CPU is running
warm but not terribly warm it wasn't
throttling it was running at about 3.4
gigahertz the GPU frequency was hitting
the same frequency that I did and just
the strict gaming tests that was okay as
well temperatures were about 82 degrees
when it comes to the GPU and then when I
pulled off the dust panel on the side
they dropped and got down to 77 and even
started falling off a little bit more
than that on the GPU and then CPU
temperatures were right around the 80
degrees mark so we weren't seeing any
aggressive throttling from that by
hitting say much more towards 90 degrees
so overall it's running a little bit
warm and I would also say it's a little
bit noisy but that's because again
there's minimal fans keeping everything
cool in here and there's minimal space
or side panels or anything like that
keeping the noise from reaching your
ears so here is a quick sound test
now the distances are out
and that sound test by the way it was
run while I was doing the gaming and
streaming test so a pretty heavy load
situation but also something that you
might be expected to hit rather than
just running some simulated tests on
there so with those test run and
completely out of time I had to hit the
road because we had a meeting set up
actually it was why he sauces birthday
last week so everyone go and say happy
birthday to wifey sauce belated birthday
and weirdo get together to meet up and
celebrate that so I wanted to bring the
computer along so I can hand it off as
Rachel was going to be there as well so
on the shores of the Pacific Ocean we
met and it was very dramatic I was able
to hand it off to her and she was super
happy about it and it's always nice when
I build a computer to be able to
directly hand it to someone and say here
you go go and do the computer things
that people do with computers and chips
make make wonderful contents or play
video games or have fun whatever
whatever the case may be but anyway guys
that is all for this video I know it's
been a little bit shorter and a little
bit different when it comes to my
follow-up testing videos but I think
with this particular build the focus was
a little bit more on what the
performance was going to be when it
comes to temperatures as well as noise
output which I tried to cover if you're
looking for gaming performance it's
pretty much going to perform like a
risin 5 1600 with a GTX 970
without too much of an overclock going
on but anyway thank you so much again
for watching this video if you enjoyed
it hit the thumbs up button I have links
to all of the parts that I used in this
video's description check out the build
video of me putting this all together if
you missed it I got more videos coming
up very soon so don't forget to
subscribe - on your way out
thanks again for watching guys and we'll
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
