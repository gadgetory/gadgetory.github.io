boys and girls I'm here with the hot box
build I'm moving on to stage 2 because
as you might have known when I first
built this for my wife a couple months
back I was not 100% satisfied although
it's been working just fine she's been
using it and gaming on it I just wanted
to do a few changes in a few updates so
I have a new motherboard here from Asus
z170 I pro gaming which I have modified
to be color accurate and all that good
stuff I've got a bunch of new fittings
and everything from ek some new tubing
I'm really ready to get to work I just
feel like it'll be nice as maybe if I
had a little help but you know give me
just a second overclock yes dick holiest
370z
then actually give it give it a second
over cockiest
get coleus 370z holy crap it work yes it
never tried that one my mother just made
a mess on the floor
oh sorry hero hope I didn't catch you in
the middle of anything
Oh Oh J everyone J's 2 cents everyone go
visit his channel it's in the
description below sorry if I got you a
bad time go wash my hands real quick
that would be good event uh Jay's gonna
help me out here actually glad I sent in
the ball you shush so guys Jay's gonna
help me out here once he's washed his
hands of course thank God he wasn't in
the middle of a bike ride and let's get
on with the show
so here's our plan of attack for today
essentially we're going to be swapping
the motherboard out that's kind of one
of the main things and then a 6700 K is
the processor now instead of the lowly
6600 K since it makes a lot more sense
to water cool 6700 K and a 6600 K we're
also going to be redoing read redoing
redo big bit we're going to read it real
good gonna redo some of these bends not
all of them are going to try to keep
maybe a couple of them and then this
pump over here we're going to try to
shift over a little bit maybe give a
little bit of this bit more space
between the power supply and the pump
and then maybe add a drain down there at
the bottom that's also an optional
feature so anyway we have a lot of work
to do we should probably start by
draining this and taking it apart
I concur J concur OJ's also got his new
selfie cam he's he got this specifically
for for recording selfies of himself you
know he really likes
it's for his blogging channel mainly I
needed a better vlog yeah
all right we're now at the phase of this
build where everything or most of
everything from the original system has
been removed leaving at least a radiator
in there and I've left the cables routed
where they should be because I think
those can pretty much stay as is next
what's next uh you gotta rinse all your
crap out oh yeah we're gonna need to
rinse some stuff to get rid of the old
dye and then we can start reassembling
with the new motherboard J is checking
to see if the sockets of these two
motherboards are in the exact same so
they're very close yeah I think yeah I
think you're good they're different
manufacturers it's some old ones a
gigabyte the new ones and Asus but I
think you're good I don't think you have
to rebuild us nice I mean uh that's kind
of a welcome relief that is save us a
little bit of time a little bit of work
we have the new motherboard installed
and it hasn't been too difficult just
getting different cables back where they
should be this area here got really
crowded so the USB 3.0 header on the old
board was over here and I had that
extension with it that extinction was
actually causing some connectivity
problems or maybe it was just kind of
loose behind there or something so I'm
using just the one that came with the
case to connect that goes in right there
then I've USB 2.0 right there for the
NZXT hue then SATA and then front panel
it's all right in that little Bank right
there but they're all plugged in so that
means there's room really thing I'm
being watched
and bigger mine's more portable I
thought we're doing small form-factor
today Jay see how smooth is there's no
like standing it it's real of there's no
there's no bird edge how much how much
does that cost my 15 bucks I'm getting
one pesky little nose
it's a bad timing for me to record no I
like I scratch the tube slightly but
then I rode my finger over it I can't
see it anymore so don't even know where
he's got came right off yeah that's the
nice thing about it greasy handle
if I missed
shorter needs to be a little tighter see
when your water cooling in California
sometimes you need the low-flow fitting
you know because of the drought
yeah nice to make is 22 compliant
whatever it is a little kink in me yeah
oh it's still hot
we're now going to do the blow test
which I normally don't do with Jay
Sierra he insists you can hold Eric and
dodgeball come on they're full of
bacteria valve was opened right but the
valve is open time is usually 2 valve
like if it's perfect if it's parallel
let me just open it to perpendicular
means close yeah okay which may be sure
you weren't doing it this little tested
like through the bell works
that was totally airtight all right
we've glued it I like it we make it some
sexy shots
so guys you've probably been watching a
montage and doing way less work than we
have been doing but I hope you have
