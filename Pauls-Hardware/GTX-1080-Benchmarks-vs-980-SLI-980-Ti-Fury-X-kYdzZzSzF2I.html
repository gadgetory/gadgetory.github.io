two new graphics cards the GTX 1080 and
GTX 1070 and even though they only
shared limited information with the
public the tech world has spent the last
couple weeks drooling and speculating
over the new GPUs Nvidia made some bold
claims including that both cards are
faster than a Titan X but one claim in
particular stuck with me with the new
1080 is faster than two previous
generation gtx 980 s and sli since my
water-cooled computer back there uses
this exact configuration I took it as a
challenge perhaps even an insult by
Nvidia so I'm here today to set the
record straight
is the 1080 faster than 2 980 s and sli
actually I don't care about that normal
980 SR for poor people is the 1080
faster than the Arctic Panther let's
find out so since this video is also my
GT X 1080 review I'm going to cover four
main topics first is going to be a recap
of what we learned from the launch event
a couple weeks back second will be a
summary of some of the new specs and
technologies that we're now allowed to
talk about there will be some benchmarks
of course and fourth some quick
overclocking so what we already knew
about the GTX 1080 was this it will cost
$600 MSRP or $700 if you get the
founders Edition it uses the 60
nanometers 7.2 billion transistor
Pascal based GP 104 GPU and has eight
gigs of gddr5 X memory has a base clock
of 1607 megahertz and a boost of 17 34
and NVIDIA demoed and overclocked card
at their event running at 2.1 gigahertz
it that was pretty impressive
it has 2560 cuda cores a 180 watts
thermal design power and a newly
designed air cooler on the founders
Edition that I have here it's got a
similar look to the previous gen
referenced cards but now it features
more triangles my launch video I also
went over Ansel and videos endgame
picture-taking software VR works audio
for more realistic positional audio and
VR and simultaneous multipe rejection
which is built into the hardware of the
1080 and 1070 it uses virtual viewports
to more accurately and efficiently
render multi monitor configurations VR
games and other unique types of displays
now let's move on to the new
technologies I'm actually kind of
surprised you haven't skipped ahead to
the benchmarks yet so thanks for
sticking with me since you're still here
let's take a closer look at this
particular founders Edition 10
the new cooler has a die cast aluminum
body and a low-profile backplate half
that backplate can be removed to provide
more airflow and multi-card setups
functionally it's the same as the 980ti
cooler it's got a blower style fan it's
got an aluminum thinner Rea over a vapor
chamber that keeps the GPU memory and
everything down there cool just a single
8 pin PCI Express graphics power
connector is required and you can power
up to 4 displays via the video outs you
get 3 DisplayPort 1.2 ports that Nvidia
says are forward compatible with
DisplayPort 1.3 and 1.4 you get one HDMI
2.0 B and one dual link DVI I note that
there are no analog analog connections
on this card at all new display
connection standards allow you to take
advantage of the 1080s 12 bit display
controller and handle 4k resolution at
60 Hertz for HP VC encoding and decoding
HD VC is h.265 by the way it's
effectively the successor to h.264 and
DisplayPort 1.4 by the way also includes
HDR metadata transport for connecting to
new HDR displays and not that you have
an 8k display but Pascal does also
support that 76 80 by 4320 maximum
resolution at 60 Hertz although that
does require two DisplayPort 1.3
connections anyway let's move on to some
of the more abstract things that NVIDIA
has done to wring as much possible
performance out of the 1080 as possible
memory compression that's like taking a
lot of data and making it smaller
basically right so now NVIDIA features
four to one and eight to one compression
methods to reduce the number of bytes of
data that have to be fetched from the
memory to render each frame that's
pretty cool asynchronous compute that
was actually asked about a lot after the
original announcement so if you consider
a GPUs workloads there's the graphics
processing and then there's other stuff
like GPU based physics post-processing
of rendered frames and asynchronous time
warp that's part of VR rendering it
checks your heads position at the last
possible moment before it spits out the
final frame Pascal's dynamic
load-balancing allows the GPU to
reallocate its resources on the fly to
handle time critical asynchronous
workloads or to simply use all of the
GPUs idle resources they've also
introduced something called thread level
preemption and pixel level preemption
which allows the GPU to essentially hit
pause on whatever it's working on even
the middle of rasterizing a single
polygon for example and switch tasks in
less than
100 microseconds to handle a
time-critical asynchronous task
finally there's simultaneous
multi-project single pass stereo and
lens matched shading all of which i
discussed a launch event video that I
already did so go watch that if you want
more info and that's I'm not going to
rehash it here let's just say they all
make VR a better experience anyway
though it's time for benchmarks at last
everything here is going to be run at 4k
and it will be including numbers for the
GT X 1080 of course as well as a gtx
980ti
and the AMD radeon fury x reference
cards these were all run in an open
testbed that's right back there except
of course the arc panther that's 2-way
gtx 980 s it's enclosed and water cooled
and overclocked to about 15 45 for GPU
the testbed is an Intel Core i7 59 and
30k CPU at 4.4 gigahertz 16 gigs of
g.skill ripjaws 426 66 speed ddr4 memory
and EVGA x99 classified motherboard and
a HyperX savage 240 gig SSD enjoy
clearly the arctic Panther winds end of
story I'm not going to mention the gta5
score world we're all done here okay all
right fine let's let's try another game
that doesn't scale quite as well and
that will also let us take a look at
some DirectX 12 performance since that's
something other people also asked for
rise of the Tomb Raider so I won't
attempt to explain the differences
between DirectX 11 and DirectX 12 here
but it's safe to say the DirectX 12 is
not yet the magic bullet that will just
give you free game performance the few
games that support it still show poorer
performance than DirectX 11 for now but
we'll hopefully see optimization on the
software and driver side that changes
that later this year so I'm sure people
are already mad that I didn't overclock
the 1080 even though my 9 80s are pretty
heavily juiced so here's a quick look at
the beta version of EVGA precision x16
for overclocking 810 80 you still get
your options to adjust power target
temperature target and GPU and memory
clock offsets there's voltage control -
but GPUs GPU boost 3.0 is the most
exciting thing here in my opinion
consider if you will that every GPU is a
little different even one 1080 versus
another 1080 but every GPU has a maximum
theoretical frequency that it could hit
at any given voltage without any issues
GPU boost 2.0 would start off with a
given voltage in frequency and then ramp
both of those up in a linear fashion
until it hits a threshold such as a
temperature limit for example GPU boost
3.0 allows you to create a custom
voltage frequency curve with a different
frequency setting for each voltage point
so you can maximize your performance
even included an OC scanner utility
which will run through a stress test for
you to automatically set up a custom
voltage frequency curve specific to your
GPU automatically unfortunately it
didn't work that great for me it kept
locking up but again we're working with
the beta utility right now so we got to
give them a little little buggle room
there I was still able to overclock the
old fashioned way though and I pushed my
GT X 1080 initially up to over 2.1
gigahertz but then settle back to a more
comfortable 2,000 85 mega
this gave the 1080 about a 500-point
boost and firestrike ultra impressive
for sure but still not enough to beat
the arctic pant but did I mention that
in all of these benchmarks the testbed
with the GT X 1080 only pulled about 305
watts maximum from the wall socket
closest competitor was the 980 TI which
pulled about 370 and the fury X which
pulled about 400 and finally the Arctic
Panther at 670 watts but it's a full
system in water cooling and dual GPU and
all that stuff but anyway clearly the
1080 is absolutely awesome as it can
kick all that ass and do it while
consuming less power before I conclude
though let's talk about this sli
situation that has so many jimmies
rustled out there first of all yes there
is a new high bandwidth SLI bridge and
it's only made for two-way
configurations standard bridges will
still work but they're only recommended
for resolutions up to 2560 by 1440 at 60
Hertz rigid SLI bridges that have LEDs
built into them that already exists will
work up to 4k and then a video software
will also tell you what kind of bridge
if the text that you're using more to
the point though three-way and four-way
SLI are still going to be there but you
will have to take some extra steps to
enable it by running an Nvidia app to
detect and generate a signature for your
GPUs request an enthusiast key from a
website that Nvidia will be setting up
and then install the key to unlock the
three-way and four-way functions does
this mean the three-way and four-way SLI
can things will be going away probably
not
does it mean that in video will be less
obligated to support them I kind of
think so but consider that DirectX 12
and VR introduced some interesting new
multi-gpu options such as using it using
a single GPU for each eye and VR or
display adapter modes allows you to pool
the memory from both GPUs and videos
choice was to focus more on developing
these configurations
since three-way and four-way SLI are
very very rare setups you guys are free
to continue arguing about this now since
I'm sure there are two sides of the
story and you guys might have opinions
one way or the other but at least now
you really know what's going on that is
