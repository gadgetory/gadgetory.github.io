so at Computex this year coolermaster
revealed a brand new case they had been
working on the master case 5 here it is
and just to give you an idea of the
entire master case family there's the
five which is an ATX mid tower and is
available now or very soon and on the
roadmap there's also the master case
seven which will be a larger ATX full
tower and maybe even a master case three
for micro ATX or mini ITX builds but
those aren't confirmed yet so let's just
stick with the five for today it's
available in the basic trim as the
master case five an upgraded version
like the one here called the mastercase
pro 5 and also in the future a special
master case maker 5 version which will
be a cooler master store exclusive
cooler masters focused with this new
series is to allow you to modify
customize upgrade and expand your case
to meet your needs while maintaining
their standards of excellence in overall
cooler mastery trademark so did they
succeed i don't know why i'm asking you
that question you should just watch the
rest of the video to find out ok so this
is a mid tower ATX case and a quick
unboxing reveals hard foam inserts for
packaging not my favorite but it's quite
thick and certainly adequate the
mastercase 5 and this is a non pro
version we're looking at here by the way
is only available in black at lunch but
Coolermaster will consider other colors
probably white would be on the short
list based on customer feedback MSRP is
$110 us for this version and 140 for the
pro 5 speaking of the pro 5 look at all
these other boxes these are some sold
separately upgrades Coolermaster sent
along including a windowed side panel a
top reservoir bracket and mesh grille a
couple more 2 and 3 slot drive cages and
one of the two lists 2.5 inch SSD
mounting panels these can all be
purchased separately as upgrades for the
base mastercase 5 or if you get the pro
5 it'll come with the windowed side
panel the radiator bracket and the mesh
top cover and look there's even a
privacy shield on the bottom of the
window panel that you can use to block
your power supply if it's not made by
Coolermaster I'm going to leave these
aside for now and focus on the
get but I will come back to them at the
end aesthetically the mastercase 5 is a
fairly standard ATX tower layout with
distinctive angular top and front panels
and lots of hex mesh air flow the black
painted steel and black plastic are very
well matched I like the quality of the
paint job it's a matte finish and that's
maybe just ever so slightly gray or
lighter black and although it can pick
up fingerprints they wipe off pretty
easily
dimensions are 235 millimeters wide 512
millimeters deep and 548 millimeters
tall at the top front and center is the
i/o panel with a reset button couple USB
3.0 ports power button mic and headphone
and this whole panel is removable for
potential future upgrades once USB 3.1
is available for example while we're up
here the top of the case has two handles
reinforced with metal which are sturdy
and make it a lot easier to pick up and
move the case around there's also a top
exhaust panel with a couple hundred and
twenty 140 millimeter fan mounts this is
filtered but it must be unscrewed in
order to clean it also there's no rad
support up here by default this is where
that radiator bracket upgrade can fit in
which I will show you later back to the
front there's a couple five and a
quarter inch drive bays and below that
your front intake with a dust filter
that pulls off from the bottom it's not
as elegant as some of the magnetic ones
but I think I actually prefer it because
the plastic catches are wide and sturdy
and I've had many of those magnetic ones
break because they have flimsier plastic
nubs that hold them in place behind it
there's a single included 140 millimeter
fan with space for a second one I would
have liked to have seen one more intake
fan included but just bear in mind that
you might want to add another one you
can do a 240 or 280 millimeter radiator
up here but you'll want to keep it slim
as there's only 40 millimeters total
spaces the rad and fans together there's
not a lot to say about the left side
panel it's a solid piece of steel which
is a fun sort of hanging trick when you
try to remove it you can trick your
friends with that it's pretty sturdy in
the coolermaster fashion and it has
captive thumb screws actually almost all
the screws in this case are captive I
bet that makes Dmitriy happy there is no
air intake here on the side panel though
and as you also might see here on the
bottom of the case there's no intake
apart from the power supply as well
although the feet are fantastic with
wide rubber pads
again real metal that feels wonderfully
sturdy about that airflow concern though
and I'll randomly switch over to
accessories here for a moment so I can
show you the bracket that's included
which lets you install a third 120 140
millimeter intake fan on the front of
the case at the top just in front of the
five and a quarter inch base and that
should be plenty also there's a manual
warranty info mounting screws and
hardware and a metal nut for tightening
motherboard standoffs metal back to the
case though the back of the case there's
your second included hundred forty
millimeter fan the rear mount is on
slotted rails so you can slide that fan
up or down which is great
motherboard IO knockout of course more
hex grilling seven expansion slots and
is that a storm guard it is a storm
guard how thoughtful cooler master this
is for land parties you basically feed
your mouse and keyboard cables through
it so they can't be ripped off as easily
anyway the bottom mounted power supply
also has a bracket panel with thumb
screws so you can install it from
outside of the case which I have never
done personally but I guess it happens
and thankfully there's a removable power
supply intake dust filter - finally for
the exterior is the right side panel
which is just like the left side panel
except opposite with it removed you can
see the cable management space right off
the bat there's a lovely channel running
down the middle with velcro straps and I
can be able to fit all of your cables in
here but you will be able to fit a lot
of them and there's plenty of space back
here otherwise
anyway the interior paint job is
fantastic there's a large CPU backplate
cutout and a couple 2.5 inch SSD mounts
you get two trays with this version and
there are four mounting locations for
the SSDs there's these two and then
there's two more right above the power
supply it would have been nice to get
all four mounts right out of the box but
that's just one of the ways coolermaster
is segmenting the different versions of
this case they are super easy to use
though and everything mounts with just a
single thumb screw I also want to point
out these wonderful cable routing
grommets which are very thick they are
removable but they're actually going to
stay in when they're in there and
Coolermaster has also done you the solid
of rolling the edges of these pass
throughs in order to keep you from
cutting yourself even though all PC
builds should require a blood sacrifice
but I digress
it would have been nice to see some of
these on the top routing holes to let
the
at least a little bit less visible
here's a look at your front panel cables
to all black cabling for the USB 3.0 the
front panel connectors even those fan
plugs cabling looks great
ooh except for that HD audio that's okay
though you don't have to plug that one
in and in the main chamber we have a
traditional ATX vertical motherboard
layout and a separated lower quarter of
the case for the power supply there's
foam strips for padding beneath the PSU
and also space for one of those hard
drive mounts at the front of this lower
area drive mounting is where you have a
lot of flexibility with this case so
let's take a look at that the housing
for the two five and a quarter inch
drives at the top can be removed to give
you full access to the clip and click
panel where a couple rubber pegs at the
back and a couple captured thumb screws
at the front or all you'll need to hold
the drive cage in place and you can also
shift the cages up or down in about one
inch increments to position them just
where you like them this is a drive
mounting system that I really have never
seen before and I like it
the trays themselves are pretty basic
wraparound jobs I can each hold a 3.5
inch or a 2.5 inch drive and that's
about all there is to show for the
master case 5 what about all those extra
pieces I will now add them to the master
case five to magically turn it into a
master case grow vibe that's right and
now I've got a windowed side panel to
look through a nice mesh vent for the
top a 240 or 280 radiator bracket that
can be used to mount up the radiator
outside the case before installation at
least 4 to 40 rads which is super handy
and I also added all the drive cages
just to give a look see what it would
look like so on the plus side the
mastercase 5 continues the cooler master
tradition of manufacturing solid
functional cases with the core feature
set that filters look for they've added
a lot of flexibility to this with the
expandable areas of the mastercase 5 the
add-ons i've shown today and the
potential parts that they mentioned like
replacement front i/o water cooling pump
mounts and graphics card supports it's
wide enough to support hundred and
ninety millimeter tall air coolers and I
like the look of the case overall I
think Coolermaster did a great job on
this one on the minus side I had a few
complaints I would have appreciated one
more intake fan at the front the drive
mounting situation is pretty limited out
of the box unless you add more cages or
SSD mounts and there seems to be a lack
of cable tie-downs behind the
motherboard tray
apart from that central
channel with the velcro ultimately
though I think coolermaster has produced
an excellent new case in the master case
5
but what do you think the new trend for
case manufacturer seems to be to offer
slimmed down versions of each case to
hit lower price points kind of like whip
fractal did with the define s or fantex
with the enthu Pro M do you like having
the option to pay a lower price upfront
even if you might need to buy some
add-ons down the line or would you
prefer a higher sticker price but all
the accessories come with let me know in
