description and get inspired for your
next project ladies and gentlemen today
intel hath launched upon us their 8th
gen core series of desktop CPUs aka
coffee lake refreshing and updating
their mainstream line up with new Z 370
motherboards and yes you do need a 300
series chipset motherboard for
compatibility with these new coffee Lake
CPUs today I have the flagship 6 core 12
thread core i7 8700 K as well as the
mid-range 6 core at 6 thread I 580 400 I
suppose there are two ways to view this
launch you might say that Intel the
leader in CPU technology who has done
and continues to do wonderful things for
their customers has bestowed upon us
increased core counts and higher
frequencies with this new platform at
prices that are affordable to PC
builders everywhere
or maybe Intel the once fallen champion
of CPUs beleaguered by AMD's relentless
onslaught of launches in 2017 from rise
into thread Ripper
seeing their market share shrink had no
choice but to fight back with a rushed
to market launch of a platform that once
again forces their mainstream users to
buy a new motherboard
despite the advent of six core
processors personally though I like to
let the numbers speak for themselves
so the benchmarks will be my focus today
as I picked the 8700 K and 8400 against
Intel's previous mainstream flagship the
fork or a thread 7700 K as well as AMD's
risin 7 1800 X with 8 cores and 16
threads and Andes risin 5 1600 X with 6
cores and twelve threats now part from
the Z 370 chipset which has the exact
same features as Z 270 there's a small
stack of CPUs coming out today with a
broader lineup promised in q1 2018 at
the bottom of the stack you have the
Intel Core i3 8100 a 4 core 4 thread CPU
with no hyper threading or
boost 3.6 gigahertz base clock is all
you get and 65 watt TDP this has
dual-channel ddr2 Slyke all of the CPUs
in the stack but it will retail for just
above one hundred and seventeen dollars
bear in mind the prices here are all
prices for buying a thousand CPUs at
once bulk pricing so expect retail
prices to be maybe twenty to thirty
dollars more than this
next up is the core i3 8350 case still
no turbo boost or hyper threading but
who cares because it's unlocked for
overclocking but it is more than $50
more expensive than its sibling the 8100
so that's a pretty big jump but I guess
it's kind of what they had to do to keep
it competitive with their own other
processors
I don't know but 91 know what TDP and
six Meg's of cash on this one
next is i-5 8400 that I'll be testing
today 2.8 gigahertz base and a 4
gigahertz boost 6 cores and 6 threads 65
watt TDP and 182 dollars retail pricing
so I'm expecting this one to be around
200 the high 580 600 K is the unlocked 6
core quad core with no hyper threading
again so 6 cores and 6 threads 95 watt
TDP I'm expecting this to be a popular
chip 257 is the bulk price for that one
next is the i7 8700 here with the i7 s
you get hyper threading so 6 cores and
12 threads only a 65 watt TDP on this
one and a 4.6 gigahertz boost so this
one might be a very viable option for
those of you who aren't looking to
overclock and finally at the top the i7
8700 k 3.7 gigahertz based 4.7 gigahertz
boost 6 cores 12 threads 95 watt TDP 12
Meg's of cash and 359 dollars so I'm
expecting this one to be probably closer
to 400 I one thing I did notice about
these CPUs are they do of course have
variable clock speed so the 8700 K for
example was idling at 800 megahertz
which led to some pretty decent power
draw numbers but I'll come back to those
after we do the benchmarks on all cores
went under a full load it was going at
4.3 gigahertz and when it was using some
cores but not all it would be about 4.4
to 4.6 gigahertz and then the peak boost
on a single core it was 4.7 gigahertz as
for the rest of the test vet of course I
had to use a motherboard so for that I
have the gigabytes
Oris z3 70 Ultra gaming a mid-range
motherboard so a very reasonable price
and a nice feature set go along with it
for all the memory I'm using g.skill
ddr4 kits and 2x8 gig configurations all
running at casa latency 14 14 14 14 34
to be specific and ddr4 3,200 speed that
gave me the exact same memory
configuration and speed across all of my
test beds of course had to make sure
that all my BIOS and UEFI are up to date
running the FI version on these e 370
eltra gaming here running the latest
Nvidia drivers for the GTX 10 80 TI
Strix ultra gaming from Asus that I was
using as the GPU for all of the gaming
tests and then for cooling on the Intel
and the AMD platforms I'm using the NZXT
creakin X 62 moving into the benchmarks
proper though first off with Cinebench
of course tested and multi thread
configuration we can see of course more
cores and more threads is going to give
you a better score so the 1800 X comes
out on top here with the Tate's cores
and 16 threads 87 undercuts got the
chops with 6 cores and twelve threads
though scoring 1430 and beating out the
1600 X that also has six cores and
twelve threads there you seeing the
single core advantage for Intel CPUs
which they already had with KB Lake so
no surprise that they are continuing to
have with coffee like next is a
single-threaded tests and here we can
see the 8700 k takes the win over the
7700 case scoring 203 just as just a
smidgen faster and that's most likely
just due to the fox feed since it is
running at about 4.7 vs. 4 point 5
gigahertz moving on to cpu mark which is
part of past marks performance tests and
runs a bunch of different tests testing
different softwares and different parts
of the CPUs architecture and here we
actually saw the single core advantage
giving the 8702 cable lead with the
score of sixteen thousand two hundred
eighty seven even though it only has 12
threads versus the 1800 x with 16
threads let's see if that carries out
further on in the testing as well in the
single threaded test with CPU mark we
saw 8700 case or a new all-time high two
thousand seven hundred and seventeen at
least when I do it include overclocking
beating out to seventy seven hundred
case 2627 and here we can see the rise
in CPU is lagging behind with scores
just over 2000 moving on to blender a
very popular 3d modeling and rendering
software this is time and second so bear
in mind that a lower score is better
here and that means that the 8700 K wins
yet again
beating out the 1,800 X by about three
seconds so that is showing its advantage
this is a shorter test though so let's
switch over to the blender BMW 27 test
which takes a bit longer and here we can
actually see the 1,800 X taking the lead
with only 296 seconds elapsed just
barely though with the 8700 K coming in
with 303 seconds I also want to point
out here the 1600 X which is a
comparable in price to the i5 8400 and
the thread advantage that it has with
all 12 threads versus the 8400 with only
six definitely helps it take the lead
here by a pretty significant margin
switching gears to some gaming tests and
these are synthetics so they do also
have some CPU specific scores 3d market
fire strike ultra shows overall scores
that are all comparable to each other
because when it comes down to it your
CPUs performance will often have less of
an impact on the overall gaming
performance than your GPU however we do
have physics tests involved here as well
and physics is primarily gonna attacks
the CPU 1,800 X was not quite able to
beat out the 8700 K here coming in with
19,000 370 whereas the 8700 K comes in
just ahead 19300 98 moving on the 3d
mark x by a similar test to 3d mark
firestrike ultra except it's DirectX 12
now instead of DirectX 11 the scores are
all kind of similar here again in the
same sort of general ballpark although
we do seem to have an advantage when we
have more cores and more threads because
8700 K and 1800 X are both leading the
pack here you might notice when you look
at graphics though that the scores are
very similar just indicating that the
CPU doesn't really have much effect on
the GPUs performance
strictly speaking but the CPU test does
give the 1800 X the lead once again I
did want to introduce some VR testing so
3d mark VR mark Blue Room is a very
difficult test to beat actually it's
looking for 90 fps and it's really
challenging to get that at all however
we didn't see much variance here between
the different CPUs and different
platforms being tested so that leads me
to believe that this test is not using
more than probably six threads at a time
and it's also probably much more GPU
bound than CPU bound
moving over to some actual games is
starting with rise of the Tomb Raider in
DirectX 12 mode he
at 1080 we actually saw a pretty decent
skew when it comes to the performance of
the different platforms with the 8700 K
definitely taking a pretty significant
lead at 160 frames per second 8400 comes
in a bit slower at 145 with the 1800 X
and 1600 X coming in much closer to
about a 120 so it does show an advantage
for the 8700 K however you'll see that
this is much more evident at 1080
whereas when you move up to higher
resolutions such as 1440 and 2160 a 1440
for sure we're only all at around the
hundred and ten two hundred and fifteen
frames per second mark with no clear
leader although you might look at those
minimum frame rate numbers and say well
the 8700 K does seem to be keeping up a
little bit better and keeping those
annoying low frame rate moments from
happening so that is something to
consider as well when we jump up to 20
160 though we again see a similar
pattern and here for some reason our
rise and CPUs jump ahead and take the
lead getting just a little bit faster at
61 frames per second all the minimum
frame rates are roughly in the same
ballpark
one more DirectX 12 test with
civilization 6 and here is one of those
weird tests where the resolution doesn't
seem to matter all that much civics
doesn't really care what resolution
you're running at it carries a little
bit more about the clock speed if your
CPU though if that's any indication with
the 8700 K taking the lead here again
with eighty five point nine frames per
second at 1080 at least 1600 X and 1800
X are pretty close behind though with
about 83 FPS at 1440 we see similar
scores with the 8700 K and 1800 X 1600 X
starting to lag behind just a little bit
8400 I don't really know why but came in
pretty low here with the score of just
shy of 75 frames per second and then if
we move over to 4k we see higher frame
rates and some tests at I don't know
civics go home sip 6 your your Trump but
again the 8400 that was what the one
thing that was consistent this entire
time was at 8400 with it's only 6
threads available to it scored lower
than the rest of the test so maybe sip 6
is more optimized for 8 threads or more
let's switch over to DirectX 11 starting
with total war Warhammer to a fairly new
title and a new addition to my test
bench suite and as excited as I was to
get this test underway it really hasn't
shown much variance between any of these
platforms at all this is
clearly not a cpu-bound game and because
at 1080 we scored just 115 fps
everywhere with roughly the same 0.1%
lows 1440 again about 81 fps no matter
what CPU I have this paired up with and
point 1% lows all around 70 and a 4k we
have about 44 - 45 frames per second
with 0.1% lows just short of that's at
38 to 40 overwatch is a very popular
shooter from Blizzard Entertainment's
and at 1080 it's actually capped at 300
frames per second max so that is what
we're seeing just about with every every
setup that we have here about 290 or 300
fps and that's just because it's hitting
the max so there might be some variance
there but it doesn't doesn't really
matter at 1080 which which kind of sucks
because I would be interested to see
where it's actually capping off beyond
that but you can't go beyond 300 with
this game at 1440 though we start to see
a little bit of a break from that and
here interestingly the rise in CPUs are
doing really well I mean I wanna say
really well but they are marginally
better performance than the coffee
League CPUs so I thought that was
something that was noteworthy and it
actually continued along in the 4k
testing as well about 109 frames per
second out of the 1800 X and 1600 X
whereas the copy leaks were more down in
the low hundreds and finally player
unknowns battlegrounds this is actually
a fairly difficult game to benchmark
simply because it's multiplayer there's
random starting locations so so just so
you guys know as actually running these
benchmarks in the starting location and
that allowed me to be a lot more
consistent I did have to make sure that
I was restarting and joining a new game
any time I encountered a rain or fog
because that was definitely affecting
the performance but what I found was the
numbers you're gonna see here are kind
of a nice mid-range when you're actually
playing the game you might see slightly
higher frame rates than this when you're
out in open fields where there's a lot
less polygons and you might see slightly
lower frame rates than these if you're
in a town or a city that has a lot more
polygons the coffee-like CPUs at 1080
though didn't show an advantage so that
is something worth pointing out 1600 X
came in last with a score of 96 frames
per second moving up to 1440 the numbers
start to even out a little bit with both
of our coffee Lakes CPUs scoring just
shy of 90 frames per second the rise in
CPUs coming in in
low 80s and then if we move over to 4k
we see pretty much equivalents across
the board here's where the game actually
becomes majority GPU model active versus
CPU so we get the same frame rate no
matter what platform we're testing on
and then I've got one last slide for you
guys here this is power draw and as
previously mentioned the copy like CPU
seemed to be editing very very nicely
only about 49 watts drawn compared to
the 70 or so from the Rison platforms on
average though we did see good power
draw out of the calculate CPUs about 358
watts 335 watts on average from the 8700
K and 8400 K and that was a little bit
less than we were drawing from the 1800
X and 1600 X so it is nice to know that
performance wise these are keeping up
with these n CPUs which are known to be
very power efficient so I hope you guys
have enjoyed those benchmarks because
they took a freaking long time to run
all of them especially doing across all
of those platforms and I I ran all these
tests fresh I didn't use any old numbers
or anything like that so I hit the
thumbs up button if you like me running
benchmarks I guess anyway though I chose
the comparison CPUs that I chose for
instance the 1800 X versus the 8700 K
specifically because of the price so the
1800 X you can easily find it for about
400 bucks right now 8702 k we're
expecting to be just about that same
price maybe a little bit less and the
argument you could make there is there's
other AMD rise and eight core CPUs that
you can get for this chip is 300 bucks
and you can overclock any of those to
perform pretty much equivalent with the
1800 X anyway now the 1600 X you can
find for about 200 bucks and it is also
a solid competitor for the i5 8400
overall I would say that Intel single
core performance advantage is definitely
still there nothing has changed as far
as going from KB Lake to coffee Lake the
architecture is supposed to be pretty
much the same apart from refinements and
we don't necessarily refine see
refinements make significant performance
improvements unless it's just something
like running at a higher frequency and
that's pretty much what they're doing so
as might be expected in situations where
single core performance takes the lead
which it does in a lot of games and was
demonstrated at least
some of the games that I showed off
today you'll see better performance out
of Intel's coffee League CPUs but all
around you can get very close to that
performance with AMD's rise and lineup
as well so it does beg the question what
are you planning to do with the system
that you're building if you're planning
to focus on gaming and a lot of people
are and that was one of the big reasons
to recommend a 7700 K even after the
rise and stuff launched was well that's
probably going to be your best bet
8700 K is now probably for now and the
near future going to be clearly the
go-to chip when it comes to building a
mid to high end gaming system and the
fact that you can now take advantage of
six cores and twelve threads compared to
four cores and eight threads that we've
had prior to now means the games that
take advantage of those threads are
going to benefit and also it's gonna
help with doing things like gaming and
streaming at the same time I didn't do
gaming and streaming testing today I'll
sit into overclocking testing today
mainly because I wanted to do that wide
breadth of comparison versus several
different see if you line up so that was
my choice I will hopefully be coming
back to those topics very soon as well
but that's pretty much all the time I
have for today's video you guys I really
hope you've enjoyed it I need to get
some sleep or something like that
because I've had to delay arctic panther
girl for like several days to take care
of this and that's been weighing on me I
want to get back to that very soon but
thanks so much again for watching this
video guys if you did enjoy it of course
it thumbs up button on your way outs and
leave a comment in the comment section
let me know what you think about Intel's
new CPU options and also let me know if
you're considering building a new system
soon what platform you think you're
gonna go with are you gonna go with
Intel's new mainstream Z 370 stuff
you're gonna go with the AMD mainstream
like an X 370 or B 350 and a rise in CPU
the choice is yours I think if you're
gonna do workstation stuff the rise in
CPUs are still gonna be the best bang
for your buck and the option to go with
but that's that's all I should say for
this video thanks again for watching
guys we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
