it's built for mini ITX water-cooled

if you get one Josh might just show up
for your house randomly fractal design
to find Nano as is small quiet and built
for mini ITX water-cooled systems just
like this one but if you get one watch
out because frankly josh might just show
up at any minute note Kyle's full of
 oh well I was immersive and pulse
still Nigeria we've been here for like
an hour
dudes get the hell outta here excellent
what's up guys and welcome to my build
video for July I planned out all these
parts at the beginning of this month in
my July builds video so check that out
and stay tuned for my August builds
video where I'm gonna have a couple more
builds for you and you can help me
decide which one I will put together for
next month links to all these parts is
down in the description below and
there's also a like button down there
you should click that if you enjoy
monthly build videos okay let's go over
all these parts before we move on to me
actually assembling the thing this is a
$1,200 build would be awesome for PC
gaming and VR by the way and the case is
going to be the NZXT s340 this is the
black and red version and I'm told this
is a slightly new revision with some
upgrades so I'll show you guys what
those are of course we need a processor
so that's going to be the Intel Core i5
6600 K the most reasonably priced
overclockable quad core Intel processor
yeah that's reasonable to pool it we
have the crown rig h7 because these
unlock versions of the Intel processors
don't come with coolers this is a very
nice air cooler looks pretty sweet so me
about 35 bucks for our motherboard we
have the MSI z170a gaming m3 which is a
sort of mid-range z170 board has all the
features we need it's black and red that
matches you know and Elstein what else
do you need from a motherboard and it's
MSI so it'll match with the graphics
card which is right up here this is the
msi geforce gtx 1070 probably the most
expensive part of this build but well
worth it because it's a very powerful
graphics card and msi is cooler on this
one does a really good job
i already tested it in sli so if you
want to check that video out i'll put
linked to it via a card in the top right
hand corner power supplies EVGA 650 GQ
650 watt power supply gets a job done
pretty quiet
all black cabling partially modular -
I'll see one finally we have our memory
and our storage and these are actually
slightly different from the parts in the
parts list just for the sake of putting
this together not too much different but
this the SanDisk Ultra - 960 gig though
actually got on Amazon Prime day for
like a hundred and sixty-five bucks
it was a really good deal I don't think
it's available anymore so anyway this is
a stand-in it's still black and red so
it'll still match and then for memory
instead of a red with black accents 2 by
8 gig kit I have a black with red
accents 4 by 4 gig kit so it's still the
same amount of memory just two more two
more sticks and it's black but still
g.skill ripjaws 5 so yeah it'll get the
point across anyway those are the parts
I'm going to build them into a computer
so let me quickly run down the updates
to the s340 case here first off the
ever-so-popular cable management bar
very distinct right here to manage
cables has been made a little bit
narrower by about 5 millimeters this is
to allow for thicker radiators so such
as the kraken X 41 you can now fit it up
and up you can you can fit it in there a
little bit more easily which is always
helpful the next update is on the bottom
the power supply filter at the bottom
has been upgraded so I'm guessing they
maybe made the plastic pull this
fruitier or just sort of redesigned it
to made it make it more sturdy more easy
to actually pop on and off and again it
goes on and off pretty easily there so
that's nice and finally we have a PCIe
slot base cover that has been added
which honestly I'm not a hundred percent
sure what that means because I do not
have that much familiarity with the
original s340 the original s340 had a
gap though here so I'm told
and this this was redesigned in the
Razer version of this case first so I
mean things look pretty cleaned out here
as far as I can tell you do have this
panel here which can be shifted back and
forth this this little slot panel and
and remove it too if you want that I
mean everything's pretty tight you down
here so can you guys in the comments let
me know what is different about this
compared to the original s340 because I
can't really tell
you
you
you
and the build is complete let me just
wrap up with some closing thoughts here
guys and some comments on how this build
went I really really liked how it turned
out especially these being all
off-the-shelf parts it's kind of got you
know the black main color red as a
secondary and then some white accents
and highlights in there as well even
goes very well with the red LEDs and the
white LEDs on the MSI graphics card
which I think in this situation is
actually a perfect combination of course
this white LED on the msi 1070 can turn
RGB but I think white it's probably
going to be the best option for it as
far as the case I figured out
I believe what they were talking about
with PCI Express brackets there's an
extra piece it kind of goes vertically
right here just provide some cover
instead of a gap now you just remove it
to install graphics card so probably
depending on the graphics card since
this is a taller one I did have to pop
that off to remove it but all-in-all
just kind of cleans up the back I
believe the prior rigged h7 seems to be
doing a really good job everything's
really quiet right now I haven't
installed Windows yet I will be
installing Windows 10 and doing a few
basic tests to give you guys some
performance and following up on that
with another video but installation for
the cry rig was not bad at all
especially if you've installed an
aftermarket CPU cooler before it's got a
plastic base plate and you got to kind
of poke the screws through you do have
to screw the thing in from the back of
the motherboard which is a little bit
less convenient but it does give you the
option to
actually not remove the fan I guess you
could you could go that route if you
wanted to
other than that though I think anyone
who happens to get this particular set
up and build this particular system will
be very happy with it I'm expecting it
to be very powerful as well if I was to
do anything different with this build I
probably take this hundred and forty
millimeter fan from the top and move it
to the front right now there's no front
intake so it definitely has negative air
pressure I think it's still going to
work fine but that's just something I
would do out of preference I know guys
let me know what you think of this build
and if any of you are planning to build
it - give me a thumbs up if you enjoyed
this video thank you so much for
watching stay tuned I'll be back with
more very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
