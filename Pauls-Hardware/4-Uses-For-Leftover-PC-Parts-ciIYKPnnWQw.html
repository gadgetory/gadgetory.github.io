I have this pile of leftover stuff that
I didn't use and sure I could just push
it all to the side and let it pile up in
the corner of my garage like some
increasingly dangerous fire hazard but
today I thought I'd figure out some
better options
so here are four uses for those parts
that are left over after a PC build is
finished the first item on my list is
drive cages because chances are your
case has a few that you just didn't need
though they're clumsy and they can block
air flow when they're actually installed
in a case I think they have a certain
beauty all on their own and with just
some string and tape and some other
stuff like that you can have your very
own drive cage hanging mobile or mobile
mobile anyway that's great for a kid's
room or as a conversation piece in the
study just watch out for those sharp
edges while you're putting it together
next up are all those boxes that the
products came in now you don't want to
just toss these because many retailers
require you to return the box and the
product if you need to send the product
back for an RMA take advantage of that
big-ass case box that your case came in
though do a little bit of Russian
nesting doll action to fit these smaller
boxes into larger boxes and the larger
boxes into the case box and there you go
you have a nice compact storage system
for all of your retail boxes I recommend
hanging onto all of the boxes for your
builds for at least a month after the
build is finished and then of course
still keep the case box even after that
so you can use it to safely transport
your PC in the future now you're bound
to also end up with a couple slot covers
and a bunch of screws and other small
items after your build is complete and
you should remember to keep and cherish
all of them just remember future builds
future builds needs screws and maybe
they need these screws right here these
specific ones and I'm like they unlike
their screw daddy I like like watch over
them and I keep them safe and I can't
let them down I will eventually find a
use for every single one of these screws
and until then they are stored in my
safe and secure screw storage system
which is always very organized now you
might say Paul that's that's way too
many screws and the things in here
you're never going to use those all in
PC builds and you might be right but
trust me the satisfaction you get when
you need just that one black PCI slot
cover and you know
got like four or five to choose from
it's just a very good feeling
and lastly modular power supplies are
all the rage these days but it's kind of
the point with a modular PSU that you
won't actually use all your modular
cables rather than keeping them in
whatever silk and cashmere storage bag
they came with for long term why not
take up cable sleeping just think with
this small tool at about 50 hours a week
a free time for the next month to six
months you could become a cable sleeping
master customizing your rig with style
and custom color choices maybe some
paracord sleeping in there i sleeved a
full power supply once it floods me with
with awesome memories of happiness no
regrets
it wasn't time-consuming at all and
those are my four uses for those parts
that are always left over after a PC
build is finished guys I really hope you
enjoyed this quick little video and if
you did of course make sure to hit that
like button on your way out links to
very many important things are also down
in the description so check that out too
thank you so much for watching and we'll
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
