every PC build but memory should know
its place a vex ear had the audacity to
send over this raid in series kit of
ddr4 memory and it's left me flustered
quite frankly with its flashy plasma
lighting and brazenly provocative design
as tempted as I may be to simply stare
at these delectable bins for hours on
end and transfer their whoa no no I will
resist because I made this channel to
bring you guys the truth so here are
four reasons while you definitely should
not buy fancy memory like a vex Raiden
series reason number one is fancy
packaging fancy packaging is useless
despite the clean design and appealing
minimalism of the Raiden retail box the
fact is that it could be delivered in a
brown paper bag as long as he SD
shielding was present of course and the
kit would work just the same some might
argue that the presentation such as this
hints at the quality of the product
within others might find that the slow
and meticulous undressing of their new
RAM is just a tantalizingly sensual
affair just kind of exciting to have
your fingers gently caress each subtle
curve and crevice of each module I'm
definitely not impressed though that's
the point okay I might have taken a
picture and posted it on my Instagram
and said I was impressed when I first
got the box but that was temporary and
I'm not anymore reason number two is
size size matters or so I'm told
ram height should be a short and
childlike as possible to allow for
disgustingly huge air coolers so the
real star of the show the CPU anything
more is just gratuitous so looking at
these Raiden modules with their enormous
size truly generous proportions
indulgently all you might say erect
sticks that just seem to stand there
like hey what do you think of all this
it just kind of makes you wonder if
it'll even fit that's never stopped me
from trying though there was that speed
yes of course
ludicrous speed extra RAM speed is
pointless sure you might get a
millisecond or two faster response time
or a half a percentage point better
score and your favorite system benchmark
but sensible PC builders know that the
minimum speed
21:33 for ddr4 is perfectly adequate and
going beyond that is silly and not even
really officially sanctioned by Intel
and this kit ddr4 3000 with C 16 timings
I mean Jerry you could brag to your
friends about your tight timings and how
your memory works day and night like
some kind of machine just relentlessly
pumping as much data as possible with
every clock cycle probably barely even
breaking a sweat so maybe your friends
would be just a little jealous but
jealousy is bad so case closed and
number 4 of course is that plasma
lighting I mean seriously ever since
this RGB lighting craze exploded it
seems like every manufacturer wants to
shove some LED festooned monstrosity
down our throats
I'm sure the radians may have plasma
lighting which is not LED it is fairly
unique in the PC landscape and though I
may have been choked with nostalgia when
I first powered them on and maybe with
the lightest touch of my finger I was
eight years old again gazing in
childlike wonder at a mysterious glowing
plasma orb at the Discovery Science
Center so now I felt no real connection
or need to have this be part of my life
I mean who wants to feel the simple and
innocent joy of childhood warming a
callous and icy heart long thought
incapable of love certainly not me so
with my four points proven I think the
best thing will be for me to keep this
ddr4 kit out of the hands of anyone who
might be misled by its flashy allure you
know it's already installed in the test
bed I could probably just leave it there
that's all for this video though guys I
tried to have a little fun with it so
your feedback as always as much
appreciated let me know if you enjoyed
by hitting that like button or leaving
me comments links to this Ram kit as
well as my a store where you can buy
shirts are down in the description too
thanks for watching as always and we'll
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
