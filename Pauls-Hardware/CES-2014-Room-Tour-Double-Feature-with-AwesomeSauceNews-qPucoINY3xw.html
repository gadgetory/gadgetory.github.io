we just got here and this is my room
tour I love Jessica I'll just got
finished washing his hands I did because
he was dirty no not now he's not dirty
anymore excellence there's me i'm using
my phone alright here's our room this is
at the cosmopolitan we're here for an
AMD events that's going on tomorrow on
Sunday right now it's Saturday just got
here here's the bathroom look they give
you headphones or something towels
mirror of course toilets in here and
over here we have the shower which has a
window through to the bedroom they seem
to really like doing this for this as
you can see there's no nothing to
obstruct the view it's just it's just
great that I was more concerned about
somebody being in a shower and possibly
having some issues there but kyle has
already gone ahead and disrobed and now
I will continue the tour into the next
room why even though it's early in the
evening Kyle has decided that's just
vulgar Kyle you should really really
cover yourself we covered up the minibar
because there's just so much stuff here
we don't want to be tempted and then we
found out it's actually wired up there's
a cable at the back so apparently they
they know if you even like remove any of
this from from the from the tray so
we're just going to keep that covered up
there got some ice ice can of course
mini fridge down here and I don't know
if you guys can even see this oh yeah
it's just full like we can add nothing
to this every spot is taken up so good
deal mini fridge you can have a bunch of
drinks TV was playing football when we
got in I was kind of weird kyle has now
assumed the fetal position which we
didn't expect to see this early in the
trip but there it is there's my bed over
there more mirrors and then out here is
our view
glorious glorious view we're looking
south so we can wait I think that South
no yeah south so we can see the Mandalay
Bay out there so those reflections back
into the room windows don't open
unfortunately but decent view that's all
for this room tour we do have one more
room we're staying in over at the palms
so maybe I'll show you that one too
alright guys this is part two of my las
vegas videos alright this is the other
room tour i'm going to give my camera a
moment to focus we've moved over to the
palms we're actually at palms place
which i think is like an offshoot a
hotel or maybe they need a more room
plenty of storage space over here red
closets that don't open they're locked
why are they trying to keep us out of
our closets oh there we go okay it's too
dark for you guys to see anything anyway
okay moving right along let's check out
the bathroom ah mirrors excellent we
have another shower although it looks
like the shower does not provide
visibility over into the main room there
is some smoked glass which looks mostly
opaque so hopefully that's okay all
right moving right along there's me
hello it's monday by the way we've had a
long day already here's the toilet sweet
pea oh there's a there's a television in
the bathroom I always find that useful
it means you could actually like watch
TV while you're taking a shower sweet
alright moving out here we got a
kitchenette that's kind of nice actually
like full-on well there's the mini bar
which once again eh I guess this just
must be what they always do now they
just pack it full of everything so you
cannot put anything of your own okay but
they're nice here they've given you two
refrigerators so you also have an icebox
aah ice no ice in the ice box but at
least we actually have space where we
can chill some beverages that's always
nice we got a little cooktop right here
microwave sink all stainless steel
appointments a little table right there
so that's cool
again apologize for the darkness right
now but you know that's how it is Cal's
over here taking his clothes off again
that's just what he does in my room to
her videos more lights lots of mirrors
they did decide I mean apart from the
shower which I guess you can't really
see through they gave us a king size bed
for both of us don't know what kind of
message they're trying to send but we
got flat screen to know we got two TVs
this room has three televisions in it
they're really going all out for this I
suppose all right i mean this light
turns on yeah lights that's better and
you guys can see better now as long as
my phone keeps readjusting all right
then we got a decent view again here's
Kyle this is rippling back muscles and
then Kyle's stuff another light and a
pretty some view we're not looking
towards a strip or anything but
definitely a nice wide open thing and
what looks like it should be a balcony
but I'm pretty sure this is locked and
they won't let us go out there because
you know in Vegas they don't trust you
to be in a high-rise lord knows why okay
so that is going to be all for this room
tour video and this is the only other
room that we're staying in in Las Vegas
so that's all going to be all for this
video we're doing so much here in Las
Vegas that I don't know if I'm gonna be
able to post any more videos but hope
you guys have enjoyed this one room
