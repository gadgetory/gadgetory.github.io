today
I like how to do it's because I drank
wine last night and I haven't done that
for quite a while but today's video is
gonna be a little different than normal
we're gonna go through a bit of a day in
my life but I wanted to start off by
talking about something like some
philosophy on tuck let's talk philosophy
with you guys for a second I personally
believe that you should clean up after
yourself
I believe people should clean up after
themselves has to do with personal
responsibilities if you make a mess you
should clean it up all that said I am
gonna hire someone else to clean our
house so so kind of servers like it
before shots we're not getting house
cleaned today we're getting a house
cleaned soon though Joe's here today I
actually have something important to do
first there's my wife she's sleeping
with the baby on the couch so we're
gonna try not to wake her she's been
watching house hunters you know how many
House Hunters episodes there are it's an
absolutely insane amount priority one is
I need to post a video not this video
that you're watching a different one
because I haven't posted one yet today
Joe is here because we're shooting a
different video and I typically take the
edits that he does and I load them up
here at home but he's not always here to
watch me do that
Joe was really tired too though because
he only got like three hours of sleep
last night and why he was top dog he was
dog sitting I don't want to bring that
up
hey wait maybe that's why this video
might be a little up but here we go
loading up hooking up another project
only 900 megabytes a second
usually will go up the fashion that I do
love transferring between drives on this
computer though discrepant do to edit
Joe did a great job okay alright
edit is good to go we're gonna leave
that surrender we have other stuff to do
Hana is just chilling in her little
chicken onesie look at her chicken
onesie there's chickens all over it yeah
baby she's she's very engaged right here
somehow this is all related to getting
ready for having house cleaners come to
clean our house but this is the lamb
eleven dynamic case in white Jeb used
for quite some time not in several
builds I've been using it for testing
but I originally got this when it was an
early version and one of the problems
with the early versions was this lower
piece for the front tempered glass which
sits right there basically it's a it's a
metal piece that's got some adhesive on
it with some tabs that sits down into a
slot right there the adhesive was
failing on earlier units basically this
I have removed and used several
different methods to attempt to reattach
it which was only partly successful but
I came out here the other day and the
whole panel had fell enough and down to
the ground fortunately didn't shatter
because the top adhesive has failed now
as well so the top switch has touched
this little piece right there holds it
in place and that just just fell off so
like I said lammle I'm pretty sure when
they addressed the failing adhesive for
the bottom of this they must have also
addressed it for the top I hope that is
the case the point for me at least is
that I'm not gonna use this case anymore
for the time being
so I'm decommissioning it I also need to
pull this test bed out of here because
there's a good chance I'm gonna be doing
some rise in 3000 series comparisons and
I definitely need until 300 series setup
to test and compare to and I'm gonna
continue to use this going to pull this
out switch it over to a test bed and put
some of this stuff
next we have this lg monitor which of
course I need to integrate into the set
so going to be replacing this one with
that one is this this that one's better
it is new monitors setup actually kind
of guy I kind of like this here cuz it's
curved hey kirb so it gives me a little
bit more space a little bit more access
to the controls down there oh look it's
after 5:00 it's quittin time my beer job
alright so yesterday did not quite go as
planned it was a good day but the stuff
I wanted to get done as far as getting
the house ready didn't really happen and
now it's Wednesday morning I'm still
dealing with like the remnants of
yesterday which includes a pie ology
that we had after awesome hardware I
also went to lunch with MSI which was
glorious day we actually had some sushi
it was wonderful but they they gave me
this so I got a Meg x5 78 to use for the
AMD stuff that's coming out also these
packages arrived three boxes actually
very important boxes I opened them to
double-check what was inside but I can't
show you guys the contents quite yet so
that will be coming in a future video
and the site also gave me a Lucky Dragon
this is for Hana I thought that was very
thoughtful of them anyway here is now
here to supervise the last-minute
frantic remainder of the cleanup of this
whole house area because our house
cleaning service is arriving like
literally in less than an hour oh and it
sounds like Hana needs and help me too
he's lucky gonna be friends with lucky
now ah they're best friends now well the
cleaning service came they just left a
little while ago and everything is so
clean I just like I can't even I can't
even look there's the kitchen this was
what I ended up doing with all the stuff
that's I couldn't do anything with but
piled it up so could at least get out of
their way here's here's like our dining
room here's the living room area couch
covers currently getting washed
there's Huey who like to make things
messy again yeah everything's just real
nice and tidy they did a great job
they also cleaned up in the back of the
house which I don't need to bother
giving you guys a tour of but everything
is clean and it only took him like a
couple hours and now we can do other
things with the rest of the day it's
Thursday now and I guess when I meant
yesterday by doing other stuff ended up
being looking after my daughter a little
bit more and spending some more time
making dinner and stuff yesterday but I
think this video is actually turning
into a pretty good representation of
like it I'm more of like an average week
that we have here especially now that we
do have a daughter and everything I made
a list of stuff that I only got part way
through with I had at least one moment
of panic whereas like there's too much
stuff to do I can't do it all and now I
get to share with you guys what I like
to call my some of my domestic duties
here at home gonna be gonna be
lubricating the plumbing cleaner and
some pipes up gonna do work in the
bathroom so we have two bathrooms this
is the second one that's kind of the
guest bathroom I guess it's not a huge
bathroom or anything but it's got a tub
so this is where washed baby and stuff
problem being the sink here draining
very slowly been doing that for a while
it mean to fix it I meant to do it
before the cleaning service came but
we're gonna handle that right now I
guess first things first I gotta clear
out everything down here and interesting
stuff when you clean out the bathroom
like I rarely rarely ever wear contacts
these days but I do have some contact
lens solution good through August 2010
here's our situation we got the existing
copper piping which I'm pretty sure they
just added this connector piece to in
order to set up this little vanity I'm
gonna remove this
probably replace it and what is caught
up in here is probably going to be
really gross geez please oh yeah I'm
gonna shave aha sometimes is David here
we've got some nasty pieces down here
that are fairly clogged I'm gonna try to
find replacements for most of them or
maybe all of them at the same time we're
trying to do a little snake through the
you been there to see if we can clear
any gunk that's out and that and we
might try to find a better solution for
that but all this means we need to run
to the hardware store
oK we've got the new sink pop-up we get
the extension we got a hair snake here
which we'll use instead of my real snake
that I can't find to hopefully clean out
the you bend and then plumbers pipe now
engage in lightening quick bathroom fix
starting this is how it goes together
the way I like to think about plumbers
play is to think of it like thermal
pastes like putting on a CPU and make a
little snake of it make a little gasket
down there and then it's gonna compress
and fill in all the gaps just like
between your heatsink and your CPU and
the entire explanation I just stole from
Joe I know my snakes not long enough
area sorry it got longer some definite
trial and error with this installation
but after some intrepid work I think
we're at least at the point where we
have this downspout connected I am now
going to tighten that lower nut on there
with these look at this
hey I was about to turn the water on and
do a test but I should probably put this
in first that's good okay
success good theoretically assuming
there's no further leaks so I'm
basically a plumber now the total costs
of the hardware that I used for that fix
is $44 and some change so that was
probably less expensive than calling the
plumber and I'm happy and proud of
myself thanks Joe for helping with that
you guys might have noticed this mosaic
blur that's going on down here because
I've gotten to the point where I can't
show you guys what I'm working on next
it's very exciting
setting up the testbed right here maybe
a throw I guess up there as to what the
heck this is down in the comment section
down below thank you guys so much for
watching this video
I'll be back actually with a lot of
really interesting concept I think
coming up in the next week or two
so this gloves up button and subscribe
if you're not already we'll see you guys
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
