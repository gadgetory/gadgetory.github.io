to you by gigabyte Coolermaster team
group and Thermaltake okay guys I'm a
g.skill I always like to stop by here
because they always have a unique
display and some cool builds we're gonna
take a look at those in a second at
first this is their new flagship product
this is in development so it's not quite
ready to go yet but this is the transi
royal RGB so the next step in their
tread NZ RGB series it's got either gold
or platinum I imagine all other forms of
precious metals it's gonna be on the
outside heat spreader very shiny very
reflective and then it's got a faceted
plastic top that's sort of refract the
RGB LEDs underneath as you can see it's
kind of projecting up on the top here to
show you kind of the effect that it
might have in the case this is so
exclusive they only have one of them
right now they told us that they are
being handmade like expert artisans
somewhere Holdaway here in Taiwan and
that they might have more of these later
in the week so if we have a chance maybe
I'll tweet out a picture of these if we
come back here towards the end of the
week cuz they said they're gonna have an
actual for dim setup and that will
probably look even more impressive than
this one does right now
still no word yet on like speeds timings
and all that kind of thing but if you
want to spend a lot of money on memory
and people look at and be like wow that
memory must've been pretty expensive
I think the royal RGB Triton C is gonna
do the trick aside from that though if
you want something that's maybe a little
bit more reasonable
I pull the Linus I haven't done that
these are okay right okay I got through
I got the thumbs I thought these were
stuck usually they're stuck to the thing
sorry for pulling the Linus there these
are the Ares kits of memory g.skill has
been working on these for a while
because they wanted some low profile
because a lot of their memory kits are
not very low-profile but oftentimes
especially if your air cooling you want
low profile memory so the Ares X kit
they're finally nearing the end of
development it's got a nice accent on
the sides I think it looks pretty clean
pretty nice it's available in this black
finish here they also have white they
also have red still in development just
like the Royal RGB Triton Z so expect
these to come out around q3 or q4 of
this year I don't know how far I've set
them back by dropping and potentially
destroying this gear
I'm gonna escape quickly so they don't
get mad at me memory overclocking is a
kind of a niche category but for people
who are always interested in how far and
how fast memory can be pushed here's an
example right here
5060 hit 66 megahertz ddr4 cast latency
21 this is a 2 by 8 gigabyte kit and
this speed last year they had to ln2
cool in order to run at this speed and
these timings now that got a kid in
there
even with RGB they're fitting the RGB
signal in there too
and it's they're cool and it works not
potentially going to be available at
retail anytime soon this is a gift that
they set up here to say look here's what
we can do next up g.skill wanted to
tighten up those timings if anytime you
see really fast memory but you know the
timings are listed why can't you tighten
the timings up these skills so here's a
40 600 megahertz kit 8 gig by 4 so they
got 4 dims in their test latency 18 it's
pretty impressive there's another 16 gig
kit two by eights this front this is
running at 4700 speed Cathleen c19 and
then finally the slash get down here
this is in a pretty sweet-looking
water-cooled red and black system 48
hundred megahertz kit 16 gig 8 by 2
castle agency 17 tight timings fast
speeds and G skill sets these up to demo
them and then they put them in
development and eventually they'll
actually sell retail kits with these
same speeds and timing
I think what's even harder than making
fast memory on a full-sized Tim is
making fast memory on SO did the smaller
memory sticks the slot into laptops so
they have two setups here this one is
actually running in a laptop at 3466
speed guess latency 18 and that's in a
laptop this is a little asrock for the
XP 99e - ITX and in order to fit poor
way ddr4 they used som slots on here 42
hundred megahertz cache latency 18 on
this kit and this is a 32 gig 4 by 8 kit
this is only going to be able to run at
this speed on this platform so kind of a
unique use case maybe not as practical
for people actually on a buy it for a
laptop but the fact that they're able to
get this memory running at this speed
and finally some memory specifically
made for risin risin can be very finicky
with higher memory speeds but Rison also
really likes higher memory speeds so
here on the Left we have a pregnancy RGB
kit also got the Liam a screamer in
there it's kind of fun 4000 megahertz
gasoline C 18 this kit will slot into a
Rison system and just run at that speed
it's only this kit though it's not
available at retail but in developments
hopefully sooner you'll be able to buy
that you can get rise and dedicated
memory from g.skill it's part of their
player x-series and also of course
they've got our GB kits that work as
well just got to make sure you get the
ones with the Samsung V dies and finally
one more kits ddr4 16 gigs 8 by 2 4000
mega its gasoline 220 also inner aizen
system so very fast the Infinity fabric
you'll love if you run your memory at
this speed I have one last thing to show
you and it was built by der Ballard look
at the bear up there he's looking very
happy with himself isn't he that's cuz
he built this system right here this
system is insane
first off specs it's a 1970 900 X and
MSI X to 99 gaming Pro carbon AC and a
gtx 750ti
but what is more unique is the way this
system is being cooled there's some
special 3m fluid that's down in the
bottom that is the entire motherboard
and graphics card is immersed in that
fluid boils at 60 degrees Celsius so
much lower boiling point than water also
it's non conductive thankfully since
there's micronics running it what
happens is the components heat up the
liquid boils evaporates it condenses on
this condenser unit at the top and then
there is an actual liquid cooling loop
that's connected to that runs down to
the back and disperses the heat through
a radiator so it's actually transferring
the heat from the
through this open space in this sealed
chamber collecting it there and then
dispersing it I have never seen a
computer cooled in this fashion before I
think it's absolutely bananas devour
great job on this and guys at home if
you like this build hit the thumbs up on
this video I also want to say a big
thank you to my sponsors for coputex
2018 team group coolermaster Thermaltake
and gigabyte guys if you want to see
more videos hit that subscribe button
hit the thumbs up and I'll see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
