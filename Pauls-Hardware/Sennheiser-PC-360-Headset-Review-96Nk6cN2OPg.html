I'm going to be doing a review that's
right a review of this sennheiser
headset PC 360 so first off this
headsets actually been out for quite
some time now at least three or four
years not currently available everywhere
I've seen them come and go on Newegg
this is like a little bit of a nostalgic
review but if you are looking for newer
versions of this sennheiser has come out
with a PC 350 the game won the game zero
and the PC 360 3 D which is the direct
successor to this headset you can still
find this one it's it was about $250
originally at retail but you can find it
discounted at times I've seen it for as
little as 150 bucks but that might have
been more back around Black Friday time
now as far as accessories there's really
not a whole lot to speak of basically in
the box you get the headset that's just
about it you get a rubber cable here a
rubber coated cable which is just shy of
10 feet long it's got gold-plated 3.5
inch microphone and headphone jacks
there on the end and then for
specifications you have a 15 to 20,000
Hertz frequently frequency response
range 50 ohm impedance get a mic
frequency response range of 50 Hertz to
16,000 Hertz and finally a 2 year
manufacturer's warranty from Sennheiser
now the headset itself physically
speaking is fairly large which is good
for me because I have a slightly larger
than average head or so I've been told
you also have 300 gram weight which is
pretty lightweight also very flexible
the plastic housing on the outside it
does maintain a lot of flexibility and
it's hollow on the inside so again
fairly lightweight now it's still very
sturdy though so very nice build quality
throughout it's got sort of a matte
black finish as you can probably see
right there
silver logos so you got like the
sentence hi sennheiser name on the top
as well as a game logo g4m e PC 360
there on the sides as well as a sort of
an M lay there on one of the ear cups
it's got an open design so that your
cups here are open on the back which
will let ambient noise through which
means I can hear when my wife is calling
for me while I'm playing video games you
also got a bit of metal grilling there
on the back
of the ear cups and that adds a little
bit of protection there for the drivers
themselves and on the left ear cup over
here as you can probably see is where
the boom mic lives so the moon might
first of all has a flip-up design so you
can tuck it up there out of the way and
it will tell when it's been tucked up
out of the way and it will automatically
mute itself which is pretty intuitive
and keeps from you having to reach and
find a mute button it has a glossy
finish overall as well as a flexible
point here at the center so you can sort
of position it there to be closer to
your mouth not a whole lot of
flexibility but still better than
nothing the right ear cut features this
little knob here which is on ear volume
control so you just reach up and twist
that around to turn the volume up or
down I find it's very intuitive once you
get used to the placement and much much
much preferred to an inline sound
control mechanism because I really don't
like those they just tend to get in the
way the your caps themselves are large
XXL according to Sennheiser they are
oval-shaped which works out pretty well
very very nice soft velvety fabric
covering all of them and it's padded so
it'll form around your ear I find
they're extremely comfortable there's
more plush fabric up here on the top of
the headrest and I managed to wear these
for hours and hours without even really
noticing that they're even there so a
very nice design overall very
comfortable and that's really what
you're looking for in a headset is the
comfort level so you can wear them for
long periods of time while you're gaming
as far as sound goes I want to point out
that I'm not really what you would call
an audiophile as as I guess they like to
call themselves these are probably the
nicest headphones or headset that I have
actually had the chance to have
extensive listening experience with so
these are kind of acting as my zero
points or so to speak when it comes to
talking about headsets or headphones but
basically I've been testing these with
the an Asus Xonar Phoebus sound card
well I've been using them extensively
with an Asus Xonar Phoebus sound card I
would recommend using a sound card with
these headsets or maybe a nice external
deck because that's where you're going
to get the best experience particularly
over onboard sound but they have very
solid bass it's detailed of that
necessarily being muddy or overpowering
it's not that crazy super bass you get
with some headsets but that is to my
preference I don't
like overpowering bass I like to be able
to hear all the different sounds mids
are fantastic as well excellent
reproduction of like vocals and
acoustics acoustic guitar in particular
I really really like listening to on
this headset and the highs are bright
without being too tinny or washed out or
anything like that so
excellent excellent sound overall and
lastly this review would not be complete
without a microphone test so here it is
I am testing the microphone on the
sennheiser headset pc 360 and that is
going to wrap it up for this video guys
once again this has been the Sennheiser
headset PC 360 a bit more higher-end
gaming headset but if you have the money
to afford it definitely some fantastic
performance particularly if you're
working with a discreet sound card if
you'd like to purchase this particular
