did you put the link in the videos I did
not know I'm gonna do that right now
though I'll have to update my
description too yes we should be live
though now so hey guys how's it going
and welcome to awesome hardware this is
a live show we talk about technology
mainly computers and gaming computers
and computer parts and we also drink a
beer part and we do occasionally use
foul language so adult language warning
if you have sensitive ears go watch
something else thank you guys for
joining us though this is gonna be
episode number 167 it is October 23rd
2018 and we are live - both twitch.tv
slash awesome hardware as well as my
youtube channel Paul site where we split
the show in half though so in about
30-40 minutes we'll switch over to
Kyle's half which was linked in this
video's description as well as links to
all the stories we're gonna talk about
it's very well organized it is somehow
somehow we make it happen sometimes I'm
actually feeling relatively
well-organized you also do an
after-party at the end of the show which
we also streamed in both places and once
what is this going on oh she's saying
I'm out of focus focus just me
well I'm sure Paul this low and
perfectly crisp and I'm Marcy crisp
you're gonna have to punch in on me and
it's gonna make my physical big oh oh
earthquake this is California where I
was I was on a roll though for a second
though but that's talking about point
being how to look crispy thank you guys
for joining us if you're watching live
and cheers let's get started oh I did I
do have one more thing to mention if you
guys do enjoy the content that we
produce and you want help us out by
buying stuff go to pulsar Burnett and
you can buy stuff from my store so it's
all real nice it's quality quality stuff
quality items for
for for reasonable consumer friendly
prices indeed we have now restocked the
RGB everything shirts was a fan
submitted design that is has gained much
popularity so legendary shirt so I'll go
ahead and buy that if you buy awesome
hardware stuff we actually split the
profits the profits go to both of us so
don't worry if you're if you can't
decide whose store to buy from Moo
doesn't matter cows stores bit without
text slash store he also has a wide
range of high quality goods look at all
them hoodies news winter is coming
everyone should stock up on hoodies Sam
right also of course the glasses that
were drinking out of today and thanks to
all for all of you for your support
oh I was saying we do an after-party -
that's going to be the end we will also
stream that to twitch and YouTube
although it will be on a separate
YouTube stream and imagine when it'll be
on Kyle's channel this week and during
that time we will read off donation
comments and we also give shout outs to
people who buy stuff during the show ok
that's an intro right there yeah well
welcome to the tech news whoo let's talk
about the day so first off this has just
popped up in the last day or two and it
regards Intel in their 10 nanometer
manufacturing process which if you guys
follow tech news has taken there's been
a long time coming like since like 2015
they've been talking about it saying it
will come out like next year and then
every year they push it back you know
due to various reasons this articles
from PC gamer dotnet by Paul Lilly but
the original source of this is from semi
accurate calm a good old good old check
over there at semi accurate wrote this
article up and he is well known in the
industry although he's I don't know do
you do you have an opinion of Chuck
Charlie I guess I don't really know as
charlie or his I'm not really familiar
with you she was at the in the Intel
event in New York did we have a
conversation with him at some point no
not really
okay but anyway um Fury's great he does
have some insider connections in the
industry and so he writes articles like
this which is saying that Intel is
killing off its 10 nanometer
manufacturing process
article that's what the articles titles
it says Intel just pulled the plug and
they're struggling
and nanometer process this is sourced
from his moles within Intel itself I
guess reasons stated are the increased
cost of the 10 nano your manufacturing
process as well as continued commercial
viability of 14 nanometer products until
of course being a business that makes
money you know if you've got a product
that you're making good money on why
bother to change it swap stuff out
especially it's the thing you're
swapping out for is more costly and
makes you less money so anyway Intel has
responded so this must be included I'm
not trying to say specifically the 10
nanometer is dead I don't know how to %
go along with what Charlie's saying
there but Intel has published a response
to this and I think this is because the
article took off a little bit when it
comes to people discussing it online in
other work otherwise Intel said though
media reports published today that Intel
is ending work on the 10 nanometer
process are untrue we are making good
progress on the nanometer yields are
improving consistent with the timeline
we shared during our last earnings
report so for various reasons in
Sellwood would do that
the main one being rumors like this can
affect stock prices and investors
typically don't like that what they mean
by consistent with the timeline at least
the most recent information that Intel
has come out and stated as far as their
roadmap is holiday 2019 is when they
plan to have 10 nanometer cannon Lake
products shipping and on unmask it's at
such a point what is going on here what
what what that's all that's what's
what's what Oh links this shouldn't be
there though I don't know this is being
those come Fri don't know why that's
going in there was it's pushing stuff
down I have no idea what was that there
a second ago
no what I didn't put it there
is someone in here it's it's probably
heavier sell or no what are you doing do
it in their cells fine worry about it
hey sell I
thanks for being here cells are
moderator
he's gathering donation comments okay
moving on though busted so I mean to
answer the question like if if this has
been reported it's dead until suss no
it's not that we're still working on it
is it that is it not that I you could
maybe take a ins word for it
dr. Ian Catrice from from a non tech yep
he said he thinks the question is if
Intel's current nano meter is the same
10 nano meter that they described last
year mmm
because you can stick a 10 nanometer
label on anything and still say it's on
track people have come have have
critiqued the AMD seven nanometer
process and said there's aspects of it
that actually aren't 7 nanometre what's
teeny comes to rice at the event that
they yeah that's I forget what that
stands for specifically but it's a it's
an industry event okay but yeah so so
the speculation is if there is some
information that Charlie has hearing
that's enough for him to write an
article about this maybe they are making
changes maybe they're doing things
differently than where it was originally
planned
maybe because because when you talk to
Intel their statements are always well
our man you know it's not just a
difference of the manufacturing process
it's not just like well look at AMD
they've got 12 nanometer going and
they're supposed to have set at seven
nanometer soon it's more like Intel says
our designs are more complex right so
it's harder to implement it's not just
looking at the shrinking down at the
manufacturing process so are they
actually change are they changing stuff
from what they have been trying to what
they've been trying to make with Canon
like are they shifting that somehow or
is the product that they're now planning
to launch late next year going to be
different than what they were planning
six months ago I feel like that that's
just that's very possible when you keep
pushing something back when you're
pushing something back for that long I
mean you said starting what 2015 a lot
can happen within that three years or so
and so like that their their path that
they may have projected back then could
be changing you know as they adjust to
new new new instances in the market and
the competition stuff like that so what
are what would be an example of Ian's
statement here
if they did release if they put a 10
nanometer label on something does he
mean like maybe like a 10 nanometer
mobile trip worth don't necessarily like
a desktop processor that we're expecting
from them no I just see what he's
talking about when it when it comes to
the the intricacies of the chip design
that they're making something that is
maybe still manufactured on send
animator process but maybe is a simpler
design or leaves certain stuff out I
mean there's no details this is it's all
speculation so right it's the question
is Intel says yes we're still on track
10 nanometers still fine we're gonna
launch products next year like we said
we're going to but yeah I mean the
question is why would Charlie write this
article I mean it could all be Charlie's
just bullcrap you know and he's somebody
or somebody tricked him and mislead him
or something like that poor Charlie this
is this is these are the the
possibilities we have to consider it
when it comes to rumors such as this but
well even even if you know Charlie's you
know article was semi accurate sorry I
think it's still good that you know
someone's holding a flame under Intel's
ass trying to get them back into the
business and and hold them to their word
of releasing 10 enemy there sooner than
later I think we've been waiting long
enough part of me thinks that despite
all the speculation and stuff that you
know 10 and meter yields have been shit
and it's been really difficult for Intel
part of me thinks that this is still
Intel and they know that they can still
sell really good product like you said
with 40 nanometer and they're still
making tons of money and maybe the lack
of competition from AMD in certain areas
not non-mo areas is is maybe maybe 10
nanometers like a secret weapon that
they're sort of sitting on for now they
don't want to show all their cards too
early and they're kind of just waiting
for it to maximize their profits and I
think I doubt that I might I might have
I might have thought that a year or two
ago but at this point I really don't
think that's the case because they're
talking about releasing late next year
and B is already talking about bringing
in 7 nanometre both to the CPU and GPU
side like probably stuff that they're
announcing it CES in January so any lead
that Intel had is quickly evaporating
and that's not good for them and and in
the long run so yeah I mean we have to
win so we have to wait and see what
happens but then your manufacturing
processes and everything though and just
because it's a you know tighter die
shrink doesn't necessarily or a note
shrink doesn't mean it's gonna be a
better chip well across the board you
know what I mean
yeah and but no yeah I think that's
that's very very possible that I feel
like in the last year or so Intel has
been feeling the heat from AMD and if if
they already had ten ten nanometer ready
to go they probably would have launched
it by now I think that's fair to say too
because they already have launched some
ten nanometer products but they've been
it's been like one yeah like one
notebook that like was impossible to
find so yeah and I think that was just
so they could meet some of their like
stated goals again because they're one
of those huge companies it has tons of
investors and lots of lots of other
stuff going on behind the scenes that
you aren't always aware of when it comes
to money money money my products that
they launch but let's move on uh next up
this is a video cards calm article also
a rumor we talked a little bit about a
possible polaris 30-day polaris re
refresh or 2/3 which might be coming out
soon potentially for the holidays I
don't know it's already late October so
something's coming that better come out
in the next month day I would expect
excuse me but this is an actual isus
product so there's kind of two aspects
to this story one being that Asus is
bringing back the ROG Strix brand name
for a Radeon rx card if this is to be
true because the name of the card is
Asus Radeon rx 590 ROG Strix gaming our
districts are excited athe gaming
AG indicating it's got eight gigabytes
of memory turning at 2,000 mega Hertz
which is the same speed the memory on
the 580 ran at it is possible since it's
running at a higher frequency the I
guess did you show this I think we
showed this last week this is a time spy
yes yes this is a time spy report for a
generic VGA card
the driver name is rx 590 and this one
actually has the frequencies and stuff
so GPU core clock is running at fifteen
forty five which is a decent step up
from the basement boost clock of the
standard five eighty which is twelve
fifty seven and 1340 a good two hundred
megahertz faster so based on that
speculation is that it's my it might be
twelve nanometer instead of 14 nanometer
so that could potentially help squeeze a
little bit of more performance or
efficiency or clock speed out of Polaris
since this is again the would be the
third version since the players already
started originally started with the 400
series and then they already refreshed
at once 500 series
I think anything else to add to the GPU
stack at that level would be good
especially if they reasonably priced and
a nice sort of maybe 300 ish 350 ish
dollar card that could pair up with like
a nice free sync monitor I think would
be a good thing to have there so you
know that you get less excited about the
refreshes because there's probably not
gonna be huge leaps forward but um
something to keep an eye out for well
we'll let you guys know if you hear
anything more on the RX 590 cool
meantime though this week it was here
yeah you need one cute it's in this
thing there would you like I'll have a
Newcastle good old Newcastle as rely all
right next up though so the 9900 K
launched last week along with the RT X
2070 9900 K though is what I'm talking
about
and we're gonna talk about some of the
reporting that's been done on it and
specifically how hot it can potentially
get so first off if you want to combat
the heat plate I should finish the first
view before it's good just splash a
little bit of little Simon thing I've
got to combat the heat then deleting has
been an option in the past but now we're
supposed to have soldered thermal
interface material or stim
so so here dear Bauer Roman did a video
where he deleted the 99 hundred K I
believe he's done this with several of
them and they're trying to get a better
analysis of the actual solder that's
being used or solder if you want to
pronounce the L solder salt solder no I
like the outside soldered I'm team Noel
yeah but yeah first off the deal living
tool just worked so issues with soldered
CPUs in the past has been they're
difficult more difficult to deal it and
it can potentially damage to see if you
die this doesn't seem to be the case
compliance so although it is solder and
it does seem to be more effective than
the crappy thermal interface material
they were using before it doesn't seem
to be all that great you know it's kind
of like mediocre solder
I guess does this mean dur Bower can
continue selling more of his deal
inmates like a later market isn't dead
yeah I mean they did the deal a dime
eight that he already makes is
compatible with this with these so they
will still work and it seems like even
though you're not gonna get as much of a
temperature drop still as you did before
like you could get good twenty degrees
before yeah now it seems like maybe ten
five to ten depending on your situation
it's still but he attempted to do a few
different things to make the situation
better he he tried to use a better
solder and I was talking about the
actual materials it's used in the solder
but um that actually didn't work
properly so he switched over to liquid
metal at using liquid metal he actually
had some pretty impressive performance
there's that's Posada right there that's
not liquid metal right yeah that is a
solder and then there's there's this I
haven't watched this one yet these parts
where he scrapes the solder off with
like a razor which is ballsy it yeah I
mean honestly I is that I mean how Baldy
is that like I don't know he's the other
solder that he used it didn't really
work properly who this is else infected
yeah like scraping oh my god that's
that's the heat spreader so that's not
to die but
that's the reason he's using I was also
couldn't tell what that was a little bit
scary there but anyway here's so here's
the deal it'd here's a successful deal
it when he went from stock and this is
ninety nine hundred K at four point
eight gigahertz at one point two five
volts crime ninety five ten minute test
sock was ninety three degrees
I'm just pretty warm delighted 84
degrees so that's uh this is also the
average temperature not peak he said it
was hitting peak so mmm never pretty
high up there so yeah that's a that's a
nine degree drop in average temperature
which is not bad but then the other
thing you noticed was looking at the PCB
itself it's actually thicker so the
night Hannah and her Kay uses a thicker
PCB kind of like I believe I don't think
I have to go back to the original
skylake was a had a thicker PCB so that
was kind of interesting but then he also
measured it and found that the the dye
itself is also stickers Wow 27
millimeters more than double under 9900
K and then he does this crazy thing
where I which I would not have even
thought to do it myself cuz dies to me
I've always been like like just you
don't touch that very delicate and yeah
I'm crack it or whatever like right
you're gonna have a hard time but the
but the functional stuff is actually on
the bottom it's towards the PCB side of
it so this is real and that top part of
the dice just for connecting not part of
the die is just like that's what they
build the that's what they build the
transistors on - mm-hmm so he went and
and started to to lap the die he used
well I've never even yeah la nube I've
never even heard of that well laughing
ding lapping is a method you might do to
the heat spreader to make the heat
spreader that lowered no not lower but
the smoothest possible surface okay so
there's a few pockets in whatever is
possible but no he's lapping the dye
itself like shaving it down
yeah shaving the top it's shaving the
dye down that's that's pretty bad um he
was he using I had it written down here
a second ago
that
that doesn't affect the IHS his ability
to like make contact with it if I don't
well do you know what I mean
he's he's also scraping like all they
all de paste off of that so I'm here to
here's his results though sure so stock
and this is also a different test he's
actually got at overclocked to five
gigahertz here at one point three five
volts stock listening 96.5 see deleted
with the conductor not liquid metals
eighty eight point five and then he
starts to get gets he basically drops
five degrees Celsius from there by
lapping the die down by by 0.2
millimeters which is and that's simply
because the IHS has now closer to the
actual it's because it's because the
efficiency of the top part of the die is
not as good as right as metal up against
it right so by shaving that down and
getting the heat spreader closer to the
functional parts all the transistors and
everything that are generating the heat
right is just allowing to more
efficiently transfer the heat gotcha
from the CPU off that's what I figured I
was just double-checking there was
nothing else going on so he was using 40
micrometer micro diamond polishing film
there to grind down the CPU die height
and he said theoretically you could lap
it down another point two millimeters so
you can go point four millimeters total
and that would make it the same height
as an 87 RDK although it's my knowledge
he has not updated this at this point I
don't know if he's planning and actually
doing that but I'm curious because as we
will continue to discuss right now are
you going oh all right I'm just checking
his videos to see if he's supposed to
know debar have posted an updated in
four days so we'll wait and see if
anyone follows it up what the 9900 kay
very hot did you notice it gets very hot
can um I did not because the only
testing I've done with it so far is with
a custom loop okay I had me really put
an ek pharmacy Evo block on it with 240
rad like a sixty millimeter thick one
and that's that's pretty much all I've
done so I my temps overclocked to five
gigahertz
I think it was at one point three five
was like it was operating like 54 C
so I was like it's not bad I haven't
tested it with any sort of you know
aftermarket cooler that's not a custom
loop so I can't really speak to my own
experience but what did you what did you
find on your end honestly my temperature
data it was not reliable and so I did
not include it in my video I'm actually
somewhat glad about because there were
varying reports about the temperatures
that these are running it yeah this
video from hardware and bucks hardware
box from our our friend Steve Stevie
from from Australia FIBO goes into this
because specifically is talking about
lioness but also tiny Tom Logan from OSI
3d reported thermals that were very
reasonable tiny Tom Logan here his 9900
K just default only hit 65 degrees
Celsius yeah oh he did an under hold on
it that didn't seem to change that
overclocked he only hit 79 degrees
Celsius but a lot of reviewers were
hitting like 90s and even hitting a
hundred and and potentially throttling
or seeing reduced performance depending
on your situation so hmm Steve attempted
to investigate this to figure out what
the heck was going on the did right yes
he did here here's for instance Linus's
results where you will know that a
ninety nine hundred k with two more
cores what's cooler cooler 8700 days
what was he cooling like hey I wonder if
they were using the same coolers if they
had ambience all in order - might have
that in his video but um interesting
yeah whereas a hardware unboxed gamers
Nexus quite a few other people start
very high temperatures I did not report
on temperatures in my video why were
using consistent mine were inconsistent
for multiple reasons mainly I was short
on time and I had actually so we had two
major launches last week and I had
actually had some some like real life
stuff going on too that I couldn't miss
yeah and it was just a very very crazy
hectic week so yeah I started to compile
my temperature numbers it didn't look
right to me and I was like you
I'm just not gonna talk that's a whole
video that's like a whole video that's
pretty much what happened for me so
point being though Steve thinks it's
because of the power delivery situation
on the motherboard and this is a
question that people thought of when
Intel's first said we have a Z 390 board
it's compatible with the new 8 cores and
we also have backwards compatible with
diseased backwards compatibility with a
Z through 70 boards a lot of people were
like well it's a power deliver gonna be
enough to support write any core
processor
Linus used the same motherboard that I
used which is the asus rog Strix I'm
sorry the asus rog Maximus 11 hero ok
because I don't know if you got the I
did Z 390 yeah you did for me open it
last week didn't ya yeah two weeks ago
two weeks ago - yeah there's a 390 care
package from Asus the Nexus they're the
highest end motherboard that was in
there was the hero yeah however the hero
upon closer inspection doesn't appear to
have quite the crazy nice power delivery
configuration on it that you might
expect
granted it's the hero and it's supposed
to be it's not the highest end when it
comes to the asus rog stuff but it's got
a four phase power delivery system which
has a which uses a doubler their their
fat faces from what Steve said I haven't
looked at it specifically so I don't
know the actual amperage rating or
anything like that but point being it's
a power delivery system that maybe isn't
quite as crazy good as what Steve was
using which was like the highest end as
rock the which was the as Mark one was
that as a 390 or z3 so yeah they're all
singing 390 ok Steve used the as rack
Taichi ultimate and the MSI z3 a 90 gut
like the see-through nightie god-like is
like a $600 motherboard so let's have
crazy over builds power delivery
configure it it's crazy there could be
so much variance between even Z 390 betw
Z 390 motherboards based on the power
delivery yes sild but there's
potentially more to this because you
have to look at the
9900 K which has a TDP according to
Intel of 95 watts but another thing that
Intel has been doing recently is that
they're a lot more cagey about the
specifics when it comes to
the turbo-boost tables like what the
clock what the different clock speeds
are they will not give you an official
listing of like all right when six cores
are active it's gonna run at this
frequency when four cores are active
it's gonna run at this frequency they
give you a base clock which is what 3.6
gigahertz for the 9900 K they'll tell
you a max single turbo of 5 gigahertz
because they had to be able to sell it
that way they don't everything in
between is kind of muddy and going along
with this 95 watt TDP thing when you
look at the power draw rating and this
is just direct power draw which is
different than TDP TDP is how much heat
a cooler needs to be able to absorb and
dissipate but Brian from tech yes City
who also did a follow up video on this
where he took the same configuration
that Linus used
and did a bit of his own testing here
and both Lee is looking for the video's
description he attempted to sort of
recreates the situation that - had he
was not able to use their exact same
hardware and their exact same settings
and get their exact same results but
according to gamers Nexus who also has
the ASUS Maximus 6 hero they said that
it uses Intel's spec for boosting and
power behavior unlike some other boards
so there's a couple ways to look at this
one way is to say that the hero the
Maximus 11 hero is doing things right it
is taming the 9900 K in order to get the
temperatures that you're seeing from
Linus's review and from tiny Tom Logan's
review and that's why they're like oh
this is you know it's a it's a cool
running chip or whatever but when you
actually test it it's not running at
high frequencies right and Steve's tests
it when he cuz Steve didn't have Steve
from Hardware box he didn't have the
same motherboard to test but he tested
on a Z 370 motherboard that had also had
a four phase power deliver
configuration so similar setup and
basically he was went for money at 4.7
gigahertz - 4.2 gigahertz which is still
not 3.6 gigahertz it's little boost
clock right but it's a different one and
the score his his cinematic score drop
by like 300 points but and his power
draw also dropped pretty significant
right so you could look at it like well
Intel specifications allows for a chip
that has eight cores and in certain
situations can run at high frequencies
and overall if you run it at those
recommended specs doesn't get hot and
and you know good chip or whatever but
if you want to take it and do what we
want to do with it and run an all core
4.6 or 4.7 gigahertz overclock which
isn't absurd by any stretch right or go
up higher than that you really can't
unless you apparently have a handsy 390
board interesting and as well as of
course as well as very adequate cooling
and hopefully not also dealing with with
okay with liquid metal and lapping your
seat where you die because none of us
really want to go that far this all
seems like a consequence of Intel not
having a defined line of where their
their their spec should I think it's all
core all quarter I think it has to do
with Intel wanting to say here's our new
chip and it still got that same TDP but
they're cagey with everything in between
so that if they were really pressed to
it they could say yes it still operates
within that it has the intelligence
built-in to throttle itself or run at
these frequencies so that it's never
gonna output that much heat right or or
draw that much power so they're
prioritizing their TDP and their power
consumption or power draw as opposed to
the frequency the frequency is kind of
left up in that case to the to the
motherboard manufacturer to live read it
and and it also ties into their
backwards compatibility with like C 370
boards which a lot of people were like
well do they have the power delivery
well yes they do if
running the clock running the 9900 okay
within that specification where you know
not the same amount of performance yeah
three hundred point drop is a fifteen
that's a fifteen percent less
performance rank when it comes to the
Cinebench scores it was it went from
around 2000 to about 1700 that's fifteen
percent less yeah which is significant
for someone who wants to use it for in a
workstation for workstation tasks or
something which is kind of what it's
supposed it's gonna make a lot more
people look way more closely at the
motherboards vrn design as opposed just
like RGB Diane nice I imagine there's
gonna be further hopefully further
testing done by people with the
different motherboards to say like right
which of these which boards will give
you the full fat experience 9900 Kay
experience if that's the chip that you
want to buy right or just avoid all this
stuff and get a 2700 hex and be just
fine and spend a lot less money I mean
there's gotta be a fun way for
motherboard manufacturers to
differentiate what kind of experience
their users are getting yeah this is the
the spec boring and cool this is like
the crazy and hot crazy and hot board
boring him cool yeah I don't know I mean
MSI just changed up their naming scheme
for them other boards a Meg
and then there's oh yeah the MVC which
should be the msi boring and cool right
and then the anyway though hey movie
yeah there's a comedy sketch in there
somewhere
speaking of that gamers Nexus Nexus this
is actually there multiple news story
but I'm only picking up a couple from
these memory prices are expected to fall
even further this is a story which is
based on an article from trend force
comm and I brought it up because it's
kind of good news is it I don't know
what trend force won't load there it is
there's the trend force article force it
to load
gamers Nexus says trend force is
typically accurate that's a quote
directly from Steve but Dean Graham
prices could lower as much as 20%
year-over-year in 2019 this is due to
weak prices and it grow
over supply this is caused by slow
smartphone shipments sluggish notebook
shipments and I thought I wanted to come
up with more adjectives to go with with
technology that wasn't selling well so I
also said plotting peripheral purchases
or dawdling DIMM deals pv pv pv pv p
triple i like traveling didn't deals i
think that's the main results that's the
main thing causing this lowering and
price notebook sales specifically were
caused by the lack of intel's 14
nanometer cpus which have not been very
readily available in the second half of
this year so you know if there's no CPUs
to build the laptops then they don't
need the memory for those laptops nand
is also listed here along with memory to
fall by even more 25 to 30 percent price
decline in 2019 again mostly from
increase i'm sorry this time mostly from
increased production capacity from
manufacturers so tell us apply your name
manufacturers that is also really good
news nand is also like right now SSD
prices are really good which is cool
it's like it's a nice sort of counter
ram prices if those continued to drop
like that'll put us in a better
situation so that's that's that's good
news that is awesome you know happy
about that hopefully then another 25 to
30 percent drop in and prices those i
like would you be able to get like a 2
terabyte nvm you drive for like less
than 200 bucks that be I mean eventually
I mean one day one someday
well one day it'll be cheap outdated to
be some way faster but I also wonder if
these price reductions with the RAM will
just be you know canceled out eventually
at least in the u.s. because of all the
tariffs cuz like what 29 25 to 30
percent that's right exactly what what
memories are going to be taxed in the
u.s. starting January 1st although and
I'm this isn't one of my stories I'm
talking about but there was an interview
actually I think this is also from wait
maybe it's maybe I can
because it's also and the gamers Nexus
set of news things yeah MSI yeah a
Chinese publication PC online
interviewed MSI and basically MSI said
they don't expect the tariffs to affect
GPU prices this is at least specifically
for MSI I believe and that's simply
because they're not manufactured in
mainland China I don't know if that
means that most they're mostly
manufactured in Taiwan or something else
like that mm-hmm but that's good news -
that is so if lowering prices GPU price
is not being affected stuff to wait and
see unlike CPUs and stuff that's great
but yeah maybe we'll see some some bit
of offsetting so that that doesn't hurt
us too bad moving on though remember on
this one is also referenced from that
same gamers Nexus article but Silicon
lottery has a bidding statistics page
that they've put up also it has a typo
on it so come lottery if anyone's
watching stats sticks okay so are you
familiar familiar with silicon lottery
hell yes I am
wait the website were the well they
they're they're they're a store so you
can go and buy processors from Silicon
Lottery okay I was not familiar with
that alright and they buy processors in
bulk they often delayed them but not
always depending on the CPU okay and
then they bend them and so and then they
sell them as guaranteed overclockers
sure they have published their
historical binning statistics for a
bunch of different CPUs that's really so
this is like 4790k here different
frequencies 4.6 4.7 4.8 i have heard of
these guys long time ago yeah and these
are the voltages that they were running
at and how many of the CPUs that they
tested were able to achieve race Frieza
was percentile they're only 3% of 4790k
s and clock hits at a 5 gigahertz so
just kind of a cool resource Wow if you
have a processor that you've never
bothered to overclock and you were like
what might it be capable of then you can
check out this list you got skylake on
here including 6700 k only 6% of 6700
k's hit 4.9 gig
it's also got your Broadwell ease 4kb
lakes only 1% of 7,700 cases Wow
5.3 gigahertz 12% though could hit 5.2
that's nuts
it's not bad at all seventh wonder
however and do we know how large these
sample sizes are I'd be real I don't
think they say specific numbers but at
the bottom they do mention that sample
size for some CPUs is too low so they're
not included sure so I don't know
exactly what their sample size is but
it's got to be enough that they're able
to break down these numbers with some
level of reliability yeah but so like
AMD as well for summit ridge these are
less exciting because some ridge tops I
doesn't work like that I thought this is
kind of interesting 4.1 gigahertz but
18% of 1800 X's could hit 4.1 gigahertz
1,700 X 33% could hit 4 and apparently
none of them could reliably hit Wow 4.1
this kind of tells me a little bit about
AMD's bidding process and they're
definitely doing something with these
because if none of your 1,700 X's could
hit 4.1 1800 X's than that then they're
1800 X is that kind of tells you like
alright if you're debating between like
a 2700 X and it's 2700 you know you
might consider like you're probably
going to get in another hundred
megahertz yeah out of out of paying more
for the X version right ever 24% but I
mean but if you but if all you're
looking to hit is 4 gigahertz in that
4.1 then a good chunk of them can hit it
only 4% 33% 1700 and 1700 X yeah it's a
great website even if you're not gonna
buy a chip even if you're gonna buy a
chip elsewhere you know just to compare
like what what your odds are 8700 k's 4%
hit 5 point 3 gigahertz nice hot damn on
where is my wait I wanted to look at my
79 80 X but I'm just making noises so
look look how look how special J's at 79
80 XE is only 2% of those 79 80 X's hit
4.6 gigahertz right and his
hitting was like five five point one or
five I don't know whatever and he wasn't
even delivered yeah yeah these are
insulated I still don't know if he's
either correct the only ones that are
deleted chips are KB Lake sky lake X and
coffee lake
Oh interesting so yes that would be
deleted 79 80 XE I think Dex damn he had
a gold sample he had a golden sample
then yes indeed Jay is the 2%
all right we're skipping our sponsor
spot for this week because I'm I screwed
up the schedule fine tho so we're gonna
move right on to our next segment no ads
boobs is not on the phone with Steve I
just I just want to pull that briefly
gotcha and report news Burt
where'd they go games and stuff oh it
starts with T cuz it's the games you're
for you there it is okay so yeah gotta
have our appropriate lower thirds all
right so let's talk about forty minutes
in by the way we are
I believe dammit alright I can run
through these quickly okay these aren't
important anyway GTA 5 as an online hack
that let trolls kill gamers in
single-player mode was this interesting
because GTA 5 is a somewhat popular game
somewheres a little bit of a screencap
from Snowy live who was a twitch
streamer his a cheater interrupted his
stream by kicking him out of his session
but claimed to be a rock star
administrator so snowy live switched to
single-player mode to avoid this person
still kind of kills but then started
dropping dead the instant the game
started the troll sent him an in-game
chat message which should be impossible
since he wasn't even in multiplayer mode
hmm it said saying you're not safe in
single-player later the Mater wiped out
the bank accounts for snowy lives
single-player campaign safe that sucks
Oh in-game bank accounts correct yeah
his single-player game called it at
least it wasn't his real life be alright
well geez that's no one is safe yeah
this was made possible by GTA 5's game
update 1.45 which was general fixes for
stability and security
but this unintentionally allowed cheers
to
harass other people in even in
single-player mode this hack has been
patched it only took them about 48 hours
but it was enough time for at least
somebody to go and troll some live
streamers the really annoying thing
about this is when they're doing
whatever they're doing with the admin
mode or however they've hacked in is if
you if you immediately die when you try
to enter the game you can't bring up the
menu while you're when you're dead in
GTA 5 so you can't like bring up the
menu to do anything to report the person
all you can do is alt f4 to exit the
game which is annoying I was lame anslee
glad they patched it I'm glad that never
happened to any of us will your
benchmarking usually it means you can't
die I guess but while you're
benchmarking but hackers can get away
with pretty much anything these days so
yeah that would actually really suck to
try to grad I guess I'm that benchmark
in this game done so I didn't mean to
give all of you ideas at a sabotage our
benchmarks right here is an article from
tech spots shadow of the Tomb Raider has
been out for a little over a month five
weeks altar but Steam went and put it on
sales I just bought it on sale you know
you just bought it on yeah I got so
confused why didn't you get it when it
first came out because the Cydia sent
out game codes to people oh did they I'm
pretty sure I I have it I think they
still sometimes send certain emails to
my old email address I don't check it's
a thing but yeah I was like Emma is this
the right is this the most recent tomb
raider cuz it's only 39 bucks I was like
what's going on here and it's like oh
it's on sale yeah yeah I I felt good I
felt good 34 percent off what way to go
Kyle having the forethought to wait for
that deal to come out totally they're
good 959 down from 60 bucks the original
MSRP which pissed off a bunch of people
who bought it in the first five weeks
cuz it's the triple a title and you know
it's got backing from major hardware
manufacturers and stuff like that so
people who spent 60 bucks went and
review bombed it on Steam too because
they're pissed off that it went on sale
or dumb so quickly
yes check reviews are mostly positive
it's got about a it's got about eighty
eighty score generally speaking where
there are those reviews these positive
just kind of negative reviews oh here we
go I gotta tell my birthday I did get a
code for share of the Tomb Raider oh my
god I can give it to ye sausage yeah
anyone want a code no I'm not gonna give
it to you so here's the shadow of the
Tomb Raider page all reviews are mixed
which thing we're overwhelmingly they
were really positive sixty-six percent
now steam in order to combat this
specific review bombing scenario cause
it's not it's if that affects steam
sales to yeah so it looks like a bunch
of the negative ones Wow popped up here
is this when the sale went up probably
started but I guess this is what the
sales up a week so yeah that's actually
the sale ended yesterday so for anyone
who was like oh I should go but and then
there's got good you can see all these
crappy reviews you oh my god but then
you can also see more positive reviews
from maybe more people buying it and
actually playing it during that time
so anyway huh if you if you want to play
shadow of the Tomb Raider I'm gonna give
it a bad review right now yeah you sure
this game forty bucks 20 bucks
sorry head code and now way better yeah
because of that all right one more story
here for the games report DL SS the
actually if you think ray tracing is
gonna be garbage then the LSS is your
next best bet for being excited about
something that the RT x series of
graphics cards can do and DL SS settings
or options have appeared within player
unknowns battlegrounds game files it's
not there directly it's not available in
game but some people have gone and
edited the game files to actually get it
up and running but some early testers
who have posted about trying this out on
the Nvidia subreddit have
perience game crashes after short
gameplay runs or some other people just
say it doesn't even work at all but yeah
if you're not familiar with what DL SS
is it uses the temps of course any r-tx
graphics card which is its got
artificial intelligence so it looks
what's on screen and like it scales it
up just to give you more detail but then
it uses artificial intelligence to to
just know what to be there and to put it
there for you to fancy yeah okay I I
mean realistically speaking the AI looks
at stuff and like it sees what's
happened before so I can it can predict
what pixels should be where make sense
it seems like same thing and fully it
seems like something that if it works
the way it's intended to work could
provide a pretty big bump in detail or
potentially a bump in frame rate
depending on how you implemented it so
yeah if Nvidia got it up and running it
could be a pretty nice boost for public
perception of the twenty series graphics
cards since launch of those has been
mixed when it comes to reaction but yeah
wait I wrote I wrote out what what what
DL SS is it uses the tensor cores an RT
X series GPUs to upscale images with an
AI based algorithm potentially offering
better image quality with minimal
performance hit and making high frame
rate gameplay at high resolutions more
achievable sort of it is very it's sort
of a paraphrase of what the article says
but anyway there are a bunch of games
that have are expected to integrate DL
SS support in the future at some points
who knows when Ark survival evolved
atomic arts they're all listed here you
guys can read serious same for planet
badass series Sam oh come on what's that
coming up anyway probably never but
that's pretty much all I got from my
half of the show so thank you guys so
much for watching hit the thumbs up
button if you enjoyed it again if you
made a donation comment or if you bought
anything hang out or jump to the
after-party
if you're watching in the future which
will be
in the description and stuff for now
jump to the second half which is going
to be on Kyle's channel a bit wit I
almost said you've been right couple
years ago
that's true but yeah thanks for watching
guys we'll be right back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
