Pauls hardware today's video is going to
be kind of a quick off-the-cuff I don't
want to call it a review it's going to
be more of an unboxing and a first look
and some basic testing for this new
little device the black magic deck link
mini recorder 4k this is a brand new
product from black magic and there's a
very specific reason why I bought this
very quickly when I spotted it and
that's because I have two Panasonic
Lumix gh4 cameras and these gh4 s have
an HDMI out over here on the side and
it's a kind of unique feature of this
camera that it can actually output
pretty high resolution but actually it
can do for two to ten bit 4k resolution
out of the HDMI out and you can use that
with something like a Natomas Shogun
optimist at the most I don't know how
that's pronounced and with a Shogun
which is an external recorder that you
can get you plug it in here and that
will allow you to record in that really
high resolution with really good color
depth however for some reason the
existing version of black magics 4k
capture card the 4k version of this guy
right here this is the intensity Pro but
for some inexplicable reason unless you
use outdated firmware the Blackmagic
intensity Pro 4k will not accept the 4k
signal from the gh4 so I'm really hoping
that this new one will work for that
since it does support some new standards
and then I'm also hoping that I can use
it to capture direct 4k gameplay footage
and then also hopefully even 21 by 9:30
440 by 1440 but again that remains to be
seen
I purchased this from Amazon it was
about a hundred and ninety US dollars
and again this only just came out so
there's really not many reviews or
anything like that on it
so again Blackmagic Design has an SDI
input as well as an HDMI inputs works
with DaVinci Resolve Premiere Pro Media
Composer and Photoshop Ultra HD six gig
SDI connector I'm not going to be using
SDI I'm going to mainly be using that
HDMI because it is HDMI 2.0 the reason
I'm hoping this might work whereas the
intensity Pro 4k doesn't is it as hdmi
2.0 a 21 peas 30 resolution capture but
also even very specifically lists 2160p
30 frames per second true 10 and 12 bit
broadcast quality input with 16 channels
of embedded audio so those are specs
also down here Yub for 2 to RGB y UV 42
RGB 4 for 4 included in the box legged
little welcome guide includes a four gig
SD card with the software and manual
installed on it it's kind of nice does
come with a low profile bracket so for a
smaller form factor capture system this
could also be an option so this is a
fairly small google capture card in and
of itself and there it is you do have a
not active cooling fan on there PCI
Express by 4 interface sister Gen 2 by 4
it will still work in a gen 3 connection
then of course just your very simple
simple inputs hdmi 2.0 a right there and
then a 6g SDI connector this is a
connection type called BNC which is a
locking connector which is actually a
really nice connector but it's more used
in professional video production
environments so i do not have something
that can connect up to that if you get
like a professional camera for example
it might have an SDI out and in fact
that's another option besides paying two
grand for the atomists Shogun for this
there is actually an add-on piece you
can get for the gh4 which you're getting
costs about two grand adds like some SDI
connectors and that kind of thing but
i'm seeing if i can do this on the cheap
so the atom of Shogun can do that really
high resolution high bit rates high
color depth capture
but you need to spend $2,000 on a device
like that if this works it might be a
$200 alternative although this one does
have some drawbacks so let me go over
those real quick so one thing you might
notice is this only has HDMI IN which
means you can't use the pass-through
so here's the Blackmagic intensity Pro
has an end as well as an out so if
you're capturing from a game console for
example you can go in with the console
and then out and then you can actually
still play on whatever monitor you're
using whatever this does not have that
option although there is a display out
that you can get as well as this which
again costs another $190 so it is a more
expensive solution since I'm capturing
Creek Street to a computer that
shouldn't be an issue for me I hope but
again that is something that you lose is
the pass-through to get a video out from
whatever you're capturing from another
potential limitation if you compare it
to something like this which is the
Elgato Game Capture HD 60 again has the
HDMI in I believe that's inside yet in
as well as out but this has the benefit
of being external and connected via USB
2.0 this does have again some drawbacks
since it is USB 2.0 but it is portable I
also have this guy right here which is
the Razer ripsaw which is also a pretty
nice capture device so this one's nice
because it's got the HDMI pass-through
it's got USB 3.0 so you don't have to
wait for buffering or anything like that
but can't do 4k although it can do 1080
60 pretty nicely so I have installed the
deck link mini recorder 4k in the
capture system over here just in the PCI
Express slot down there just going to
have this installed for right now and
I've gone ahead and downloaded the
software from the Blackmagic website and
installed it and now in the desktop
video setup I can actually see the
capture device listed so let's start the
first test setup so I have an HDMI cable
come in here plugged over into the input
on the capture card if you have hdmi
cables and you're worried about the hdmi
2.0 allows your hdmi cables hdmi 1.4 or
newer it'll still work with hdmi 2.0 or
at least from what i've read see if that
actually plays out here and then on my
gh4 i got to go over here into the
settings for the HDMI output and here is
where the connection
set stuff like the bit mode so we want
the bit mode to be ten bits can I record
to the memory card with this setting
well yeah yeah that's fine
and then I don't care about inflow
display and we want 4k done convert to
be off because we want it to stay at 4k
you just plug in the HDMI over here
screen should go off for a second as it
switches over to HDMI out and now lets
you have to pick it up on the computer
and it seems to have worked at least
done initial inspection this is the
desktop video sup setup software the
Blackmagic is provide provided it's a
seems to have been improved upon a
little bit here too but you can tell SD
ni and HDMI inputs and recognize this
device and everything and we can already
see right here HDMI 2160p 24 so it is
outputting at 24 frames per second
4k let's see if we have the proper
bitrate alright guys I just spent the
last maybe two to three hours messing
with this thing and I've had my share of
ups and downs as I've gone along but I'm
happy to say that at least what you're
watching right now is being recorded and
for gate and 4k directly through that
capture card but there are some
limitations there are some of course
bits of quirkiness with it and I think
what we're really suffering from right
now is a lack of software support from
the capture software side specifically
with xsplit but anyway I'm going to do
some ghetto recording of the screens
right here and show you guys what I
found out so first off after setting up
the camera properly to output in 4k and
10-bit and all that good stuff it was
recognized again by the Dec link mini
recorder 4k software the desktop video
setup and then the next thing that I did
was I actually loaded up the actual deck
link software so the first thing I want
to show you is the actual media Express
software which hello reflection in there
which is right here and which shows
thankfully that it's working
so there's me recording the screen of me
recording the screen this is getting
crazy but anyway so this worked and this
showed that this is 4k this is
functional and and it's working so
that's good
that means that my capture card works
now what I did was I use the actual
capture feature
down here and there's a different
there's a few different options you can
do in here in the preferences to
determine what your actual video
settings are what the resolution is as
well as the capture file format so I
went through all these file formats and
I found that if I'm using avi 10-bit y
UV or RGB it basically captures in
lossless format which ends up being
really large file size
avi motion JPEG records and does some
compression but it does not do 10 bit
what this meant was that my test files I
was running here are like insanely huge
this is like over 2 gigs per second that
it's recording at that is using that's
using avi 10 bit y UV switching over to
AV or RGB 10 bit was even worse and in
fact led to this file being almost 3
gigabytes per second so these are like
20 15 or 20 second clips and this one is
5 point 2 3 gigs this one is six point
seven four gigs that's pretty insane
the third test I did was again using avi
so what that ends up being is a much
more reasonable file size more like 200
megabits which is a lot more reasonable
for 4k but then it also was not doing
actual 10 bit though and that in that
case so these media I used media info
here to scan the file and we can see
here some of the details of it such as
the bit rate that's going at 242
megabits per second and then we also
have the actual color depth and chroma
subsampling so chroma subsampling is for
two two and bit depth is 8 bit so we are
recording in a reasonable format but the
problem here was that with these other
videos here and I can kind of start to
start to play them back you might notice
they are insanely choppy and basically
dropping frames all over the place I
think what this is a result of is the
fact that I'm not using really high
speed storage I'm recording to an
external USB 3 SSD why this is huge
crazy according to an external USB 3 SSD
but that's not fast enough for the bit
rates that these are actually recording
it so that was my downfall there so I'm
going to need to set up some high-speed
storage on the system if I want to
capture directly probably a couple SSDs
in rate the good news though I mean
upshot here is that it is working I am
capturing straight from the gh4
I'm doing it at 4k and I'm doing it at
or at least have the availability for
the higher bit rates and color deaths so
that's cool like although of course was
to use this with xsplit and possible
well ideally xsplit because I occurred
exploit can do 10 bit
unfortunately xsplit is just completely
non-functional at least when it comes to
getting video with this capture card i
have tried literally just about every
single possibility i've tried using dec
link video capture i've tried black
magic WM WDM capture I have tried going
into the video input settings for all of
these deck link video capture does not
even have 4k listed down here as an
option so I think that is a software
update that needs to be made when you do
the WDM option WDM capture it does give
you some more options or at least you
can go in there and manually tell us
before k but it's still the same results
I am getting audio through the camera it
does actually pick that up but it's just
black video and I found no way around
that so xsplit a date your so it
works with this capture card OBS on the
other hand was working for me
unfortunately although I was
encountering really weird kind of crazy
issues with the studio version so I
ended up going to just the classic OBS
and this seems to be working so as I was
able to use this to record myself and it
worked and I recorded that too I use
this to record the stuff that you might
have heard just a few moments ago and
look there's me hoping things will work
as I start talking but it did work I was
able to compress it on the fly and I
ended up with a file over here which is
not as high a bit rate as I would have
wanted it's only about 15 megabits but
it's still 30 frames per second it's
still 3840 by 2160
the only downside here though is that
this is not recording using the full
color chroma options so yeah down here
it's only recording at or to go four to
zero for chroma subsampling and it is
only recording at 8 bits but it is
recording and if you compare that to
using a gh4 with the Blackmagic
intensity Pro I suppose that is an
improvement well guys just to sort of
sum up the additional tests I've done
after my capture test with the gh4 which
were somewhat successful unfortunately I
have had bad luck since then so my first
attempt was with my Acer predator x34
monitor back there and I was hoping what
I could do is take this system here
output it to 3rd at 34 40 by 1440 20m by
9 to that monitor and then cloned the
output to the HDMI outs to send over to
be captured that did not work so I
decided to take the predator exit a 4
out of the mix and I disconnected it I
originally had a longer cable going here
with an extension and then I started to
get worried because it wasn't working
that I didn't have a fully compatible
hdmi 2.0 cables or that my my coupler
wasn't fully compatible or whatever so I
moved this whole system over here so I
could take the one cable that I know
work because I had it connected to that
camera and it was working there and just
that is connected to this via HDMI was
not able to clone 4k monitor and then 4k
captured was not able to use extended
mode like like it's set up right here
and capture the extended monitor was not
able to even plug just the HDMI in
directly and capture that at 4k 30
frames per second I am pretty much given
up trying right now I have literally
spent two hours going through different
settings and everything so initial
thoughts on the deck link many recorder
4k are not good at this points well it
has succeeded in getting a fork a 10 bit
signal from my gh4 which I give it a
thumbs up for and I guess I'm going down
pros
right now a little fan that's on there
even with my capture system over here in
the side panel off not audible at all I
mean haven't got enough right next to it
but it's definitely not something that's
loud so that's good that was a complaint
on the intensity Pro 4k um but the fact
that it simply cannot capture a 4k 30fps
signal from my mic like friggin gaming
system right here which I know it's a
1080 it's running out of GTX 1018 there
I know it's outputting the right signal
because it's coming through just fine on
here so I have no idea what else is
going on but I pretty much run out of
time anyway thanks you guys for watching
this video I hope it's been illuminating
to some of you any of you who are
interested in capturing 4k footage for
example hopefully I'll be able to come
back to it in the future after I've done
some more testing a little bit more time
may begin the software a chance to
update and when it comes to stuff like
xsplit OBS because those are giving me
issues - anyway though I hope you guys
have learned a little bit from this
video hit thumbs up button if you did
enjoy it and thanks for watching we'll
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
