ddr4 RGB memory kits are made for high
class pcs with each meticulously crafted
module featuring a full-length
crystalline light bar atop a polished
heat spreader with a luxuriant
reflective gold or silver finish
reminding you to appreciate the finer
things in life like the freedom to
choose from tried NZ royal RGB kits in
16 gig 228 gig capacities and up to ddr4
40 600 megahertz memory speeds if you're
looking to give your high class system
build the royal treatment
click the sponsor link in the
description below what do we have here
so guys what we have a right here in
front of me is the makings of a themed
build yes
Asus hit me up actually a couple months
back to do a sponsored build that's a
giveaway now I typically don't do
sponsored video so I want to be clear
here this build video is not necessarily
sponsored the giveaway sponsored you
have the opportunity to potentially win
this entire system and putting it
together which includes the call of duty
black ops 4 monitor as well so that said
this is an absolutely epic system we
have a r-tx 20 atti the call of duty
black ops 4 edition everything is the
call of duty black ops 4 edition for the
most part here we've also got an Intel
Core i7 9700 K unlocked 8 core processor
for your processing and gaming needs a
wide array of asus rog products here
with lighting features and headsets and
the monitor by the way is the PG 2 5 8
which is an rog swift monitor with
g-sync support at 240 hertz refresh rate
so guys this is an impressive impressive
pile of hardware and I'm gonna go over
each piece so you know what's involved
starting of course with this monitor
already mentioned PG 2 5/8 apart from
the call of duty theming this is a 25
inch monitor and it's actually 1920 by
1080 resolution but that is because the
refresh rate is so dang high 240 Hertz
refresh rate as well as 1 millisecond
response time so this is an ideal gaming
monitor also features support from
Nvidia g-sync as well as 3d vision so
that's gonna pair up real nicely with
the graphics card which is the call of
duty black ops edition of the GeForce
r-tx 2080 ti I use two of these the non
Call of Duty versions and my attempts to
beat J and Steve when we were doing the
2080 ti overclocking races this
for me well although I never actually
went and did exotic cooling on them so
you know you can only go so far with the
air cooling but moving on for a
motherboard we've got the Maximus 11
hero so this is a z3 90 motherboard
overclocking call of duty black ops
edition of course once again so once we
get that out of the box we'll give you
guys a closer look at it so you can see
what sort of aesthetic differences other
than that it's the same Maximus 11 hero
so one of the better overclocking
motherboards from Asus and then we got a
bunch of peripherals here so the ROG
Strix Flair I'm gonna leave these
peripherals in their boxes since they're
destined for a giveaway winner at some
point I don't want to take them too much
by getting them dusty or anything like
that but I've been using the standard
edition of the RG Strix Flair keyboard
just not call of duty black ops themed
and it's real solid keyboard and this
one has Cherry MX silver switches as
well as compatibility with aura sync
also including a very nice Mouse mat to
go along with the ROG Gladius to origin
Mouse that's right up here this mouse
can be used in wired or Wireless mode
it's got a call duty black ops 4 logo at
the back which will light up and of
course or a sync compatibility as well
or a headset we have the asus rog delta
which features quad Dax it's a gaming
headset so you got a mic and headphone
both included its uses ESS decks to
handle your audio processing and it also
features a USB type-c connector which is
kind of a first when it comes to gaming
headsets and of course it's also
Wireless for power supply we have the
rog thor 1200 watt this is a platinum
rated power supply also features orison
compatibility a 10 year warranty and
1200 watts which is more than enough
than we'll need for this actual computer
also going to throw in an ROG spotlight
here this is just sort of an aesthetic
product you can shine an ROG logo on a
wall wherever you want to show the RG
logo the spotlight will do that so we've
also got the RG or a terminal this is an
addressable RGB hub so we can connect up
all the addressable RGB stuff in the
system which is a significant amount and
get it all working we've got the RG
ryujin 360 liquid CPU cooler 360
millimetre radiator
Noctua fans as well as an LED display on
the actual pump block unit itself and
for a case we're going to be using the
Leanne Lee 11 err RGB this was kind of
my contribution vo Leanne Lee to this
build because I wanted a case that I've
worked with before that's a good case
and also that has plenty of airflow
since we're installing quite a bit of
hardware in this system and the
remaining key components here we've got
the 9700 cave
we have a 6-series 512 gig nvme SSD from
Intel and we've got 32 gigs of Corsair
Vengeance RGB memory that's 2666 speed
for 8 gig sticks total well that was a
lot of stuff to unbox very exciting but
I think we're finally ready to build
well there's one more thing left to
unbox that's the manly 0:11
air
at this point the power supply's
installed and I've just been sort of
reality checking where everything else
is going to get in because we've got
this 360 mo meter radiator and I think
we're gonna install that in the top
mainly because I want to use these
included not to a crow max fans these
are n FF twelves by the way because
they're not going to there'll be less
visible and if we're gonna have RGB
anything it's probably gonna be visible
so we'll keep that in the top this is
the air version of the case so it comes
with a couple hundred and twenty
millimeter fans so we're going to keep
those as intakes at the front and then
since this is the RGB version of this
case they give you three more fans
these are RGB with lights in the central
hub so I think I'm going to install
those in the side intake or exhaust and
I'm gonna have these as intakes these
fans have rubber vibration dampening
pads but you have to install them
yourself
so what I'm trying to do here is make
sure all my fans my intake fans which
are two on the front three on the side
and just try to wrap all the cables
right into this area because the fan the
three fan pack came up a little a little
splitter here so I'm gonna use that to
plug all five fans into the same fan
header on the motherboard and I can
mount that with adhesive out in this
area so it's just enough room here I'm
trying to cinch these up close so I can
wrap the cables in between and sort of
use the fans to hold the cables in place
sort of a makeshift cable management
solution and looking at this little fan
splitter and I'm realizing you know you
can connect up to six fans to it but
there's no supplemental power so all the
power is coming from whatever source
plug you connect this end into that's
actually fine for these Liam Lee fans
that ship with it because they're only
0.15 amps draw max per fan but just to
be on the safe side and also you know if
I was to connect other fans that drew
more power there's a high amperage fan
header on this motherboard so I'm going
to connect to that so there's plenty of
power for those fans
alright guys this build is assembled I
haven't turned it on yet so I'm hoping
things work but we got the LED strip
addressable LED strip run around the
edge of the case here it is magnetic so
it's just held in place by the magnets
graphics cards installed I ran the power
cables up for that and that's to help
eliminate a bit of the GPU sag that
might potentially happen with a larger
graphics card although upon initial
installation this graphics card wasn't
really sagging at all so that's good
other than that everything came together
pretty nicely I was trying to plan ahead
for the RGB to make sure everything was
wired up there properly but we got tons
of intake on this system we've course
got the triple fan 360 millimeter
radiator at the top for exhaust and
there's some extra exhaust at the back
I'm just talking because I'm nervous
that this might actually not work when I
turn it on so I'm just gonna turn it on
how about that our switch is on we have
lights and now the moment of truth oh
look at that so as I somewhat
anticipated when connected directly to
the LED the RGB LED headers on the
motherboard because the motherboard is a
Call of Duty motherboard all the LEDs
are orange our Corsair Vengeance RGB
memory is not lighting up it's just
doing the rainbow color and we also have
some LEDs on the region all in one
liquid cooler as well that's still going
rainbow LEDs so gonna need to install
Windows to get into the software because
this one's controlled via a USB
connection and then the memory connects
directly to the motherboard of course so
as I was putting the system together I
was kind of reminded of when I used to
play Diablo and Diablo they'd have set
armor you could get and you'd want to
get all the pieces of the set put them
all together cuz they all matched and
then you get set bonuses and stuff like
that I don't know if that analogy
completely applies to a system like this
but it is I think the first time that
I've put together a largely themed
computer with all parts that are from
mainly the same manufacturer asus in
this case and most of these are also
call of duty black ops 4 theme so we get
an overall black and orange color scheme
of course these are RGB LEDs so we could
go in and adjust those two'll if we
really wanted to but guys this entire
system was built to be given away to one
of you lucky viewers at home up there so
stay tuned for a future video where I'll
be
announcing the giveaway details and how
to enter and all that good stuff hit
thumbs up button if you enjoyed this one
definitely subscribe so you can know
when the giveaway actually kicks off
I'll also be announcing it on my Twitter
so a big THANK YOU to Asus for providing
these parts to build this system so that
could be given away in the future thanks
to you guys for watching this video let
me know what you think of this system
build in the comments section down below
and we'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
