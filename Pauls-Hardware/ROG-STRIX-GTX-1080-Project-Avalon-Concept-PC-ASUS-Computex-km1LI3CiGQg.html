sponsored by fractal design MSI and
g.skill we're nowadays soos I know
there's some stuff you guys want to see
here and we'll start out with what I
think you want to see the most which is
which is this this is their new GT X
1080 this is our OG Strix and and it's
it's pretty cool they have a custom PCB
on this of course they've gone with an 8
+ 2 phase power delivery so they're
completely redesigned the board the
power delivery they have an 8 pin plus a
6 pin connecter therefore providing
juice to the card they have RGB LED
lighting and they have no other color
accents on the card at all except with
RGB LED lighting that's how it should be
done
good job Asus even on the back you got
this little logo right there ROG and
there's a couple unique features of this
card one is that they have redone the
i/o here or the least the outputs for
the video they've given you an extra
HDMI and that reason they've done that
is because if you're using VR you're
going to be using your HDMI for your VR
headset they're giving you a second one
in case you happen to also have an HDMI
monitor that's convenient of course they
still got a couple display ports on
there they got the dual link DVI and the
other thing they've done here down on
this end is they've added a couple fan
connectors because we all know we have
fan connectors on a motherboard that
will often run based on a CPU
temperature for example this will give
you the opportunity to plug in a couple
fans and have them actually ramped up a
ramp down based on the GPU temperature
that's pretty convenient so if you have
like some fans that would directly
provide airflow onto the GPU connect
those up and if the GPU gets hot fans
get the fans get juice here a couple
more specs I'm going to cheat off of for
here this has an OC mode it'll go up to
1936 megahertz
boost clock so I would imagine that
might even push over 2,000 megahertz
just right out of the gate memory clock
is 10 gigabit gigabits per second and of
course it features Asus Ora RGB lighting
and more on that in just a second the
other thing I have is this right here
this is the our gxg station - and look
you just pop it open like that and it
opens up basically this is an external
device of a light connect a laptop now
asus has already done a version of this
but they've changed now so they're
actually using thunderbolt for this one
originally they had a proprietary
connection
Thunderball does introduce a little bit
of latency what would they want decided
they wanted to do is go with a standard
that was a little bit more broadly
accepted and open standard I don't know
if it's open but it's at least a
standards a little bit more common they
are going to do a higher-end version of
this as well that will use the
proprietary standard so for those who
want the maximum performance and don't
really care about thunderbolt they'll
have that option but you can just drop
in a graphics card here it's got active
cooling on there it's got even a little
plasma guy on the front which is pretty
cool and it will provide its own power
so if you are the kind of person who
likes to have a laptop and then bring it
home and plug it in and then game on it
this is a kind of cool device for you it
looks badass too I mean it's an rog
product so that kind of goes without
saying I also wanted to thank Logue or
I'm okay I want to thank Kane for being
here and playing playing games in the
background well know why I know why
these people playing these games uneasy
with these controller I can't like this
is I have no words we have our Asus Ora
RGB lighting the demo showing showing
right here is demonstrating a very
unique feature when it comes to RGB
lighting in cases look you have a
graphics card that lights up RGB you
have a motherboard that lights up RGB
you have RGB lights inside the case you
even have RGB lights something on the
keyboard here as well as I thought there
was a mouse here earlier it's gone ok
it's about that even though RGB lighting
on this is our G or our og monitor right
here is all synced up Wow so they've
created Universal standard so you can
connect it whether it's connected via a
USB or whether it's net could be like
PCI Express like the graphics card it
will all synchronize and that's pretty
cool you can even maybe in the future
maybe connect something up external so
light your desk up to I don't know about
that I don't know where I heard that
though and finally I have this new asus
motherboard look at it isn't it
beautiful no ok what this actually is is
Asus Project Avalon this is an ROG
device the actual completed project is
right here and I do have some b-roll of
it sort of being taken apart and
disassembled and whatnot but here's what
Asus did they took the ATX standard and
they threw it out the window like screw
that we don't like the ATX standard it's
too constraining what could we do if we
just kind of
went with our own layout for everything
so what they ended up with was this
board so you have kind of the main
motherboard pieces it's on top right
here that's where you actually have your
CPU socket four dimm slots which you
typically wouldn't be able to get on a
case or system this size maybe you could
depending if we go in micro ATX or
something but definitely not mini ITX
they have a separate power plane here so
there's a separate piece of PCB in the
middle of the board that delivers power
to different components and then they
basically have edge connectors that
they've used to lay in like a backplane
here four SATA slots so you can slide in
SSDs there in the Front's they have an
extra element over on the side that
drops down overhears to give you a
unique positioning for your graphics
card so you can have actual access to it
by simply opening up the side panel of
the case which you just press and pop
off like that these are freaking heavy
like milled aluminum pieces as far as we
can tell at least they're very
substantial this is an rog product so
they were going for a you know that sort
of aggressive gamer look but it's really
is is one of the coolest things i've
seen here to be honest because they're
simply using edge connectors to take the
different modules of the motherboard and
assemble it all together so that you end
up with a complete working system but
you have separate chambers for like the
main motherboard and the memory and the
CPU you've got this chamber over here
which is basically to give you your fans
support what they've done with it here
is they taking an ek predator and I've
dropped it in there
ek predator with minimal all I did was
add a couple 90 degree angle angle
connectors on there to provide water
cooling support in here have a
water-cooled graphics card over on this
side as well and it's just a pretty cool
completed project product they have an
air-cooled version of it as well and we
don't know how much it's going to cost
we don't know what when it's going to
come out but I do like that ROG likes to
kind of throw standards out the window
do their own thing and kind of push the
industry forward a little bit and
although this would be sort of a
self-contained unit I was asking them if
they would ever consider making sort of
a their own standard so that case
manufacturers could come in and develop
their own products or something like
that they're not really going that route
this just kind of working on this for
right now but they're really interested
in seeing what people think of this
concept
this design and the idea of just you
know there's different ways motherboards
can be put together there's different
ways computers can be put together and
this I thought was a pretty compelling
example of that but that's gonna wrap it
up for my Asus booth coverage guys I'd
like to say one last sponsor shout out
to my sponsors fractal design MSI and
g-scale they're sponsored links are down
in the description click those to show
them some love thanks for watching this
video and I'll be back with more from
Computex 2016 very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
