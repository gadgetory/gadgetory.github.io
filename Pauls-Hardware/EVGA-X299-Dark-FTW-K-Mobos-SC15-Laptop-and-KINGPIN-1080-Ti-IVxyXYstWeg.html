to you by MSI EVGA Tesoro g.skill and
Coolermaster guys EVGA invited us over
to their headquarters in new taipei city
so we're actually here right now in
their gaming arena this is they set this
up just like they can bring people in
have like LAN parties here and it's
actually pretty epic they've got like a
whole stage setup and they can have
competitions and that's all pretty sweet
but we're actually not here to check the
gaming arena out we're here to check out
be BGA's new products so guys EVGA has
conveniently laid all the products as
here on these tables for us so I'm going
to kind of run down the line and show
you guys what's going on
ignore Kyle over there he says he's not
covering any of this stuff he's just
pretending anyway let's start with cases
the dg7 series includes the DG 73 75 and
76 you guys might be familiar with some
of these tempered glass available
options on multiple slides up to three
sides of the case and a bit more of a
sort of standard box like aesthetic and
then you get with for instance the DG 8
series like the one down there on the
left these look pretty nice so I think
they're pretty good solution and more on
new VGA solutions again in just a minute
because that's what they're trying to
focus on this time around it's not just
being a components vendor but also being
able to provide the complete solution
for people who wants a gaming PC or
otherwise here's a keyboard that they're
working on the v10 there it is right
there mechanical switches nice volume
and dimmers options here as well as the
LED readout it looks like they're in the
middle I don't have very much
information on this keyboard but I want
to do at least point it out let's go
over over to the flap top this is the SC
17 and huge thank you of course the EVGA
not just for sponsoring my Computex 2017
content but also I reached out to them
to see if we could borrow one of these
and we are and my editor Joe is editing
on this right now probably as I speak
it's a beast of a laptop 17.3 inch
screen 4k vsync display so I just got on
their gtx 1070 inside was also 6820 cpu
and the one we have has absolutely been
wonderful so far 256 gig SSD and a one
terabyte hard drive in there
aluminum construction just a beast of
the the laptop I also want to point out
came with very minimal bloatware which I
certainly appreciate it here's the
one though that SC 15 a smaller variant
of the SC 17 probably going to be a
little bit more affordable I have to
imagine because the specs aren't quite
as high-end but you do get a 15.6 inch
IPS display it's 1080p and again g-sync
capable has USB 3.1 bluetooth 4.2 and i7
7700 HQ 16 gigs of ram a gtx 1060 full
GPU in there although it's try not going
to be running at the same frequencies as
a desktop cards again 256 gig SSD and 1
terabyte hard drive and with it that all
aluminum construction you could gauge
done a really good job on this they had
a blown up sort of a version of it
upstairs we're able to look at the
internals and stuff like that
simple clean design and I definitely
like it if it's anything like SC 17 its
Big Brother there's going to be a very
nice laptop someone who needs something
on the go here's the VGA t7 it's a big
old case let's move on down the line no
here's a DG 77 gaming system and again
going back to EVGA solution now take a
look at this DG 77 gaming system reminds
me of the DVD a also in their push to be
more of a solutions provider rather than
just components they're introducing a
configurator so this could be integrated
with retailers for example like New Ager
something like that I believe EVGA is
also going to just have this hosted
directly on their website but it's
basically will allow you to configure a
system I would imagine using EVGA
components of course make sure
everything is compatible since you can
now get just about everything you would
want for a desktop computer all from a
VGA power supply case graphics card
motherboard CPU cooler I mean all you're
really missing is what like some storage
memory and a CPU and you can do
everything else EVGA if you want so
super convenient
check out the EVGA configurator if you
want you to configure 8 something if you
have launched these DLC coolers just
after CES this year so I've already kind
of taken a look at these just just just
to point out in case you weren't aware
you got a 280 millimeter 240 millimeter
and 120 millimeter Clos luc√© cooling
solution for CPUs they also had some
expandable versions of these that gets a
at CES those are kind of interesting but
check out Jays video and they just he
has reviewed them did a great job
playing playing dueling dueling make
EVGA videos with Kyle
all right let's talk power supply's I
recommend EVGA power slide all the time
because they're just good power supplies
go to good power supply review sites
like Johnny guru and Tec power up they
consistently give the vast majority of
EVGA power supplies really good ratings
for their internals their build quality
they work with good OMS like super
flower to put them together and they are
not only well put together but they're
quiet and they have cables that are
mostly usually all-black and blend in
with your system a little bit better
here's sort of a new one they're working
on this is the 750 g 3s there's an 80
plus gold rated power supply as part of
their supernova series and you might
notice that it's a decent size smaller
than any of these other full-size ATX
power supplies that we have around here
it is not an SFX power supply though sfx
is a small form-factor standard this is
not quite small enough to fit that
however they said they're going to have
this available enough to a thousand watt
so it's going to be the pretty much the
smallest thousand watt 8 plus gold rated
power supply that you can get and of
course it's got all the features they'd
expect from the supernova supernova
series like nice quiet fan completely
modular on the other side I would have
to imagine all the cables are going to
be the standard black cables like they
use if you've got an eco mode switch I
believe that's an eco mode switch on
that side so if you're going to build a
small form-factor system or mini ITX
system and especially if you're
considering water cooling or something
like that and just space is an issue
check it out the 750 g 3s from EVGA
I have to imagine the S stands for small
alright now let's move on to these guys
over here because I think you guys are
probably most interested in set and
excited about the X 299 products that we
have of course going along with Intel's
recently announced X cool X series of
CPUs going all the way up to 18 core 36
thread options so EVGA is starting off
with their X 299 dark this is going to
be their flagship motherboard you might
notice that it only has four dimm slots
that was an active choice because I want
to make sure that this motherboard is
going to have the capability to break
overclocking records and doing a quad
channel four dimm slot option rather
than an eight Tim slot option allows
them to hit to 300 megahertz faster
speeds when there
attempting memory overclocks with ddr4
simply due to less complexity and less
crosstalk between the channels beyond
that though the sport has a very unique
ATX design but it's ATX with a little
little pockets cut out of it so you can
still fit it in a standard ATX case at
least in some situations and you will
still be able to wrap your cables for
your 24 pin and your USB and everything
through your motherboard routing
channels like you should also down on
the bottom left they have a PCI Express
graphics supplemental connector this
will provide some additional power to
defeat the PCI Express slots especially
if you're running a bunch of different
devices and different flops and again
this one they've reset recessed with
that notch cut out that's for power
supply compatibility because a lot of
cases that's going to be where your
power supply matches up with the
motherboard and having that recess will
allow you to actually plug that in and
use it which is which is kind of cool
beyond that we also have tons of the
nvme SSD support to you dot 2's over
there and then this m dot 2 m dot 2
cooler unit here it's got a shroud it's
got an active fan and then there's an m
dot 2 right here and an m dot 2
vertically right here fan will actively
cool both of those and channel the hot
air up and out of the i/o and that will
see erratically keep your m2 SSDs cooler
which is important if you have a really
fast one like say a samsung 960 pro when
those gets too hot they start to
throttle themselves so keeping them cool
is a good idea this one also comes with
a really cool blank PCB set up here with
some standoffs so you can use this just
to set it up externally to an
outside-the-box build set up set up a
little testing workstation like like
kingpin does and I actually have one of
these that I've had for a really long
time that I got an I thought was special
so now people who get the 299 dark board
can get one of them as well moving along
to the X 299 for the wind K and check it
out EVGA has has is susceptible to RGB
LEDs as well is that first RGB LED
motherboard
they have our GB LED accents along the
erm cooling solution up here the IO the
sound area down there as well as the
chipset so that's kind of the most
distinguishing feature of this
motherboard of course but before the win
boards from EVGA
the nice reputation my expanding
classified motherboard from EVGA was
super stable so I have to give them that
credit for sure also on here
you got surface mounted power and reset
buttons debug LEDs I should point out
that that is also available over here on
the X 299 dark board although you get a
double debug LED for that one you can
actually have that read out your volt
your CPU voltage kind of interesting and
then finally of course the same type of
connectivity for nvme SSDs a couple u
dot two's a couple of dot two's as well
as an e ATX form factor so there's the X
299 for the win K and then finally again
X 299 in the micro ATX form factor v aj
vji i did this with x 99 as well they
were kind of the first out of the gate
with a micro ATX board so again this one
you've only got four dimm fluffs and
it's a pretty basic design as far as
connectivity and everything you do have
again surface mounted power me set you
have a single you that to you've got a
single MDOT to but overall looks like a
nice clean board and for anyone who's
looking to drop x 299 and an Intel Core
X CPU core x-series CPU and a smaller
form factor there's a micro ATX
motherboard available from EVGA let's
move over to the two GPUs because that's
probably what EVGA is most known for
we've got the 1080p I hydro copper there
on the right we've got the new 1080 TI
hybrid right here on the left so this
one includes custom PC V active air
cooling on the fan for the V RMS and the
power delivery and then a liquid cooling
solution with an integrated all-in 120
millimeter fan and radiator for cooling
the GPU and this is proven with a lot of
their hybrid cards in the past to be an
extremely effective solution for keeping
that GPU temperature down and
maintaining often higher boost clock
speeds to 810 PCI Express power
connectors on this one in case you guys
are wondering now the 10 HD eyes are of
course available in a wide variety of
options from EVGA these are the SC 2 on
the right and the for the win 3 on the
left and for the for the 1-3
EVGA is now offering its elites members
which you can join that club by either
being very active on the forums or
owning a lot of EVGA cards or other
things like that but you can get
different colored shrouds with these and
they showed us several different options
of those very colorful so if you're
doing a theme to build with a specific
color in mind the EVGA has got you
covered
unless you want purple
where's the purple EVGA everyone wants
purple all right let's move on to the
final card the gtx 980ti kingpin
absolute beast of a card this one's
again completely redesigned PCB this you
see a bunch of copper in there it's not
a complete copper cooling solution in
there but they have copper plated a ton
of the cooling on the card they also
have a specialized heat pipe that's on
the base plate to help keep the VRMs
cool we've got a specialized connector
for voltage measurements it has dual 810
PCI Express graphics connectors again
that are edged melted and right angled
so help them keep your cable management
clean it's got a really cool design and
it also continues to feature icx
technology which EVGA has been working
on for well for quite a while but we
originally covered with the launch of
their 1080i CX which means you have nine
sensors scattered around the PCB to help
measure things like temperature on your
V RMS so you can actively cool different
parts of the card see how the card is
performing see where you might want to
cool things down if necessary and you
can also have a synchronous fan control
so you can have one fan that spins up
for the GPU and the other fans can be
connected to the V RMS just so you can
have a more intelligent cooling solution
to keep things cool while also
optimizing for sound generation so
things are both cool and quiet EVGA is
also guaranteed that the GPUs that ship
in the King 10 cards are going to be
able to overclock to 2025 megahertz
which is pretty significant they're
doing that by bidding the GPUs to make
sure that whatever GPU you get and your
kingpin card will overclock like a beast
that's pretty cool
once again the geforce gtx 980ti kingpin
edition with icx technology from EVGA as
well as all of these EVGA parts beastly
beastly parts so guys that's all for my
coverage of a BGA's headquarters here in
new taipei city thank you so much for
watching this video if you enjoyed it of
course hit the thumbs up button and a
huge thanks again to my sponsors for
cupcakes 2017 EVGA of course as well as
msi to sore OG skill and coolermaster
thanks again for watching we'll see you
very soon with more coverage from
