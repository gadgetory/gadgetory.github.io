fractal design define our five computer
case
featuring expansive radiator support and
noise optimized engineering click the
link in the description for more
information
well hello there everyone if you can't
tell i'm kind of like a kid in a candy
store today because i have all the water
cooling parts that are going to be going
with my epic water cooling build which
is right right there you can't even see
that can you hey that's the computer see
that's this is my epic build in progress
okay it's really good if you want to see
any of the videos i've already done on
this project you can check out my water
cooling pros and cons discussions that I
did with Jays two cents I'll post a link
to that you can also check out my build
or my bill to think of this which I did
a time-lapse of I'll also post a link to
that down in the video's description
first and foremost for today though I
need to say a huge huge huge thank you
to the sponsors for the water cooling
components here so we have ek of course
who jumped in pretty early on so thank
you ek they sent over all this stuff you
can see here from fans two radiators two
blocks also a massive thank you to primo
chill they've just recently jumped in as
well they are providing the fittings and
the tubing so we have their rigid tubing
fitting so you can see right here and
then we also have PE TG tubing they have
sent over but I'm gonna end it and a
tubing bending kit we're gonna be doing
duping bending so I'm gonna go kind of
do an unboxing and look at all of these
parts for you guys today not a whole lot
of building going on unfortunately but
that's coming soon and Jay has already
promised he's gonna help me out so hit
the like button if you enjoy epic water
cooling builds and if you want to see
more of them okay one more thing
announcement wise and that is that this
piece of the build has also arrived it's
glass its tempered glass in my opinion
is infinitely superior to plexiglass and
I'm also going to be doing a side panel
mod to replace the side panel with
mostly tempered glass so that's cool too
right and here we are and there it all
is and before I go ahead and start
carrying things out of their boxes let
me go ahead and run down all the stuffs
that I have right out here in front of
me and then I'll go through one at a
time and take each one out and give you
a closer look so let's start with the
water blocks for the
graphics cards they right here these are
from UK the ek FC 980 these are made
specifically for the GTX windforce 3 or
the GTX gaming windforce graphics cards
these two right here specifically so I'm
going to be pulling off those GPU
heatsink fans and I'm going to be
dropping on these two GPU coolers and
I'll be handling that with J as well as
hopefully the rest of this water cooling
build this coming Saturday and then
hopefully have you guys the video for it
after that of course we need back plates
and these are the e KF C 980 GTX one for
three back plates big surprise there the
back plates that are made to go with
these GPU blocks and that are again made
specifically to go with the wind force
gtx 980 g1 gaming's from gigabyte okay i
have a pump and reservoir both in this
box x the e KX res 140 d 5 pwm it's the
black estill finish and of course i have
all these fans you guys might have seen
JS video on the new EK Vardar fans I
have the Furious Vardar which I think
means angry father in Slovenian that
could be wrong but these are 120 s they
go all the way up to 3000 rpm I got them
because they're all black and also
they're good fans too of course we need
to connect the GPUs together since
there's two of them so this is a
terminal so a dual parallel three slot
since I'm going to go three slot spacing
to give a little bit of space between
the GPUs and make things look kind of
cool that's to connect those two
together and then of course we have the
CPU block which is the ek supremacy Evo
one with the white version here because
it's a black and white build if you
can't tell and I thought that might
match up a bit more nicely with
everything in the case and make the
block stand out a little bit more as you
can see right now I've got the fractal
Kelvin cooler in there which is been
doing a nice job for me but the CPU
block is going to go right there at the
center and I think that's going to stand
out quite nicely especially since I'm
going to have a windowed side panel on
here once that mod is finished and then
lastly on the ek side we have two
radiators of course the 240 and the 360
both the cool stream PE which is a
little bit thinner of a radiator and I
needed thinner ones because they're not
have a whole lot of space to work with
up front I need to figure out what to do
with that drive cage
among other things but wait there's more
of course primo chill jumped in here too
and they were helping me out big time
with the fittings that you can see here
as well as the tubing now I do have some
flexible tubing I grab that because when
you're setting stuff up sometimes it
helps to have flexible tubing available
and to go along with that flexible
tubing I also have like I have flexible
tubing fittings that are right there I
just got four of those and those are
just to drop on in case I need them the
actual fittings that are made for the
hard-line PE T G tubing that we're gonna
be using are these right here now you
might notice I have a few extras I got a
total of how many is that 18 well I got
10 blacks because that's how many I need
is 10 but I also got the white ones
because I think I might want to
alternate not alternate but depending on
the thing so like the water block for
example is white so I'll probably use
black fittings on that and then the
connector for the GPUs is black so I
probably use white fittings on that
that's kind of what I'm thinking of
doing just to make them stand out a
little bit more they gave me some extra
eye rings there as well so there's
there's the fittings super sweet and
then of course the tubing at rigid PE TG
tubing you can also go through a jet
acrylic but J recommends the PE TG so I
go with his advice since he is my mentor
on this particular project
this is 3/8 inch inner diameter or 10
millimeters and 1/2 inch outer diameter
or 13 millimeters and they come in a
pack of gosh how many of these they come
in a pack of 12 which again it's more
than they need but they're 36 inches
long but that's cool since I'm going to
be learning how to do this then of
course we also had the Primo chill to
bending kit which is basically some
gloves that you can wear while you're
bending the tubing that hopefully won't
mess with it if it's warm some
microfiber cloth the little tube that
you put inside the tube because you have
to have a tube inside the tube when you
warm it up in order to bend it so it
won't collapse and then of course some
of this spray stuff which I imagine is
to keep your breath minty fresh so for
starters I have pulled the e KFC 980 GTX
wf3 GPU block as well as the e KFC 980
GTX wf3 back plate out of their boxes to
show you guys what all comes with and of
course give you a closer look so
starting here with the GPU of course
you're going to get the stuff
if you need to do the installation which
is a bit more in-depth than your typical
like video card installation or
something like that so you're gonna need
new thermal paste they've given you a
fat allen wrench to remove the plugs
they've given you a set of these small
screws which you're going to use to
attach it of course you've got some
thermal pads here you're going to need
to replace those around stuff like the
the memory modules as well as the power
delivery stuff like MOSFETs some very
detailed installation instructions here
and very specific because this is not
necessarily an entry-level project and
then of course the GPU block itself
which is right here the ek logo is
covered up and I'm gonna leave that
covered up for now at least to keep it
from getting to fingerprinted no no if
you can tell but it's got a very very
slight texture to the finish here up on
the top so you can see the LC solution
FC 9 TD GTX ws3 you can see here where
the plugs are going to connect and
that's where that I'm actually going to
be removing that so I can do that
combo adapter thing what's I called the
terminal the terminal dual parallel
three slot to add that on then of course
on the back you can see the nickel
plated copper so tons and tons of copper
back there for contact not just with the
GPU but also with all the other
important heat generating elements of
the graphics card and then of course you
can see all the connection points and
that good stuff so I am going to put
this back in the baggie it came in very
quickly to keep myself from getting any
stuff inside those little channels but
then of course we have the back plate
over here to backplate also comes with
its own set of instructions also comes
with its own set of screws also comes
with its own set of thermal pads to drop
on there and then of course with a look
at it we can see that it looks very
similar to the GPU block except on the
back instead of a lot of nickel plated
copper we have just these channels and
everything like that so still looks
really cool and that is actually going
to be the top looking down at the
graphics cards so this will be in here
like like something like this sort of
kind of
so that cutout over there is for the sli
bridges but there's a look at the GPU
stuff and telling me I said there's all
the GPU stuff but I forgot about the
terminal so the terminal is at the end
and you only need a terminal if you're
doing more than one GPU together because
what the block the GP
block actually comes with his just a
single GPU terminal and it's set up as
you can see all of the holes are open
because you have lots of different
options for where you want the inlet and
the outlet to be you can basically go in
bottom at the top either way as long as
you plug one and unplug the other and
yeah but for this one you can set this
one up to connect as you see on that
side to two of the GPS so two of those
slots go to to the GPUs you can actually
configure this a little terminal to be
serial which would feed to one GPU and
then down and then to the other one or
in parallel to feed to both of them at
the same time so depending on where you
put the plugs and all that stuff that's
how that works but then those three
little holes right there is where these
attach and I need to remove that single
card terminal to put this duel card at
terminal on and now onto the ekx res 140
DSP WM pump and reservoir you get two
sets of instructions for this one ones
for the pump itself and then this one is
for the mounting bracket that it comes
included this mounting bracket is
probably going to be necessary although
I still haven't exactly determined where
the pump and res are going to go
probably in this area I might try to
stack it on top of that drive cage
because I do need the drive cage in
there again that's that's we'll figure
all that out apart from that you get
some accessories little feet and other
mounting stuff for connecting stuff this
little foam thing here is for anti
vortex so if you're getting a vortex
swirly in your reservoir and it's
causing air to suck down into it which
is bad you can drop that in there
hopefully what that won't be needed and
then I'm gonna feel like I'm gonna have
tons of these little big fat Allen
wrenches by the time we're done some
more plugs and fittings in there
Algie one quarter of course and then the
pump which you can see is sticking with
the ek kind of Circle Square Circle
Square styling that they have going on
again a very simple design very clean
design much like the GPU blocks and much
like the back plates and even like the
terminal interchange very simple clean
designs which is why I felt like ek
would be such a great fit for this build
in particular because it's kind of a
simple basic black and white theme apart
from that there is an ek logoed kind of
stand-up thing in there as you can see
and then that's where all liquid goes
it's called the ek x-ray as 140 because
I assume it can hold like a
40 liters something and now we have
radiators as well as the fan that it
took just one out of the box I'm not
going to take all them out of the box
the radiators though are the LC solution
cool stream PE as you can see as the
label down there these are all copper
fins that we have here on the inside so
you can see the ports are currently
plugged over here ek logos and then this
one is 360 or 3 by 120 and this one is
240 or 2 by 120 and here is one of the
ek Vardar fans if you want some more
information on these ek Vardar fans and
I probably am not pronouncing that
properly but oh well J already did a
video on them he had the lower rpm ones
that have gray fan blades and I went for
these like I said because they have all
black fan blades and I didn't think the
gray would really go particularly well
although who knows the gray might've
looked ok - I didn't know though that
they had these oh my gosh bright red
sleeved cables which isn't all that bad
there there it's a nice little sleeping
job there however no plans for red in my
system so I might have to also figure
out a solution for that we'll see how
bright they are but you can see it's got
some vents there to provide some cooling
for the actual motor on the inside and
as Jay found in his testing these are
very powerful and also very very quiet
so very very much looking forward to
those and I've got enough for a just
push configuration on both of these so
five spots five fans I'm not doing push
pull and that's simply because I don't
have room in the case and finally we
have the CPU block the ek supremacy Evo
white edition supremacy Evo has long
been regarded as a very very or one of
the best CPU blocks available on the
market and the Evo has a I'm sorry ek
has quite a few different variations of
it this is the white version which I got
because my builds black and whites for a
surprise apart from the block itself you
get a couple back plates which I'm not
going to need for AMD as well as other
Intel bret sockets aside from enthusiast
mounting hardware that's located right
there you get a couple of these little
jet plates where it should actually some
internal components for the blocks you
can switch does that to switch the
diameter that's all I'm guessing going
to change the amount
of water there the liquid that's flowing
through there this is another internal
component here which you can swap out
which I'm actually not a hundred percent
sure of what it does I'm guessing it's
if you want to switch or reverse the
flow in there then that's something that
you can do but I'm gonna double check
with J so I guess you guys have to watch
the building video to find an actual
answer for that ek has also provided you
with some thermal paste thankfully and
that about does it but let's take a
closer look at the block as you can see
all white finish again there's an ek
logo there that's covered by sticker
right which I'm not going to remove yet
pretty simple clean design again on the
outside you can see the bottom has a
please remove before use sticker
covering the finish on there and the
copper plate and that's pretty much it
looks fairly simple but internally
there's a it's got some plastic piece
which channels the liquid over the
copper fins and helps to effectively
dissipate heat but let me switch over
now and talk a little bit more about
these fittings that I got here from
primo chill and although my alignment of
them has gotten messed up a little bit
the reason I got black and white was
because I was pretty sure even though I
got this all whites CPU block here that
I wouldn't want to go like white on
white because that doesn't really
completely match unfortunately so I'm
okay having them both in the case but I
wouldn't want that merit I talk of each
other plus I think a black fitting right
there he's gonna pop a lot more same
goes for these white fittings and
putting them on uh something black like
the radiator
that'll make those pop a lot more so
that's kind of why I have the two color
option going as you can see and now that
I have all this stuff like out of the
box and I've finally been playing around
with it I really really can't wait so I
hope you guys are with me on that one
and that is all for this video guys
thank you so much for watching like the
video if you're wondering how the heck I
got everything back into these boxes so
pristinely I don't know how I did it and
it's just magic don't forget to also
head over to store Paul's Harbor net you
can buy a shirt like this one and that
helps support the cause you can change
your link to Amazon to my Amazon link
then I get a little kickback when you
shop at Amazon that helps too and if
nothing else thank you so much for
watching this video stay tuned for the
next one
we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
