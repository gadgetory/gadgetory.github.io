what kind of seems like AMD waited for
the perfect time to introduce the risin
+ Vega processors that I'm reviewing
today the risin 320 200 G and the risin
520 400 G that's because it's never been
more challenging to build a budget
gaming computer GPU prices are
ridiculous memory prices are just as bad
and there's a whole generation of new PC
gamers who just want to build a computer
and play some freaking video games
already so these are AP use possibly the
answer to that dilemma their accelerated
processing units according to AMD which
means that there is a quad-core CPU and
a Vega based GPU included in each of
these chips so while you'll still need
to buy a ddr4 memory you can at least
get by without a graphics card and still
play games for today's video I'll be
sharing some gaming and performance
benchmark numbers for both of these new
ap use but my goal is to answer a few
simple questions are these viable for
1080p gaming can you play currently
popular games with them and how do they
stack up to other budget gaming
alternatives so let's start off by
taking a quick look at the specs the
Rison 320 200 G is only $99 MSRP and
it's a quad-core CPU without SMT so 4
cores and 4 threads the CPU has a base
clock of 3.5 gigahertz and XFR will peg
one or two of those cores to up to 3.7
gigahertz under load if temperatures
aren't too hot officially the 2200 G has
a 65 watt TDP although it's variable
according to AMD 45 to 65 watts is what
they actually list that's because the
heat output of any given processor will
change depending on the CPU and GPU
clock speeds so if you overclock it
TEP goes up if you under clock it or run
it at a lower frequency TDP might go
down the a.m. for platform that these
apu slot into does support cpus with up
to a 95 watt TDP so depending on the
power delivery hardware in your chosen
motherboard you should have some
overclocking
and I'm not going to be overclocking
today just FYI but the CPU and GPU and
both of these chips are both unlocked
and I do have a full build plan that I
will be giving the OC treatment to in
the future the 2200 G's integrated GPU
is classified as Vega 8 it runs at
eleven hundred megahertz by default with
eight compute units 512 I'll use 32
texture mapping units and draw graphics
compute power of 2.25 teraflops
floating-point 16 the risin 5 2400 G
will cost you a bit more it's a hundred
and $69 MSRP and it is also a quad-core
CPU but it has simultaneous
multi-threading so it provides 8 threads
for your operating system to work with
base clock is 3.6 gigahertz and loose
clock is 3.9 gigahertz when temperatures
permit of course it's also fully
unlocked for CPU and or GPU overclocking
with a 65 watt TDP and the GPU and the
2400 G is a Vega 11 running at 1215
megahertz by default with 11 compute
units 704 tail use 44 texture mapping
units and raw graphics compute power of
3.5 to teraflops floating-point 16 let's
move into some comparison benchmarks and
I do still run all my benchmarks fresh
all of these were handled just in this
past weekend I will add some extra CPU
comparisons when I'm specifically
looking at CPU performance charts but
for gaming I wanted to do a current test
of the best a GPU that Intel offers on
the desktop side which right now is the
Intel u HD graphics 630 that you can
find on coffee like chips I used my 8700
K for this and while this was mostly for
the gaming numbers of the eye GPU please
bear in mind when we get to the 3d mark
physics and CPU tests that the 8700 K
costs more than double with the 2400 G
costs and almost four times the cost of
the $100 2200 G so please bear that in
mind that said I also added a gtx 1050
Ti to the Intel platform and ran numbers
on that as well and that's because
that's apparently the lowest power
discrete GPU that I actually have on
hand right now I know a GT 1030 from an
video would probably be a more apt
discrete GPU comparison here but I've
never once recommended that GPU to
anyone I wanted kind of a more real
low-end budget GPU option that I've
recommended to people so that's why I
chose the GTX 1050 T I also bear in mind
it costs well over 200
right now so it also costs more than
either of these AP use and that is fifty
two hundred dollars more than the ten
fifty T is MSRP which should be more
like a hundred and fifty issue dollars
anyway my Intel testbed used an asus rog
Strix z 370 - i gaming motherboard a
samsung 960 pro 512 gig nvme SSD and 16
gigs of g-scale flex ddr4 memory set -
its ddr4 3200 casa latency 14 XMP
setting I rise in test bed was based on
the gigabytes a be 350 n gaming Wi-Fi
mini ITX motherboard it also used a
samsung 960 pro 512 ua nvme SSD and the
same 16 gig g.skill flex ddr4 memory kit
also set to the same ddr4 3200 casa
latency 14 XMP settings i made
absolutely sure to use the exact same
memory with the exact same speed because
the I GPUs use the system memory for
graphics memory and that can very much
affect your graphics performance so
let's jump into the benchmarks I've got
CPU focused gaming focus and I'll end
with some actual footage of gameplay
testing and some testing of what
settings you need to go with actually
play some of these games at 1080 with
Cinebench D multi-threaded tests which
saw the 2200 G with all four cores
scoring 565 points and a 2400 G scoring
816 because it has quad core with
multi-threading if we move over to the
single thread tests you can tell when
you're comparing this to some of the
mainstream rise and stuff single thread
performance should be roughly in the
same ballpark in fact if you're running
this at the same frequency as say an
1800 X you should get almost exactly the
same results 145 and $152 the 2200 G and
2400 G respectively moving over to CPU
mark this is the CPU test specifically
and the overall score for the 2400 G was
ten thousand two hundred and twenty with
a single thread score coming in at 1972
you can see the slight variance here
again with the single threaded tests and
this is again mainly because the 2400 G
is running about 200 megahertz faster
frequency on the single core than the
2200 G let's move over to blender a bit
more of a practical test here when
testing the splash fishy cat
demonstration we saw a total time of
just over 60 seconds for the 2400 G and
then ramp that up to 70 3.2 seconds for
the 2200 G I will say looking at these
CPU numbers right out of the gates
they're not bad by any stretch of course
if you're comparing them to the higher
end stuff that you can get on the Rison
platform or especially the higher end
stuff that intel offers the numbers for
the AP us aren't going to be quite as
impressive but you have to keep the
price in mind and also the fact that
these come with a GPU integrated which
many of these comparison CPUs do not
finally for CPU specific tests here's
the blender BMW 27 tests and here you
can see that as you're moving to longer
tests or if you're comparing this to say
rendering video or something like that
when you go from 4 cores and 4 threads
to something with 6 cores or 8 cores or
beyond
you get a vast reduction in your actual
compute time and here is probably the
best example of where you might tell
someone who's going to consider one of
these AP use for something that's more
CPU compute oriented maybe opt for
something with a higher core count
because you're going to get more benefit
out of that that said these ApS are
still of course perfectly viable for
doing stuff like working with render or
video editing you're just gonna be
waiting more time for your project to
render out moving over to some gaming
tests now and starting with the 3d mark
firestrike synthetic this is just
standard fire strike and here again I
want to point out that when you're
looking at overall scores and physics
scores the 8700 K tests have a huge
advantage and that's largely because
it's on a much more expensive platform
so I'm in no way trying to tell you guys
that these are directly comparable CPUs
I just wanted to include all of these
scores so that the charts will line up
and everything and mainly here you want
to look at the graphics tests so the UHD
six-thirty graphics test scores a
pitiful 1452 we're getting double that
with the 2200 G with a score over 3,000
and more than that 3609 for the 2400 G
as we move over to 3d mark time spy this
is a DirectX 12 test this is also much
more intense tests and it was pretty
much a slideshow with the AP use as I
tested them however they were still able
to get through its scoring 1015 overall
for the 2200 G 1244 for the 2400 G and
again if you compare that to what
the IGP you on the 8700 K is capable of
483 total score and the graphics coming
in at just 416 shows you the massive
advantage that the integrated Vega
graphics has compared to what Intel's
working with at least on the current
platform and now on to some actual games
and I've chosen a few here that I found
were popular and also playable on lower
end systems so let's start out with for
tonight becoming insanely popular as
sort of a player knowns battlegrounds
replacement and actually playing this a
little bit I had a lot of fun the 2200 G
that was able to get about 23 frames per
second on average 2400 G got up to 29
frames per second on average bear in
mind this is with the high quality
presets and this is mainly set that way
to compare it to
as you can see something a little bit
more reasonable when it comes to a
discrete GPU like the 1050 Ti can't get
around 66 frames per second wait just a
minute though and I'm going to be
testing this live and I will show you
some settings that you can use in order
to get a much more playable frame rate
out of fortnight especially with one of
these ap use next up is overwatch and
sanely fun game they keep adding more
things to it and more heroes and
everything so I actually need to get
back into this I feel like I haven't
played it quite as much but also really
well optimized here and we got 52 FPS
out of the 22 hundred G's 61 out of the
2400 G and this is with the high
settings and 100% run render scale again
I'll be testing this in just a minutes
to show you guys some more reasonable
settings to use with this game if you
want to play at 1080 and gets playable
60 frames per second or better frame
rates moving average player unknowns
battlegrounds and this game feels like
it could use some more optimisation I
think it's a much smaller team than the
team at fortnight has working on it but
I was only able to eke out about 23.4
frames per second with the 2200 G just
over 30 frames per second with 2400 G
that's at medium settings so medium not
super high but still not super low
either this game could probably use a
little bit more work or perhaps some
driver optimization specifically for
these GPUs
compare that to the 1050 Ti which is
getting 72 frames per second on average
and you can see one of the benefits you
get by spending more money on a discrete
GPU however I want to point out there
was an issue with the 2400 G that I
experienced and that I talked to Kyle
about and he
- which was stuttering and inconsistency
it's like you'd play the game it would
be okay for 20 seconds and then you have
three or four seconds where it would
slow way down you get into the
single-digit frame rates and then it
seems like it would recover and it'd go
back to a more normal frame rate this
seems very much to me to be something
that is probably going to be a driver
fix that they need to come out with that
said if you look at the 1% low numbers
on player unknowns battlegrounds as well
as back on the fortnight numbers my 1%
lows were less we're lower with the
2,400 G then with the 2200 G and this is
representative of those stuttery
inconsistent frame rate points that I
went through
unfortunately that made the game very
difficult to play and it did persist
through my gameplay testing that we'll
get to in just a second and let's move
on to total warhammer - this was
actually benchmark with the ultra preset
so that made it much more challenging as
you can see from the frame rate numbers
2200 G less than 10 FPS 2400 G at 12 fps
you could get better numbers out of this
by changing the actual preset from ultra
down to something a little bit more
playable but I just wanted to point out
when you have lots of draw calls when
you have lots of units on the screen
it's going to bog down lower and
graphics cards and especially when you
start to get above the actual GPU memory
limits which is 1 gigabyte by default
with the 2200 G and 2400 G that's gonna
lead to some issues as well that made
total war Warhammer - not very easy to
play at all in the AP use and probably
something that you'd want to crank those
settings way down on to play at a more
reasonable frame rate speaking of
reasonable frame rate though GTA 5 at
1080 doing quite well here also probably
due to game optimizations but it's also
been out for a little while longer but
44 FPS on average though for the 2200
G's 69 FPS for the 2400 G very
reasonable 1% low numbers as well so if
you've been itching to play GTA 5 on the
PC and you haven't been able to these
are pretty solid choices for that bear
in mind again I'm using not the highest
settings that I typically do when I test
higher higher in graphics cards most of
the stuff is set to normal with some of
the detail levels and that kind of thing
to turn down but all those settings are
listed at the bottom if you guys want to
check it out so the next thing I did was
some actual play testing and I screen
capped this and I played three different
games overwatch fortnight as well as
player knowns battlegrounds I did
20200 G and the 2400 G and I messed with
the settings to try to get a frame rate
above 60 fps playing at 1920 by 1080 and
I wanted to show you guys the actual
gameplay as well as what it looks like
and the frame counter is in the top left
hand corner from fraps so starting off
with overwatch first thing I did was
switched from the high preset that I
used in the benchmarks I just showed you
down to medium
overwatch when I did this automatically
did a 75% scaling as well so those two
combined resulted in pretty consistent
made 60 frames per second gameplay so
the 20 200 G I am happy to say it's
perfectly capable of playing overwatch
you just gotta turn the scaling down a
little bit I don't always like messing
with the scaling but it is definitely a
very viable option if you're limited on
GPU power moving out a fortnight's here
I started with the medium preset and
tested that out a little bit and the
grass turned off that can apparently
improve frame rates I was getting mid to
low 40 frames per second actual results
so then I switched it down to low but
with 100% scaling and this resulted in a
very playable 70 to 80 frames per second
sometimes even getting up to the hundred
frames per second range but fortnight's
thankfully allows you to scale those
graphic settings way down so even with a
fairly underpowered system you're able
to get some pretty decent frame rates
next up is player on owns battlegrounds
very popular but I already mentioned
going through the initial benchmarks
that the frame rates were not all that
great I actually had to crank the 2200 G
all the way down to the very low setting
and crank the scaling all the way down
to 70 and still I was in the mid 40s per
second range I did note that it was
using all the vram 1 total gig of VRAM
so that spills over into the
supplemental vram that these chips are
capable of handling although I'm not
delving into that too much for this
video once you get past that one gig
limit it seems to start to slow things
down and definitely player unknowns
battlegrounds suffers from this so
you're probably gonna have to go below
1080 if you want to get above 60 frames
per second if you use the 2200 G and
player and ons battlegrounds barring
some some driver update that fixes
things really well or something like
that living up to the 2400 G and back
over to overwatch here again I
had to bump down to the medium preset
but I was able to do 100% scaling so if
you're comparing the frame rates that
you're seeing here to the 2200 G they're
kind of similar but how two percent
scaling with the 24 energy 75 percent
scaling with the 2200 G it was mostly
above 60 frames per second even getting
above 70 some times but I will point out
them when I got into a more intense
firefight the frame rate would dip down
to the mid 40s saw something that you
might play around with even more
thankfully overwatch is really good when
it comes to graphic settings and getting
something that gets you the most frames
for your GPU did not fortunately suffer
from the stuttering fortnight and player
knowns battlegrounds did speaking of
which fortnight's so here is probably
your first introduction to these weird
stuttering issues they were sporadic
they would come and go I could play for
a couple minutes and not experience it
at all just very much an indication that
this probably needs some optimization on
the drivers side but it's definitely
frustrating if you're playing this and
it happens at the wrong time right as
you're going to try to kill someone not
that I was able to kill anyone I'm
horrible at all of these games I started
at medium I was getting in the mid to
high 44 second range I turned the view
distance and anti-aliasing down and I
was able to get to just under 60 frames
per second but eventually I just
switched back to low same setting I was
using it with 220 200 G with
hundred-percent scaling and there I was
getting around 80 FPS sometimes going
over 100 but again every so often would
encounter those stutters that made
playing pretty difficult
and finally player unknowns
battlegrounds here I eventually after
testing a couple things realize like you
know it I wasn't getting very good
framerate with a 2200 G so just redo
those settings very low was 74% scaling
still only getting in the 40 to 50
frames per second range and still
plagued pretty regularly by those weird
hiccups and stutters FPS tipping down to
the single digit range happens the most
in my opinion in player unknowns
battlegrounds so hopefully a software or
driver updates will fix this since I
didn't really notice these hiccups of
stutters with the 2200 G so before
wrapping up if you read enough so I
wanted to point out just things that
appeared to me that I found interesting
first off there's no temperature control
knob on this one or offsets thread
Ripper as well as the mainstream rise in
CPUs have a temperature offset that
tricks your system into cranking up your
fan speeds
the CPU will be the lower temperature
and it will overclock itself more not
the case on these ApS what you see is
what you get the video ads I was
actually asked about lots of video outs
on existing B 350 and X 370 motherboards
what do they actually support if your at
1080p you can go all the way up to 240
Hertz so if you're playing like a csgo
or something like that that is good to
know
1440p you can go up to 144 Hertz and at
4k you can go up to 60 Hertz and that's
just default out of the video outs back
here which includes on this motherboard
at least an hdmi and displayport bear in
mind that these ap use are compatible
with free sync however free sync
requires DisplayPort so if you're
getting one of these ap use and like a
cheap free sync monitor which is a great
idea make sure that your motherboard has
a DisplayPort out that's very important
as for temperatures and in case I didn't
point it out clearly enough already I
wanted to use everything the way it
comes so I've been cooling these with
the wraith stealth coolers that came in
the box with either of these ap use it
did an okay job 2200 G was pretty
reasonable temperatures were typically
in the low 60 Celsius range peaking at
about 70 degrees Celsius 2400 G however
ran much warmer and that's probably due
to the higher clock speeds simultaneous
multithreading
more GPU compute units 70 degrees
Celsius was more common on average and
87 degrees Celsius was what the CPU got
to max 77 degrees Celsius was the max
that the GPU got to and bear in mind
that those temperatures are taken into
account when it comes to XF bar so you
might induce throttling in some
situations if you're using the 2400 G
with the rate stealth cooler so these a
fuse would probably benefit from an
aftermarket cooler especially if you're
going to be overclocking and especially
if you're overclocking the CPU and the
GPU alright so let's talk pros and cons
I'm gonna start with the negatives 2400
G and it's stuttering issues definitely
stood out the most to me it was just a
little bit disappointing when it comes
to the performance but again probably
just a driver update issue that will
hopefully be addressed very soon by AMD
I also want to point out that the Wraith
stealth while being a perfectly adequate
out of the box included cooler just not
quite capable of handling with 2400 G at
full throttle
so high temperatures might limit
performance especially if you're in a
more tight enclosure with less airflow I
was testing all these just in open test
beds high temperatures do limit
performance and definitely limits the
ability for XFR to do its job and crank
those clock speeds up the best
performance also with these aps and this
is just applies to resin in general
requires high speed ddr4 even more so
applies when that high speed ddr4 is
being used as the GPUs memory as well
and that's just still very expensive so
you're gonna want to pick and choose and
find yourself some 29 33 or 3200 speed
memory and finding a good deal on that
is pretty challenging right now moving
over to positives though excellent
performance per dollar for 1080p gaming
and you don't need to buy a graphics
card and I will say especially from the
$99 2200 G if I had one takeaway from
this whole thing it's at the 2200 G at
$99 seems like a great deal and the 2400
G at $170 seems like an okay deal the
improvement that you get for the 2400 G
just isn't insanely that much better at
least according to my numbers today and
the 2200 G 99 bucks that's 99 dollars
for this and then like 99 dollars for
this motherboard and that's your GPU
your CPU and your motherboard for 200
bucks pretty reasonable extremely
budget-friendly especially in today's
GPU pricing environments and definitely
a lot of fun Mini ITX build potential I
think coming up to the upgrade path I
also wanted to point out it slots into a
m4 so you can get one of these little
$99 AP use with a GPU in it slot it into
say a higher-end X 370 motherboard and
you'll have an upgrade path in the
future to yourself like an 1800 X or
even one of the rise in two CPUs that
AMD is promising will come out soon like
in the next month or two I think but
guys that is going to wrap it up for
this video on the new AMD reisen AP use
the Rison 320 200 G and the Rison 520
400 G really nice performance I'm
impressed I hope you guys are impressed
too and leave me a thumbs up button on
this video if you enjoy it and of course
your comments are always welcome down in
the comments section below let me know
what you think let me know if you have
any ideas if you're planning on buying
one I'll put links to these in the
video's description so if you guys want
to click those also very much
appreciated
one last thing I've been kind of back in
some of the swing of things this week
with video
I wanted to say a big thank you to any
of you guys who have come out and been
like hey yeah go Paul or we missed you
or anything like that it's really been
helpful as I've been getting back in the
swing of things and it makes it warms
the cockles of my heart okay I finished
this video off by saying couples I
should end now anyway though guys I've
said enough already thank you again for
watching this video and we'll see you
