just had to do one today because there
was sort of an incident last night and I
was right there in it and I was so
excited when it happened if you guys are

are you're following me because of Linus
because last night he did a live stream
and he like totally plugged my channel
my channel as well as Kyle's channel
which is awesomesauce news you should
check out that one as well and I got
like literally like 95% of my
subscribers right now a direct result of
him so I want to say a huge thank you to
Linus when we started doing videos with
Newegg I was always like while Linus is
up there he's got so many subscribers he
does a really good job at a lot of
respect for him and now I like also know
he's really a very nice person as well
so Thank You Linus
thank you to all my subscribers who are
not subscribers as a result of Linus as
well as all the other subscribers
because you guys are awesome and I'm
really wanting to make lots of videos
for you guys now to live up to your
expectations I hope but yeah that's just
a quick one for today this is like our
kind of video gaming room for me and my
wife like where we play video games and
stuff and just sort of store a bunch of
everything I'm about to do a bunch of
sort of rearranging in here I would tie
kiya today I got a couple new tables and
stuff I'm going to try to set stuff up
in here so it looks somewhat nice but
this is like this is a kind of raw I
haven't like bothered to clean up or
anything like that but there's my
computer you guys were asking about my
peripherals so I guess I could point
that out 27-inch plain our LCD right
