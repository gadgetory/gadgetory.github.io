hardware this is my second video and I
just had to do one today because there
was sort of an incident last night and I
was right there in it and I was so
excited when it happened if you guys are
following my channel right now chances
are you're following me because of Linus
because last night he did a live stream
and he like totally plugged my channel
my channel as well as Kyle's channel
which is awesomesauce news you should
check out that one as well and I got
like literally like 95% of my
subscribers right now a direct result of
him so I want to say a huge thank you to
Linus when we started doing videos with
Newegg I was always like while Linus is
up there he's got so many subscribers he
does a really good job at a lot of
respect for him and now I like also know
he's really a very nice person as well
so Thank You Linus
thank you to all my subscribers who are
not subscribers as a result of Linus as
well as all the other subscribers
because you guys are awesome and I'm
really wanting to make lots of videos
for you guys now to live up to your
expectations I hope but yeah that's just
a quick one for today this is like our
kind of video gaming room for me and my
wife like where we play video games and
stuff and just sort of store a bunch of
everything I'm about to do a bunch of
sort of rearranging in here I would tie
kiya today I got a couple new tables and
stuff I'm going to try to set stuff up
in here so it looks somewhat nice but
this is like this is a kind of raw I
haven't like bothered to clean up or
anything like that but there's my
computer you guys were asking about my
peripherals so I guess I could point
that out 27-inch plain our LCD right
there 24 inch sceptre this one's 19 by
12
this one's 1080 they work I like him my
lap my keyboard is a Microsoft aergon
ammok maybe not what you guys are
expecting I've tried lots of mechanical
gaming keyboards I just really like this
one I like Kerrigan on keyboards I have
a thing about typing with my hands the
right angles Mouse is a logitech mx518
old standby beautiful Mouse I think it's
one of the best gaming mice ever made
just is so comfortable work so well nice
hack your tracking not super expensive
gets the job done
anyway that's to be all for this video
thanks again all my subscribers I will
hopefully be posting again very soon
hopefully going to get everything set up
in here so it looks nice and so I can
shoot videos and do builds and all that
kind of stuff for you guys
