to build a PC in 2019 tutorial series in
the first part we talked about all the
parts of a computer and gave some
suggestions on what you should
potentially buy to assemble your own
system in part two we actually assembled
the system we built two systems and
Intel build and an AMD build today I'm
going to be focusing on installing
Windows 10 getting everything set up the
way you want it to working with the UEFI
to make sure that the memory is running
at the right speed and everything and
even getting so far as to installing
steam and other game clients and maybe
even gaming and streaming at the same
time but first today's video is brought
to you by Squarespace go to
squarespace.com slash Paul's hardware
and get 10% off of your first order more
on that later in the video but for now
let's get started so let's start out
with what you need of course the
computer that you just built is
necessary you will need the cables to
connect it which mostly should come with
the computer itself either in the power
supply box for the power cable you might
need a video cable for example like HDMI
I am connected up to this monitor via
the graphics card also I installed the
r-tx 2016 here which I initially
intended to install in the build video
which I've swapped accidentally you guys
forgive me of course but we're not
working with the proper graphics card
that I intended to install in the first
place and we have of course the keyboard
and mouse we have the monitor we have an
internet connection that's represented
by my Ethernet cable over here
additionally you're going to need
another computer that's right a
functional working computer and that is
so you can set up a Windows 10
installation USB so you will also need a
little USB Drive for that I recommend an
8 gig Drive but just remember everything
that's on the drive is gonna be wiped so
don't have anything stored on there
speaking of storage and backing up stuff
I highly recommend getting some form of
external storage and that is so you can
both backup if you have an existing
computer that you're transitioning over
to the new computer from and to copy all
that stuff externally so you can copy it
onto the new computer but also having
everything saved in more than one
location I'm not going to go into
long-term backup storage solutions or
anything like that but my general rule
of thumb is have everything saved on at
least two drives so especially if you're
talking about personal stuff pictures
stuff that's not replaceable get it on a
storage drive that's external as well as
something that's internal in your
computer and I'll talk about doing that
and setting that up in just a minute
so for that purpose you'll also probably
want an extra Drive that's installed in
the computer
right now I've only got a single Drive
installed in here but I'm going to be
adding one more and that could be
another SSD like this 2.5 inch drive or
it could be a spinning mechanical hard
drive like this WD black 3.5 inch drive
they're both SATA drives so they both
plug in the same way and finally for
that gaming part at the end I have a
headset so both headphones so I can hear
sound from the game as well as a
microphone so I can talk to people in
game if I don't want to be a complete
noob and if you're at all considering
gaming and streaming at the same time
then you might want a webcam or
something so you can show your face on
your stream so for that I'm just going
to be using this a Logitech c920 I will
link an updated version of this in the
video's description down below as well
so what we're gonna do now is set up
this USB drive to be a Windows 10
installer to take Windows 10 and install
it onto the SSD that's already installed
in the system so for that you're gonna
need your existing computer go ahead and
open that up and take your USB drive and
plug it in from there you'll want to
navigate to the windows 10 website I'll
post a link to this in the video's
description but you wants the create
Windows 10 installation media function
click download tool now so from there
just go to your downloads folder and
launch the media creation tool you'll
get a little pop-up click OK and from
there you'll see this screen that says
getting a few things ready with a little
spinny wait a moment
dial so give it a minute and it should
pop up with the next screen we are
definitely going to agree to these
licensing terms hit accept
wait a few more moments and then you'll
see this screen we don't want to upgrade
this PC we don't want to create an
installation media USB flash drive so
I'll click Next there choose your
language Edition and architecture all of
these are fine English Windows 10 and 64
bits these are recommended options you
can uncheck that if you want to but I'm
gonna hit next and here we're gonna use
a USB flash drive needs to be eight gigs
we'll hit next there once again and then
it has recognized the only connected USB
flash drive that it deems is eligible to
install to do double check if you have
other drives connected that you're not
overriding any of those this is our only
drive that we want to install to you
right there hit next and then it'll take
a few minutes to copy all the windows 10
information onto your USB Drive while
it's doing that head over to your
motherboard manufacturers websites the
motherboard in here is the MSI B 450
tomahawk search for your motherboard on
your motherboard manufacturers website
you should have a support page that you
can access you can also download the
latest bios or UEFI version for your
motherboard I have one that's just
a little shy of a month old so I'm gonna
go ahead and download that the latest
version and then I'm going to go over to
drivers and here we just want to make
sure that we have the right drivers for
the operating system which is windows 10
64-bit and then here we want land
drivers because we want to make sure
that after we install Windows we can
access the Internet on the new system to
download any additional drivers that we
might want so PC a Ethernet drivers is a
good one to grab the Windows 10
installer might recognize your Ethernet
adapter by defaults but it's good to
have this on hand just in case it does
it because getting this computer
connected to the Internet is important
also if your motherboard happens to have
Wi-Fi integrated which this does not you
could also download your motherboards
Wi-Fi drivers and then you can connect
to your router via Wi-Fi either way
works as long as you get an internet
connection
while we're waiting if anyone is
concerned that I'm not doing the
installation on this Intel build I put
together
it is literally pretty much exactly the
same the only difference is is that the
motherboard manufacturers website is
going to be for the Intel motherboard
that's installed here rather than the
AMD board that's installed over there
other than that you need the same
drivers and software and everything for
this system that you need for that
system and the USB flash drive is ready
hooray we can hit finish Before we jump
over to the new PC though I'm gonna go
into that USB Drive that was just
created still has some space left over
on it and I'm going to copy the stuff I
downloaded from the motherboard
manufacturers website I made a new
folder for these files and I'm gonna
take the BIOS that was downloaded and
move that as well as the driver for the
land I just relabeled those folders so I
know what is what and now we can switch
over to the new PC I'm just gonna take
my USB from the computer I use to create
the Windows 10 installer plug it in to
one of the USB ports on the back of my
system here and then we can turn the
system on make sure the switch back here
is in the right position then just power
button should do it and when you first
boot up a new computer for the first
time it's going to access the
motherboards UEFI or BIOS and you'll
also probably see on the monitor it's
connected to a splash screen usually
it's got the logo of the motherboard
manufacturer right now we see Arsenal
gaming and at the bottom you will see
very very briefly some information about
hitting the delete button to enter the
UEFI BIOS you can double check what that
splash screen says but it is almost
always the Delete
button so as the system is booting up
I'm just gonna tap the delete' button
once every second or two and that should
allow me to access the UEFI bios
this is MSI it's got a graphic user
interface so you can actually use your
mouse to navigate around and click on
different things and the first thing I
always do is just reality check to make
sure that everything you installed is
actually there and installed and
functional you can see the motherboard
listed in the top right view 450
tomahawk our CPU is the risin 5 2600
memory installed is 8 gigs which reminds
me that I installed an 8 gig kit in this
system rather than a 16 gig kick that
was recommended I'll fix that in just a
second we can also see the vcore DDR
voltage some other stuff bios version is
listed right here so we're gonna do
first is update the BIOS there's
different ways to do that for MSI there
you have a utility called em flash so I
can click over here and em flash and hit
OK the system will quickly reboot into
BIOS flashing mode a gigabyte and Asus
have functions allow you to update the
BIOS from within the UEFI you just need
to access the Q flash feature double
check your motherboards manual and it
should have a walkthrough for that just
make sure that if you're updating your
systems BIOS the system stays plugged in
and powered on you don't want to power
it off especially if it's a mid update
that is a way that you can potentially
brick your motherboard and force you to
reinstall it
but we've rebooted here into M flash
mode my USB Drive is already plugged in
I'm gonna go to the folder I created MSI
B 450 tomahawk click on the UEFI BIOS
folder I made and here we can see the
file that I am updating to version 1.5
we are currently using version 1 so
that's that's good for me click on that
and hit OK and give it just a few
moments while that updates the BIOS the
BIOS if they completed the system
automatically restart afterwards and I
am tapping the delete button upon the
restart to get back into the BIOS
because we're not quite done yet
actually before any of that I'm going to
install a 16 gig memory kit because this
memory kid is 8 gigs I intended to
install a 16 gig kit but the kid I had
that was matching as the wrong size so
let me pop these up now the system is
starting back up again and I'm tapping
delete once again to get back into the
UEFI sometimes we get a message like
this if you swap out memory or a CPU so
if you're upgrading from a 2200 G to a
2600 for example you'd probably see this
that's okay it just means the system
recognized it something changed so it
wants to go into the UEFI to make sure
all the settings are appropriate before
it proceeds to try it
windows now we can again double check
and make sure everything's looking good
memory size is now up to 16 gigs so
that's awesome when it comes to memory
it will automatically run at a default
speed and for this platform that is 2133
since you probably bought faster memory
you want to make sure the memory is
running at the faster speed that it's
capable of running at and assuming that
you bought rise in compatible memory you
should be able to just do the easy thing
which is to enable XMP settings in order
to get that up and running a mess I made
a shortcut for it up here it's just an
on/off button so click on and now it's
on and down here there's actually two
XMP profiles for this memory kit one's a
slower speed of 3066
when is it faster speed of 3400 I want
the faster speed so I'm gonna go as
profile - just like that's finally going
down to storage I'm just double checking
to make sure the SSD I have installed is
being recognized I just installed the
SanDisk 240 gig so that's right there -
also our SATA controller is an AHCI mode
which it should be by default but that's
something that's also good to
double-check one last thing before we
back out of here is our fans and here I
noticing that one fan in particular is
running a little loud all the fans are
plugged into fan headers on the
motherboard and those are all labeled
the one that's being loud is the one
that's plugged into the pump fan header
so I'm just going to click on this P
pump fan I'm gonna click the little gear
icon and then I'm going to make it
slower also it's only a three pin plug
for that fan so it does not have PWM
that's what the four spin four is for
with fan plugs so I'm gonna switch to DC
mode and then I'm just gonna grab these
these guys on here and move them down so
that it runs a lower rpm at a lower
temperature there's a bunch of different
squeaking and stuff you can do with this
type of thing but I'm just keeping it
simple for now okay once you've made the
changes you want to make in the ufi you
can usually hit f10 to save and exits
that's one way to do it
or here in the MSI board we can go to
Advanced Mode and settings and then
there also we have a save and exit exit
option Save Changes and reboots that's
gonna save and reboot and then we want
it to boot off of that USB Drive the
windows 10 installer that we just
created we could go back into the UEFI
and change the boot priority or we can
hit f11 and as the splash screen pops up
here once again at the very bottom we
should see a very very quick list of
other things you can press besides
delete one of those is f11 F 11 takes
you to a quick boot menu and here we can
manually tell the system I want
to boot off of the UEFI USB disk that I
just created
do you efi not just USB disk you want
UEFI mode and hit OK on that and then it
will start booting off of that drive and
get you into the Windows 10 installation
environment so now we're actually
installing Windows 10 you can choose
alternate languages here as well as time
and currency format so we're going to
leave those all at defaults and then
here you can install or repair keep this
USB installer because you can't use it
for repair functions in the future but
we're just going to click install now
just a brief moment well it loads up
some installation stuff here's where you
can plug in your Windows 10 product key
if you happen to already have one don't
worry if you don't click I don't have a
product key we can grab one later and
then here's where you choose the version
you want to install I usually go with
Windows 10 Pro you can also go with
Windows 10 home those are the two
choices I would recommend for you guys
for our purposes we're gonna go with
Windows 10 Pro 4 right now we have more
license terms which we of course will
read thoroughly and agree to and then
here we're gonna click custom rather
than upgrade I always like custom
installs do it clean do it fresh and
that will take you to this interface
where you choose which drive to install
- I only have one drive connected that
is drive 0 but this drive has been used
before which means it already has some
partitions on it now bearing in mind
that we're going to be deleting
everything that's on this drive so of
course we've already double checked to
make sure there's no important
information we're just going to delete
all the existing partitions on the drive
so that we're left with nothing but
unallocated space and then we can
install windows onto that unallocated
space you could hit new and make your
own partition but just hit next and
it'll do it automatically from here it
will copy Windows files get ready for
installation install features this
process will vary depending on the speed
of your system and the USB Drive that
you're loading off of but usually it
takes between 8 and 15 minutes and then
you can move on to the next step after
the Windows 10 installation finishes it
will do an automatic restart which is
has just done right now since I did the
quick boot in order to boot off of that
USB Drive it's gonna automatically
refresh and boot back off of the SSD
that it just installed - if you went
into the BIOS and manually changed your
boot order in order to boot off of that
USB Drive and that's a good time to go
back in there and switch it back so
again it's booting off of the windows
boot manager for the SSD that you
install windows 2 here it's gonna do a
bit more housekeeping stuff getting
ready and then we're gonna go into first
steps after a quick restarts we're now
greeted with these men
suja's start with the region we're in
the United States so we'll go ahead with
that we're sticking with the u.s.
keyboard layout we don't want to add a
second keyboard but you can do that here
if you need more accessibility and here
we can connect to the internet but we're
gonna skip that for now Windows 10
really wants me to connect to the
Internet no not not yet Windows 10 I'll
connect to the internet what I am ready
and now you can create a name for the
computer with Windows 10 the license can
be attached to the computer or the
license can be attached to you via a
Microsoft account I usually attach the
licenses to the computer so that's the
method I'm going to focus on for today
but your computer needs a name we're
just gonna call it Tommy
next up create a password definitely you
should do this I'm not gonna do it right
now because I wouldn't show you what my
password is anyway but but always create
a password it's the way you keep your
computer secure next up it'll ask if you
want to use Cortana no no you do not
next up device history across multiple
devices no I don't care about that
either privacy settings I always turn
all of these off because I don't want
Microsoft to track me
Microsoft is still gonna track me to
some degree but this is the way you can
tell Microsoft no I don't want you to
track me as little as possible and then
after that Microsoft will say hi we're
getting everything ready for you and
just a few more minutes to wait before
you can actually use the operating
system look Windows 10 is installed
that's awesome of course we still need
to do quite a few setup procedures and
I'm gonna start out with my personal
method for making the Windows 10 UI just
a little bit easier to handle for one
let's go to themes and related settings
and here I just like to choose desktop
icon settings and add the computer icon
to the desktop there's just a personal
preference you don't need to do this at
all next up open up file explorer via
the little folder icon on the desktop
and go over to view and here we want to
go to options this will bring up folder
options I like open file explorer to
this PC rather than quick access and
then over on view I display the full
path in the title bar I show hidden
files folders and drives I do not hide
empty drives and this one in particular
is the one I always turn off hide
extensions for known file types I just
think that's a stupid thing that
Microsoft should never use this means
that we can now see the file extensions
of stuff like INF fi dot exe we can now
see
if this is an executable file we might
be running by double-clicking it for
example now that this PC is on the
desktop we can right-click it and go to
manage and there's a couple things we
will want to access in computer
management's one is going to be the
device manager we can click on that and
we can see all the devices that the PC
currently has in it that the operating
system does not recognize don't worry
Windows updates should be able to handle
a bunch of these we'll also be looking
at Disk Management in just a minute but
I'll come back to that I also like to
turn off the people icon on the taskbar
also personal preference but at this
point we are ready to connect this
computer to the Internet's so I'm gonna
take my blue cable of Internet access
here and plug it in to the rj45 port on
the back and in just a moment we should
have internet access when you connect to
a network Windows 10 will ask you if you
want to make your PC discoverable if
you're on a home network and you want to
network between computers to transfer
files then click yes if you're on a
public network or you're not sure click
no now we can see that we have internet
access so at this point you should do
windows updates over and over and over
again you can access that by hitting the
windows key and typing updates it should
take you to the check for updates
function in settings we're gonna click
check for updates it should come back
with some updates that are found it will
then install them we'll let that do that
automatically will then manually tell
the system to restart will then access
Windows Update again see if it has any
more updates let them install restart
rinse and repeat this process until when
you access Windows updates it says there
are no updates left to install you're up
to date even then click update yet again
just a double check because sometimes it
doesn't always catch things right away
but do it a few times and then
everything should be up to date among
these updates though you might notice it
downloading some drivers so for instance
this is an Nvidia display driver that
it's downloading from back in January
also Advanced Micro Devices that's a MD
so it's gonna be downloading some
drivers for the chipset and some of the
motherboard hardware that's installed
now that Windows is up to date I'm gonna
use Microsoft edge here to download
Chrome and Firefox I tend to like to
have multiple browsers but if we go to
google.com we can access Chrome so we'll
go ahead and download that and at the
same time we'll go to the Mozilla
website to download Firefox because
Firefox is also a very good browser and
there
independent browser source so I like
them will hit run on both of these and
install them both the same time maybe
isn't the best idea but we're gonna do
it it's good overlapping browser
installs that's fun right well let
Firefox go first and then we'll let
chrome go yeah hey firefox be afraid to
use Microsoft edge as well just bear in
mind edges switching to chromium so edge
and Google Chrome are going to be very
similar beyond that Chrome and Firefox
are generally my go twos I will then
also unpin edge from the taskbar down
there and then go ahead and pin Google
Chrome and Firefox pinning frequently
used tasks to the taskbar down here
allows you to access them without having
the icon on your desktop and that helps
your desktop stay clean which is always
nice from there we can load up either
browser and it might recommend that you
set a default browser cuz I just default
I'll switch to Chrome and yes switch
anyway from here I'm just gonna go back
to the MS Ivy 450 tomahawk web page from
MSI so I can go back to the support page
and double check that there's no drivers
that Windows 10 installed but there
might be updated versions for in order
to do that go back to manage after
right-clicking on this PC and we can
click device manager and we can actually
see that there are no more unrecognized
hardware devices here Windows 10 did a
good job of sort of scooping all those
back up well you can go back over here
to drivers select Windows 10 64 bits and
then you can see if there's any
additional drivers you don't need the
raid driver unless you're setting up
raid and I'm not going to cover that in
this video there's also a chipset driver
which you might potentially want to
updates LAN drivers in particular if a
not recognized for now I'm just going to
go with what we have because this AMD
chipset driver is from November of last
year so chances are we're not too far
out of date so instead we're going to go
to the nvidia website since we have an
nvidia r-tx 2060 installed and we're
going to download drivers from here
because the GPU driver is something that
is very important for your gaming
performance you can have the website
automatically detect what you have
installed or you can tell it what you
have installed we have a twenty series
twenty sixty everything else is the same
latest drivers from three days ago on
february 22nd so we'll click download on
that's wait for it to download and then
install that as well anything that you
download should download to the
downloads folder that's why it's there
so you can run the nvidia driver
installer
from there click ok it should
automatically install again just takes a
few minutes and everything should be
automatic the one thing that I don't
install from the Nvidia drivers is the
NVIDIA GeForce experience that's my
personal preference though GeForce
experience can actually be pretty handy
for you if you're not familiar with how
to go into a different game and do the
settings or to have the automatic
capture feature for it so so feel free
to install GeForce experience if you
want to just I'm not going to here the
install we're finished we can click
close and sometimes it'll prompt you for
restart but not every time and now the
computer is pretty much set up the way
you'd want it to you might consider an
antivirus but Windows has Windows
Defender built into it which does a
decent job at this point I'm going to
move on to actually using this gaming PC
for PC gaming so to install manage PC
games usually you're going to use a game
manager Steam is the most popular one
and gives you access to a huge library
of games a lot of them free-to-play of
course there's a lot of other ones that
have come into popularity recently so
Blizzard has their own launcher epic has
the launcher especially if you want to
play fortnight which is free-to-play
that's another good one I'm gonna stall
the origin launcher so we can test out
some apex legends and then if everything
goes smoothly I'm gonna try out gaming
and streaming on the system at the same
time and I'll show you guys some basic
setup steps for that too so for gaming
I'm gonna download the Steam client for
that just go to steam powered comm click
the install steam icon and you'll
download that little installer origin
roughly the same go to the origin
download page and will download the
origin thin setup client for that the
same time I'm going to go to the OBS
project.com website and download the
windows installer version of that too
the one thing that I almost nearly
forgot here is that I have added another
drive now so the system's all set up I
have now added a drive or just plugged
in a drive if you happen to unplugged it
you'd probably want to install that
better than I have it's just sitting in
there right now but the actual setup
procedure for an additional storage
drive is gonna be the same whether it's
a SATA drive or mechanical hard drive
like this and for that's you will just
want to plug the drive in right click on
this PC go to manage down here you have
Disk Management so click on that and
since we've just plugged in a brand new
completely unformatted and unpartitioned
Drive it's popping up and asking
if I want to initialize the disk you
want to initialize a disk and then
create a partition on it bere mind if
you have a drive that you're reusing
from an existing system it might already
be formatted and have partitions on it
in which case you'd want to go delete
those and then reformat the drive so you
can use it as a fresh and new one for
now though we're just gonna initialize
the disk use GPT rather than MBR
especially if you're using a mechanical
drive that's larger than 2 terabytes
click OK and then down here we can see
disk 2 listed but all the space on it is
currently unallocated right click on
that go to new simple volume this will
take you through your wizard to do that
probably you just want to use the
maximum amount of space although you
can't partition it into different
smaller partitions if you want to assign
it a drive letter click Next and then
choose the filesystem you want
NTFS and default and I usually do a
volume label on here so title at 480
gigabytes storage SSD and I recommend
doing a quick format in order to get the
drive up and running and working quickly
although if you are using an older drive
especially if it's from an existing
computer you might want to consider a
full format on the drive just bear in
mind the larger the capacity of the
drive the longer it will take and that
does mean a few hours potentially for
like a 4 terabyte or a larger drive with
the quick format though once I hit
finish it should pop up like within just
a few seconds usually now Windows has
asked me what I want to do with the new
Drive I usually just tell it to open it
and they look completely new clean drive
with nothing on it so now connected to
the system if we eject our Windows
installer because we don't need that
anymore we have our local disk or the
SSD that we installed windows on to and
that still has 194 gigs free on it and
then we've got this other drive that
we've just added for storage and the
first thing I'm going to do in here is
go and create a folder called games my
downloads have completed so I'm gonna go
back to the Downloads folder and I'll
start installing these we can start with
Steam setup and these installers are all
pretty much the same they'll have you
choose a language an installation
location you can just use the default
for the most part the clients will often
update themselves as well once you've
installed them and now you can either
log in to your existing Steam account or
create a new one I'm gonna skip that for
now so we can go ahead and install
origin pretty much the same way one
thing I do like to turn off is having
these run when windows starts you know
I'll tell you if I want you to
load application automatic updates are
okay though and sharing harbour aspects
is up to you
origin is installed so lastly we will
install OBS so guys I now have steam as
well as origin setup and installed but
none of the games are actually installed
so I'm gonna really quickly talk about
copying games that you might have
already downloaded so you don't have to
redownload them especially if it's you
know 20 or 40 or 80 plus gigabytes it
might take a while it's easier to copy
games over that you've already
downloaded and also talking about the
external drive that you have hopefully
backed up stuff on to as well as the
internal storage drive that we've just
recently set up so I'm gonna take my
storage drive here and plug it in the
back I have multiple things on this
drive but the steamapps folder is the
important one here and then the origin
games folder is the other one so let's
start with steam if you have steam and
you want to install a game or copy a
game that you already have if you've got
steam loaded up and you're logged in you
can go to settings and then you can go
to downloads and then you can change
your Steam library folders it's gonna
have a default one in the x86 Program
Files folder we're gonna add one more
and then we're gonna change it from the
c drive here down to the e drive because
if we look at my pc we've got our
operating system drive here and then we
have our 488 storage drive that we just
set up that is the e drive we want to
make a games folder in there so we'll
hit new folder steam library now we've
got a steam library folder select that
and now we've got a secondary location
week where we can install games so now
on our 480 gig storage drive in the
game's Steam library folder we have a
steam apps folder and that's gonna be
important because that's where the games
go so I've got an exited steam I'm gonna
go into the steam apps folder and then
in the common folder I'm just gonna copy
the FTL faster than lights folder over
and that was really quick again this is
not a very large game I will then
relaunch steam and if I go back to my
games library and go to FTL its
installed in another system on my
network which is why it's asking me if I
want to stream it though but if I go to
install on this machine and then click
install as long as I point it to the
library where I just copied that folder
and hit next so it did this really
quickly for me just now but basically
it'll say discovering files it'll
discover the folder that you've already
copied over there and then
you should just be able to play it again
it really quickly because FTL is a very
small game but especially if you have a
larger game that's 20 gigs or more you
should be able to do that and then play
the game rather than downloading it of
course it's Steam there's tons of free
to play games on Steam so you can just
download any game and start playing it
but I also copied Apex legends which is
about 20 gigs and I saved that to the
origin games folder over here so again
in my games folder we have Steam library
I'm gonna copy origin games as well over
to that and that's got the apex legends
folder with all the files for that game
in it too and that shouldn't take too
long here how fast is it going 200
megabytes a second it's not too shabby
now that that's copy I'm gonna go back
to origin go to my game library apex
legends is free-to-play so anyone can
add it to their library and then here
there's a little gear
so rather than download I'm gonna click
the gear and go to locate game and then
I should be able to just point this
clients to where I copy the game to
which if you guys remember correctly is
my 488 storage Drive games origin games
apex select folder hopefully it will
verify the game files and then we'll be
able to play soon rather than read
downloading this 20 gig client well that
is getting set up I am going to set up
to do some game streaming because that's
been my whole goal this whole time is to
build this system this is about a nine
hundred dollar system and actually set
it up show you guys a step by step
process and get to the point where I can
game in stream on it to prove to you
that this is legit and that I know what
I'm doing so this is just a webcam
logitech c920 you can get these really
cheap now because they've been around
for a while they do 1080 as far as the
resolution goes the video quality isn't
phenomenal on them so there are some
newer ones they have like a 4k version
now or you can get like Elgato has a
little adapter USB that you can use to
plug in a nicer camera that has an HDMI
output there's a bunch of ways to get
your face onto the stream but this is
just a quick and easy one logitech
capture apparently is a Windows 10 thing
I've never used this before but I'm
gonna I'm gonna dive into it here just
for you guys it's downloading
automatically
fortunately apex legends has verified so
that's good to go webcam is working
fortunately so that's good and I'm also
getting my headset plugged in now my kid
headphone these are going to be green
and usually a pink or sometimes red they
should plug into color-coded outputs on
the back except this mother
bored MSI is really cool with their
color coding so they made them all red
and black
fortunately the mic is labeled mic and
then the normal one you'd use for
headphones are a standard stereo out is
highlighted in white so that's good so
at this point I've got my games
installed
I have OBS installed I've plugged in my
Logitech camera I've used the Logitech
new software which seems functional
enough again I'm not going to get into
the details of the setup for that or for
OBS because this video is already
getting a little bit too long but OBS at
least I'm just gonna use the wizard that
they have which is available under tools
Auto configuration we're gonna optimize
for streaming and again just to keep
things simple I'm just gonna go with the
defaults that they're suggesting so 1080
for our outputs are streaming type here
is streaming services usually twitch I
would input my twitch streaming link
here which I'm not going to show you
guys but I'll pull it up in just a
second I've actually never done the auto
configuration wizard with OBS so it's
doing some bandwidth testing right now
that's that's kind of fun it says it
just takes a minute or two and hopefully
then it will also maybe access the
webcam alright so settings are applied
and now we need to set up our scenes so
we're gonna add a couple things try a
video capture device first we will call
this webcam okay and hey it
automatically pops up with our HD pro
webcam c920 gonna hit OK on that and now
we can see me right there you can hold
the alt button and grab the edges of
this if you want to crop in so that just
get your face in there and crop out
other stuffs that might be around and
now we'll also add Game Capture and
usually that's just by default to
capture any any fullscreen application
and then we want the Game Capture to be
behind the webcam so we'll drag that
down underneath now we can load apex
legends allow access to the firewall so
now I'm just double-checking that apex
legends is appearing with OBS I switched
apex legends to borderless windowed mode
so that I can see both at the same time
but now we can see the game is being
captured in the background we can also
see that my face is showing up right
there although the game capture I need
to rescale so that it fits the window
that's better and now I can start
streaming and play again hey guys anyone
jumping in to watch on Twitch I really
appreciate you guys being here but just
to be forewarned this is going to be a
single game at a single
game only my apologies I don't have a
whole lot of time today I'm just doing a
game demo test for my how to build a PC
video part 3 where I did I just set up
this whole PC this morning and I am
actually gaming and streaming on it at
the same time no no an enemy you don't
budget heard the enemy go guns I want a
gun no don't shoot me now chair to jump
kick instead he came up and hit me with
the oh come on teammate are you going oh
you just ditching me thanks for the help
buddy just run away how much time do I
have here before I die
oh never mind was a quick game I said it
was only gonna play one game but then I
died immediately so now I'm only playing
one more game so this works stream from
what I can tell is a little choppy but
it's not looking too bad maybe I can get
a gun this time that would be a vast
improvement have you shot out already
somebody's already down I have a longbow
oh this is the first time I've ever had
a longbow and I kind of know how it
works sort of but not very well did our
team mate just drop out of the game
exciting this is brilliant well
fortunately the point of this was not to
show my amazing gameplay it was to show
that this computer I just put together
is functional and capable of play a game
and streaming at the same time although
some more tweaks to the settings would
probably maybe smooth out the stream a
little bit but honestly overall
especially for just this quick setup I
did things looking pretty smooth except
for of course my ability to shoot a gun
and play the game well so obviously I
need to practice more at Apex legends
but I'll get to that very soon in the
meantime though that pretty much wraps
it up for this video of course there's
lots of little details here and there
that I didn't cover hopefully I got the
main things so that you guys can go from
a system you just put together to a
system that is set up with Windows games
installed that you can start using start
playing games start enjoying the
computer you just built ASAP now the
last thing here is going to be Windows
10 do you want to activate it you can
actually get by without activating
Windows 10 for quite some time it just
takes away your personalization options
and you'll eventually get a little
watermark down in the bottom right that
says this copy of Windows might not be
genuine now you can actually get around
the wallpaper personalization thing if
you just download a file I usually go to
interface lift but of course it's not
the sites not working right now but if
you've downloaded a picture you can just
right click it from Explorer and go to
set as desktop background and now you
have a desktop background even though
you don't have personalization options
so that's something you can do there and
that will get most people by but if you
really do want a legitimate version of
Windows you can purchase a key and for
that you should check out my windows 10
for $20 video although the price is now
closer to $30 that'll walk you through
the steps of activating your version of
Windows just make sure you only use it
for Windows 10 and make sure you get the
version of Windows that you installed so
if you installed Windows 10 Pro get that
license key so you can activate it
properly because the home license won't
activate on Pro and vice versa before I
move on though I'd like to quickly say

description thank you all so much for
watching this video I really hope it's
helped you out and especially if you
know anyone who's maybe considering
putting together a computer not even
just a gaming PC all of these steps can
be used to put together a PC to do just
about anything you want so if you want
something that's more heavy on storage
or you don't need a graphics card
because you're not gonna play games but
you need a CPU to do some heavy lifting
for something all these apply to
building just about any desktop PC so
thanks again for watching this video hit
