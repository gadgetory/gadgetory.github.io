brought to you by monoprice who you
might already know for their extremely
well-made low-priced
and lifetime warranty backed cables of
all varieties but today I'm going to
show you really quickly some of the
other products from monoprice that I use
on a regular basis monoprice does pro
audio now so down here is the small
sound board that we use every week for
our awesome Hardware live show up here
is a large diaphragm condenser
microphone this one sounds great we
haven't used it yet but we're going to
be integrating it very soon they also
have professional audio accessories such
as this boom stand over here as well as
the pop filter monoprice has a wide
variety of power banks this one belongs
to my wife and have other models
available as well here's my wife's
wireless bluetooth headphones so these
she connects up to her smart phone and
then she can wander around the house
listening to her music or her audiobooks
it's fantastic monoprice also has these
tripods here
did you know monoprice had tripods yes
there's a aluminum one there's a
carbon-fiber one both of those will
compare it in mono pods if you need them
to there's also a smaller multipurpose
tripod down there and all of those come
with carrying cases over here is the
monoprice 4k monitor with the glossy
screen and i have done a full video
review on that so you can check that out
if you want and lastly we have the steve
helping hands steve model available at
monoprice soon rights really no I'm not
but definitely we're here to support you
Paul and we're happy to do it on top of
that you guys can pick up all these
products at monoprice com alright and
Steve very soon
excellent what's up everyone and welcome
to my second video on skylake that's
right the new series of processors that
intel has just announced and should now
be available for sale as a couple new
SKUs that they have launched there's the
6700 K that I have right here which is a
quad core with hyper threading turbos to
4.4 gigahertz and it's available for
about $350 u.s. there's also a 6600 K
which is quad core without hyper
threading that one will turbo to 3.9
gigahertz and that should be about $240
u.s. now I already did a video of the
first five things that you need to know
about skylake so check that if you
haven't watched area that'll give you
kind of an introduction to the new CPUs
the new z170 chipset and the platform as
well as the use of ddr4 memory which
you're probably going to need by and
large it Center a few outlying
motherboard models so for today's video
I'm going to be comparing a 6700 K's
performance to a 59 30 K as well as a
4790k with a focus on gaming to tell if
upgrading to skylake will get you any
extra performance here's a look at my
testing configurations the goal really
was to neutralize any variables or at
least neutralize as many variables as I
could in order to really make sure that
the testing was between the CPUs and
nothing else so first off for the video
card for all the tests I'm using the
EVGA gtx 980ti
this is the SC or Super clock version
I'm using it with its manufacturer
overclocked out-of-the-box specs so
nothing was changed there is running at
the same frequency frequency for all the
tests it's got an EVGA x99 classified
motherboard so this is a x99 socket LGA
2011 - 3 haswell-e processor
configuration other than that I have the
59 30 K right in here it's being cooled
by the fractal Kelvin 120 millimeter
cooler and then making sure things stay
comparable to in between the CPUs all of
my CPUs are overclocked to 4.4 gigahertz
so this is a 59 30 K run into 4.4 also
for all of my three different test beds
I am running a 16 gig kit of DDR or D
here 3 or ddr4 memory depending what's
compatible so this is a g.skill ripjaws
4 kit 4 by 4 gigs 16 gigs total this is
actually a 2666 kit but as running all
the memory at 2400 speed so that's my
has well ii test bed
for standard Haswell z97 and socket LGA
1150 I used this system right here this
is the system that I built last month
and this is actually the streaming
system but fortunately you had a very
very fresh operating system installed on
it and it didn't really take much to
transfer over some games and stuff and
get it set up to do some benchmarking as
well so here we have a gigabyte z97 X
SOC motherboard that's the orange
motherboard in the back CPU under there
and here's where I maybe I'm going to
get some crap from you guys let me know
if you forgive me for doing this I know
I put 4790k in the title but I actually
don't have a 4790k so this is a 4770k
which is essentially functionally the
exact same thing as a 4790k just the 40
the 4790k
it runs at 4.4 gigahertz turbo boost out
of the box this one I just overclocked
so ever clock to 4770k to make it
equivalent with the 4790k and I I'm
sorry but I hope you guys forgive me for
being slightly misleading with the title
but anyway there's my 4770k or 4790k
depending how you look at it I'm also
writing 16 gigs of memory in here this
is a also g.skill tried an X ddr3 series
memory that I kid actually believe goes
to 20 666 but again as running at 2400
speed using the cooler master Neptune
240 L CPU cooler in there and that's
pretty much it
apart from that right now it's got a GTX
770 in it but of course I was running
the 980 TI for the actual tests and then
of course right over here is the main
event
although it's less of a main event now
because I disassembled this whole thing
so I could do video evidence stuff so
either way let's take a closer look
mainly what you need to see is right
over here so this is the MSI motherboard
I was using for these tests this is a
z170a gaming m7 you might have seen this
in my introductory video for skylake or
the first 5 sky like things it's been a
great solid little motherboard for me so
far I do want to point out that I'm
using a Plextor m2 m6 as I called again
I should point out that I'm using a
Plextor m6 e Drive in this which is a
PCIe SSD which is a bit faster than the
SSDs and the other drip systems but as
you probably tell a moment that really
didn't matter at all that didn't didn't
really affect the benchmarks and apart
from the motherboard and processor we of
course have this memory kit here this is
g.skill ripjaws 5 kit this is brand-new
from g.skill
candidate redesign on it and made it a
little bit less flinging at least in the
label English which I'm happy about but
again this is a four by four gigabyte
kit and this kit is also this is
actually really fast kit this is a 3200
speed kit but again I just set it to
2400 for the sake of the tests speaking
of tests why don't I look at some
benchmarks I'm gonna talk you guys
through these benchmark numbers although
at first glance it might seem like
that's not even really necessary working
at battlefield 4 and if you look at
those average Mensch mark numbers you
might notice that they're all pretty
much the same within about a 3% margin
of error the 59 30k did get a little bit
of a boost of 1080 the whether you're
gaming at 1080 1440 or 4k all these CPUs
seem to give you about the same gaming
performance I thought battlefield 4
might give an edge to the 59 30 K
because it is a bit more good at using
multiple CPU cores however that didn't
seem to pan out Metro last light is next
and again if you're looking at those
average frame rates not a whole lot of
difference the 15 and 30 K bits seem to
have a little bit of it an edge at 1080
I've also included minimum frame rates
here those do tend to bounce around a
lot but just there for your reference in
case you're interested BioShock Infinite
is next and since there's not a whole
lot to talk about as far as differences
between average frame rate so I'm going
to talk about power draw 59 30 K does
use a bit more power at about 395 Watts
peak then the 4770k and the 6700 K
however and I'm going to switch to GTA 5
here as well the 4770k and 6700 K used
may be 20 to 40 watts less speaking it
more like 362 380 as I was testing me at
times for GTA 5 though again benchmarks
are all really pretty much in the same
ballpark just not a whole lot to say as
far as differences in frame rates it
doesn't really matter which DP you go
with you're gonna get good performance
so are any of these graphs going to show
any difference between these CPUs well
yes here's 3dmark fire strike I save
this one for last because I've also
included the physics test numbers and
the physics test is really a CPU bound
test that's just using the CPU so here
we can see the 59 30 k with its six
cores pulling out ahead pretty
significantly in the physics test
busting extreme and ultra mode as for
the 6700 K it did outpaced the 4770k and
here's where you can see those
instructions per clock about 10% and
performance improvement they can expect
going from Haswell to sky
so there you have it folks proof beyond
the shadow of a doubt or a shadow a
reasonable shadow a shadow a reasonably
proved beyond doubt that's skylake is
not really required for high-end gaming
even if you're using a high-end graphics
card like a gtx 980ti now there are
other reasons to go for skylake other
than just gaming if you want the new
features of the z170 chipset and the
motherboards to go along with it like
USB 3.1 and the connectivity you get
with m2 and all the extra PCI Express
Lanes on the PCH and that sort of good
thing but don't upgrade to skylight
because you think it's going to get you
a lot of extra frames per second in fact
I would say even if you're going back as
far as using has well even Ivy Bridge
processors if you're still on z77
you're still not going to get that much
of a boost by upgraded into the new
processors so upgrade for the right
reasons I guess is the point of this
video and hopefully you now have a
little bit of ammunition to show your
friends if they're like I'm gonna get
sky lake to give myself bit better
gaming performance because that's really
not going to happen now I know some of
you who are on older platforms let's say
you go further back like Ivy Bridge or
even back to Sandy Bridge or Prior are
thinking like well what about if I'm
upgrading from those unfortunately
there's some other really really wise
folks on the internet we've done more
extensive testing than I have so I'm
going to post some links in the
description to articles from tech report
PC PC perspective as well as hot
hardware you guys can check those out
and those will give you some comparisons
even if you're upgrading from like Sandy
Bridge or something like that and
honestly even then it's not that huge of
a jump but if you're still on Sandy
Bridge I'll say go ahead and upgrade if
you're if you're in the mood for it if
you're ready for a new platform because
there's really a lot more performance to
be gained there's a lot more cool new
features like PCI Express gen3
m2 connectivity nvme a USB 3.1 all those
are good reasons to upgrades and if you
use your computer a lot and you're ready
for an upgrade I think skylake is a
great way to go and that is all for this
video folks if you enjoyed it don't
forget to hit that like button on your
way out and leave a comment in the
comment section let me know if you think
about a Korean disguise like wouldn't be
a bad choice in my personal opinion also
down in the video description you can
find links to those articles I was
talking about a link to my store where
you can buy shirts mugs and glasses to
help support Paul's hardware also
there's a link to skylake processors at
retail at least if I can find them
there'll be a link down there anyway
which you should click and as always
