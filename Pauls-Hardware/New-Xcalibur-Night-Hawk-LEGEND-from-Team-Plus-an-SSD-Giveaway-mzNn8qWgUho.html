to you by gigabyte coolermaster team
group and thermaltake okay guys I am
over at the team group Suites here at
the Hyatts they have some new memory and
they have a USB Drive that can open beer
very excited so let's start with a good
stuff
this is 128 gig bottle opener USB Drive
so if you're already keeping a bottle
opener your pocket might as well have
128 gigs of memory attached team
actually got a design an Innovation
Award for this from Computex so its
greatness has been recognized not only
is it a USB Drive and the bottle opener
but you got a little measurement you
know it can measure a few centimeters up
there on top and then this corner of it
also acts as a box opener super useful
but team is probably a bit more known
for memory so let's check that in so
here are a couple tough series
motherboards from asus and asus has been
working with team in order to get some
memory that actually matches nicely so
the toughest etic is supposed to be
somewhat military-themed but they now
have this sort of orangist accent color
so it can be difficult to find memory
that actually matches well with it team
extra has a couple different options
here this set that was pretty unique
this is gonna be a little bit more
budget oriented but part of the tough
gaming alliance no heat spreader on that
just a bare PCB but the PCB is black and
they've done some printing on it so make
sure it matches up with the motherboard
lock this motherboard by the way is a V
350 and plus gaming so it's going to
support rise in the processors if you do
need a bit of extra cooling and
protection then the Vulcan tough gaming
Alliance ddr4 does have some heat
spreaders on it also a very similar
design aesthetic to the motherboard so
it's blending and very nicely here this
is a four stick kit this is gonna be
available in frequencies going up to
3600 now here are my favorite new
products from the team this is a new
seat part of the T force series and
these are called T force Excalibur's I
went up on top just a special edition
and it has a special design on the
heatsink it's supposed to look like a
sword it handles at this end and the
sword end is over there it's also got a
bit of an accent there with a metal
piece across the top and that actually
will form a tienen F it's like the team
at t4 still go wrapped around the top of
the memory
since this is more premium memory it's
available with speeds of 3600 and 4,000
and you're also guaranteed to get
Samsung VIII season here so that means
that these are going to be very
compatible with rising platforms is
there actually gonna be available pretty
soon at least the standard version down
here at the bottom will be available on
Newegg as of next week they're still
finalizing the special edition up on top
so you should expect to see that later
and that will be available at new leg as
well as Amazon a team has quite a few
varieties of memory and different
finishes shapes sizes capacities speeds
so here's a quick look at all of them I
did want to at least highlight the dark
pro tee for strike dark Pro which is
down here it's just been one of their
more popular series of memory and it
doesn't light up so if you're not into
the RGB LEDs that is definitely a
possibility for you available in speeds
of 3466 33 33 and down to 3,000 you guys
may have seen me do the build recently
with the Nighthawk RGB ddr4 right there
a very distinct look and some very cool
automated RGB effects when you just get
that installed that's available in black
and white and there's a special edition
I'm going to show you in just a second
and also down here we have a set of the
team T force Delta RGB SSDs available in
black and white I did the build recently
and this is where I asked you guys if
RGB a gun too far and you know reactions
were mixed but I feel like by and large
most people said no we still want more
RGB so there you go guys
white or black RGB SSDs the team T force
Delta series and finally here is another
design and innovation award winner here
at Computex the T Force Nighthawk Legend
RGB ddr4 you've already seen this in
black and white and now they has an
aluminum finish on there so you get a
metallic finish that gives it a really
nice premium feel and these should be
available next month on new way so there
you have it guys this has been the team
suite they've got some cool new products
coming out especially if you into RGB
SSDs or memory so I'll put some links
down in the description oh one last
thing they're doing a giveaway right now
they're giving away some of those t
force Delta RGB SSDs that's an
international giveaway so I'm going to
post a link to that down in this video's
description go ahead and click that
enter the giveaway and maybe you could
win one but thank you guys so much for
