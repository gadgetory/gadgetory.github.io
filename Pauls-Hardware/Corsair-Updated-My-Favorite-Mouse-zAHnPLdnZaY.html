you by Corsair enter max deep cool and
cooler master guys I met Corsair now
Corsair is a sponsor for CES 2019 so big
thanks to them they have some new cases
they have some ice I'm pretty excited
about and algata has joined the Corsair
team so if they have some cool stuff -
so of course there has a new version of
their spec alpha case this is called the
spec Delta if I'm being perfectly honest
I was never a huge fan of the aesthetics
of the spec alpha but they've made a new
version and this is apparently a very
popular case in certain regions so DEP
grades include more fans so you're gonna
get three RGB fans on the front and then
you will get a non RGB fan in the back
this is this is the case I will ship
over here and this is for a serious
presentation version you're also gonna
get a magnetic dust filter up on top and
then they've redone this front panel so
it's still the same shape as the
original spec alpha but it is an acrylic
sort of smoked acrylic panel it doesn't
seem like there's a whole lot of air
flow going on around the edges here this
is pana locked in there is a bit of a
gap down here at the bottom so I imagine
this will take some testing to see if
this is going to be effective as an
airflow solution but this case is only
gonna cost seventy nine ninety-nine and
you get those included pants so that's a
pretty good price to performance metric
I suppose next up is a 275 Q this is
also gonna be a $79.99 case the 275 R is
what it's based on so internally
functionally everything is the same it's
just gonna cost ten bucks more and for
that you're going to get sound dampen
sign pet side panels so this is not a
case with the acrylic panel or tempered
glass or anything solid side panels but
they do have a sound dampening material
as well and then you're also going to
get a multi-channel fan controller but
then you're also going to get a PWM fan
repeater so you can actually hook up up
to six PWM fans to that and it does come
with two 120 millimeter PWM fans
included so if you're looking for a
quiet case the 275 qq4 quiet that makes
it next up is the H 100 I RGB platinum
special edition
so pretty much functionally the same as
the original age 100
are you platinum but this one is all
white it also comes with special edition
light loop series RGB pins light loop
serious fans of course they're not
necessarily known for their excellent
static pressure in a radiator
environment these have been reconfigured
so that they are better reuse with the
radiator but they still have the light
loop RGB LEDs on both sides these are
all displayed but you can turn RGB on if
you want to as well beyond that you just
get a really clean looking 240
millimeter on one with really also clean
and sleeved cables on the tubing there
to look really nice I kind of like how
this looks matches well with this mouse
down here speaking of mice now if you're
at the headline for this video you might
have noted that Corsair updated my
favorite Mouse now if I'm being
perfectly honest they have a few
favorite mice my onyx has one or two
that I really like but this is the m60 5
and this has had a few variations over
the years they've updated and refined it
and now they've actually slightly
adjusted some of the contours here so
it's a little bit more comfortable in
the hand they slightly repositioned and
made larger the forward and back buttons
as well as the sniper button there so
it's a little bit easier to access
they've got the weight down below 100
grams although you can still add these
weights to it to bring it up to about
115 grams still has the durable aluminum
frame available in both black and whites
and then it's got a precision picsArt
sensor that corsair worked and developed
with pixar on its 8,000 dpi high DPI
isn't necessarily a huge factor when it
comes to a sensor but you can actually
change your the pin1 dpi steps so 18,000
different dpi settings that you can have
with the elf 65 RGB
next to the iron flower GB this is a
palm with specific notes so still has
that same Pixar 18,000 DPI sensor and
the weights they've gotten down pretty
low on this one to only a hundred and
five grams and I will say that when you
grip this mouse like I have reasonably
sized hands a little on the larger side
perhaps the contour here just really it
really fills up your home that's the
only way I can describe it but feels
pretty comfortable so if your palm
gripper I think this would be a great
solution for you it's and beyond that
you still have 50 million click on
switches 7 programmable buttons and this
also has RGB LED as well as an indicator
therefore your dpi settings which you
can adjust via the two buttons on the
top now the RGB roots and the iron fire
both $59.99 very reasonable prices for a
corsair high-quality mice and then over
here we've got the harpoon RGB Wireless
this one's only going to be 50 bucks
$49.99 and this one's actually pretty
flexible as Wireless my skills remain
wireless connection it uses Corsair sip
stream wireless technology which is RF
based but coarser has worked with it to
bring it down to sub of 1 millisecond
response time 500 of microseconds which
is really really fast so if you're
concerned about response time with the
wireless house that should alleviate
some of your concerns I'd be interested
to do a side-by-side comparison plugged
in via USB against slipstream but you
can also connect the ax Bluetooth
Bluetooth is going to introduce more
latency but gives you more flexibility
if you just want to take this to connect
up to a laptop really quickly and of
course you can plug it in via USB if you
want to do that as well to charge it or
to have a direct USB connection again a
very lightweight Mouse just weighing 99
grams and you have up to 60 hours of
battery life if you're connected via
bluetooth you're gonna get less than
that if you're using these slipstream
Wireless stick
that's just because the refresh rate is
so fast that's gonna use more power you
have RGB lighting support of course as
well you have a dpi switcher button in
the middle boredom becky's and a fairly
small design that's again very
comfortable man
that's the harpoon RGB Wireless here's
some Elgato stuff I got though has
joined the Corsair team they have the
stream deck of course they've the 4k 60
pro capture card which I've been a big
fan of but they also have this key light
now check it out lighting for screamers
because lighting can often be challenged
if you're streaming from your bedroom or
something like that
these lights are very slim they have an
array of LEDs to go around the edge so
it's edgelits they have a very high CRA
rating although they are not actually
officially listed for CRA compatibility
but a very good color reproduction and
you can easily mount these to the back
of your desk not only that but they also
are Wi-Fi controlled so you can control
them via an app on your phone or an
application on your computer or you can
also tie them into your stream deck so
you could use their stream deck buttons
to push and turn on your lights or you
can create a crazy macro where you push
the button or two on your stream deck
and it turns on your lights and starts
your stream and does an announcement for
your fans and it's get to streaming
without having to worry about doing all
that stuff individually beyond that the
4k 60p Pro has also been recently
updated for HDR support and then I've
got so has also been working on an app
this is actually for iOS not available
for Android but for streamers who want
to stream stuff from an application the
app will allow you to stream directly to
a computer so if you're going to do
Pokemon go or something
future you can capture it pretty
accurately this is apparently something
that's not widely available as an iOS
app they've developed it from the ground
up it connects via Wi-Fi as long as
you're on the same network so you're not
going to lose your network your internet
connectivity from the laptop you're
capturing on but also can access the
camera on the tablet or iPhone or
whatever you using so you can position
that wherever you want and have sort of
a wireless camera that you can move
around and then capture on to your
computer
almost done here just a couple more
products to show this is the Corsair one
i-40 the Corsair one has been around for
a little while now it's an all contained
computer with a very small footprint
stands vertically has a really good
cooling solution implemented with 220
millimeter all-in-one liquid pours this
is not the type of thing you could put
together yourself
but they've updated this one and
integrated an i-9 9700 k as well as the
chief force r-tx 2088 gig that's pretty
impressive
lots of connectivity on this via the i/o
in the back or the front i/o which is
down there at the bottom
and apparently when Corsair showed this
at their press conference it was asked
if they could just sell the case by
itself the answer is a resounding no and
that is simply because the case itself
would be very expensive you'd have to
have those all and ones also integrated
and flexibility for integrating your own
hardware would be very challenging with
this so you'll have to buy the course i1
i1 40 as of all in one computer but for
those of you who don't want to build
something and want something with a very
small footprint there it is and here's
the last thing I'm gonna show it Corsair
I really like small power supplies and
this is the s7 50 so they've upgraded
the SF series 750 watts it is 80 plus
platinum rated and it's still fully
modular and it's still so so super tiny
so still maintaining the very small sfx
form factor i have a shot of the
internal components corsair always does
really clean work with the internals on
their power supplies so just rockin a 92
millimeter fan this does have a zero rpm
fan mode it comes with a bracket so if
you want to install this in a small like
mini ITX case that still has ATX support
but you want more space in there we can
install that with the included bracket
so if you're looking to build a very
small computer and you're feeling like
the 500 550 watt sfx options are not
to snuff if you want to drop in like a
28 yeah or something like that this will
be what you want to go for guys that's
all the time I have for here at the
Corsair suite I want to end by first
thanking my sponsors once again for CES
2019 Corsair as well as coolermaster
deep pool and enter max I have a ton
more videos coming at you real soon so I
think the thumbs up button and we'll see
you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
