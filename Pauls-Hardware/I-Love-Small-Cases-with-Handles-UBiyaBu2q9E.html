you by Corsair enter max deep cool and
coolermaster hey guys I'm at the Leon
Lee's suite now or at Caesar's Palace
they have a few new cases as well as a
pretty fancy concept designed for a desk
PC I'm going to show you all these
things so Leon Lee has quite a few desks
that are also computer cases that are
also vert discs which is very convenient
in a lot of ways if you want to put your
computer in your desk you can do it this
is the DK o''h for which they've
actually shown before there's a fair
amount of reflection in here sorry about
that but you can't see there's a pretty
awesome system but then they also gave
me this remote control and they said hey
push the button
I heard the computer go wait there it is
you know it's gone yeah it's there yeah
it's gone I'm just gonna keep doing this
that's what the rest of this video is
gonna be as me doing this okay you get
the point I'm being told there's two
names for this technology you can call
it magic glass if you're an Apple fan or
electric current conductive glass point
being electric current causes it to get
causes it to get very opaque and you
can't see the computer anymore they're
actually saying they want to do this so
it completely hides the computer and you
can't see any of the light shining
through so you know if your house gets
broken into and you need to hide your
desk computer you can do it very quickly
so guys let me know in the comments if
you'd be interested in this type of
technology for averting desk I've done a
few builds in the 11 dynamic this is the
Razer Edition that they have been
working on and it's very similar to the
11 dynamic in many ways but they have
added some RGB strips actually an RGB
strip along the edge here that sort of
shines through so you can see it over on
the left side too which is kind of cool
you have an etched Razer logo across the
front this is actually a special etching
techniques like you can't feel it at all
it's inside the glass even if you went
to the other side of this you can't feel
the etching at all which is cool lastly
they've also integrated a control module
so you can plug this in and use the
Razer synapse software to control your
RGB lighting so that's the 11 dynamic
Razer edition it's gonna be selling for
about one hundred and sixty-nine dollars
here's a cool little case this is the TU
150 and this is still in the prototype
stages but if you guys remember back
when I used to do new egg TV videos we
built a computer that we called the
handler which was an ally only case that
had a handle on the top it is sort of a
follow-up to that and it also has a
handle on the top I love small cases
that are also portable and that you can
easily carry around and again while this
is a prototype here's the handle just
pops out off the top
you can lift up the whole case to carry
it around or drop it I guess if your
line is beyond the handle design you
have a pretty direct airflow path from
the front of the case directly back for
your components the GPU is located
fairly close to the bottom that is a
pretty fat ZOTAC GPU that they have in
there right now but there is plenty of
ventilation down there to also allow
some airflow to that they currently have
it set up with an air cooler
they said this is more designed for like
office environments or that sort of
thing which is interesting since it's
got tempered glass but they're not
necessarily expecting you to put a full
water-cooled system in here it's more
designed for air coolers so it supports
air coolers with Heights up to 175
millimeters side panel also pops off
very easily here I really like side
panels that come off that way and
there's a quick look at your cable
management's not a ton of space back
there but enough for routing your major
cables and they put a little bit extra
space up here where the power supply
goes for the again the main place by the
way the Razer edition case down there is
expected to launch very soon and within
the next month or two little t-150 here
is supposed to launch in q1 so expected
by March at the latest and then lastly
for cases is a new version of the 11
dynamic or a refresh of the old eleven
wgx either way you look at it this is
the 11 wgx ROG certified v2 so they're
working with ROG to make this an ROG
certified case that's why you might
notice some of the Orochi branding on
the sides and some of the ROG artwork
going down the sides too also down the
sides note that there's a two USB 3.0
ports down there at the bottom couple
more USB 3.0 ports up here as well as
the type-c USB 3.1 gen2 and Leon Lee
said that was so that you have if you
have the case on the floor but you
shouldn't do you can access the upper
ones or you if you have the case up on a
desk or something you'd have access to
the lower ones I just like the fact that
you could actually plug in dual USB 3.0
front panel connectors because a lot of
motherboards have that now but you can
actually connect it to your case to make
use of those ports beyond that the idea
here was to update the 11 wgx to bring
it in line with a lot of the feature
updates that they added to the O 11
dynamic the o 11 dynamic is a little bit
more of an ATX case it does support UT
ATX but it's just a little bit smaller
so here they've made it a little bit
taller a little bit wider so that's
going to help address a few issues for
one in the back for a rear exhaust you
can do full-sized hundred and twenty
millimeter fans and that's pretty nice
and then as far as internal spacing for
graphics cards if you're using like an
aftermarket GPU that's a bit thicker
and especially if your water cooling it
with a GPU block that has you know
terminals on the end sometimes that can
be too wide to fit in the O 11 dynamic
so this one is made wider so if you're
doing a crazy GPU setup with SLI or
aftermarket cooled cards or just really
overbuilt cards that tend to be larger
it will actually fit and of course you
still get the vertical bracket so you
can mount them that way too
here's another cool feature for water
coolers that is a removable radiator
bracket that's at the bottom of the case
so this is a popular area for intake or
just another space to put a 280
millimeter add or 3 by 120 it does up to
360 and having that be removable is very
convenient especially if you're doing
with a very heavy system that has water
cooling components in it and you want to
build without having to lay the case on
its side and then here in the opposite
side you'll notice there's a bit more
space for drive cages they have a larger
cable management cover that goes right
there and then put to provide you some
flexibility for the fan mounts right
here they're also working on these
little adapters and these are just
plastic again these are prototypes but
they said they're going to make a metal
this will just allow you to put a 3.5
inch or 2.5 inch drive if you're not
going to be populating all of these
areas with fans and now we're back over
at the razor addition case so we can
look at this all-in-one cooler that
Leanne Lee has also been working on so
they've developed this so that they can
make their own all-in-one and to do that
they have a pump that's actually located
up in this area right here that does
make it a little bit wider so that's the
length here on the 240 millimeter on one
is a little bit longer but not in such a
way that should cause great conflicts or
anything like that and then they've also
done a fairly unique design here for the
cooler itself as you can see RGB
lighting behind this little panel and if
you want more RGB lighting just remove
it and now there's lots of RGB lighting
as well as a Lee Ann Lee logo and if you
don't like all that RGB it's got a
magnet so and just pop that right back
on so cheers guys Liam Lee forced me to
drink this beer actually I didn't really
drink it it's like 10:00 a.m. right now
but Cheers anyway thank you guys so much
