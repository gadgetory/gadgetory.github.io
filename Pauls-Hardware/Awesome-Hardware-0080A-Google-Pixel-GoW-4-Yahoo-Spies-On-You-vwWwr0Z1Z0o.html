of the thumbnail oh he's near the
thumbnail I mean I cuz I did it I did it
straight from oh I did no configuration
you youtube I didn't I didn't train
which also means i don't have the link
alright so maybe i should have thought
that through better sorry it's okay we
were in a rush we're gonna really trying
to get on time for you guys you're lying
on the bed it's much more important to
be on time that it is to have all the
little details yeah all those little
minor things every stone okay turn to
the night I gotta go get the link from a
channel and so does that mean the link
that I just tweeted out is broken yes it
is that's what that yeah that's fine
haha live see me right tis alright yeah
we're alive have been life for 40
seconds hey guys we welcome welcome to
awesome hardware if it's your first time
here that's a perfect idea of what to
expect in deserve an example goodness is
real life yes that's the main main point
alright so eyes on the prize people
funny story at the beginning of today's
show I'm at least gonna be able to
update this yeah funny story um I
realized since Kyle had used not the
system did you bring the system with you
oh oh so since Kyle had used his his
exploit account to stream recently from
a hotel in in San Diego it was set to a
lower resolution so I was like oh we
should stream at 1080 that's what we
usually do so I had to cut the stream to
reset it to 1080 and when I cut the
stream it pops a little thing that says
do you want to hand the stream and I've
gotten really used to just clicking yes
because usually when I stop the three
and we're ending the stream so i clicked
yes which meant that everything that I
had set up for the original for this
original show would like the link and
the thumbnail and all that was like used
up so we streamed to that video for like
five seconds at 720 and then it was over
so sorry only we're not too late it's
it's five it's almost 550 now so we're
still within 20 minutes of when we
usually start but I had to kind of
frantically grab all of the description
and everything
put it back in to a video so that we
could stream and that's where you're
watching right now so that's why we're
maybe not quite as prepared as we
sometimes are at the beginning of the
show but thank you for being here anyway
I'm gonna go ahead and paste the new
link in your chat in your youtube check
yes please please do that would be
absolutely awesome cuz I'm a good friend
of the kid that's why and I will tweet
it you got one view on that old one wait
hold on videos live streams now okay
here we go and I just tweeted it cool
alright I'm not logged into my can I
post links here I'll just do this maybe
not all right so anyway guys let's try
to start the stream the way we usually
do which may or may not work this is
back button do here uh yeah um alright
so far usually tooth if you're not
impressed already maybe buy some stuff

know love alright so today we're gonna
be talking about I might have the show
at least uh Google Google's event that
they had today I watched not the whole
thing but a good-sized chunk of it we
also have a little bit tech news towards
the end everyone's going to be doing an
expanded swordfight section where Kyle
and I are going to argue about many
different things also you have high cpu
usage detective cap unfortunate what
alright it went away um alright so let's
get started right oh no beer check they
forgot the beer check yeah um right now
I'm drinking this split as a porter uh
yes it's portable yes it's a porter yep

blunt beaut beaut ok I could be wrong
black butte porter and that it's not a
Stein we've also got a couple beers from
our good old buddy John from Norway who
was actually a winner a couple weeks
back for the day of refinement giveaway
sorry my voice is a little dead from
twitchcon by the way if you guys
couldn't tell so that's what's going on
there so I don't usually sound like I've
been smoking a pack a day hundreds and
 so the John was kind enough he was
the giveaway winner to bring us a bunch
of beer from Norway way overseas and we
are still like finishing it off I think
these are the last two bottles okay we
have from that batch she brought us like
eight or nine bottles so thank you John
we are down to the wire here I'm
drinking a Hubble canon india pale ale

the show and i'll get really shitty hey
this week if i get messed up for the
second half of the show it'll be your
half and think i can still proceed maybe
I'll boss maybe I'll hiccup for the rest
of the show sorry to anyone who is
around last week I mean who knows maybe
I don't need to apologize and you guys
enjoyed it but um you know I got the
hiccups pretty bad during the show kind
of that was that was probably like one
of the best moments in awesome hardware
ever I think really like we I was that
was a top moment well sure that goes you
made history that night because Allah
along with the the the thing that Jon
Stewart said when when Stephen Colbert
went to do his his late show that he's
doing now that if you if you feel
uncomfortable like you're doing the
right thing apparently yeah right so
that out of your comfort zone right I
didn't feel like I was running a good
show they're all right uh let's let's
cheer just pixel oh yeah she's shake off
the show cheers to all of you guys who
are joining us if you drink in growth
hopefully it's are responsible and
you're of legal drinking age that is
quite tasty actually eze give it yeah
good it's an IPA yeah right so Google I
had an event today where they announced
amongst other things the pixel phone a
new pixel phone they have a video here
for it they throw some shade at Apple
which is kind of funny Scott an aluminum
unibody polished glass finish there's
actually a glass piece on the back as
well as all the way across the front
screen LED display some random features
that I just kind of jotted down as I was
watching the event you can plug it in
and charge it for 15 minutes and you'll
get seven hours of battery life yeah I
was young about time that's what you're
pretty great a new android feature I
don't know if this is an Android feature
or just for the pixel but the OS will
update in the background and just prompt
you for a restart rather than restart
and then like hopefully that means you
have to go through all the updating apps
thing and everything that takes so long
uh twist the phone and in midair to
activate the selfie camera and I was
just a random thing that they showed on
stage is kind of money just like flip it
like when you got the camera up in a
double flip right yeah and it knows that
you uh yeah that you want to use the
selfie cam fingerprint scanner that
doubles the trackpad first phone
shipping with Android 7.1 project Phi
compatible which I think I'm going to be
trying an excellent actually and man so
type C as well right yes of course USB
type-c and all that good stuff so here
is a ours ARS technica article where
they have a little bit more hands on a
few more pictures yeah so that it's it's
available in two versions the XL and
just the standard pixel so you get a 5
inch or 5.5 inch screen they have both
have the same internals I mean it's
mainly just a bigger screen that you get
with the larger one as well as a bigger
battery Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 one
processor it's a quad core with dual 2.5
2.15 gigahertz processors and dual 1.6
egrets processors it's a couple that are
faster than the others they're showing
this blue version right now which is
really blue that's the actual name as
I'm they named the colors the names they
chose for the colors were very Doge like
great yeah um quite black very silver
really blue such such green yes since
they should have such green as well
maybe it the blue sold-out i saw i
actually have ordered one of these and i
was actually like i usually go with
really bland colors for my phones cuz i
don't care i'm like a it's usually black
or whatever yeah so like I when I get
the blue just you know may make a little
difference I feel like they really went
out like they made a point to kind of
differentiate the look and style of
their phone which I feel is good because
I feel like a lot of flagship phones
lately are starting to look exactly the
same well like the s6 and the iphone 6
looked almost you know indistinguishable
and so like they've got the the pixel
has that tempered glass piece on the
back to which is very like noticeable
and kind of unique so it's kind of nice
if their brand
jeanette with their their colors as well
yeah I cool it gives you a little bit
more variety right at the gates yeah
Benjamin thank you for the five-pound
donation greetings to England all the
way across the pond and next keep things
safe for work or the overlords willed a
nice money yet we're gonna we're going
to do that I shall try okay it's been a
while since we've had a sex toy on the
show it's got four gigs of LP ddr4 ram a
pixel imprint fingerprint sensor that
I've already mentioned the pixel will
have a 2770 milliamp hour battery and
the XL will have 3450 and then it's
supposed to have a really really nice
camera of course it should if its
flagship phone I'm sure there's going to
be tons of comparisons between this and
iphone 7 you got twelve point three
megapixels with large pixels 1.5 x 5
micro i believe is that micrometer where
is that smaller than a millimeter I'm
not sure they talk about the actual size
of the pixels that is micro that yeah
yeah micrometer um an F 2 point 0
aperture so you should be able to get
the Boca now here's here's the two
available in two sizes as far as
capacity of storage 32 or hundred and
twenty eight gigs and it's a hundred
bucks more for 128 gig version yeah so
definitely a marketing yeah definitely
my kind of thinking maybe a 64 gig
version in the middle might have helped
a little bit it is already an expensive
phone any of the USB type-c 3.5
millimeter headphone jack bluetooth 4.2
a couple other things you get along with
the phone just by having it since it's
like new flagship and everything free
unlimited uncompressed storage for all
of your photos and videos that's really
nice that's pretty cool I gotta that got
a round of applause from the audience
even 4k and completely uncompressed I
really use video or like backup or like
photo backup services and stuff just cuz
like I don't a lot of them will do some
compression and whatever and I don't I
don't want that yeah um iPhones the same
way I think yeah yeah so that's pretty
cool and especially since this of course
can also shoot 4k video
yeah that was I found that appealing
starts at six hundred and forty nine
dollars for the standard Google pixel a
standard Google pixel 32 gig is 6 650
128 gig of course 100 bucks more 750 and
then the pixel x el is seven hundred and
sixty nine dollars and 128 gig version
is 860 nine dollars which one did you
get and I got the I spent the most money
you can spend at the XL 128 gig yeah i
did and i'm not sure so your last phone
was that also a 5.5 inch screen um well
right now i'm on a galaxy s6 which i was
i bought as a refurb and it was a
replacement for my Nexus 6 so I'm which
was yes I'm it was this was actually
sure of shrink down from my yeah from
your leg asus phone right yeah this is
much smaller than the nexus i was using
and I've almost gotten used to a smaller
phone but I don't mind the larger phones
my hands are reasonably sized so um yeah
but I spent I spent too much money I
don't know did I what today on the phone
yeah I was trying to find my actual
tweets wrong with taxes and stuff that's
close to a grand right uh yeah yeah yeah
I sweet I tweeted my receipts with
information redacted and stuff here's
here's my actual order nine hundred and
fifty nine dollars and fifty-one sense
that is with the areola and volleyball
for the 128 gig yeah that is with about
seventy bucks tax and I also paid $21
for shipping because of course the
estimated dates were like right when I'm
supposed to leave to go out of the
country not on oh great I'm gonna be in
that situation work I hope this arrives
the day I'm getting um it's how is it
probably won't so I don't know I there's
nothing I could do about that but yeah
anyway uh so yeah it's you also do a
follow up on a future awesome harbor and
let us know how you're liking it once I
definitely will well I'm probably gonna
do a video
homeware network video I was hoping to
like get it take it on my trip with me
and then you know do do some sort of on
the fly you know action coverage or
whatever mm-hmm-hmm would be sweet but
anyway I'm actually going to
preemptively send out this straw poll so
you guys can vote really quick because
the question is probably pretty obvious
but I'm you know is is it overpriced is
the question that we're asking so yes
vote on that we'll come back to in just
a few minutes when we get to swordfight
sweet all right next is daydream view
which is a VR headset um you guys
excited about VR headsets who loves the
Samsung gear VR man yeah well actually
before before I before I dive into this
the other thing to point out it's
actually pretty cool that I didn't
mention about the pixel is it comes with
Google assistant and Google assistant is
like the it's like Google now plus you
know the answers on but made fancier
yeah bit more conversational and all
that good stuff right um which for now
is exclusive exclusive to the pixel
phones as far as phones go but then you
can also access it with Google home
which we'll come back to in just a
minute anyway the daydream view is a VR
headset by Google it's one of the VR
headsets that are made to work with a
phone so we have complained in the past
about whether or not that actually
counts as VR knots but for better for
worse that's what they're calling it um
360 videos strapped to your head yeah
that's what it is well this can do a
little bit more because they're actually
developing some apps specifically for
and everything and it goes along with
Google daydream which is you know
they're the VR environment that they're
kind of working on that you can access
with a phone or other VR type device
what makes this one a little bit more
unique is that it is crafted from
technical fabrics fabrics which actually
does give it a bit more of a distinct
look kind of flexible techy type
material like the type of stuff that
you'd imagine you you'd wear if you were
going out for a jog or something like
that you know
in the flexible type fabrics you don't
look quite as silly I mean it's a little
bit smaller you still look kind of silly
but maybe not quite and you know it's
got that texture print on there so it's
a bit more modern yeah it does look a
bit more mana I mean the fact that it's
flexible I do i do definitely I don't
want to don't get me wrong I definitely
prove it looks like he's got a shoe on
his head yeah it looks like I'd like the
sole of a shoe of a shoot it's available
in a few different colors they have like
a kind of gray as grey silver and this
kind of red and then kind of a lighter
gray with I guess kind of gold accents
or something like that and then it's
probably really light than tube fits
fabric it's very light everyone everyone
who i read about who had tried it on
said you know if you compare it to like
a Viper a rift it's oh yeah wait lighter
and everything of course it does it's
not as powerful so don't don't confuse
the capabilities of it but it does come
with this tangle remote which has a
touchpad I believe this area at the top
is a touchpad a couple simple buttons as
well as a gyroscope in it so you can use
that for interaction with the actual
world around you um which they were
saying is it makes a little bit more
sense than like connecting a Bluetooth
you know gamepad or something when
you're starting up your VR experience on
your phone yeah but yeah it's also
pocket friendly so yeah you carry an
xbox with you all or an xbox controller
with you all the time yes well it
actually um it actually goes right there
so nice does little front of it that
flips down the little remote just their
slots in there so you know hopefully
that makes it a little bit less
difficult to lose pretty cool and yeah
so there it is the daydream view VR $79
is what you would pay for it and then it
will of course work with pixel phones
right now and of course they're saying
like most android phones i Donna say
most they said a lot of android phones
this will work with right now I'm you
know they're trying to make it flexible
for all that sooo are you planning on
getting one no I did not order this I
don't care yeah this is that's what I
think it to be yeah uh I mean we have a
five and a rift so I care okay that's
those two bruh I care about VR and I
care about making VR headsets
that are more lightweight and I
appreciate some of the things that they
did with this one to make it better and
I can see you know an oculus rift to
version 2 or whatever or an HTC vive
version too heavily considering
something like this when it comes to
design because it just makes it less
clunky and bulky and that right anything
but yeah uh yeah and then I wasn't
already said it comes in different
colors so cool that's what I chromecast
ultra was another one of the
announcements when it comes to actual
hardware so this is the third generation
of the chromecast it will sell for $69
it's very reasonably priced and it will
do all the things that the chromecast
already does so easily allow you to be
watching something on your phone and
just throw it up on your TV that with
the chromecast plugged into in stuff
yeah some pretty cool updates though a
4k video support of course that's kind
of what you would expect also HDR
coulombs not necessarily expecting both
of those but it's got both of them so
must have a faster processor in there
because it also has 1.8 times faster
loading time when you like you of a
video it's also got an Ethernet port
which I thought was cool as an option
especially if you're in a very congested
congested wireless area yeah and the
ethernet ports not on that little pocket
self it's on the power adapter that
comes with it and then I was reading a
little bit of the article but I kind of
had to skip over this one because the
show time was coming up but the anon
tech article which is linked in the
description if you guys want to read a
little bit more this one's directly from
Ryan Smith he has some of the specs laid
out here as far as what they know we
don't know for the ultra what processor
it's using that kind of thing we do know
it's got a dual a two antenna wireless
radio two point four and five gigahertz
and yeah that's that's about it um so
yeah he's saying it might support 1080
60 which has been one of the downfalls
of the current chromecast yeah which
does not so yeah all right last product
here for the this is supposed to be a
hot and heavy hardware segment by the
way but I think ever gets even say that
Oh is google home okay so Google home is
basically like
like an Amazon I go heck oh yeah type of
thing um so it's google's version of
amazon echo because amazon had the
amazon echo first and that's why it's
easy to explain it like that but yeah it
does still have some pretty cool
features so it's got a touch pad at the
top so you can control it via touch
although it's made primarily to control
via voice so you say okay google and as
long as you're in the same room or with
an earshot of it because it has
far-field microphones right um it'll
yeah little thing and listen to you and
then you can ask you to question or tell
to do something or whatever and it
should do it it got speakers big-ass
speakers yes it's got some substantial
speakers built-in music and stuff which
I thought was pretty cool so almost even
like a competitor's into something like
oh crap i forget the name uh what's
what's the wireless it's like a
higher-end wireless in-home Wi-Fi
playing music solution my friend used to

we are pretty lame on video I will say
guys are into it thank you very much and
happy belated birthday to you as well
nope cheers and and also pie for the
five dollar donation thank you your
opinion matters pc 08 with GT x 1080 for
the one sli and 6700 k single loop cpu +
GPU or cpu and cpu individual loops um
if you're in the PC OA you're probably
over to you already dealing with kind of
a small case right the pc 08 that's the
isn't that the the Langley
wall-mounted chassis that's the wall
managed chassis no no I remember that is
lien Lee it's oh oh it's the one that
boxy one yes the boxy one yeah um I
would you got the space go for it do
loops yeah do a little bit cuz it
yeah as you got us a lot going on and
even in at 6700 k isn't gonna out put it
quite as much heat as like a 68 fifty or
sixty nine hundred or something like
that just go for the double loops you
you're already gone you're already
invested so much yep all right back to
Google home though and thank you
everyone in chat sonos is what I was
trying to refer to and you guys knew
exactly what I thought oh yes you know
me so well alright so these are going to
cost a hundred twenty nine dollars
that's for a single unit you can get
more than one of them and scatter them
around your home if you have a large
home or something like that available
multiple colors these are fabric based
ones on the left's and the the orange
the blue and the purple then they also
have some metallic bases in the black
and copper and white fun part of Google
assistance which is again the rebranded
version of google's voice powered search
and Google now it is smarter and more
conversational and in the demos that
they had they they talked to it and you
can kind of have more of a conversation
with it rather than just asking a pretty
direct question and getting a pretty
direct answer although ultimately what
you're really going to get is kind of
the same information that Google now
would provide for you it does integrate
with music apps like Spotify and Pandora
which is pretty cool so you can tell it
to play music and it will like you can
set a preferred music service and it
will play on your preferred music
service or it would like do the other
music service if the song you asked for
wasn't on the first one for example and
it will soon allow you to cast Netflix
videos to any TV with a chromecast
attached going on yeah which is which is
also kind of cool far field Mike's 3
speaker and the basis i already
mentioned those things and there is a
techcrunch article linked in the
description if you guys want to read a
little bit more about their first look
at it also there's a mute button I kind
of like I like the mute button and thank
you for making it not hidden in tucked
away somewhere yeah because you know
it's still paranoid about a device just
listens to you all the time right and we
have to assume that the mute button
actually works and does what it says it
does and actually mutes and stops
listening to you but you you likes of
course it would you just you just mantle
the mute by
just like me nothing there's just like a
wall maybe the mute but finding anything
mute button turns on like advanced
listening mode they don't want us to
hear what they're talking about
increases the decibel reading or
something feeds everything directly to
the NSA that's what the mute goodness
all right that clearly have something to
hide that's my assumption um so that's
all for your hon heavy hardware google
edition yay fun stuff thanks for people
in chat who are still pointing out that
it's so knows someone said the mute
button techno scope said the new button
only stops it from responding so but
that doesn't necessarily mean that maybe
it's not listening really but it's a
meet it's a mic mute that I got the
whole idea though or maybe he's just
elaborating on our our theory I'm not
sure he could be joking matter okay
let's move on to a sword fight we
actually have an expanded certified
segment for this week because we missed
sword fight last week so I actually
pulled one of the questions from last
week to do again this week and I had
nothing to do with the fact that I was
rushing before the show started alright
so let's start off with this one right
here this is an article on ARS technica
about amazon recently banning reviews
based on free or discounted products
there's a wait say that again amazon and
review is going either just started or
they're going to now ban reviews on that
are based on free or discounted products
now what I'm not clear on here is amazon
has a program called vine where they
send people products to review for free
yeah now i'm not sure if amazon is
banning all of it they're cutting off
the vine program i kind of doubt they
would do that but maybe maybe now the
vine program will be exclusive like
that's the only way you can get a free
product interview it on amazon but lots
of vendors like a manufacturer for
example can set up their own we send you
a product you post a review on amazon
program if they've won um you know I
think I think gigabyte might have
something like that going on or
something
but yeah it's basically the idea is that
getting the product for free you're
getting the product for a discount
creates awareness creates a bias and
leads to overwhelmingly or significantly
more positive reviews yeah and the
articles describes how they did a study
of seven million reviews on review meta
and the incentivized reviews are the
ones that includes the proper disclaimer
text where they put what's the text you
put I received this product for free or
at a discount in exchange for my honest
unbiased review then it means oxymoron
right so they basically search that and
they found that that if it included that
rating that the product was rated 0.38
stars higher than non incentivized
reviews and in a 5-star cap system point
three eight stars is a substantial
amount of them of light and it is
because I mean if something has four
stars on amazon I'm class and a similar
product has four point four stars then
I'm more inclined to buy the one that
has the higher rating it seems miniscule
but when you're comparing you know tons
of products and it really comes down to
the wire then that point four star
difference really influences your
position and so yeah no question
manufacturer manufacturers definitely
have an incentive to get reviews for
their products especially good ones so
if sending out some free ones means you
can get an overall higher review rating
on amazon then there's lots of people
who have done it so but amazon has
decided that since this is tainting
their ratings that they're going to cut
it off that's an average to that is an
average that's scary just way way better
wait what alright so here's the straw
poll question we're going to be arguing
over right now and you guys are free to
of course argue it yourselves or you can
argue it yourselves or you can vote or
you can listen to what we have to say
and then based on our wise opinions then
you then then you vote you do I'll do
all that stuff
all rights okay what do you what do you
feel here should you trust reviews based
on free or discounted products we got of
course basically we got a yes or a no
option what do you think well I kind of
already started my argument for saying
no all right so kal-el you should go for
that then I'll say no they're
compromising biased and mostly evil as a
reviewer myself if if a fender well I
guess it doesn't really apply that way
right cuz i do get for free anyway
man i'm gonna argue the other one well I
guess that's different it is it well for
us it's if you're Abe you get paid I
knew I knew that this had they were
layers there layers to this quest is
tricky is if you are if you argue that
they're compromised then you're
basically saying that we're compromised
damn it what did I'm so compared rate
yeah I thought this was gonna be using
15 seconds to think about it while I
real quickly say thank you very much
Randall a five dollar donation and yes
it was great to meet you as well at the
tipsy crow that was a very fun night I
got to hang out with with Luke and it
was lots of lots of good people that was
great it was nice because i felt like it
there was an there was a decent number
of people there but it didn't feel like
it was closer out crowded yeah are like
a mess they'd also didn't feel like no
one showed up good thanks Josh if you
happen to be watching for helping
coordinate that event it was neat um
okay so I'm gonna change my stance here
and say of course you should um because
we get pollen I get free products all
the time and all of our reviews are
completely unbiased uh granted we're in
sort of different both because we are
tech reviewers that's what we do for a
living but some of these people who
review products online just lean amazon
reviews that maybe that's what they do
for a living maybe they just review
stuff on amazon or you know whatever
other you know websites there are that
your resellers retailers and stuff so I
mean point three eight stars isn't that
bad I mean really come on come on like
it's just just like I mean it's not
really gonna make a difference in the
grand scheme of things it's not even
half a star I mean they don't even have
increments in point three or point four
stars it's like point five it doesn't
even reach the minimum requirement for
having an increment so i don't know i
think based on what Paul and I do the
fact that you're all watching us now
means that you trust that all the
products we get for free are reviewed
properly and reviewed unbiased Lee so
why shouldn't we why should we treat
these products any different or these
reviews any different I don't know tell
us ball well you made a strong point
there at the end because basically
you're telling people that if they
disagree with you it means that they're
wrong for even watching our channels at
all which seems like a strong argument
but what you're not taking into
consideration is the fact that people
could be watching us to find out what
they shouldn't be doing who knows maybe
nobody trusts us at all which they
shouldn't because paid for are not paid
for but reviews based on free or
discounted products are compromised and
biased and evil they're well they're
watching us to say which products are
being sent to people for compromised
reviews and then we should no longer
trust those companies see we're
basically promoting the more knowledge
of companies that are shady and people
are watching our channels to find out
about those shady company so that they
can then avoid them I just now thought
up that I know this theory just came
into my head so I haven't not researched
it so this might not be based that you
know I'm not going for use at all ya
know this makes perfect sense yes it
does it does so alright so that
obviously if you get something for free
it's like you're not going to treat it
with the same amount of scrutiny as if
you had invested your own money into it
like that's that's just psychology and
it's obviously backed up by the
scientist i a'n't if accrue salts that
are demonstrated in the article so point
proven hey see I'll make sense all right
ah let's see what you guys think about
this one yes he has a brilliant argument
it was good really good uh oh you're all
you're all wrong
here all wrong what what am I thinking
putting a sensible response in there I'm
but uh twenty four percent no they're
compromised and biased and mostly evil
yeah I would have to agree in the grand
scheme message that's pretty low choice
there Kyle you picked at eight percent
her I was going you know I was I was
rooting for the underdog yeah you were
you were I was taking up a undertaking a
challenge all right well it was well
played well played yeah I tried okay
let's move on ah this is the next one
which is about YouTube heroes you too
sir this is just like a new MMO or a new
mobo run my mouth a little bit sounds
like a new moment we're getting started
with wow look at the like dis really
like ratio with us oh my god this is
I've never seen it so much worse Rebecca
Black did better than that yeah that's
insane alright so if you guys aren't
familiar with YouTube heroes you
probably should because it's been out
for a couple weeks now I said like ours
this information lamely racist or
something what not are you not familiar
with this at all no really this went
over your head when did this come out
about a week and a half ago because it
was going to be a we're gonna talk about
it in last week's show hey am I have
somehow missed it so YouTube heroes is
basically YouTube's program to engage
their community of viewers to help too I
want to say sensor to flag inappropriate
comments and videos oh my god to add
captions and subtitles okay these users
will have the power to do all those
things if you're part of the YouTube
Heroes program to get a separate
dashboard where you can track your
contributions YouTube will still get the
last say on what to remove from the
website hope so so I mean the
fear is obviously a bunch of YouTube
heroes who decided to hit your channel
start taking down all your videos
youtube will still have the final say
according to this heroes can only flag
and report them but a lot of people
still aren't happy to YouTube is putting
unpaid volunteers in charge so to speak
so they're not getting paid at all no
they're not getting paid this is a
volunteer program people do this already
people already flagged videos that
shouldn't be flagged yeah but this will
give them more power great
good God so he's an engadget article on
it that's actually a little bit more on
this this is this is YouTube's way of
saying no guys it wasn't us that
up everything it was the heroes this is
just a huge scapegoat that Utah's
created because everyone's blaming you
to like now we need some other elements
we needed we need a common enemy between
the content creators and ourselves
youtube anti-heroes yes alright so the
question see your game youtube I see
what you're doing see what you did there
and I don't like it the question just to
keep things simple and straightforward
is does YouTube hero suck and despite
what is probably a pretty obvious answer
based on the lake dislike ratio for that
video we will argue it nonetheless its
controversial so argue conflict yes it
will destroy you tube and the trolls
will take over no it's gonna be awesome
I'm gonna finally have community
moderation and a third option I'm still
kind of pissed it wasn't just a big
guitar hero announcement um this that
occurred to me it's funny when I wrote
it in we can go uh Sonny way what do you
think no shows huge oh yes yes I forgot
to read the question ok does it suck yes
it does destroy youtube so ok going
against your likely answer which is it's
gonna be awesome we'll finally have a
community mod system that's stupid
because YouTube isn't just one community
I mean it is but it's like got a bunch
of other umbrellas underneath it like
there are dudes who like are on YouTube
that watch like one type of video or one
type of genre video and then like
stumble into another genre that they
hate or they find some content creator
that they just despise and now they have
like full rein to like just go ahead and
flag it and they're giving more power
for that whereas like if you go on like
a tech forum like you go on the linus
tech tips for more something shameless
plug like you're not going to have like
soccer moms who are into soccer flood
like flocking the linus tech tips for
not going to go to linus tech tips com
and and like get like flagged or
because it's a completely separate e
unit youtube screwed in a community
sense because it's just too many
communities all in one space it's just
too easy to have to see a suggested
video we've all seen those suggested
videos that do not apply to us at all
you click that video and you're like how
the was i suggested this and and it
doesn't take much for some bitter troll
on the internet to see that video I'm be
like you and I hated flag like
flagging is like the new dislike for
trolls you know so it is just too easy
for people to do that and I think that
YouTube giving power to those types of
people is just wrong in in more ways
than it's not so you try to argue that
bitch alright so oh well does YouTube
hero suck no it's going to be awesome
and we will finally have community
moderation so here's a problem this is
change and whenever you try to change
something on the internet there's waving
flag we're getting flagged right what is
it okay starring your devata yeah so
whenever you try to change something on
the internet that's been the same way
for a while people will resist it like
every every possible way they can I mean
you take like as a UI that people have
gotten used to you try to move a button
and everyone's like oh my god I keep
pushing the wrong button yeah you know
that kind of thing regardless of like
your degree in UX design and all that
kind of stuff that you might have but
back to the point here youtube heroes
there's community moderation that's done
well there's lots of examples of
moderated by the community communities
on the internets I mean I'm gonna throw
bread it up there as an example granted
there reddit is another one of those
ones it's so huge similar to YouTube
that there are different pockets and
whatnot some of them they're better than
others but done correctly community
moderation is really the only way that
you're going to have some semblance of
civility on a platform like YouTube
where anyone who wants to say anything
can just go and say it there are too
many people posting too many things in
this environment for it to be reasonable
to
say Google you need to have staffed
moderators to go and browse and proves
all this stuff and you know take out the
bad stuff and you need human eyes
looking at each thing and making a
decision that's just it's not going to
happen and if you guys enjoy watching
videos on YouTube for free then I think
people should be a little bit more
receptive to something like this because
people like having a dignified
conversation and this is just sort of a
means to that and I think people are
overreacting about the power that these
heroes are going to actually have
because like i said in the in the
lead-up to this YouTube still gets the
last say on what happens on what gets
removed and what doesn't get removed
this is simply a means of bringing
problem issues to the attention of the
dedicated staff that YouTube has so that
they can handle it in a more efficient
manner and we all know how proactive
YouTube is it has that was really I feel
like I was really well said what I just
said I kept being afraid that I was just
gonna like forget words but I actually
kept you know I kept up with it the
whole time any bed it was all phyllisha
anne too bad that I believed none of
it's just making it making it all
alright oh let's see what you guys think
everyone thinks it must suck quite a few
people are pissed it wasn't a big guitar
hero announcements that day did better
than right so we traded they percenters
yeah I got the a-team on shiner though
in the second second round so there it
is youtube heroes sucks I'm surprised
that 24 people still were like no I
think it sounds great all right real
quick I was like some real late this
this one that I already linked towards
the beginning of the show so you guys
can vote on it if you haven't had a
chance to yet we'll be coming back to
this in just a moment but before we do
that a more interesting question we
don't have to argue about this wait
first our donations Oh donations
donations i dollars from Stephen Hill
thank you very much heroes could just be
a trap permanently banned from reporting
videos after they got the after they get
hero status perhaps the guy can hope
nice meeting y'all hey it's nice being
you to Steven hmm I'd remember
chat yes Patrick even thank you for the
donation you guys are great quick
question best location for UV lights on
UV coolant with rad set up similar to
Arctic Panther and hot line pretty much
with UV lights wherever you would put
regular LED lights and I don't know it's
too much different I mean you want to be
able to hit the coolant we're actually
have mine on Arctic Panther is in the
top radiator like if the windows on this
side it's actually tucked into the
radiator um like the little lips that
sticks over between the the bottles like
the lowest part of the radiator and the
fins so that cover up no because it's
good Peter so it's like up there but
then it shines down and towards
everything else so it I liked it cuz I
hadn't seen it done before and it was in
a position where you can't see the LEDs
themselves but it still gets a lot of
light on the on the tubes and coolant
and everything so i can send her
something like that um yeah I mean I
think I think a big strip across the top
and on a big strip across the bottom
both positioned out so you can't see him
from the outside of the case but then
down if you have a reservoir that's at
the front of your case also just lining
the LEDs running them down the front of
your case as well as a possibility if
you have room hmm oh yeah nice all right
good luck on the build Patrick GG all
right so here's the question that I
asked last week and I was just pulling
this up because there was a bunch of
people who voted on this last week
there's like over 100 votes even though
I never talked about it on the stream
there's just people who found it in the
description so congrats to all you guys
and you were hearing all the options oh
wait I didn't mean to vote it was so
which phone should you get even though
you've already got it yeah which one
should i get even i already ordered it i
just want to say almost thirty percent
of people said just it galaxy note
7 that ain't the that is hold it
a little bit it's either because of the
 adore because people want me to die
somehow and get a galaxy note 7 all the
hairs here's the haters gonna hate lots
of votes for the one plus three I was
considering one plus three but um yeah I
got the google pixel XL so i did get the
third option here of the phones that
won't kill me
uh why is the phone I recommended option
iphone 7 plus google pixel 7 plus beat
the google pixel that's we have google
pixel and XL we're so far apart yeah
interesting people definitely want me to
have a big phone though the smaller
phones did not get many votes oh yeah
it's good you need something substantial
to hold in your hand all right it's got
to be proportional right all right
exactly yeah exactly what were you
talking about no no um all right so
since we've already argued a fair
amounts I'm going to just show the
results for this one especially because
we gave people the option or you can
just you can give your opinion is it
overpriced 650 to 750 dollars I think
it's a little overpriced because i'm not
a huge phone user yeah i'm not a huge
power user it doesn't really mean the
world to me that my phone is like ten
percent better than all the other phones
and i don't want to spend that much more
on it because of that ten percent
diminishing law of returns i feel i
think it's also overpriced I still
bought it I probably would not have
invested that much money in it if it
wasn't also something that I could use
to make videos on for my channel so yeah
that that definitely had an impact BBQ
ribs oh that sounds delicious thank you
for your five dollar donation uh thank
you for the congrats on the 80 episodes
we've done eight this is our idiot
episode yeah how long do you think it'll
be until USB type-c is integrated into
pc cases that's a good question um i
would say longer rather than shorter
only because i remember the USB 3.0 long
ass time to get finalized now you
already have USB type-c like ports on
motherboards like on the rear i/o and
stuff like that not on board but yeah as
far as having a USB type-c port
integrated onto like a chassis like
front panel I or something like that
yeah that's a good question i have not i
don't think i've seen any cases that
just have it because when you have to
have the motherboard with a 3.1 header
as well yeah there's no standardized USB
3.1 header you
yeah but you can have a USB type-c port
that's a u.s. ut3 why no connections so
I wonder if like just an adapter would
be all that was needed or something like
that it's a good question I hope soon
because especially once i get my pixel
i'll start looking down pejoratively
negatively on any micro USB stuff i'll
be like that sucks now right now I'm
like I've got so many micro USB cables
I'll never run out now I'm gonna be like
I hate them any time you like plugging
your phone to charge it after you pixel
it was like look someone else in the eye
and just do it without looking just yeah
well I was so not like I don't even know
which way it's going in but okay okay uh
anyway let's see what you guys think is
it overpriced most people say yes and
they pay well dinner and enriched this I
mean honestly this is rickard this is
probably the biggest thing for this cuz
cuz I this yeah this is the biggest
negative i think this irritated me as
well the reason i got the pixel is
because i enjoyed my nexus phone a
couple Nexus phones that I had so much
and I kind of wanted that same
experience at the same time I was ready
for a flagship phone and investing a
little bit more but I can completely
understand people who are like Nexus
phones used to be like 300 bucks and you
can buy them right up no contract right
and there were really good phones yeah
yeah that that sucks i hope the nexus
line is not dead I hope they relaunched
a new Nexus phone in the future that's
just you know not as good as the pixel
but still reasonably priced and still
gives you the full android and all that
kind of stuff only eleven percent said i
love thousand dollars make smartphones
all right sad let's move on to final
segment news right that's the final
segment of course is where we will talk
about more news things the pc version of
Gears of War can now be preloaded if you
guys are going to buy the game or you
want to if you've pre-ordered the game I
don't recommend pre-ordering games but
if you have you can preload it it is 73
freaking gigabytes so make sure you got
plenty of space it's crazy apparently
also there are people who have been
having some problems with it you need
the windows
anniversary edition and you need the
latest patch for Windows 10 anniversary
edition that just came out I believe in
the past few days so if you don't have
both of those it won't download or won't
work but even people who have those are
still having problems with downloads
that either won't start or failing to
finish the article here from gaming
volts.com I originally had a tweaktown
article here but it redirected me to
some really shitty page it wasn't yeah
the tweaktown link redirected you know I
just I had there's a tweaktown article
on this and I just had the article up
and whatever ad was loading on the page
was sending the entire page to a
different site that was just an added
Lord bloatware site says I'm
disappointed so I had to switch to this
one I've never heard of gaming bull for
shame but you know what I've had this
article up for a good 45 minutes and it
hasn't redirected the page to something
telling me I have a virus so that's nice
anyway it's the little things this is
the little things the night so yeah if
you guys are having this issue and maybe
there's few out there the article says
resetting the windows cash can solve its
doesn't always but you go to run and run
WS reset that we reset the cash I
personally downloaded it from the
Windows Store myself I started up last
night that's Wheaton about it when it
was still a mystery but yeah 73.3 three
gigs pretty substantial also I loaded it
through the windows store not the Xbox
app on Windows 10 so maybe that has
something to do with it it seems like
people are having more luck with it
downloading see ya downloading directly
from the Windows Store yeah cool that
comes out later this I believe it's
available everywhere on the 10th this is
information I should have had for this
story but there should be reviews coming
out in just a couple days for it so cool
people be able to talk about it and all
that good stuff maybe we'll do a live
stream of it there's perhaps it might be
cool perhaps because multiplayer
streaming might be available before the
game actually launches possibly possibly
yes we don't know where if so there's
some potential follow our Twitter's guys
because we're gonna try to do some stuff
with that although there's still some
stuff up in the air that we're not high
percent sure about so I don't promise
anything but follow our twitter is and
we'll talk
that if we do live streams or whatever
we'll talk flare storm 99 I'm going to
be checking my p.o box tomorrow
guaranteed I'm going there so i will get
anything that might be there that hasn't
been gotten yet um alright movie I'm
Induna you haven't done mail time in a
while yeah it's been a couple weeks we
got hard to tell though so it'll boards
honestly i don't i don't have the p.o
box listed very many places like it's
not publicly i don't i don't want to get
on any spam lists or anything like that
if I can avoid it so it's only really
verbally talked about and I usually talk
about it in the in my monthly Q&amp;amp;A video
right um but yeah zack vasquez thank you
for your five dollar donation I'm glad
you love the show motherboard doesn't
support sli crossfire instead you have a
gtx 970 should just sell my 970 get to
RX for AES or should I buy a new
motherboard and another 970 alright so
it probably doesn't support sli because
your lower s the lower pcie slot is
probably a by 4 and not a by eight
connection I I mean you'll be okay with
two arcs for 80s but I wouldn't really
recommend that I mean I like single card
solutions honestly yeah thank you unless
you're unless you're rocking the best
card out there unless you like on a 1080
or tight next right now and you can't go
any further without doing SLI I'd
recommend possibly if you're going to
sell the 970 just invest in a better
single card if you're thinking about 2
40's maybe think about a ten seventy or
something like that yeah probably better
bet um but yes thank you for the
donation all right next up this is
random but random Pakal took all the
good news stories today okay which it
was a trending topic um on right so nike
has self-lacing sneakers they're finally
going on sale november 28th even though
they're lates and it's 2016 now and not
2015 inspired of course by back to the
future to michael j fox rocking his
self-lacing sneakers let's see it in
action they're pretty they're pretty
sweet actually the the wired article the
wired issue that just came out has a big
article on this and just all the design
and everything and I'm pretty a company
like Nike in the level of the level of
detail that they go into a
something like this is absolutely insane
yeah um granted their margins are very
good on choose oh yeah that's why they
can invest more in the development so
these are called hyper adapt one point
oh they will be available for experience
and purchase not just purchasing but
also experiencing starting on the
twenty-eighth of November but sorry to
anyone who's international only in
select nike locations in the US pricing
is unknown at the article said it's
probably high 1 million dollars yeah
probably really I'm what do you think
would you guess 250 20 say 300 is the
fried 3rd fret 250 300 probably bare
minimum it's never before seen something
that's like never before seen you can
just and then like three special edition
colours that are limited that are 500
bucks yeah don't know so I'm like some
sir yeah this an internal cable system
made from fishing line and a pressure
sensor in the soul so you put your fit
of your foot in and then cables tighten
based on an algorithmic pressure
equation and the fit can be adjusted
with a pair of buttons near the tongue
so it's pretty fancy that's pretty fancy
all this technology so people don't have
to tie their content yeah it's been
since it's every time in I Larry well
now I've had to tie my shoe so just like
Jesus what kitty just I just leave my
shoes tied all the time and I just slip
out of them I feel like everyone does
that don't they do you tie your shoes
every time you put them like who has
time for that I really I usually slip on
so you're already tie they're usually
pretty loose because I'm not a freakin
Olympian runner yeah so like they don't
need to be like super supportive or
whatever but I guess if you're like
super active and you're not complete
yeah home home bodies or couch potatoes
like we are then maybe it makes sense I
was reading an article on this earlier
actually they were saying that the
future is for the the laces to actually
restrict and contract and like and go
back and forth based on like
microseconds like as you're running like
based on like the steps you're taking
that's like the the long-term goal that
Nike has in mind that is that it's
constantly changing like as soon as you
like run and then as soon as you stop
running it's just like loosens or
whatever because it's like okay you
don't need it like that much support
irreverent
seems like a bit better use of the
technology yes I'd writes more benefit
rather than just I didn't have to tie my
shoes yeah that's what I see this as
it's like a precursor to what they
really want to do the other option I was
going to suggest is going with velcro
artistic or just little crow a classic
velcro this problem was solved in the
80s yeah all right finally ending with a
couple YouTube YouTube yahoo articles
yahoo has open sourced their machine
learning porn filter but so there we go
I like there i like i like the
pornographic so innocent looking that's
from getty images but thanks getting hum
alright so this is an article about
Yahoo's convolutional neural net or CNN
no relation I have to say it's like you
weren't interested in watching CNN
before you thought knew it was about
porn um but to be clear this is used for
filtering of pornographic images but
they've also open sourced the code a a
caveat in the article quote from I
believe someone from you two are from
yahoo we do not provide guarantees of
accuracy of output rather we make this
available for developers to explore and
enhance as an open source project so
it's so so it's so like independent
developers can have algorithms that
filter porn yes so you can yeah you can
you can get this code and basically you
can use the machine learning to do
filtration of stuff like images witter
needs to hop on this and I've been to
all about too many Fembots lately that
would be nice that are just something
that are looking to chat way too hard or
it's open source you could get the code
and build that yourself a nobody got
time for that we don't know how to code
Jerry we need to give this code to Jerry
yes have Jerry used yahoo CNN code but
it's Jerry he would inverse it and be
like unfiltered ok that makes yer every
porn that's my fancy that's my final
bullet point oh is it is to use real fan
girl um I'm on the same page with you to
my are you I mean evil
depending on who you ask I mean can we
reverse this can we make it so that it
filters out all the bad porn and we only
have the highest pull the most premium
best porn I was trying to low hanging
fruit as well as you know the codes only
available on github for now yes but soon
it would also be important out there
that's absolutely beautiful anyway so
that's that's kind of fun last story
though we're ending in a dark note you
will all die also has to do with youth
with Yahoo I keep almost saying YouTube
Yeoh yahoo has been secretly scanning
customer emails for US intelligence
agencies oh no no this is a Reuters is
it Reuters or Reuters perfect all right
that's it all right readers Reuters it's
just like neuter yeah oh yeah that makes
sense reader yeah and where i got
writers from is just really annoyed all
right ah esther just to be clear this is
uh articles based on three former
employees and a fourth person apprised
of the events who have talked to
exclusively to reporters from reuters
they have basically implicated you yahoo
as there is they've said yahoo is
secretly built a custom software program
to search all of its customers incoming
emails for specific information provided
by US intelligence officials there's
some vagueness in the article about
certain details which either are unknown
or unable to be provided which are a
little scary but they compiled with a
classified US government demand I'm
sorry they complied with a classified US
government demand so the government
asked them and they said okay and yes
are you at a beer no no you can't dress
yeah go for no it's actually quickly yes
yes yeah so the government asked they
said yes is basically what happened they
scan hundreds of millions of yahoo mail
accounts it is not known what
information intelligence officials were
looking for only that they wanted yahoo
to search for a set of characters again
pretty broad and vague what data yahoo
may have
it over if any is unknown it's likely
that the NSA or FBI had approached other
internet companies with the same demand
since this isn't usually the type of
thing that would just go to specifically
Yahoo however Google and alphabet were
both contacted by Reuters and Microsoft
and I'm sorry google / alphabet and
Microsoft were both contacted both of
them said they had not participated
there I think both of them said we
didn't like we have no knowledge of such
you know inquiry and if we had there's
no way we would have complied with it
yeah hopefully they're telling the truth
but yeah there it is that's just it's
kind of freaky and it definitely does
not bode well for Yahoo to have this
kind of information come out because
they're not exactly doing the best for
instance last month I think we might
have mentioned this on the show at some
point state sponsored hackers gained
access to 500 it was only came to light
that state sponsored hackers had gained
access to 500 million customer accounts
in 2014 maybe this is a response to that
maybe yeah it's interesting because
sometimes we don't know the full story
yeah like we only know some we thought
read the heavy but this was a response
from that it meant you went from having
state sponsored hackers being able to
read your emails to States Punk
sponsored hackers and the US government
which makes everything better yeah and
then finally at the same time right now
Yahoo is trying to complete a deal to
sell its core business to verizon
communications for four point eight
billion dollars who knows this will
affect the share price and verizon also
a company with a glowing track record of
oh yeah humanitarianism and moral all
things all of those good things yes but
anyway guys fun that is all for my half
