enough time hello everyone welcome to
awesome hardware this is a live show we
talked about technology we drink a few
beers we have a good time and a huge
thank you to you for being here if
you're watching live you're super
awesome
yep you might be watching on twitch TV /
awesome hardware we stream there we also
stream to our YouTube channels this is
my half of the show the second half of
episode hundred and 1919 be on my
channel Paul's hardware we already
streamed for about an hour on Kyle's
channel bit wit so check the video
description for a link to that if you
missed it since we do drink a few drinks
on the show we do occasionally use some
adult language and that kind of things
so be forewarned if you happen to be
sensitive to that kind of talk look at
least you didn't say it as I was giving
the warning this time so that's that
makes that means the warning list this
is actually every day I'm learning it's
did a good job alright also if you
happen to enjoy our channels and the
work that we do a great way to help
support us and get yourself some
merchandise is to check out our stores
pulsar Burnett is my store and I have
shirts and I have some decals and I have
hoodies and I have some paint glasses
and they're all really high quality so
check it out or some stuff when does the
dildo hit the store we don't have the
dildo yet that's still an in production
apparent oh look the polo shirts on sale
look at look at my polo shirt sale get a
polo shirt in the meantime we're idle
there or being prepared right there for
the polo shirt sale yeah interested net
Kyle also has a store bit wit dot tech
slash store is where you can check out
his store he has ladies cut shirts now
as well as well as fidget spinners hats
and all kinds of get merchants
so thanks to all you guys who order
stuff during the show we'll give you a
shout out at the end if you happen to
order while we're live go to drinkin
beer yes we already were drinking a
little something from loggin eat this
now you need this a little something
Hale it's delicious it's also 7.5
percent so yeah it's quite a punch it's
not it's not a lightweight beer but who
does not but it's tasty and we were
drinking the Newcastle earlier so this
should hopefully yep this and the
Newcastle yeah alright let's get right
into the plans content for today
starting off with tech news and are you
guys familiar with Intel I've heard of
them they make processors they have a
really really heard of process fancy
high-end processor that they've been
teasing since June called the 79 80 XE
the i9 79 80 Extreme Edition we thought
this was going to be coming out when the
rest of the sky like X stuff came out
but they delayed everything beyond their
ten core part the 7900 X so the 79 79 80
XE as well as the 79 sixty seventy nine
forty and seventy nine twenty are gonna
have 18 16 14 and 12 cores respectively
and this w CCF Tech article by newsman
Parata says that there's some leaked
benchmarks now these are not necessarily
from the most reliable source so please
bear that in mind it's a WCC F Tech
article grain of salt and all that good
stuff these were actually derived from a
wherever they derived from a Korean
bulletin board which showed screenshots
however of the 79 ATX running a fire
strike physics as well as several
comparisons at least in screenshot form
to some of the specs and temperatures
running against an AI 979 xx which would
be the 12 core variants the tests were
run on an Asus Rampage 6 Apex X $2.99
motherboard and the fire strike custom
physics
score was thirty seven thousand four
hundred and eighty five which is pretty
damn impressive that's a pretty high
score now there's a bunch of other
screenshots you guys can check these out
in the article they're probably too
small to actually make out much of the
text on them or anything like that right
now either but these are of just the
reason the ROG real bench to run some
tests so you can see some temperature
numbers as well as some various
overclocking performance again assuming
this is correct they even posted
screenshots of the actual UEFI BIOS
showing the overclocking frequency that
they were going for and that kind of
thing so there you go now if you want to
compare the physics test results to a
more normal test result thirty-seven
thousand four hundred eighty five fire
strike physics the seventy nine hundred
x10 core at stock scores about ten
thousand on that Wow so ten thousand
versus thirty seven thousand four
hundred eighty-five the difference there
would be going from ten cores to 18
cores not quite two times the number of
course but also going from the stock
frequency running across all cores of
the 79 had 900 X which I believe is
gonna hit you at three point two two
three point three gigahertz although I
could be wrong on that I didn't put that
in my notes
don't forgive me if I'm wrong on that
but comparing that to the four point
eight gigahertz overclocked across all
cores that oppose idli oh yeah this
overclock was doing but several guesses
ill that's still a pretty huge jump ten
thousand to thirty seven thousand so I
don't know it was a custom fire strike
benchmark if you run fire strike physics
tests only it will pop up with the
results as custom so it still could be
the legit just physics test but we're
not sure if they went in and made any of
their adjustments to the actual settings
of the test so that could be a variance
as well right there are some more
detailed specs on the actual CPUs in the
screenshots though for instance the
vcore was set to auto it was peaking at
about 1.25 volts which is pretty nominal
for a skylake
and the 7900 X I'm sorry the 7920 X that
they also apparently have a version of
can be seen in some of the screenshots
if you're interested in the frequencies
and temperatures however they didn't
cool publish any fire strikes for with
that they didn't say what cooler was
being used either although they did say
was being liquid cooled so we're not
sure if liquid cooled with like a shitty
ace tech 120 or like a really nice
custom setup with a multiple radiator
configuration or something like that but
it was on liquid which does do a much
better job of efficiently moving the
heat away from the CPU which i think
would be important with something like
this
now we also briefly discussed on Kyle's
half of the showed der Bauer's resets
the lidding of Intel's 12 to 18 course
guide like X CPUs and you can see that
the die on them is fairly substantial I
believe this is the smaller core count
the medium core counts die on the top
and the larger core count died on the
bottom almost looks like someone
Photoshop just a black square yeah it's
it's substantial it's much larger so not
only is that larger though to house more
cores and it's obviously completely
different died in a different it's using
the same architecture but it's a
different actual design for an 18 core
16 core and 12 core secret CPU and 14
core but because it is a larger die that
might mean that the temperatures are
able to stay a little bit more within
reasonable levels this the tests that
they were showing here max at ninety
ninety degrees Celsius which is hot but
not good on liquid which is hot but not
for that one but not that hot when you
compare just skylake X to a lot of the
sky like X stuff that's been going up
yeah so yeah definitely very interesting
and of course we should hopefully see
more stuff in this coming out soon
intel has promised the sky the ax parts
again from 12 to 18 cores launching
anytime between the September and
November so there we go yeah all right
let's move on though to some AMD stuff
first off and visually enabling some
nvme raid on their ex 399 threader for
platform this is really good news to
anyone who's building on thread Ripper
and didn't know this existed because
it's always nice when you buy into a
platform and then you find hey new
functionality stuff that wasn't there
before that's gonna be added so this is
going to be made available via a driver
update which includes a lightweight f6
install style driver as well as a
motherboard BIOS update this will let
AMD X 399 chipset motherboards boot from
raid 0 raid 1 and raid 10 arrays made
from up to 10 and vme drives nice which
is significantly more than what until it
was currently offering you make that
smaller with V rocket well in so Intel
has talked about vrock but it's that
it's still not like a thing that you can
just go out and buy or that kind of
thing so V Rack is virtual raid on CPU
which is Intel solution for this now on
both Intel and third row platform you
could go in boot into the operating
system and set up an nvme raid array the
ish the difference here is making it
Dressel by the boot environments and
making a bootable nvme raid array as
well as how many devices you can
actually have set up on Intel's platform
with X to 99 through the chipset if you
have nvme device connections that are
wired through the chipset which isn't
all of them sometimes they're routed
directly to the CPU and then you can't
use them for raid you can have up to
three nvme devices in raid and it's raid
0 0 1 and 10 as it's pretty much the
same raid type situation that you might
have expected if you've been using intel
for the past five or 10 years they've
been doing this for a while now but it's
only up to three devices which for most
people is okay but if you're looking at
the really high end you might be
interested in nvme raid configurations
that use more devices so it's really
cool to see that AMD enabling this doing
it via just a software update and saying
like here here you go guys this is yours
now
in cell on the other hand with their VR
OSI technology
it requires an actual key which is a
physical device which has a proprietary
plug that plugs into the motherboard
that enables VR OC and that's nvme raid
configurations that are bootable that
support devices that are directly
connected to the CPU which sounds pretty
cool as far as what it can do
functionally speaking but there have
been rumors since X 299 was launching
back in June that it's gonna cost 500
bucks for that key which sucks but
that's not confirmed yet and there I
tried to look before we went live today
if there's anything updated from Intel
about this and maybe there is but there
was nothing that I could find at least
with a fairly brief Google search so
yeah if I'm wrong about that I apologize
but it doesn't seem like Intel has come
out and said here's exactly how V rock
is gonna work
here's how much that that dongle is
gonna cost and everything like that it
is it is slightly suspicious that
they're offering it as a separate entity
where it seems like if they wanted to
they could have built it like hardwired
into the motherboards as is but the fact
that they're making it a raid dongle
something that you have to get
separately I feel like the only reason
they would do that is to sell it yes but
because Intel hasn't been been very
clear or hasn't confirmed for sure about
costs and everything and I have to
assume AMD coming out with this
information is going to affect their
decisions in that area to some degree
you know maybe they won't charge that
much or maybe hopefully it will be 500
bucks maybe it's something slightly more
reasonable should be from should be free
all right yeah I don't everything's
gonna be free I don't know money should
not exist but yes beyond thread Ripper
and the X 399 platform however AMD does
not have plans to bring this nvme raid
technology support to X 370 or B 350
sorry for you guys there but it is it is
a higher-end function so it's probably
something that people on using standard
rays and setups are going to miss but
they are adding nvme read through for
what this is 4x 399 thread Ripper but
not for for the means not for mainstream
X 370 or B 350 right shy all right
speaking of thread Ripper and this is
just a very interesting story that I got
the chance to read through most of today
so if you guys want to check it out all
the stories I'm talking about are linked
in the video's description this is a
story from Forbes and it's about behind
Rison thread Ripper the story behind
this processor how it came to be some of
the development of it it's an interview
with multiple people from AMD and if you
guys want to hear a little bit more
direct kind of from the horse's mouth
about how threader became to be a thing
totally check out this article because
that thought was pretty cool
third repair is actually the brainchild
of AMD engineers were you but thank you
cow I misspelled brain child my notes
it's the brainchild of AMD engineers who
wanted to see epic I wanted to see if a
pic which was already in development for
the server platform it could be spun
into a consumer high-end desktop product
it wasn't originally part of Andy's
plans at all back in 2015
their plans included Rison for the
mainstream desktop side and epic for the
server side Zen was announced in 2014
thread Ripper didn't even get the green
light to go ahead with production until
CES 2016 Wow which is just about a year
and a half short of when it actually
launched which for a CPU this is
freaking crazy like absolutely crazy as
far as yeah they've been grindin they've
been telling the story talks about and
it mentions the names of several
engineers in the story I'm not gonna
list them all out here but they worked
in that spare time it was a passion
project for about a year before they
sawed the green light from management
some of the original team behind
threader per day MD from the press side
with a critical and appreciative eye for
PC hardware free from years of reviewing
a wide range of products before may 2017
no one knew it
distant which is probably why it took
Intel place such bye-bye surprise
awesome so before May 2017 when they
announced that no one knew about it and
by August it was actually in people's
hands so that's that's pretty cool too
also a little tidbit from the article
thread Ripper was the codename of this
project and they said decided to keep
that through and go ahead and use it as
a launch name and an actual retail
product name which is actually something
that I've suggested many times in the
past when I discussed
CPU code names because CPUs have code
names like like we refer them we like we
call skylake processors skylake intel
doesn't call them that there until 8th
generation core whatever the hell Genet
version they're on now all of these CPUs
have code names that their work the
pre-launch code names
we the enthusiast community learn those
and we start discussing it and it
becomes branded with that code name and
then I launched it as a intel core
whatever series blah blah and they try
to like ignore the code name like
thankfully new Aegon's a lot of websites
are like no people look for scaling we
should put sky like in there right but
yeah it's one of those things where yeah
and it's a good name to so fun code name
for a project but a needy I wonder if
the the the code name comes from the
engineer the marketing side engineering
for sure
I feel like marketing should run I mean
me OK I use like a marketing thing a
code name because that's very much so
alright I could I could totally be wrong
about this so anyone from AMD who knows
better please please correct me but my
assumption would be that the code names
come from the engineering side because
they're they're working on the the
earlier projects and the early
development stages before marketing even
has heard of or or knows it exists and
they need something to go ahead with as
far as talking about a project that or
project that and right right so that
would be my assumption it's not till
products get much closer to launch that
marketing actually starts digging in
says how can we sell this to people
right but I could totally be wrong there
so
oh yeah just I say I'm not absolutely
sure about that yeah all right let's
talk about 8k TV everyone who just
bought a 4k TV you're all is that haha
your own shirt obsolete I know you suck
now sharp is ready to sell 8k consumer
TVs especially to those of us who just
bought 4k because we're upset they
announced their inkay aqua
television series they're coming to
Japan and China by December of this year
so that's like within the next 3-4
months with releases in Taiwan and
Europe also planned for early 2018 not
planning to launch in the US and I guess
we are just high res plebs over here
but the res fur for 8k in case you're
wondering is 76 40 by 40 320 which is
effectively the same as for 4k 3840 by
2160 monitors just double the height and
double width they've had panels with a
Kay resolution since about 2015 we've
been seeing them at like events like CES
for quite some time but there's no
content to watch on them so how the hell
can they sell you a TV if there is no
actual EK content to watch on them mmm
also a detriment to actual buying one
actually buying one back in 2015 was
that they retailed for a hundred and
thirty thousand dollars but now they're
much more affordable although there is
no plans for a u.s. release date of this
and no official price was listed by
sharp the article says that they talked
to sources who said that models are
going to be available for as much as 1
million yen which is nine thousand US
dollars affordable which is expensive
but compared to but not a hundred
thousand dollars plus six years so there
you go yeah also sharp announced the
company initiative called the 8k
ecosystem which is dedicated to refining
the process and technology of shooting
editing storing and broadcasting content
in for an 8k as finalists at 4k just by
default in a case so we need to hit up
sharp and be like a sharp we need to
start making 8k YouTube videos give us
some
a camera's stuff like that that's that's
why I'm getting out of this I opened a
bottle with a failed acrylic PT GPT
nails Pete oh it's not so I shouldn't
use it well I mean I don't know I don't
know if I'm gonna try him what about
this one all of those are the actual
tubes Oh from arctic pan I'm sorry the
spoons right there oh wait what have
been cool I could have opened it with a
piece of tubing that was just somethin
fancy I mean I have no doubt that you
would have been able to do it
but next time on Dragon Ball Z okay
Karen all right
Japan's telecommunications ministry is
pushing for production and broadcasting
of 8k technology by next year this is to
ensure that they'll be ready for the
2020 Tokyo Olympics broadcasting an 8k
beautiful online but if the distribution
of these TVs is to any indication like
how are we gonna watch 8k Tokyo's 2020
Olympics in the u.s. yeah I want this
we are the bottleneck we need we need
more a.k TVs Excel deployed this is only
we only got three years to pull it okay
I'll figure it out okay
uh yeah and I already talked about the
US release date and everything so let's
move on to the next segment
I'd love to game it is it what can
actually run it what what game could run
it any k counter-strike can run an 8k
it's solitaire
yeah can you turn up to the resolution
just nothing good okay with eight times
MSAA minecraft
there's a game that needs msaa anyway
Terry exactly all right here's a new
segment it's called cryptocurrency
there's no currents I was this really in
that it's a bad segment no I like it
but how's it gonna bring good
cryptocurrency like current that I
remember when I made the lower thirds I
said cryptocurrency
see that's even better I like it even
more now look at the lamp thing was
really last minute it means something
significance of it so we're going to
talk a little bit about cryptocurrency
your Bitcoin your etherium and whatnot
your old coins
first off china has some some pretty
massive news that they dropped yesterday
at least when it comes to cryptocurrency
they buy they have band i ciose our
initial coin offerings which is
something that happens quite regularly
in china
what's an ignition point a free initial
clean a franc is when a new
cryptocurrency because you know
bitcoin is one cryptocurrency with the
set of tokens algorithm that does all
the work and and and keeps Ledger's and
everything you can make another one
what's the different whatever and
there's tons of them all over the place
and some of them gain more legitimacy
than others
right some of them get listed on certain
coin listings some coin listings are
more prevalent and well-known than
others some types of cryptocurrency
become more prevalent and well-known and
more accepted than others to the point
where something like a like Bitcoin
which is the most well known
cryptocurrency can be traded and what
much more easily for cash or used to
purchase goods or anything like that and
there's sort of this levels of of
acceptance that that cryptocurrency gets
I guess so
Bitcoin obviously the biggest one
there's tons of other ones as well that
have been around for more time or less
time but when a new type of
cryptocurrency is launching it will not
have what is called it an IC over and an
initial coin offering I see where the
initial tokens are distributed to people
who invest in that coin there
that type of cryptocurrency and then
they can start using those tokens to
mine that cryptocurrency
gold there you go that's that's a
general assessment of it I know there's
lots of details and everything that I'm
crossing over sorry about that but on
Monday seven china-based regulators took
sweeping action against domestic initial
coin offering specifically in China it
hit all aspects of the market it called
on many exchanges to cease trainings
training of their ICO tokens and
demanded that platforms issue refunds so
now lots people serious so previously
projects on Chinese sites like ICO age
and ICO info routinely raised between
3,000 and 5,000 bitcoins via token sales
and since a Bitcoin is now worth well
over $4,000 that's a pretty substantial
amount of money this resulted in a
pretty substantial dip in Bitcoin prices
as well as lots of other coins over the
weekend although this is today where it
seems to have recovered quite a bit
whenever I'm deciding to talk about
cryptocurrency I'm always like what am I
going to talk about when I'm talking
when I'm looking up stuff earlier in the
day and what's it actually gonna look
like when we talk about it right now
yeah but here's what I'm really wanted
to talk about which was that bitcoins
price hit an all-time high
late Friday early Saturday depending on
that your your time zone and that kind
of thing
this chart doesn't show it but it
actually did peak over five thousand
dollars per coin what kind of right here
so here's what no one's told me it is
what kind of mining rig do I have to
have to mine one Bitcoin a month Oh
something insane like a single Bitcoin
is a lot your ma your mining very very
small portion margin percentage yeah
small chunks of a coin okay is what you
get right now cuz a single coin is now
divided up to many many many times
because it's just computers and math and
wondering what that rig would look like
to get one Bitcoin amount it would be
yeah it wouldn't be a rig it would be a
big big warehouse full of many many
and that kind of thing all right so
bitcoin Pete it dipped off after that
because that's a lot of times what
happens with stuff like stocking coins
and whatever and then here is what
happened Monday Monday is when the
actual China news came out and there it
tanked off quite a bit and actually got
down to almost four thousand dollars
although today this is mainly what it's
done today it's been recovering all day
today and it's actually kind of backed
almost about $4,500 so bitcoins price
was definitely affected by this news
from China and actually the other coins
altcoins
non Bitcoin coins like your aetherium
and whatnot were also hid and
significantly more in some cases
etherium for example was up 2.9 percent
earlier today but still down more than
20% because on Friday it peaked at 390
dollars and now it is much less than
that and that would bring that up right
now but I'm not I'm not fast enough
we'll figure it out later
anyway however due to this increased
popularity of crypto clay mining and the
widening knowledge of what crypto Quinn
mining is and therefore also lending to
its legitimacy we're seeing increased
prices but also we're seeing stuff like
celebrity endorsements this is an
article from MarketWatch for example
that talks about some of the ups and
downs of cryptocurrency Bitcoin and
ether over the weekends also pointing
out that we're getting random like
celebrity endorsement endorsements for
icos like Paris Hilton Mont was tweeting
from I SEOs about a Lydian coin Ltd
token for a new ICO Floyd Mayweather is
also behind another one it's just it's
it's getting a little bit crazy as
plasma it's also drawing more attention
from governments and regularly
regulators however though so in the
United States the SEC or Securities and
Exchange Commission in case you're not
sure what that means
recently warns that it may treat such
clean offerings as securities which
open up cryptocurrency industries to
stricter oversight at least by the US
SEC also mentioned in this article is
that a Nobel Prize winner Robert Shiller
also said bitcoin is the best example of
a massive bubble right now so check that
article out if you want to read a little
bit more it's so weird on those specific
things maybe we could start doing pre
rolls for like aetherium whoever
controls that it's nuts but see that's
the thing is it's decentralize I know
who do you see if you want so if you
want to talk to people about like the
benefits of Bitcoin if you want if
anyone is like what is Bitcoin why is it
a thing cryptocurrency why is it worth
money why are people placing value on
this thing and if you want to speak
about cryptocurrency in the best
positive light you would say that well
it's a decentralized currency and by
decentralized that means there is no
World Bank and no governments that is
controlling it it's completely
controlled logistic by how many people
are mining it how much mining can be
done and how quickly and beyond that
it's just sort of a built-in scarcity
difficulty to create more of and also
the built-in Ledger's that a lot of
things like Bitcoin have as far as
tracking exchanges that I haven't really
what's probably a very stupid question
but one that I have never really found
an answer to I mean now that I've looked
very hard but let's say you mine an
entire Bitcoin can you somehow cash that
Bitcoin in for real usable cash yes you
can
mm-hmm there are just websites that
allow you to do that yes okay just
making sure
you can catch up you can catch that
anytime you want okay a lot of the news
recently as well specifically with
Bitcoin as well as with some other
crypto currencies is it's becoming more
easy to track today because a lot of
cryptocurrency is used for black market
transactions or stuff that doesn't want
to be tracked or whatever but there's
become better ways to track people and
extend transactions through through the
blockchain now so if you want to get
cryptocurrency
and cash it out and you don't want to be
tracked you should trade it for a
different type of cryptocurrency before
you cash it up and that's the best thing
that's the best way to get around that
kind of thing anyway another quick
article here just about some follow up
and some fallout from the China ICO
banned cryptocurrency industry leaders
weigh in discussing everything from how
China just loves to ban stuff in general
to people who are hating on the ICO
market to people who are positive about
the ICO market to people who think that
overall this has no impact on Bitcoin
and very little on aetherium and it's
probably not going to have much effect
at all I do not at all proclaim to be
extremely knowledgeable in this area
so I mainly want to present information
to you guys rather than saying that one
person is right or the other person
isn't right but hey if you want to do if
all some people on Twitter check this
article up and they're all pretty into
the cryptocurrency mining thing there's
also some bad news on the horizon
potentially for China in particular when
it comes to ICS and crypto currency
markets this is probably just the
beginning Yi Chi the Chinese financial
news agency has said the Chinese
government intends to further regulate
crypto economy crypto economy this is
just the tip of the iceberg other
countries are also looking into further
regulation or restrictions on crypto
currencies where I talked about the US
and SEC South Korea is all South Korea
is also has recently stated its
intention to regulate the cryptocurrency
industry and they may move to ban icos
as well the most dangerous place to mine
bitcoins right now though is Venezuela
and that is for various reasons Firmin
punishment death well for one thing
Venezuela is don't don't make noise for
one thing vain as well is is in a
massive crisis right now I mean apart
from cryptocurrency or anything like
that they are having a
political and the greatest of
massive-scale
that I can't even begin to encompass
here this show is not meant for that
type of thing so but yeah because of
this crisis the currency in Venezuela
the Bolivar has lost ninety nine point
four percent of its value since 2012 so
because the currency that Venezuela uses
has lost so much of its value
cryptocurrency has become a much more
viable potential way to earn money and
sort of keep yourself afloat if your
event as well in citizen a women
interviewed and interviewed an article
works three jobs and still mining
Bitcoin represents 80 percent of our
income about a hundred and twenty
dollars per month wow that's a lot for
some countries yeah huge amount also
it's interesting to point out that
mining cryptocurrency is not illegal in
Venezuela I originally was looking at
this and be like oh well obviously they
must have banned it or something like
that it's not illegal however the police
have been arresting miners and charging
them with energy theft and possession of
contraband Wow the Venezuelan government
views cryptocurrencies as a threat to
the earth already weak Bulevar and it's
strict rules about capital flights so
for those reasons even though it's legal
to mine in in Venezuela people have
still been getting arrested and
especially larger operations they have
been going after the dogs are breaking
that's so yeah easy there's a lot more
in the article again guys if you want
interested it's gonna check it out it's
interesting how different governments
are reacting differently to this craze
it's really interesting to me wow
they're using it as a energy crisis
thing it's an energy hero so yell at the
dogs will you do that I've just been
yelling into the micro right so I can't
there's nothing I can do about the dog
just mute sorry guys well interesting
yeah I guess
check out those articles if you want to
read a little bit more let's move on to
the final segment from my hat which is
tales from space what is there music
playing I hear it mute mute tab all
right cool what we got next up is tales
from space we're gonna talk about spaced
outer space and SpaceX alright so first
off SpaceX has tested the world's most
powerful rocket yeah has completed first
stage testing this is the Falcon Heavy
so the Falcon 9 is what they use for
most of the launches that you guys heard
about from now since back in 2012 when
they first started using it the Falcon
Heavy is a it's basically three
nines two gets kind of strapped together
if you want to simplify it
three first stage cores have completed
their testing according to the SpaceX
the first stage core is a section of
rocket that launches and propels it into
space and there's some video of it but
here's a better actual image from the
SpaceX website of the rocket so the
payloads at the top the second stage is
in the middle this is what actually
powers or provides thrust after it
breaks out of the Earth's atmosphere the
first stage is at the bottom so all
three of these is basically three Falcon
nine it's not exactly a three Falcon
nines but it's basically the same
because your Falcon 9 has nine of the
Merlin engines at the bottom mm-hmm this
is three of them next to each other
providing 27 Merlin engines total
with which gives up to 37,000 pounds of
cargo or it can transport up to 37
pounds of cargo to Mars 37 pounds 37,000
pounds of cargo saying I can my cargo
and fire and do that okay
yes your car should at least be able to
buy more thrust than your car
I would hope it's like a Hyundai yeah
yeah god help astronauts okay so it's
sort of a Frankenstein of three Falcon
Knights yes I like it's probably a lot
more a lot more elaborate than the ours
yeah I'm sure there's a layman's
knowledge I'm sure there's other very
specific things they've done to take the
nine rocket night and the nine
merlin rocket nine and put three
of them together and everything like
that but you can effectively look at it
that way as far as when you compare what
they've been using to launch satellites
into near Earth orbit so what they're
going to be using with this to launch
much heavier payloads into I am blanking
on the term right now but it's because
I've been drinking the extra further
from Earth and to Mars even even
potentially as far as alright so oh the
other cool thing about this is that all
of those since they are effectively like
a falcon 9 they all have landing gear so
all of these can break off and it is an
independent land land back that's why
they're on terra firma or on a barge and
in the ocean and then be reused
continuing SpaceX's tradition of reusing
stuff to launch more satellites to save
money and make getting stuff into space
much more cost-effective the Falcon
Heavy generates more than five million
pounds of thrust at liftoff liftoff
which is approximately what eight
eighteen 747 aircrafts produce capable
of cover of carrying why don't 119
thousand pounds in orbit twice the
payload of the next largest rocket the
delta 4 heavy and SpaceX claims it will
cost six
6% less to deliver and the first launch
of the Falcon Heavy is supposed to be in
November which is in like two months
Wow I don't know where they're going
yeah I don't know what they're gonna
launch do we get their disposition so
it's significantly more like weights
capability than then a nine has
so I don't know what they're gonna
launch at that but hey I will definitely
hang out for that because I don't want
to say that SpaceX is regular lunches
have gotten boring but they're getting
better at them and they're becoming more
of a regular thing and even stuff like
we're using the nine rockets has
become a little bit more commonplace so
for instance in October they're going to
be launching the Ecostar 105 and SES 11
it's sort of a joint the collaborative
satellites they're using another
partially reused Falcon 9 rocket this is
going to be in October luxembourg-based
SES and echo star of Englewood Colorado
ordered the satellite from Airbus
defence in space in August 2014 as a
replacement to their AMC 15 satellite
which is now 13 years old this was
actually supposed to launch in 2016 but
it was set back due to the September
2016 9 explosion if you guys
remember that which was caused due to
the temperature that helium fuel is when
you load it into the settle into the
rocket this satellite will cover the
Americas including Alaska Hawaii Mexico
and the Caribbean all right Voyager
Voyager 1 Voyager 1 I like that this is
what roll on 40 years the Voyager 1 has
been in space for 40 freakin years now
and this is not a good I can't repeat I
can't show this full screen and why is
it so small why can't it make like 140 P
right there and I wanted to show people
this video because it was kind of
interesting but it's really not there's
some footage on the space comm article
if you guys want to check it out of
early Voyager one stuff NASA's Voyager 1
probe lifted off on September 5th 1977 a
few weeks after Voyager 2 the two
Voyager spacecraft perform an epic grand
tour of the solar system flying two
giant planets Jupiter Saturn Uranus and
Neptune but then they kept going after
that on August 25th 2012 Voyager 1 got
out into interstellar space becoming
grueling yes of the act of the initial
launch
yeah I mean it's playing out of the
speakers yeah but yeah so Voyager 1
Voyager 1 is the first-ever human-made
object ever to get into any result
interstellar space Voyager 2 in case
you're wondering took a different route
through the solar system and it will
also exit the Suns sphere of influence
in the next few years that just didn't
get there as quickly as Voyager 1 the
both of the spacecraft are working after
40 years in space which is pretty
freaking cool considering they're built
in the 70s and yeah
as a Friday September 1st Voyager 1 was
twelve point nine seven billion miles
from Earth more than one hundred and
thirty nine times the distance from our
planet to the Sun Wow that's specks like
that or part of the reason why I I'm
fascinated with space stuff oh yeah but
it feels so small speaking of space tiny
and let's talk about the weather to end
my show weather hurricane Irma a lot of
you guys are probably following a lot of
the hurricane Harvey stuff over the past
week or two since hurricane Harvey hit
Texas and was pretty crazy as far as the
amount of water and dumped and
everything hurricane Irma is now on its
way and there's some video in this
article of it being tracked from the
space station
I believe that's from the space station
every was a category 5 storm as of
Tuesday with maximum sustained winds of
185 miles per hour it's more than 400
miles wide and it is currently bearing
down on Puerto Rico it should hit there
on Wednesday
Dominican Republic in Haiti on Thursday
morning Jamaica on Friday morning and
Florida and Cuba most likely will see at
least parts of Armagh by the weekend
it's too far effort to accurately
predict accurately predict where it's
going to go but Florida is already under
a state of emergency so if you're in
Florida I hope this doesn't hit you if
you're in the Caribbean islands I hope
you secure yourself and your family and
your property as much as you possibly
can our prayers will be with you this is
like we said a category five storm and
one of the largest ones that has been
seen since the 2004 to 2005 season
that's a ton of the large
record-breaking storms that a few of
which hit the US right now this is Irma
and we talked a little bit last week I
was mentioning Kyle how all of the
storms have predetermined names
yes lists of names that they're going to
use and it goes alphabetically so herbie
was followed up by Emma which is going
on right now
there's also Jose which is also
developing in the mid-atlantic which
might follow right on Emma's heels
there's also a not yet named tropical
depression in the southwest of Gulf of
Mexico which might if it further
develops be named katia which would be
the Kay following Jose and if that does
continue to develop it could potentially
even hit the same area that Harvey did
of course it's still a bit too early to
to tell for that but it's a it's
apparently going to be a rough hurricane
season because there's already been
quite a few named storms and wonder how
they come up with the names I don't know
I don't know how they actually come up
with the names is it maybe someone that
they work with maybe someone on their
team
it's an international thing so I'm not
not really
not really sure yeah yeah they talked
about expanding the categorization of
tropical storms and hurricanes back in
2005 2006 2004 2005 they didn't but
maybe if these keep happening and we
keep seeing sustained winds of the close
to 200 miles per hour or even above
maybe they'll decide we need a category
6 at some point what happens when they
get dizzy
what's his evening Zelda
Zed Zed Zed is dead Zelda zebra man
there's lots of Z names that sure really
are they're a little out of Z names Xena
that's X there's Zed Zoe Zeke Zeke Zach
Zach Zach you got Zach dial how about
the other ones Isle no ball no nose all
right
Zelda is the only one Zelda and Zach
they only got two Z's and then they're
out and they got a skip Z all together
cuz there's no other Z's
well they reused names too oh do they
yeah I don't I don't I think they can
reuse names but how does that help
someone traveling back in time when they
arrive and they go oh it's there's no
Cal it's hurricane Zeke on the rise
might be how do they know what year that
is if they've repeated Zeke multiple
times it might be an imperfect system
Zach we schewe the question is a cliche
yeah it's a cliche that's that's the
best one
okay where did you find it's under
community Zeus
I'm gonna name my kids messages very

because Kyle owes me one Leo el primo
hey guys first time watching I have
since I started watching in March a $20
donation
boys Billy my first game PC should does
there be an order of buying parts if I
don't get it all at once
$1500 PC $500 increments great content
whoo I try to get the functional parts
of the seat the PC up and running as as
quickly as possible so you can test them
that's the main problem of buying
piecemeal is testing stuff like the
motherboard and CPU and whatever because
you want to make sure that they're not
defective there's a very small chance
that they will be but if they are you
want to catch it early especially before
like your 30-day replacements periods
runs out so I would say try to get like
CPU motherboard memory yeah and power
supply I guess first so you can kind of
put those together and make sure it's
functional this stuff like maybe case
and graphics card you might be able to
delay a little bit that would be my
suggestion though Thank You leo so
processing $5 donation why you're
donating so not itself oh and thanks
spider fan for ruining the first running
the first half you're awesome don't

awesome and would love to do this
I love getting yelled at while building
yeah that was my favorite pastime that's
a great idea for a video right there out
of an automatic Matt with another ten
bucks please welcome Claire to the club
but when she's returning a PC to PC
building for the first time in seven
years I'm not on death row I'm joining
the Army on the 18th he's joining the
army so yeah I was right he's shipping
up yeah
shipping at well welcome Claire to the
PC master-race and welcome Claire you
were now one of us that is our ever and
