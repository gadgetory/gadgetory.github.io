doing a quick unboxing of the Asus Eee 7
pro this board Falls kind of right in
the middle maybe a little bit towards
the high range from Asus mainstream or
channel boards it's for of course the
z87 chipset and the new Haswell or Intel
4th generation Core processor today it's
just gonna be a quick unboxing as well
as some specs so let's just jump right
in and we're taking a look at the retail
box this is the z87 - pro which means
it's based on the z87 chipset sports
2-way SLI 3-way crossfire X it also has
for weight optimization that's dual
intelligent processors - TPU in the EPU
is gonna be something I might look into
in a future video tape you an EP you
listed right there of course for
overclocking as well as energy savings
you also have the ultimate cool and
quiet technology as well as Asus Wi-Fi
go which is pretty cool
flipping around to the back here's a
closer layout of the board itself if you
guys want to take a closer look these
are all pointed out I'm gonna try to
also point out as much many of these as
I can while we're taking a look inside
the box
detailed specs listed as well as some of
the additional technologies that asus
has built in more info on the dual
intelligent processors right there it's
one click for weigh optimization
actually works pretty effectively now
see it Y if I go it's got onboard 802
that 11 a B G and n you can use that
along with the Asus software to set up
some pretty cool Wi-Fi and streaming
technologies like making your computer
into a router also USB BIOS flash back
still there one of my favorite feature
is you also get USB 3 boost which can
really improve your USB 3 speeds as far
as accessories we have an input up with
shield of course it's white it's got
some labels on all those we have serial
ata cables these are pretty standard
ones that they've been including for a
while they're all SATA rev3 I've got a
couple with L brackets and a couple with
straight plugs I also get an SLI bridge
for two-way SLI configuration is one of
the flexible ones look a Q connector and
it's gold I really like the colored q
connectors because they tend to stand
out a bit but I really like their
convenience you also get one there for
USB this is actually a
your Wi-Fi antenna it's kind of cool
it's got two leads on there it's got two
antennae built in you can kind of twist
it around to prop it up on your desk and
give yourself a better signal pretty
cool design in there and then also all
those instructions there on the back to
chemistry that is set it up here is a
manual for the dual intelligent
processors and your Wi-Fi go and here is
the main users guide which also includes
your driver disk which is going to be
outdated and your ace who's powered by
Asus badge go to the website to download
latest drivers and there's your big
users guide which is very detailed and
I'm not gonna go to depth on that let's
move on to the board here's a closer
look at it you'll notice it is golde
golde is a new color for the HP's
mainstream series of motherboards if you
don't like it well I don't know I don't
know what to tell you if you are looking
for something similar in this line and
you really don't like the gold try the
Maximus 6 hero because that's not gold
the PCB is black even some nice
attention to detail here like the
brushed metal finish on the metal back
plates for the heat sinks I like
attention to detail
apart from that gold heat sinks of
course sort of yellow gold slots for all
the dims and everything else and pretty
much black and gold throughout so uh
yeah I kind of like the gold I think
they did a good job with it but you know
your your your opinions may vary we all
have our own opinions when it comes to
color schemes but look let's take a look
at the bottom of the board because
there's a bunch of connectivity down
there in the lower right there's a front
panel connectors next to that you get
chassis fan above there the EP you and
TPU switches so those are going to
enable different modes for
epu and TPU stage one and two this is
something I might jump into and do some
more in-depth coverage on if you guys do
want to see that let me know in the
comments I also got clear CMOS jumper
right there and above the the front
panel connectors there's a direct direct
key header and JJ's tip for that was to
connect it over to your reset switch you
can use that your reset button on your
computer to go directly into UEFI pretty
quick but anyway moving along from there
you have a chassis fan header all that
teenagers on this board a 4 pin 4 USB
2.0 to get all that kik connectivity up
and going USB bios flashback key as well
as LED q-code LED and also a surface
mount of power switch right there
Thunderbolt header front panel connector
and spdif out and then finally trusted
platform module header on the Left PCI
Express you got plenty of connectivity
you got 4 x1 slots little short ones
there also got three x16 slots you get
16 PCI Express 3.0 lanes from Haswell so
we're gonna run it x16 on the top slot
x8 and x8 if you're going with slot 2
and slot 5 and then x8 x8 x4 if you're
going to 5 and 7 the chipset of course
is e7 there's your heatsink on that's
controlling your SATA so around on the
side we have state a rev 3 6 gigabits
per second also exports for that from
the chipset it's beautiful they also get
raid 0 1 5 and 10 support from there to
the right a couple more SATA rev 3 and
those are controlled by an add-on as
media chip let's move up the side you
got your power connector of course on
the top right you have a dram LED and a
memo k button mo k is gonna help you
with the memory troubleshooting memory
slots right next to that DDR 3 dual
channel and supports up to 32 gigs and
overclock speeds up to 2800 and even
beyond above the memory there's a pretty
cool little feature for your CPU fan
header I wanted to point out really
quick it's the fact that it's it's got
an extra little tab in there and what
that tabs gonna do is if you plug in a 3
pin had a connector it'll treat it as a
three-pin plug in a 4 pin pwm the tab
will recognize that will automatically
set your fans to PWM mode which is a
really cool little feature nice little
little thing that ace uses come up with
moving out of CPU socket 1150 for your
Haswell processor you'll notice some
attractive heat I'm sorry power delivery
elements there under the gold heat sinks
your jokes and your caps
MOSFETs are under the heat sinks really
high quality components asus is used
throughout this board and there's just a
close-up look along with the heat sinks
finally for IO on the back you have a
ps2 ports
combo for mouse or keyboard you also
have six more USB 3.0 ports all of the
blue ones that you see there Wi-Fi
antenna hookups right next to that video
outs for your eye GPU hdmi displayport
DVI and VGA also an optical Toslink out
your intel NIC and then of course all
your analog audio connections on the
right for your Realtek ALC 11:58 channel
high def audio and that is gonna do it
for this video everyone if you would be
so kind I would love to hear your
feedback on what types of additional
videos would like to see covering these
boards I have these e87 Pro here I also
have the z87 sabertooth from the Tough
Series I'm going to be doing some
follow-ups with those so if you'd like
to post a comment in the comment section
down below let me know what types of use
case scenarios would like to see or
whether you'd like a deep dive on the
the UEFI or the utilities that are
included anything like that so leave
your comments that's all for this video
though I'm gonna go ahead and start
packing and I guess we'll see you in
Taiwan yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
