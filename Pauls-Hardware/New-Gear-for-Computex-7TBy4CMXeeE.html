welcome to my first video for Computex
2016 this is kind of my Computex prep
video but I want to start out by saying
a huge thank you to my sponsors for this
event fractal design MSI and g.skill
without them I would not be able to do
any of this coverage so thank you so
show them some support by clicking their
sponsor links in the description down
below anyway this video is kind of a
preparation video for Computex and I
didn't want to make it like what's in my
bag video although a lot of this stuff
is going in my bag this is more of a
overview of some of the technology I'm
bring along with me and I wanted to talk
about creating video contents at an
event like Computex because it can be a
bit of a challenge and I've taken some
steps this year to improve my production
methodology as well as hopefully the
audio and video quality and if you're
looking at this video right now I think
you pull what the hell this looks and
sounds pretty mediocre well that's
because I'm using my cell phone right
now to record this this is my Nexus 6
and I'm going to kind of show you guys a
progression I'm going to start with this
in a second I'll show you some of the
cameras I'm going to be using and I'll
switch to those as we move along
hopefully you'll be able to see a
progression as we move from one to the
next to get a better idea of how
hopefully the content that bring you
this year is going to look and sound a
lot better so here's everything laid out
on the table and over in this area we
have audio and video capture equipments
right up here we have this MSI
workstation laptop that I'm going to be
using to edit videos watch some editors
mainly gonna be using edit videos then I
have some other random knickknacks and
stuffs that I picked up at Target and
whatnot so I'll cover that at the end
anyway I want to get off of my cell
phone camera so let's start off by
talking about this camera which you've
probably seen me use before this is the
panasonic lumix lx7 undred so I've been
using this camera for a couple years it
has a couple quirks the main thing is
that it does not have an audio input
jacks so when I'm recording with this I
got to rely on the built-in audio and it
kind of sucks sometimes because it picks
up some of the the noise inside from
focusing and zooming in that kind of
thing you guys hear that image quality
on this is really great and it gets very
nice close-up photos and I have this
aftermarket kind of cool lens cap on
there that pops open when I turn it on
if I can figure out how to turn
Hey look at that it's fancy the other
thing is there's a fleck of dust on the
sensor which is bugs the crap out of me
but there's not a whole lot that I can
do about it right now maybe I'll find
like some fancy camera guru in Taiwan to
take this apart and fix it but anyway
let's switch to this camera yeah this is
so much better okay so camera one is my
cell phone camera two is the LX 100 that
I'm using now camera three is gonna be
this little guy which is a actual
monoprice kind of a GoPro naka shoots
1080 video doesn't get very good audio
cuz it's in this housing but we got that
attached to kind of a selfie stick thing
and I'll use that for quick shots
externally or you know if I need to hang
it out in an airplane window or
something this is my little flexible
tripod that I've been using for the LX
100 this is what I used last year at
Computex and I had the Alex 100 set up
on top here and this little offset same
thing to the side if you watched the
video last year I had my zoom h1 mic
kind of hanging down off of there
actually with this little ball joint
right there and I was able to kind of
walk around with the camera and pointed
at stuff in her court things and I was
able to point the mic back at my face
and record that separate audio so it
didn't sound mediocre like the audio
that you're getting right now anyway
I've reconfigured this for this year
it's still going to be put in use a
little bit I will still use this with
the lx100 and really because it's
flexible and you can wrap it around
things or if I just need to set it up on
a table or something that would be good
so those are my three cameras fourth
camera is this one right here alright so
here's the gh4
this is my main camera actually do have
two of these cameras but I'm only
bringing one of them and this one has
been upgraded and outfitted with some
new technology but the lens I'm using on
there is one of the Panasonic lenses it
is eats well 235 yes HD camera it's a
really nice lens and it gets really good
image quality it does have a floating
focus ring which is the only thing I
really don't like about it but the nice
part is that it's really compact and
fairly small so for travel that works
great eh for is also great for travel
because for a DSLR it is also very small
when it comes to the size of the body
and one of the things I really like
especially for taking this on the go is
the change for battery life is
absolutely amazing so you know I'm
really I like for instance when I
brought this to Austin and I did
coverage there I literally did not have
I used one battery the whole time I
never changed it or anything
and a flip-out screen and all that good
stuff external audio connections and
then as you might be able to see I have
this cage you
on the outside it's kind of a mid-level
cage by ephoto Inc DSLR camera camera
rig anyway um Kyle got one of these
cages too and his was pretty expensive I
think it was over 200 bucks and I was
considering that some of the ones that
are solid body this one is in pieces but
it comes all built and connected
together and I like it so far it was
about 85 bucks and it gives you a bunch
of extra mounting points all around so
you can attach stuff like this little
guy in here which is a little external
cold shoe which I'm going to be using to
match my audio solution also you get a
handle up on top and that really helps
for well being able to just pick up the
camera and move it around like this also
really helps where when it's on the
monopod so the monopod I'm using is this
one well that's the monopod it's from
Manfrotto yeah this so that's that's the
monopod with the rig on top this this
fluid head is actually velbon valve flow
9 pH 3 6 8 this one there's only about
40 to 45 dollars
Logan first tipped me off to this little
fluid head and you know it's not super
nice like some of the really expensive
Manfrotto ones but it really gets the
job done and even as a fluid head it's
not that bad you can do pretty decent
pans and tilts and all that stuff so
that fits up on top and with this
Manfrotto monopod which has the little
legs down on the bottom I also use this
in Austin and I really like it I
apologize I don't recall the model of
this monopod right off the bat but I
will link it down in the description if
you guys want to check that out so
that's kind of my mobile rig and you
know it can stand up or you can maneuver
it with a little handle or that kind of
thing and move it around a zoom in or
zoom out or whatever you want to do so
actually Kyle is probably gonna be using
this a lot because we're gonna be
filming each other but uh I don't know
hope hopefully he likes this
configuration that said let's switch to
that camera and see how that one looks
ok we switch to the gh4 I'm using the
built-in mic on the gh4 and let's go
over some of this other stuff on here
now if you're recording stuff or if
you're editing stuff you're gonna need
some audio playback these are my fostex
headphones that I got from Mayflower
electronics actually I might not be
bringing these but I'm gonna bring a
nice set of cans these have a nice like
you can you can replace the audio cable
on it so using this little short one
made it pretty nice from
while I was testing the monopod rig also
have a nice little pair of earbuds here
these are from think sound think these
are the rain there's rain and thunder
but these are actually pretty nice
little earbuds and then I have some
additional audio cables this little
flexible one is for connecting the zoom
h6 up to the gh4 when it's plugged in
also I just have a little eighth inch
audio extension so minor things over
here to show real quick another limiting
tripod that's to set the zoom h6 up on
if we need to set it up on a desktop I
have a tiny little screwdriver multi
screwdriver kit this is actually made
for snowboarding but I'm taking it with
me because TSA doesn't get mad at it
because it doesn't look like it could be
used as a stabbing weapon or anything
but that's handy for attaching a ton
attaching cameras to tripods and
anything else where you might need to
connect something or use a screwdriver
some minor little things here this is
actually I'm gonna attach this to my
belt I made a hole in my belts I'm gonna
screw that in for the opposite side and
then that just gives me a little cold
shoe on my belts and that will be so if
I need to wear the zoom h6 on me on my
belts instead of the camera hopefully I
can just pop that in there I really
don't know how that's going to work
memory cards of course these are from
Kingston as well as a what is that
SanDisk these Kingston will 64 gig micro
SDXC cards do really good job I've been
using those for the past year so and
then the zoom h6 I've kind of shown you
but I haven't really shown you but I got
a zoom h6 I'm actually really really
happy with this so far it's a little bit
on the expensive side but I'm happy to
have gotten it so it's got four separate
XLR inputs it's got two built-in
microphones that come along with it that
you can pop off and remove from the top
so this is the XY version here that gets
kind of stereo sound points in two
directions and this is kind of
multi-purpose I think and it's got
little carrying case so you can put
everything in there here's one of the
other mic attachments that comes with it
so you can really swap this swap them
out and depending on what your situation
in your sound situation is I'm not sure
how good these are going to work for a
noisy show floor environment so I do
have some other solutions as well but I
can pop those on to the end and they
even are removable this is Sophie
sure sure that's not a delicate
connection at all you can pop those off
and I can I can even use it without
anything connected to the front there so
if I just need to use it as a sound
bridge or sound board I can go XLR Zin
to that and I'm going to go out of the
headphone jack so I can control the
volume into the gh4 or if the gh4 needs
to be further away or something and I
can't plug into it directly because I
don't want to do any wireless for this
trip Wireless on the show floor is is
dangerous so if I need to plug into it
directly and I can't plug into the gh4
then I will just attach this to my hip
and off to the races just record sound
separately on the SD card also put that
little adapter on it and that is so it
can go on top of the gh4 which I can't
show you because I'm using the gh4 right
now able to show you in just a minute
though I've switched back to recording
with the lx100 so I can show you guys
this setup at least a little bit more
configured the way it's supposed to be
so there you have it you know it is a
little top-heavy it's slightly
cumbersome but I don't think it's too
bad overall so again the zoom h6 is up
on top and right now I have gone out the
side of it just my little XLR adapter
for my lav mic so this would be a
configuration for example where I could
be holding the camera from back here
recording stuff or whatever blah blah
and then I can just have that XLR mic
wired down and attached to me and then I
can narrate while I'm filming which is
actually a pretty convenient for the XLR
cuz it stays in the right position and
doesn't move around too much or anything
the zoom h1 let's turn it on I'm sorry
zoom h6 I need to remember I upgraded
now turned on just like that starts up
pretty quick gives you levels right
there on the thing and then all you got
to do is kind of hit the button for the
right channel I think I have that
plugged into channel 3 yes and now we
have a little indicator that says yes
the little the little lightning bolt
means you have phantom power and now
this is picking up audio from from a
little lab mic there anyway so that's
pretty much how it looks it's nice to be
able to see the the visuals right there
and then the other thing is once you
turn on standby it automatically starts
piping that sound through to your
outputs if that's what you're doing so
theoretically down here on my monitor
I should well at least this hasn't gone
into partial sleep mode
I should be able to see yeah there's
there's levels right there Mike the Mike
going up and down that's that's for me
talking it can hear me it's listening
now the zoom h6 does come with its own
little mic windscreen but I picked up
this one too because I think it's kind
of funny-looking and I like the I like
the dead cat one so I put that one on
top of there it'll look cool and then as
I mentioned I'm probably not even going
to be using the built-in mics
unless roommate sticks all that much
because I'll be using other solutions so
I have a lav mic here such as connects
it needs this little connector although
this is kind of large and bulky sticking
off of the side of the zoom h6 it needs
this in order to provide XLR phantom
power to this little mic I also have
this handheld mic Samson q8 so in
particular on the loud show floor when
there's lots of music going on that kind
of thing being able to hold this and
just hold it right next to your mouth
does wonders it's nice because I can
hold it right by my face and I kind of
feel like I'm on The Price is Right next
contestant on The Price is Right
this is stupid yeah I have a short XLR
cable to go with that one and then again
this actually just this little mic
windscreen came from from Amazon just
earlier today but I have have this dead
cat as well dead kitten this one is for
my zoom h1 but I think I might put it on
top a day I know what do you think
should I go with the more traditional
windscreen like that one or go with the
dead kitten taken dead kitten finally
over here we have Ed's mouse ed from
tech source I don't really need this
mouse for production but he left it at
my house when he was over here last week
and so I'm actually bringing it to
Taiwan to deliver to him even though
they both live in Southern California
that makes sense I decided to move into
the bathroom so I could actually see how
this looks from my own perspective so
right now I'm filming myself and I'm
monitoring myself in the headphones
which sounds kind of weird cuz I can
hear myself laughs Mike is miked up some
to me right here going into that going
into the camera camera is up and running
and you know I got to be honest I don't
have any zip ties holding this thing
together so it feels a little bit more
professional than it's been in the years
past all right guys I'm back to
recording with the gh4 and I'm using the
lav mic so here's a quick run-through of
my miscellaneous pile also heroes in the
background back there
he let out some epic toots just a minute
ago I'll see if I can catch any more of
them anyway all right so we have a Wired
magazine because it's always good to
have some analog reading material for
the plane or the travel or whenever
you're bored I got a new t-mobile
account this is literally going to be
just for a month because t-mobile has
really good international set up so in
Taiwan I'll have full data and cell
reception all that good stuff extra
batteries always gotta have that stay
prepared for potentially getting sick at
many cons so I got some airborne and
some dayquil just in case I want to have
some food for on-the-go so I got my Clif
bars chocolate chip
apparently I'm I really like chocolate
chips and then I also got some you know
some peanuts they're just so so if he
needs some quick protein pop those in
there got to stay clean stay clean and
fresh so I got my you know my materials
here for all that all that stuff don't
ask what the baby wipes before I got
some sunscreen probably won't need it
but you know it's there just in case new
toothbrush and toothpaste Listerine
pocket packs as well some gum having
like clean fresh breath as you're
working for 8 or 12 hours a day and
going lots of places and eating random
food and everything I find that to be
quite handy also I got a J pillow this
was a complete just spur-of-the-moment
impulse buy from Amazon last night and
it got here today thanks Amazon Prime
but it's supposed to be like a really
nice neck pillow and when you're doing a
12-hour flights or more then that's
pretty important ok guys I'm back to the
lav mic now to take a look at the msi
workstation laptops that msi is lending
us to use for the next couple weeks so
first off it didn't realize it came with
a little carrying pouch it's nice
zippered protective pouch especially for
travel and before I even get in the
laptop itself I am gonna be rolling with
some supplemental storage these are a
couple external drives from Corsair
you've probably seen this before I've
done videos on them I got the GTX right
here which is about 256 gig and I got
the GS here which is about 500 gig so
tons of storage on these and the GTX is
really fast I actually edit off of this
Drive so I will do that sometimes the GS
is more for mass storage but I have a
bunch of games on here my rule when I'm
doing filming on the road is that if I
have any footage that's on an SD card I
don't work with it or touch it or do
anything with it until it's copied to at
least 2 locations
so that usually means internally to the
laptop itself as well as preferably some
external locations so I also have a
HyperX SSD this is a HyperX savage 480
gig and I've got that connected to a USB
3.0 adapter so that is going to be
really really fast just about as fast as
it would be if you connected it straight
to a SATA connection to like on a
desktop so that's going to give you
plenty of SSD storage to work off of and
especially when you're working with a
lot of raw video footage in Premiere
it's really nice to have fast storage
and finally here's the msi workstation
laptop specific model is ws 66 QJ - 0 -
4 which is kind of a mouthful but
basically you got a 15.6 inch 1080 Full
HD screen and Intel Core i7 6700 HQ
processor and NVIDIA Quadro
M mm m4 gig workstation graphics card a
1 terabytes
7200 rpm hard drive and 128 gig SSD as
well as 16 gigs of DDR 4 memory as well
as wireless Bluetooth Windows 10
Professional all the stuff you would
expect with a workstation system those
are lots of connectivity for external
monitors SD card reader USB type-c
connector tons and tons of features on
this laptop so we're gonna be putting it
through the paces and I will let you
know how it performs for us well I've
just realized I'm pretty horribly
backlit but it's ok the video is pretty
much over I have one last item here to
share this is an AOC external USB 2.0
powered and connected monitor which is
pretty handy it's actually my wife's but
I've used it a couple times the model is
a OC e.164 9fw U and it's pretty small
but um you know basically consider it
vertically or whatever and the fact that
you just plug it in via USB and you know
you get a load a little driver but it
just works power and data over the USB
connections so I'll be providing that
for Joe so he can have a secondary
monitor to use while editing on the msi
workstation but that is gonna wrap it up
for this video guys by the time you
watch this I will probably be on a plane
to Taiwan and perhaps even another
secret mystery location in between that
I can't even tell you about yet I want
to say one last big thank you to my
sponsors fractal design MSI and g.skill
for helping me go on this trip and bring
you lots of informative and educational
content hit the thumbs up button and
subscribe to my channel for all the
Computex videos coming up very
and we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
