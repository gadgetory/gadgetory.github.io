hardware today's video is it's an
unboxing I feel bad I feel conflicted I
was actually completely unsure whether
or not I should even go ahead and do
this video because unboxings as you guys
probably are already aware of kind of
suck I mean there's really not a whole
lot that you gain from them you can
watch me take some stuff out of a box
and really what it's gonna lead to is
just a and D getting some free publicity
for their new lineup of aimed EAP use
that are coming out for the am for
sockets that are gonna be compatible
with the 300 series unfortunate series
motherboards and so when I first heard
that there was going to be an unboxing
embargo for these ap use that's separate
from the actual embargo lift which is on
Monday and when we can actually give
reviews and performance metrics and that
kind of thing I was like you know I'm
not gonna fall for it this time I'm not
gonna do it but I didn't want to just
make that decision and wash my hands of
it without at least running it by you
guys so I reached out on Twitter sent
this tweets and I am a little concerned
about the 42 percent of you who are no
longer feeling feelings anymore but 2017
was a tough year but it does appear that
only 14% of you actually believe that
unboxings are lame and pointless so
we've all been misled by gamers Nexus
and with all that said I'm gonna go
ahead and take this out of the box just
arrived a day or two ago and I don't
know what else to say about it there was
a packing list on the outside that I
already looked at so I have a vague idea
of what is actually in here I'm not
expecting quite the same level of
presentation and the stuff that they did
with thread ripper or the earlier Rison
launches from 2017
yes so we have a large horizon retail
ish looking package I guess it's another
reason why I guess some people are
interested in these types of unboxing
videos is not everyone gets to see this
type of packaging so you guys get to see
what AMD directly sends out to reviewers
in order to review products and this one
does specifically say for reviewing and
testing purposes only not for resale
so guess I can't flip this after I'm
done and make a profit on top we have
just two inserts talking about the
actual two products in here we got the
risin five 2400 G which is gonna be the
higher end it's actually kind of a
replacement for the the 1400 then I got
the 2200 G which also includes Vega
graphics it's not quite as powerful you
got eight GPU cores or GPU compute units
as AMD calls them versus eleven JP
compute units in the Vega units on the
2400 G but I think this is gonna be a
really nice option for anyone who's
struggling with horrendously overpriced
graphics cards right now especially if
you're looking to build a budget system
because budgets even the budget graphics
cards are really overpriced so getting
yourself an APU you'll be able to gain
with hopefully decently game with
assuming it's gonna be a 1080 basically
just get yourself a computer to game
with to tide you over hopefully for the
short period of time until graphics card
prices get sane again it appears to be
all that we have in the box alright so
here is my kit and basically we've got
the two processors I'll save those to
take out of their boxes in just a moment
and then they basically want to make
sure that you're set up with the
hardware to get these running functional
and of course give it give a good show
of them so to that end they've included
descale Flair X memory this memory is
really nice if you're pairing it with a
rise in CPU because clerics are
specifically made by g.skill to work
with the rise and CP resin CPUs and
work at higher rated speeds this is the
3200 speed kit to buy eight gigs given
memory prices right now I should just
trade this for gold or something I
imagine but some it is it's it's good to
have another kid flex stuff and if
you're gonna use we're just gonna plug
in X and P values and if the flare X
memory isn't grossly overpriced compared
to you know comparable memory speed and
capacity configurations definitely
something I can recommend to get
yourself up and running
let's nice to be memory and rising which
is very good for game for gaming as well
as overall performance the motherboard
they've included is from gigabytes this
is the a B 350 in gaming Wi-Fi Mini ITX
motherboard this is actually the same
Mini ITX motherboard that I used in the
bill that did for Rachel
and sent with her over to China and it
is still doing a great job for her over
there from what I understand and I was
kind of sad to see my little mini ITX am
floor board go overseas so this is a
nice little add-on to m dot to slot on
the back there so you can add yourself
some high-speed storage this is a be 350
motherboard of course we are expecting
at least X 470 motherboards from AMD
coming out in the next month or two but
we're also probably gonna see a B 450
very interest something along those
lines as well though I don't believe
that has been officially confirmed yet
but I can't imagine them not doing it
beyond that though this is a nice
motherboard as far as the feature set
Wi-Fi integrated so you don't need an
expansion slot for that full-size by 16
expansion slot for your graphics card
supplemental CPU power connections so
it's got decent power delivery and you
can do a bit of overclocking here not
the best position for that supplemental
CPU power connector but I digress
alright so let's get this put aside so
got the motherboard got the memory this
is sealed for security or so it says
this the the packing list said there is
a personalized USB stick but this just
appears to be a USB stick so this
probably is gonna have drivers on it and
that kind of thing just a four gig stick
it's orange and black and has an AMG
logo on it and they've included a
lanyard because they're very thoughtful
that way and now it lasted it's time to
unbox the processors I'll start with the
three the Rison 320 200 G page here
break the seal on the top and hear the
voices of angels singing
it looks like packaging is pretty much
the same as what we saw with the horizon
first-generation series does include ll
races fire cooler there which is very
nice to have now the CPU itself has a
varying TDP the TDP actually goes from
45 to 65 watts
depending on the configuration but out
of the box 65 watt TDP and that can be
handled by this race spire cooler so
it's good to know that you have
everything you need just to get yourself
up and running it also looks like they
put a new AMD sticker on the top of that
just make things look a little bit
cleaner thermal paste is pre applied and
then in this little box we have our
actual apu 2200 g has four cpu cores and
four threads so you get four cores but
you do not have SMT so four cores four
threads it's got a base clock of 3.5
gigahertz and a max boost clock of 3.7
gigahertz again that TDP which varies
from actually 46 watts to 65 watts but
still keeps it down quite a bit
especially when you're considering that
it's graphics and CPU in there at the
same time and then they've also included
a couple stickers here and since it's
got the graphics you get your rising
three sticker our case badge and the
Radeon graphics logo as well beyond
that's the CPU is not gonna really look
all that much different than any other
rise in CPU for a m4 that we have seen
already seen because it's a name for CPU
and it slots into a m4 sockets just like
rice and CPUs have already existed the
main difference now is that when you
slot this into a motherboard a name for
motherboard that has video outs on the
back which most am for motherboards do
have but they've been completely useless
up to now
unless use some of the older older ApS
that they came out with a few of it's
nice to be able to get just get video
out directly from there
now these CPUs are also going to be
using your system memory for the
graphics memory there is no HBM memory
that's integrated as part of the CPU as
well so that's another good reason why
you might consider a
high range memory or just something
that's a little bit faster because this
is going to be using infinity fabric to
communicate between the CPU and the GPU
portion and Reisen infinity fabric ticks
at memory speed so faster speed memory
means that everything is going to get a
little boost and of course once we're
able to do some actual gameplay testing
performance on this will give you a bit
better idea of what you're actually
gonna get from that higher speed memory
and now for the review you've all been
waiting for which is going to be
completely different than when I unbox
the 2200 G the unboxing of the 2400 G
alright I have confirmed this is gonna
cost $169 MSRP and it's effectively
gonna replace the hundred and seventy
dollar quad core that exists in the rise
and five lineup right now they will will
both still be available and it's
difficult to say whether the included
Vega graphics in this will affect
overclocking or that kind of thing but
hopefully we'll do some testing on this
and let you guys know we also get a rate
stealth cooler in the box here same as
the 2200 G and the 2400 G has 11 GPU
compute units as compared to the 2200
G's 8 GPU compute units the 2400 G has a
base clock of 3.6 eager Hertz a boost
clock 3.9 gigahertz the TDP of 65 watts
at default but you can lower that by
reducing some of the flock speeds of the
heat output changes and then you have 11
GPU cores as compared to the 8 GPU cores
on the 2200 and of course still using
Vega architectures so there's that one
again physically no real difference from
any other am4 processor apart from the
fact that there's a GPU in there and it
says 2400 g on the top you've also got
both of your little case patch stickers
and there are your two CPUs ap use I
guess I should say since these are AMD
APU
well that haven't heard am ii using the
term apu quite as frequently anymore i
don't know if they're they're kicking
that to the curb or what but maybe i can
find out for sure and let you guys know
if AMD approves of the term apu anymore
if you look at the current AMD rise and
line up the risin 5 1400 and the resin 5
15
Eck's are usually between 150 and 170
dollars or so and those are both
quad-core CPUs with 8 threads so this
2400 she coming in at 170 dollars is to
some degree going to replace a couple of
those CPUs although they will still be
available so you can't still buy either
one and hopefully as some more reviews
and testing comes out we'll be able to
give you get a better idea if there's
any actual performance difference from
this CPU given that it's got a GPU
integrated as well or if you're not
using the GPU if it's just going to work
the same way
so guys that has been my quick unboxing
of the new risin ap use the 2200 G and a
2400 G coming soon compatible with the
am 4 sockets and existing be 350 and X
370 motherboards as long as you get a
BIOS update as well as upcoming x4 70
motherboards and hopefully more in the
400 series as well I will have a review
video coming out too once I'm able to
divulge that information to you guys so
of course hit the thumbs up button and
subscribe to my youtube channel if
you're not already so you can see those
videos when they come out I don't think
I can put links to these either but I
will put a couple links in the video's
description to some of the other
products that came in this package if
you guys are interested thank you guys
so much again for watching definitely
hit the thumbs up button on your way out
if you enjoyed this video and we'll see
you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
