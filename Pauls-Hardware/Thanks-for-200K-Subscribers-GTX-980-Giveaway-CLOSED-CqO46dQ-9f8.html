pauls hardware this is a short thank you
video because I just recently passed
200,000 subscribers a major milestone
something I'm incredibly grateful for
I'm something that I've been continually
grateful for is as I post videos on my
channel and I see you guys come and
watch them I see people come and
subscribe and post comments in the
comments section people have supported
me as well as other people who I work
with in the tech YouTube community such
as Kyle other friends like Jay watching
our live show all of this awesome stuff
that you guys do to help support us
whether you know it or not you are
supporting us so that's what this video
is about to say thank you to you guys
and also to give a little something back
because this is a giveaway video I'm
giving away this graphics card right
here this is a EVGA GTX 980 it has been
lovingly and caringly used by me to run
some benchmarks and what not really not
extensively used at all it's in great
shape and one of you guys will win this
this is an international giveaway and
i'll come back to the details in just a
moment i need to give us a little bit of
back story on this giveaway though if
you go back a little over three years
ago was when i started my youtube
channel back in 2012 and i actually
started my channel one day after Kyle
that's right Kyle started his first and
I copied him immediately so Kyle also
just passed 200 thousand subscribers and
I decided why not continue that trend
and copy him again by doing a video card
giveaway Thank You 200,000 video just
like he did so that's what you're
watching anyway in order to enter to win
this graphics card go ahead and click
the link in the description it is a
gleam bio link and you can enter simply
by subscribing to my youtube channel and
that little app will verify you done
that there's a few other ways to enter
as well though you can follow me on
Twitter for example follow my instagram
it's all down there in the details
there's not a ton of ways to enter so
it's not like you have a list of 20
things to do but good luck to all of you
guys again its international so void
where prohibited or whatnot but other
than that you should be good to go and
everyone make sure to be checking your
email addresses that used to enter in
about two weeks that's when this
giveaway will end and then I'll be
announcing the winners on Twitter but
I'm only going to give you about i'm
going to say 24 hours to respond before
i pick a new winner because I got it I
got to get this thing shipped out what's
ready to go one other thing you can do
if you want to support me is to use my
amazon affiliate
link I have links for both us and UK
Canada coming soon as well both of those
are also down in the description that
doesn't help you enter to win or
anything like that but it does help me

shopping in Amazon just click my link
before you check out I get a little kick
back and everybody wins anyway thank you
