hardware this is my first video this is
my new channel and I think it's kind of
fitting because today at work where I do
our other video channel I just did our
1000th video it was the power color
Radeon HD 7990 devil 13 pretty awesome
maybe I'll link to it anyway I wanted to
do a video even though I'm not really
ready to do a video because I don't have
like lights and stuff like that yet but
I've got some stuff ordered and I got
these projects going on anyway so I
forget I'm a so hit record and show you
guys I hope you enjoy my new channel and
I've been very very happy with all the
feedback I've gotten has been incredibly
positive for the channel I do over at
new egg so um yeah hope you guys like
this one too I'm going to for today I'm
going to show you my computer because
I've been asked to do that a lot and I'm
also going to prep for my second video
which is going to be my wife's new
computer okay so for the wife what I
have coming up is a new build and she
wanted an orange computer and I don't
even know if this looks orange I'm
really sorry about the lighting not
going to be filming out here on a
regular basis but I got her a NZXT
phantom 410 the new egg special the
black with the orange trim looks pretty
sweet and I wanted some fans to match so
I got these a cougar vortex
HDB they're hydrodynamic bearing fans
are really quiet and a should do very
good job so I'm going to swap those out
here's my computer it's uh it's an
Corsair 600 T case it's the graphite one
it's got a side window down a fans on it
right now because I don't really do it
I'll really put a whole lot of strain on
this but let's take a look inside which
might be a little bit messy because I am
taking it out right now to clean it okay
so inside for starters I do some video
card testing with this so I needed a
pretty beefy power supply so I'm going
to enter enter max plateau max that's
1200 watt it's also got the cables which
are kind of red and gold which I like
because I like reading gold I also have
the Asus GTX 580 new directs YouTube
it's a big triple slot card but it's
been working well for me thinking I
might switch to something else soon but
I'll see what is available and then I
guess I'll talk about what's most
visible here this is a thermal take free
Oh cooler I really like this cooler it
does a really good job down at the
bottom which I hope you guys can see I
really don't have like the best light
here again I like holding a lamp over so
down at the bottom there you can see my
motherboard and that's the Asus
saber-tooth z77 which has a thermal arm
armor on it which looks looks pretty
sweet I've also got like 16 gigs of
course area low profile memory it's like
1600 it's nothing too crazy but yeah as
you can probably see it's not terrible
and here as far as dusk goes but it does
good ease of cleaning also I guess it
talked about my storage I just got that
like a DVD burner up in the front
storage I have a kingston hyperx 240 gig
SSD and then a couple hard drives i have
like a 500 gig this is a Western Digital
RT for like enterprise drives and I get
a 2 terabyte Western Digital Western
Digital green down there as well which
does a pretty good job for me a storage
and backup and everything and then rt4 I
put like if I have some of my Steam
games and other games installed on that
I have most among the SSD cuz there's
plenty of space but that's my setup I'm
gonna give this a cleaning that's gonna
be all for this video guys again I'm
just getting things started here so I'm
proud not going to be posting too
frequently but I guess some lights
coming in I promise things will look
better and all that but stay tuned for
at least one more video hope you guys
enjoyed I'd love if you subscribe you
could be one of the first ones cuz it's
my first video and see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
