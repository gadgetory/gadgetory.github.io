you months ago that when I built a crazy
over-the-top $10,000 plus computer that
I would actually use it and well I
haven't not used it but I'm not
completely using it either this video is
going to be about actually making use of
Riptide the Corsair one is a gaming PC
for people who want maximum performance
with a minimal footprint don't let the
size fool you though there's a core I
$9.99 hundred K CPU and an RT X xx atti
in the Corsair 1i 160 kept chilly with
convection assisted cooling and separate
closed loops for the CPU and GPU there's
also a corsair 1i 140 with an i7 9700 K
and an RT X 2080 so click the sponsor
link in the video description to learn
more so I'm in the computer room today
and hero was chilling down there below
me so if you hear him snoring just it's
okay he's peaceful and nice down there
but it's Riptide I built a stand for it
I did a multi-part video series on it
last summer from the inception to the
construction to the water cooling to the
upgrades in the future a ton of work got
into setting up to the RGB lighting on
this system and I'm really happy with
how everything turned out and I was
pretty much ready to start using it
except I wanted to make this video about
using it so there were certain setup
stuff that I didn't do with it
completely like setting up the raid
because I was waiting to make this video
at the same time though I make lots of
videos and I have this other computer
behind me that I had previously set up
to render all my videos and do editing
and stuff like that
and I kept relying and reverting back to
that just to get work done instead of
completely switching over to Riptide
so today I have three demos that I'm
going to share with you guys the first
is gonna be a setup demo for that raid
storage configuration I have a bunch of
SSDs it's actually all SSD storage on
the upper system in this build since
there's two actual systems and they're
including a FreeNAS so I need to figure
out how exactly all those are going to
be configured set up the raid
configuration maybe do some quick
testing on that too to see how fast the
drives actually are second is going to
be a more practical demonstration of
rendering a video on this system Riptide
vs. the old system back here which by
the way has a 78 20x and 32 gigs of DDR
4 memory and then the third one as
always in these types of videos I want
to play some video games and since this
system has 210
t is in water-cooled configuration and
SLI I'm going to play some games on
those two at the end and 4k at well 60
Hertz because they've got 4k 60 Hertz
monitors here behind me before any of
that though if you guys don't want to go
back and watch the OL grip type videos
here's a quick recap on the hardware
that is actually installed there so
system was mostly built around the case
which is the corsair obsidian 1000 d
which is the largest and most elaborate
case that corsair has ever put together
for mass production it has tempered
glass everywhere and it fits two systems
one in the top part and one down in the
bottom part that can be a mini ITX
system so the mini ITX system at the
bottom I configured as an S it is
actually running FreeNAS and it's based
on an AMD Rison 520 400 G processor that
has a Vega 11 GPU integrated the cooler
is a Noctua
NH L 12 s low profile cooler and the
motherboard is an asus rog Strix x4 70
di gaming for memory it has to 16 gig
sticks for 32 gigs total of corsair
dominator platinum ddr4 I am potentially
going to be switching this out for ECC
memory at some point in the future but I
haven't gotten to that project yet for
hard drives for the NASS we have 4 8
terabyte WD red spinning mechanical hard
drives and those are down in the lower
Bay this case can actually only fit for
standard 3.5 inch mechanical drives when
its default configuration so I maxed out
that space with all four drives for
thirty two terabytes total in the Ness
FreeNAS is then running on an Intel
obtain 32 gig SSD that's installed in an
m dot 2 slot and then I have a Corsair
force MP 500 hundred and 20 gig nvme SSD
and that is running as a cache drive for
the FreeNAS set up and there's a
separate video on the FreeNAS setup if
you want to check that out lastly the
power supply for that system is a
corsair SF 600 s FX power supply power
supply for the big system is a corsair a
x 1600 eye 1600 watt 80 plus titanium
rated power supply going on the rest of
the specs for the upper system we have
an asus zenith extreme x 399 motherboard
a AMD risin thread ripper 29 70 X that's
the 24 Core 48 thread
threader per CPU it's not the 32 core
version but 24 cores and 48 threads are
still plenty enough for me there's about
$500 worth of fans in the system all
Corsair LL series hundred and 20
and 40 millimeter fans you can see
across the front as well as the back and
the top radiator for memory there's an
absolutely insane 128 gig kit of Corsair
Vengeance RGB that's a ddr4 3200 rated
although I have been having some trouble
running it at that rated speed the
graphics cards are dual issues RG Strix
GTX 10 ATT eyes everything that is
water-cooled is pretty much water-cooled
by alpha cool the GPU blocks the pumps
the rads the reservoirs only thing
that's not is the monoblock that's on
the motherboard that is from EK the
specially designed mono block for the
asus seen its extreme and lastly there
is the storage in a separate drive and
this is where there's a lot and there's
several things that have been added over
time for the main operating system drive
I'm running off the Corsair Neutron
nx500 which is a 400 gig PCIe nvme SSD
which is kind of tucked in there between
the graphics cards for additional fast
storage I have two samsung 970 Evo one
terabyte nvme SSDs and those are on the
little riser card that issues provides
called dim - there's a couple - terabyte
SanDisk Ultra SATA SSDs there is a
couple 480 gigabyte Corsair force el
aceite SSDs and then there is a Corsair
force MP 500 960 gig m dot - nvme SSD
that's installed as well down in the
actual m dot 2 slot on the motherboard
so altogether I've got about
seven-and-a-half terabytes of SSD
storage in this system some SATA some
nvme a lot of it is very very fast some
of it I'm going to be configuring in
raid 0 configurations and some of it I'm
just gonna leave as is for long-term
storage I'm going to be transferring
everything over the network to the
freenas and then I still will probably
be using long long-term storage by
copying stuff to external mechanical
drives like I have right here I've been
doing that for way too long though I
need a better solution set up some read
most of the raid setups I've done are on
Intel systems this is an AMD system
there are some slight differences
fortunately I've pulled up a quick
set-up guide over here so I'm gonna be
hopefully diving through that's to
figure out what the heck is going on
first thing we're gonna need to go is go
to our SATA configurations this is what
I'm already aware of and switch from a
HDI to rate that should allow us to set
up raid for all of our SATA connected
drives the for SSDs - 500 gig ones
to terabyte ones next up over here in
the advanced tab we want to head down to
AMD PBS and we're going to switch nvme
raid mode to enabled and that will help
us to the instructions also have some
information in the AMD CBS tab but
that's not there anymore and it does
seem like our serda controller is
enabled so the funny thing about this
guide is it's made for the standard UEFI
BIOS settings but Asus has gone in and
you know moved some things around and
changed stuff to their preferences so I
basically found everything from this
guide that I could and changed it and
then I just went through all the other
Advanced Options that I looked for
anything related to SATA or CSM and I
changed everything that I think should
have been changed oh wait look there's
CSM is some support should be enabled
all right let's get UEFI and legacy
that's good too so these settings look
good to me
I'm going to save changes and reset and
then there should be a pre boot
environment that I can get into by
pushing a shortcut key that's usually
how this works
all right well as I sort of feared the
raid setup was a bit more confusing than
anticipated fortunately I have made my
way through it with some help some
outside help I want to give a shout out
to go step film pro who posted in the
asus rog forums a walkthrough of a
situation very similar to my own that
was really helpful and also eibar
anthony from hardware connects he did a
video back in 2017 where he went through
the raid setup process I think he got
some help from Wendell from level one
text as well so thanks to all you guys
by referencing those materials I was
able to figure out pretty much what was
going wrong after going through the UEFI
and trying as hard as I could to find
all the raid and SATA and nvme
configurations things that I could I
didn't find them all I was able to set
raid mode for the nvme drives as well as
for SATA but for some reason the utility
that you're supposed to be able to
access from the UEFI just was never
there I'm running the latest version of
the asus zenith extreme bios and
everything so not sure what the deal was
there but managed to get it figured out
from within Windows 10 and mostly by
using device manager when it comes to
your drivers for the devices you're
gonna have drivers for the disk drives
themselves and you're also going to have
drivers for the storage controllers I
basically had to download AMD SATA raid
drivers
software and then I had to go through in
device manager and either re-record
NIH's or update the drivers for all of
the storage controllers to make them am
deer a bottom devices because you know
who doesn't want to be a bottom and then
also the disk drives themselves not for
the SATA drives but for the nvme SSDs
after doing all that going through a
system restarts I was then able to
install the actual utility which is
called raid expert - that wasn't
initially installing because it was
telling giving me an error saying I put
it off an nvme Drive so running that
software would break it then I wouldn't
be able to boot anymore
fortunately going through the other
stuff first loved me to do this once I
did that it went through the
installation after hanging for a little
bit and then I was able to launch up
this web interface and this gives us
fortunately a layout of all the drives
so we can see our course airforce le
drives we can see our sand s 2 terabyte
drives and see the force MP 500 and the
neutron and X 500 as well as the two
samsung 970 so all of our drives are
here that's really good we can see the
drives I'm already using the force MP
500 discs v has already been assigned
drive letter e and then drive letter C
has been assigned to the neutron and X
500 could be 400 version of that because
that's what I installed Windows on to so
we have three reads to set up and I
think I'm just gonna go raid zero with
everything max speed I'll have all my
data backed up elsewhere so I can just
let's just see how fast these gonna be
all right so first thing I'm gonna do is
initialize all the drives that are not
currently initialized that is mice and
disks my Corsairs Samsung's let's go
ahead and initialize yeah next let's
create a raid array I want to do raid 0
I want to select which - I gotta select
the disks up here just name this one -
by force L e raid 0 and then we'll just
repeat that process for the other drives
as well these are the SATA drives arse
and disks so this is gonna be a 4
terabyte same disc and 0
and one more with our envy me drives
Samsung 1970s this will be a 2 terabyte
I'm some 70 that it's gorgeous
alright so my arrays are created but
we're not gonna be able to view them in
Windows quite yet and we can still only
see those first two drives we need to go
over to disk management's and then we
should be able to there we go we can
initialize those three new discs which
have been created their virtual disks
created by the raid arrays will go ahead
and let it do that for all of them and
then we'll just create partitions on
those three drives - so my storages
should now be configured and there they
all are one terabyte force le that's -
480 gig drives 9 that's just the 960 gig
the 4 terabytes and disk great 0 to 2
terabyte drives and the two terabyte 970
Evo nvme raid 0 look at all that space
so much room for activities let's see
how fast these are so here's some quick
test results with crystal disk mark
going and testing my three raid arrays
so starting on the top left is the D
Drive which is the - of course air force
le 480 gig SSDs we're getting about
eleven hundred megabytes per second
reads and just a little bit less than
that when it comes to sequential writes
so good performance that's what you
would expect from two good SATA SSDs put
together in raid I apps are over here on
the right as well if you guys want to
check those out next up is the F Drive
here which is the two same disc two
terabyte SSDs that are in raid 0 these
are still SATA SSDs so we're seeing real
similar performance close to eleven
hundred megabytes per second reads just
shy of 1,000 megabytes per second right
so the right speed here is a little bit
slower although it was a little bit
faster and some of the 4k tests which
are down here below again I ops are here
on the right side overall got a little
bit higher score than the two 480 gig
drives but finally we have the big jump
up from the two samsung 970 Evos so 5855
megabytes per second reads just over
5,000 megabytes per second rates real
good performance is over here on the
right this is a little bit less than
you'd see with the utility like Iometer
which you can sort of use to find the
perfect range to get maximum IAP
performance but also since we're
looking at a raid configuration that's
gonna be a little bit of overhead as
there as well so that will hurt overall
ABS performance too so what I'm not a
hundred percent sure of right now is
whether this is gonna do me a lot of
good these massive sequential read and
write numbers here given that the 4k
numbers aren't all that much better than
a single SSD I might just go with those
two individual rather than combine
together but we'll see how that goes in
the future finally I did a test on the
standalone nvme drive that's the Corsair
force MP 500 so this is a just m dot two
nvme SSD by itself just shy of two
thousand five hundred megabytes per
second read speed and just over fifteen
hundred megabytes per second sequential
writes I have performances down here as
well we can see wasn't too far off of
our dual samsung 970 Evo configuration
so my next s is actually the most
important one as far as actually using
this system because it's rendering
rendering with Adobe Premiere which is a
software that I use to render most of my
videos by the way there is gardening
going on right outside the window I
apologize but I have to do this because
there's actually a test going on right
now my test is side by side rendering on
both systems to see how much faster
Riptide is than the old system I'm using
before which again uses a 78 20 X so
it's got eight cores and 16 threads
we're dealing with three times the
amount of cords and threads on Riptide
24 cores and 48 threads so maybe that
means it'll be three times as fast
long story short yes pretty much let me
quickly talk about the tests as setup
because it's actually still going on the
system on the left here it has finished
on Riptide with a time of 9 minutes and
23 seconds what I am actually doing is
encoding a 4k video 3840 by 2160 at
29.97 fps progressive-scan h.264
encoding with a target bit rate of 42
megabits per second and we're still
rendering on system on the left so I'll
have to tell you what this ends up being
but it's already been going for over 20
minutes and again this one on the right
finished in 9 minutes and 23 seconds
while that's still going though I want
to talk about the UEFI settings on
Riptide because that's one of the things
that kind of took me the most time to
get figured out specifically memory we
have 128 gigs eight dims of memory and
with Rison it can be challenging to get
your memory to run and if
faster speed the memory is rated for
3200 speed I ended up deciding to dial
it back to 29 33 which is still a good
speed for risin let's take a quick look
at what I did in order to get those
settings actually before I close this
let's talk about the actual performance
while was rendering across all cores it
was running at 3.5 gigahertz a little
bit higher than 3.5 gigahertz it's
actually going up to 4.1 4.1 and a half
gigahertz on a single core at a time so
it's getting nice single core
performance in there as well but 24
cores at 3.5 gigahertz and that's just
with the stock frequency that was super
nice and then when it comes to
temperatures it was running in the high
40s maybe hitting the low 50s from time
to time it peaked at fifty five point
eight degrees Celsius on the dies so
that's very good temperatures there
again with so many cores and threads
going in the same system so that was
pretty cool
I remember your usage peaked at about 38
gigabytes so still plenty of headroom
available there now let's dive into the
thigh settings though yes my old system
is still working on that render but
here's a quick look at my UEFI settings
in extreme tweak room and leaving most
stuff at Auto because I didn't want to
mess with the CPU overclock too much I
was originally trying to hit that higher
ddr4 frequency of 3200 and then I'm
dialing it back to 29 33 I might still
push for 3000 but 29 33 really isn't
that far off from there beyond that I
went with manual settings for the SOC
voltage as well as the deer and voltage
and then in the DRAM tiny timings I did
loosen them up so we're at casa latency
17 right now well guys the old system
finally finished rendering that project
out with a total time of 27 minutes and
37 seconds which is right about three
times as long as Riptide took so I guess
that's a result right there more cores
and more threads you get faster
rendering with software that takes
advantage of all the cores and threads
of course now in case you're wondering
the right panel here is for one @cn
panel it's not as nice of a panel as a
panel on the left I actually have both
of these setups so I can sort of compare
and contrast one to the other when I'm
looking at my work I have a nicer high
color depth IPS monitor on the left I
can also bring it over to this not quite
as good of contrast monitor on the right
to see what it might look like for
people who don't have monitors that cost
more money but it's also running at
1080p and that is because I am passing
it through my notebook down here in
order to capture the stuff I've been
showing you on screen with the UEFI BIOS
tests have been running now the last
part of this video is gonna be gaming
and I'm just going to play some games
show some stats on screen and share a
few clips of those with you guys cuz I
just want to play some games on this
system but before I get to that I wanted
to talk about pros and cons now that
I've had this system set up and been
using it for a little while
pros are of course all of the awesome
stuff that you guys have seen the system
itself it looks awesome it's quite
pretty I think with the LEDs the custom
sleeve cables I really like this sort of
stands that Joe and I built for it which
turned out really nice I think as well
it kind of keeps it up off the ground
but at a level where I can still get an
a view at it especially those pumps the
fact that I can see the water flowing in
the pumps as I'm using it it's just nice
peace of mind for me because I've had
pumps die on water-cooled systems before
and that's something I want to keep an
eye out for I'd say the cons to the
system are going to be flexibility when
it comes to upgrades and swapping stink
things out in the future this is a very
flexible system when it comes to
water-cooled systems in general that's
why I used so many quick disconnects and
tried to make it somewhat easy to get in
there to modulate their modify things if
I need to but at the same time that nass
system that's done in the bottom has
really wedged in there if I wanted to do
any work on that it would be a lot of
effort to get it out of there and then I
think functionally there have been two
main areas of concern one was getting it
stable in the first place and that was
mainly to do with running the memory at
higher frequencies I wanted to do that
but with so many dims in there it's
challenging to get it stable I think I'm
okay for right now I might still tweak
and tune it a little bit more in the
future but for the time being as a
system that I'm going to be doing most
of my work on I think it's okay the
second thing is some instability I think
that has to do with the Corsair IQ
software that's still been being
developed and they actually just did a
new version of it right before I shot
this video but I've noticed for one that
if the system goes to sleep the IQ
software just completely stops
functioning the colors change the fans
will spin at the high speed I have to
shut the system down and start it back
up again hopefully that's something that
can be fixed in the future I've also
noticed that it likes to sync up
everything you have connected so I've
got my Corsair Mouse right here my m65
which is a mess I really like it keeps
resetting it back to some default
setting with really high DPI so the
mouse moves really slow so I keep having
to switch it back from that
that's kind of an annoyance but I'll
probably be able to mess with the
software a little bit and figure that
out on the plus side it has synched up
the LEDs on the mouse which I never did
myself with the color scheme that I have
on there so the IQ software I have to
give it credit for being as flexible as
it is to do all this stuff but still
working out some kinks in the background
guys let me know what you think of this
video and this entire series by the way
it's been a long time coming to get this
system integrated into my workflow but I
do feel like I have done that now so I'm
gonna quickly jump to some games let's
take a look at those the game actually
played his apex legends because it's
pretty fun game right now and I was
actually loading up OBS at the same time
to see if I could do 4k 60fps gaming and
capturing at the same time unfortunately
apex doesn't seem to take advantage of
SLI very much at this time at least not
with this configuration so unfortunately
the framerate wasn't all that great at
4k I was struggling to hit at 60fps in a
few situations so I turn the settings
down to medium beyond that it was just
messing with different OBS settings
training x264 in order to capture 4k
60fps at the same time unfortunate I
doesn't get like a perfect solution for
that I think I'm getting closer to
something good I did get one a set of
captures that were pretty nice not too
terribly choppy
I think there's something I might
revisit in the future just looking for
the perfect settings for 4k 60 frames
per second capturing while you're gaming
and playing something that has a lot of
movement involved unfortunately the game
I did the best in because I was being
carried by two other guys is the game
that did not capture very well I was
trying a new envy encoder setting and
it's very new and it ended up being just
freeze frames for most of it but we were
a second-to-last eliminated there and
that was pretty fun hey that was fun I
should game more often actually have
been gaming more often it's been great
for mental health and everything but
moving back to this there's one last
thing that I wanted to do before I close
this video it has to do with the
computer tucked over here on the left
it's connected to the monitors the cords
are too short for me to do sit stand on
this desk anymore with it plugged in
that way so all I have to do is unplug
this theoretically there we go and now I
can do this
I should've double-checked plugs should
double-check plugs everything's fine oh
good everything's fine look now I can
stand my framing is messed up now okay
that is gonna wrap it up for this video
though guys thank you so much for
watching and check out the Riptide
playlist if you want to see the full
series of me assembling this thing
putting it together getting the LEDs set
up and all that good stuff thank you so
much for watching this video hit the
thumbs up button if you enjoyed it and
we'll see you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
