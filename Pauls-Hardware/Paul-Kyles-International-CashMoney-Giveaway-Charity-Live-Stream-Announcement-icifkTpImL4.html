Paul coming to you today to tell you of
a couple announcements actually the
first of which is that you guys might
have caught wind that we were doing like
a fan meet up earlier where we sold off
a bunch of stuff also some hardware
forgive my phone going off in the middle
of this already but we actually
collected all the money that we got from
those things and we're planning to do
some cool stuff with it the first of
which is that we're going to do we're
going to host our own extra life charity
stream that's going to happen on
Saturday a December 10th from 11am to
11pm we're doing a full fledged 12 hour
stream to raise money for a hospital
somewhere in LA or orange county area we
haven't decided exactly which one yet
but it's going to be a very charitable
cause so hopefully you guys can make it
out for that it's going to be streamed
live of course to each of our twitch
channel so twitch TV / paul's hardware
and twitch TV / bit wit Kai it wit with
KY at the end I know it's confusing but
I think that's pretty much it for that
you can also follow us on Twitter Paul
hardware bit wit Kyle for more details
as to when and where exactly that's
going to be streamed yep Thank You Kyle
but the other part that you guys are
probably more interested in is this big
wad of cash as just holding up because
greedy best we're giving this away or at
least giving yeah pretty much this way
we're actually giving you more than what
I have right here away we're giving away
fifteen hundred dollars in cash and this
is a part of the proceeds from what Kyle
and I did when we liquidated some of our
stuff recently so again the first part
of its go into the charity thing second
part here is going to be for you guys so
it's international you can enter this
giveaway and win no matter where you are
all you have to have is a valid active
paypal account and then of course it's
void where prohibited so if local laws
prevent you from entering it give away

that but all you have to do to enter is
click the gleam IO link which is down in
the video description all we're asking
you to do is subscribe to each of our
channels nothing beyond that no special
stuff there's only one entry link so
whether you're watching this video on my
channel or kyles channel it's the same
link and then we'll choose two winners

dollars cash via paypal and you can use
that to buy computer parts or whatever
the heck else you can buy legally with
32 is cash money thousand this is u.s.
dollars by the way if we didn't
