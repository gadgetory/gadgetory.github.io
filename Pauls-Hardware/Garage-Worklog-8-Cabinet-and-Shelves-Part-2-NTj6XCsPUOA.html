another Paul's hardware garage worklog
this is my cabinet and storage shelving
installation video part two I'm gonna
get to hopefully a little bit better
point of closure for today I actually
need to run back over to Home Depot as
usual with the garage work logs they
they start with the Home Depot run in
the meantime though why don't you guys
take a look at all of the hard work that
I did yesterday getting to the point
where I am now
on my mind a home depot I decided to
make a quick stuffing eBay so I stopped
by to say hello D gigabyte and they had
a gift for me
yay 980ti extreme gaming this ins water
cools I'm gonna start working on a video
for this ASAP fortunately I live within
range of several Home Depot's because
none of them not all of them have the
stuff that I need so I've come to a
different one today to get to get the
stand out knows nothing stand ups I'm
gonna talk about motherboards talking
about about shelf standards estimating
any long shelf standing if you're
shopping for a wood at Home Depot it
helps to like kind of do line of sight
on the wood first to make sure it's nice
and straight that one looks a little off
to me so apparently you can just buy
these kits make a cabinet out of him
look 95 bucks 514 bucks
129 150 for all the woods pre-cut for
you I've got shelves that's boring
though where's the fun in that
alright guys I'm back for my shopping
trip let's take a look at what I got and
then I can get to work putting it all
together so most of its on the ground
here but the main thing I needed to get
was this was one more of these shelf
standards and I wanted a really long one
to go over on the side here's a look at
all the stuff that you might have seen
in the time lapse that I have completed
as of yesterday so got the plywood
strips mounted to the studs across the
back of the walls they're a little bit
different on this side because the the
tool chest is going right there so I
made a little pocket for it to kind of
sit in but on the right side here I'm
gonna do the Shelf standards a little
bit closer together so I'm gonna do one
two three right here it's gonna be
staggered on the left side anyway you'll
see it all in just a minute but then I
can do what you can kind of already see
here which is use these little inserts
there that pop in and then I can pretty
much put shelves like wherever I want
and I'm going to do a bunch over on this
side I might do some shallower ones over
here and then of course I got all the
pegboard but stuff set up so this is an
extra long shelf standard and then I
also went in picked up one of these I
wasn't planning on using these
originally but these are the rails that
go you put it across the very top and
then the top of the shelf standard kind
of
fits in there right now I just have
these drilled in but I think this is
gonna be a little bit
look provide a little bit more weight
it'll be able to hold a little bit more
so I'm gonna do that at least on the
right side and I might have to actually
pop this one off too to get it to fit in
there anyway apart from that I got a
wood glue which I'm not actually gonna
be using today I got a 1 by 5 I think
it's a 1 by 5 or no I think it might
actually be a 1 by 6 this long one that
is specifically to go on the front right
here because I don't have anything tall
enough and I want it to go all the way
across the front on there I'm gonna seal
that off so critters can't get in I also
got some more of these shelf supports I
got some 1 inch screws these are drywall
screws but I couldn't find anything
stur year than drywall screws that was 1
inch so I'm gonna be using those with
this skinnier strip here 1 by 3 when I
cut that into pieces and I'm gonna fit
that underneath the plywood shelves and
drill it in from the outside with these
1 inch screws should which should be
just long enough to go through both of
those and give a good amount of support
without actually punching a hole all the
way through and then that will give me
much more support under these shelves
and a big thank you to everyone who had
commented on the video area posted the
part 1 of this because I got a lot of
really good suggestions and that was the
main one was that their shelves not
gonna hold up with just being nailed in
the side of the plywood the main reason
I stopped yesterday was cuz I ran into
these screws one in 5/8 inches these are
like outdoor screws but I'm using all
over the place they're nice nice great
finish are using these as well as some
much longer ones which are up here
somewhere to go back into the studs but
ran out so I had to get more finally
since I got that pegboard I kind of went
and got a bunch of pegboard accessories
so these little hooks that go into the
wall couple kits for those and then
these nice little baskets which should
just pop in there and give me some more
storage anyway though let's get back to
work
all right I got those side supports in
and now I'm working on the bottom here
basically what I have is this guy here
which is a 1 by 6 I believe so it's
gonna be right up here in the front and
then I got this 2x4 it's cuts the size
in the back this is an old piece of a
fan blade that I cut in half and I'm
just using that as a spacer so this do
by 4 I'm gonna go back there like that
and you get now then on either side I'm
gonna level that off and then make sure
that this is attached to the front level
with it as well and then this last
bottom shelf will go on top of those and
then I'll be ready to put the doors on
and there it is a cabinets and shelves
or most mostly shelves I am pretty much
done I'm as done as I'm gonna get
and I'm pretty physically exhausted so
I'm gonna do a quick wrap-up and show
you guys how this turned out but whose
shoes better look at it so you can see
the cabinet's from top to bottom and
they have the birch front plywood as far
as things that I learned in my journey
and building these the first thing I
think would definitely be the thing that
popped out towards towards the very end
if the camera will focus which you can
probably see right now which is that my
hinges the hardware for them was a
little bit too long by maybe a
millimeter or two so I poked out I'm
going to be fixing that I'm gonna be
just going over all 16 times two of
these 32 I'm gonna go over all 32 of
those with my dremel and I'm gonna cut
them down so it'll be fine I knew before
I went in and started to do any drilling
that it was gonna happen but I was too
far along and I really wanted to get the
doors mounted today anyway speaking of
doors mounted look although they don't
know handles yet but they open ah 90
degree hinges in their top to bottom
this one opens as well just like that
and I'm really happy with how they
turned out as far as hanging the doors
it wasn't terribly difficult I started
at the top hinge I actually had I put
the door like in the closed position and
I kind of taped it in place and then I
went inside and marked off where the top
hinge would go and then after hanging
that one I can line up the ones going
further down to set the doors up I kind
of like I said I taped him and then I
shimmed him at the bottom with a couple
metal thin metal strips that I have to
kind of give him a little bit of a lift
off of the ground so that they would you
know have enough clearance there to
actually open anyway I would have you
sticker plywood if I was doing this
than that I'm pretty happy with it I
might have planned out the interior a
little bit more so I still need to add
shelves and that kind of thing anyway
here's the final bit of stuff Abin noon
which is my whole shelving system over
here this is he could see I got these
shelf standards I kind of staggered and
doubled up on him over on this side as
you can see I don't really have shelves
on them yet although this one has a
piece of wood on it to dissimulate a
shelf so I just have to basically cut
plywood strips strips to size these have
metal racks metal wire racks you can do
on them too but those are like 20 bucks
each I'm just use plywood you kind of
drill in at the top there and it holds
it in place
I also going to get more of these actual
shelf supports I have a fair amount of
them but they come in shorter shorter
sides too so for over here I want to do
some more and all that kind of thing
that's a peg bar going to hardware
hardware is hanging on the pegboard at
the tool chest in place over here and
yes anyway guys I am super tired so I'm
going to pack and then get to bed
tomorrow I'm going up to Fremont for the
Corsair live show one more time and in
