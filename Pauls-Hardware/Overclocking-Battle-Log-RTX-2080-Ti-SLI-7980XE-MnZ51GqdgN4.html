setup video it says 79 80 XE right so
that's what I that's what I assumed was
in there so that's what I used this says
18 on it though 18 minutes
that's number I shoulda looked at there
it is I think this should help the enter
max liquid tech tr4 - all in one liquid
CPU cooler has a massive contact plate
made just for thread Ripper and is rated
for 500 watts of heat dissipation high
pressure pwm fans mount two rubber
channels on the radiator to absorb
vibration and the sexy logo and edge
lighting on the block is addressable for
syncing with your motherboard
it comes with an RGB control box - so
click the spots are linked in the
description for more what's up guys
how's it going welcome back to Pauls
hardware today's video is gonna be my
attempts to continue my overclocking
experiments with the RT x 20 ATT is in
sli or envy link I should say and be
linked to way and I'm trying to upgrade
this course system if you watch the
video where I set it up you might have
noticed that I accidentally installed my
10 cores 7900 X instead of my 18 cores
79-80 XE I have swapped in the 79 80 X Y
right now and what I was trying to do is
just get some baselines some baselines
for comparison but it's not going very
well I need to deal in my 79 80 XE and I
will be doing that very shortly I've got
the der Bower at the leading tool for
LGA 20 66 CPUs right here but I want to
be able to say here's the before and the
after for that so I have a 4.7 gigahertz
overclock going right now on all the
cores on my 79 ATX see the voltage is at
one point two seven five I haven't done
too much tweaking aside from that and
I'm overheating and throttling I've had
100 and over a hundred degrees Celsius
on all of the cores such as can
constantly dialing back that 4.7
gigahertz overclock and making it pretty
ineffective so that said rather than
mess around too much with tweaking with
voltages and stuff to get myself stable
as is I'm gonna start upgrading when a
delayed which should reduce my
temperature significantly I'm gonna
upgrade this ek waterblock which is an
older one that actually might be a
little bit corroded and not efficiently
cooling inside I'll be swapping the item
with an ek monoblock and have several
other components that are supposed to
like be arriving literally today so as I
proceed I will hopefully be adding
things to this test bed running tests in
between and hopefully I'll be somewhere
in the ballpark of where Steve and Jay
are by the end of the day with their
spy extreme world records overclocking
attempts I should also point out that
your Bower is also involved now and he's
using ln2
but that's cheating so I don't care I'm
mainly trying to compete with Steven J
for now so I am becoming very suspect of
my cpu block a little bit but also
really hoping that the D lid will help
me out some so here was my score from
the initial tests I was running with the
7900 X 11 to 21 and here's the score
just submitted twelve thousand thirty
five so that's a decent jump
although the cpu score only jumped by
like around a thousand points graphics
score jumped up by about two hundred
points so really all I wanted to get was
a baseline here to give me something to
compare against as I do the thermal
upgrades and I want to point out even
though I lowered the CPU frequency we're
running at four point six gigahertz on
all cores on the CPU we were still
hitting above 100 degrees on single
cores so we were still probably
experiencing some throttling so so
rather than mess with this current
configuration any further I am going to
deal it the CPU and I think that
monoblock might be arriving any minute
now that twelve thousand thirty five
score did bring me up on the list though
currently sitting at seven I think I was
like 14 just just a few minutes ago
this will be my second time deleting a
skylight hex processor it is pretty
foolproof with this tool but we're still
doing a somewhat dangerous action on a
very expensive processor so yes I'm a
little nervous we're gonna line up the
triangle though pretty thoughtful and to
do it that way make it so how this does
is apply a very firm pressure to the
side of the IHS in a uniform manner and
we're keeping a close eye on this little
surface mount these little surface mount
guys over here because as soon as the
IHS shifts just ever so slightly it
shouldn't indicate that the seal is
broken I'll try to do it by hand but I
might need to crank it in just sick
that's do you see my pressure being
applied now no there it went that was
more of a pop than I seen in the past
it's fine because it didn't actually
knock off any of these surface-mount
none of things over here and we just
have to hope that none of the stuff
that's inside the IHS suffered from that
da da dee lid little nerve-wracking
alright guys the deal it is successful
thankfully I don't think anything has
been destroyed I guess I shouldn't wait
to say that until I've reinstalled it
and tested it but packages arriving
today as predicted very excited and I
think this will allow us to make an even
bigger improvement on our CPU
temperatures and hopefully also scores
and overclocking frequency by water
cooling it better all right what do we
have here
first check it out that is a monoblock
specifically for the rampage 6 extreme
right ROG I succeed yes that will help
us greatly because the block we've been
using I really don't think is doing an
appropriate job this is an ek supremacy
Evo but it's like two and a half years
old and I've mistreated it which means
it got a little corroded inside other
than that oh look we have GPU water
blocks this is the ek vector RT X xx
atti RGB the RGB is the least of my
concerns because I just want things to
be cooler and they did send me two of
these and these will fit on the
reference founders edition design
motherboard and I've got two of those
and two of these so it looks like I get
to water cool my graphics cards I'm not
even sure I'm going to get to this today
because I think for starters I need to
get that mono block installed and at
least get some more tests going with the
air-cooled setup but these are ready to
go for next steps let's get back to the
CPU though one more package has shown up
and this I'm pretty sure is memory ha we
got a new kit of g.skill credenzie
memory the Trident II you've probably
seen before it is a design that they've
been using for quite some time no fancy
RGB or anything going on here what the
selling point is of this kit is the
speed is a 4 by 8 gig kit made
specifically for X 299 this will work
for X 399 as well and it's a 38 66 speed
out of the box
cast latency 18 and I should be able to
overclock this even further than
creasing the voltage in
doing other overclocking things so Thank
You G skill this should also help
officially the first run with the
monoblock installed right now here it
comes
survey says oh my gosh it just jumped
1,500 points 1,500 points alright so let
me be clear here as as to what's been
changed CPU has been deleted and you
guys might have noticed that I did not
use look with metal I actually don't
have any liquid metal here and Kyle as
kind as he was to bring the deleting
tool over because he had borrowed it
from gamers Nexus he didn't bring any a
liquid metal so I do have like a metal
coming it should be here tomorrow so
we'll see how things go and I might pull
the block off and apply liquid metal
between the 79 80 XE die and the heat
spreader the only other things that have
been changed are the D lid the addition
of the mono block instead of the just a
CPU block and then I increased the pump
speed because the pump was connected to
one of the headers on the motherboard
and it just wasn't running very fast so
I have it connected to an external
Zalman unit that's running it closer to
maximum speed all of that without
changing any of the overclock settings
or anything still running at 4.6
gigahertz on all cores in the CPU led to
about a 1,500 points increase in my
score and I want to say that yes a lot
of that had to do with the CPU score
increase it looks mike-mike graphics
core is about the same CPU score is now
up to ten thousand seven hundred and
fourteen and it still thinks I have
g-sync on let's compare our online
results and see see what that brings us
to oh look look I just took the five
spot yeah I am literally there's only
one person time arts between me and J
granite I still need to make up about
1500 points but that would put me in
very rare company I think right up here
in the top if I can get up into the top
three or four with nobody up there but
me and herb our gamers Nexus and J I
think I'll be pretty happy so I still
got work to do
alright guys here's a follow-up if you
can maybe see the table behind me I have
cleared off and after the last bit in
this video I have actually spent about a
day and a half not the entire time but a
tough time probably good 12 hours
speaking settings messing around and
trying to get more higher scores from
time spy unfortunately I haven't had
that much luck but I decided this
morning I was going to take drastic
steps in order to try to get something a
little bit higher than I had before
it's my apologies cuz everything is just
a huge mess out here I have really just
set stuff up and things are chaotic but
this is my only portable AC unit and it
is kind of tied into the back of the
garage there for its exhaust so I set up
this cardboard tube completely hacked
together with duct tape and everything
in order to pipe my cold air over to the
system here which has been set up with
more fans on it other than that I also
have a supplemental power supply
additional power supply for one of the
CPUs because I was getting very close to
the 1200 watt Paris power limit of the
power supply I have installed
fortunately it has run I did finish test
just now that had a better score and I'm
trying to play around a little bit with
settings that might help then since I do
have colder overall temperatures with
the cold air from the AC being piped in
right here but this run is about to
finish let's see what my score turns out
to be temps are way better max temp on
the GPU is 61 C 13 663 that is better
but it's still not quite getting me
where I need to be so here's the current
layout of scores on 3dmark and as you
can see I've fallen several people have
jumped up we've got DJ Koon from Korea
Brian Ford VPS customs history and he's
got a couple EVGA cards I dropped down
to ninth but 13,600 ish does get me up
to 813 663 I will still be an 8 I need
to jump up to over 13 800 if I want to
start competing with the guys in five
six and seventh range but I think this
mainly became a time issue because I'm
about to go on another trip these things
just keep popping up and taking my time
away from doing stuff like this but my
options were to either try the AC trick
apply the water blocks or try to figure
out something else with my radiator
solution I decided to do the AC thing
because I don't really have all the
stuff I need to go further advanced
water
pulling right now I'm actually really
sure it on radiators so think I'm gonna
have to leave it at this for now I'm
sorry guys I tried to provide more
competition from gamers Nexus but guys
thank you so much for watching this
video
rip Paul I guess is the end story here
maybe next time we have a no seating
competition I will compete a little bit
more strongly hold on I take it all back
I take it all back I spent more time and
I've made progress actual progress hold
on yeah all right first things first
there's my score 13 8 61 for the record
here let me turn off the air conditioner
and before anything else turning the
Wi-Fi back on we could go ahead and
validate and compare that online 13 8 61
1/2 a jump over here to our current Hall
of Fame for two GPUs you notice that
currently number 5 there is Brian
bps customs and he did a great job with
his setup and that's not gonna be there
and number 5 for long I was at 13 806
there's my old fifth place 413 536 and I
was pushed all the way down to eighth or
ninth place but I would basically just
kept raising in my base clock this was
after trying a bunch of different
various overclocking methods yesterday
and I kept getting just a little bit
higher a little bit higher I got to 13 7
713 732 13 738 32 759 and then finally I
got to 13 803 which you didn't bring me
up in the standings but tied me for
eighth and then I got to 13 806 and that
brought me up to seventh but really
close to both Brian and WTO Mike here so
if i refresh with my new score there we
go I am back into fifth place with 13
860 and my wife you saw so there I am
for now at least in fifth place for 13 8
61 I would have been in 4th place but a
dude from Korea has jumped in there in
between me and J and gamers Nexus but I
think that's where I'm gonna be for now
here's a quick look at the final setup
the ghetto cardboard mod here for a tube
of air to go over to the computer
assembly I've also been adding some card
around the side just to sort of direct
the air this could be much more
efficient this was supposed to be a very
quick setup so I could just try to get
stuff a little bit cooler in here and I
got several fans doing some extra work
pushing the air over the entire rig I
got this one on top trying to pull some
air off and of course I've got the dual
power supplies to power everything the
maximum wattage we pulled was 11 27
which is not too bad at all here's a
look at my GPU overclock 1085 on the
memory plus 150 on the GPU clock voltage
max power sliders max and the fans were
max - I gave me a boost clock of 1795
with the memory at 2021 and it looks
like my max frequency was 20 85 as for
the CPU I'm an interesting overclock
going on that I'll show you in a second
but basically I'm getting it just over 5
gigahertz on a single core and when it's
running across all cores it's fitting at
4842 megahertz I hope you guys can see
this ok but these are my overall results
here target turbo mode frequency four
point nine seven two gigahertz AVX
offset is 100 megahertz below that and
then my dear am is just below 4000 just
below four gigahertz and then also my
cache frequency also known as the mesh
is at 32 11 megahertz and these numbers
all wonky because I did some BC LK or
base clock overclocking bump that up to
103 point six and that is what was
working for me today the fact that my
frequencies are this high is actually
baffling to me because I was getting
nowhere near this yesterday today was
just that base clock overclocking and
then of course the air conditioner that
helped me get much much better
frequencies I was doing by core
overclocking which allowed me to set as
specific turbo limit for each core which
is at 48 47 46 respectively for 2 for 8
cores and 18 cores of course then that
is multiplied by 103 point whatever my
base clock 13.6 that gives you the
frequency which is a little bit harder
to figure out when you're not
multiplying by 100 so there you go DRM
frequency 39:36
I did not mess with advance timings I'm
in 1819 1938 and then I did a few other
things like little 9 calibrations it's
seven hundred and forty percent and two
hundred percent current capability for
the power delivery and then also of
course
voltage is CPU core voltage at 1.35
cache voltage at 1.33 DRAM was at 1.45
input voltage of 1.95 and system agent
at one point one so now I can say that's
all for this video guys thank you for
sticking with me I am really happy that
this setup started to produce produce
some results I got back into the top 5
even though I'm still just using air
cooling for the GPUs a huge huge thank
you to g.skill for sending that memory
kit over ek for sending the monoblock
and also the GPU blocks that I haven't
even used yet and then of course
gigabyte for providing the 2080 Ti and
NVIDIA for providing the other 20 ATT I
thank you guys all so so much for
watching this video the thumbs up if you
enjoyed it and I will have more videos
coming at you very soon so subscribe to
balls hardware if you're not already
thank you for watching we'll see you
