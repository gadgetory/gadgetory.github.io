Pauls hardware today's video is gonna be
a quick rundown of this system right
here and just a notification to you guys
out there that I'm actually giving this
system away so if you're interested then
definitely go down to the link in this
video's description and go to the
gleamed i/o page and you can enter to
win it's only on for the next about
three days so bear that in mind this is
gonna end on Sunday and after that point
I will be drawing a winner so be sure to
check your email I'm gonna be notifying
people within 24 hours and if you don't
or if you don't respond within 24 hours
I'm gonna pick a new winner now
originally we actually had two systems
to give away and this was to help
promote an event that we held on
Saturday which was an Extra Life charity
livestream for twelve hours
Kyle and I sat right here played video
games and also we had a bunch of people
viewing and a bunch of generous viewers
who were actually donating to help
support via Extra Life the Children's
Hospital of Los Angeles and we were able
to raise over ten thousand dollars
thanks of course to the generous
donations of the people who are
reviewing at the same time people who
donated we're also able to enter to win
one of the two systems we gave away Cal
System the day of so that was just for
people who are reviewing the stream but
this system is available for another
three days so if you're interested go to
the gleamed IO entry page the parts that
are in here are an AMD risin threader
for 1900 X CPU that's an eighth course
sixteen thread CPU and enter max liquid
Tech TR for 240 millimeter all-in-one
liquid CPU cooler and asrock X 399
Taichi ATX motherboard a Corsair
Vengeance memory kit and actually that's
what we're gonna need to fix just a
second the Corsair Vengeance memory kid
actually isn't installed yet so more on
that in just a sec we've got a 240 gig
SSD in there it's listed as a SanDisk
here but just bear in mind that I might
actually need to swap that out but you
will get a 250 gig class SSD ZOTAC
GeForce GTX 970 Ti a mini graphics card
and a Corsair RM 850 I 850 180 plus gold
rated power supply in order to enter all
you got to do is click the link to go
over to the charity entry page and this
is still open by the way guys so if you
are interested wow and actually just
since last night we've cracked 11,000
dollars so that's absolutely amazing
thousand dollar badge right here so if
you guys want to donate again not
required by any means for you to enter
to win the system but of course it's
greatly appreciated if you happen to do
that and then you can also get an entry
by subscribing to my channel and then
subscribing to Cal's channel chances are
you already subscribed to our channels
but if you're not just got to confirm
that and you're good to go so I'm going
to get the system set up because we
actually used it for the live stream
Kyle was playing on it so this is a this
has been used only briefly for the
charity livestream I'm gonna clear it
out get it set up for the winter and
then again the memory which I got to go
pick up at Newegg maybe we should do
that first actually yeah okay thank you
so we're having a new great now deal
with a little bit of traffic I am trying
to split the gap here see if you order
from new it will call the day before the
morning of they'll take your order and
from the warehouse and bring it over to
the will call place you usually gets
there around 11 a.m. but the actual
email doesn't typically go out until
closer to noon ish so I don't have I
don't I'm I we will call email but we're
still gonna go over there and see if I
don't know if Robert is working the desk
then maybe maybe he'll just give me my
package I don't know about Robert though
he's so I was trying to pull something
success we tried to get there early but
we were too early so we had to go get
lunch
we stopped by Jersey Mike's but remember
he's here only 220 dollars for the 4x4
gate kit right now so charity them
success here we go
it's amazing what you can buy when
you're willing to spend lots of money on
overpriced ddr4 memory that's it's okay
let me get this open and we can inspect
to make sure everything is where it
should be
now I'm replacing what's already in this
system which is a g.skill trident z RGB
kits which was very nice kit great
compatibility with Rison of course but
honestly i don't think it goes i don't
think it's the best match up with
everything in here this is an
entry-level thread Ripper system so it's
meant to be serious it's meant to get
some work done and this is a little it's
a little too colorful and blingy I like
the white LEDs
enter max in the zotac logos for the CPU
cooler and the graphics card and then
there's just a little bit of subtle blue
LED on the actual asrock motherboard and
that is our GB so it could be changed
you know if necessary but here we go the
classic Corsair Vengeance kits only 220
dollars at Newegg right now ok guys a
quick aside here and a quick last-minute
change when I went and got the Corsair
memory yesterday I foolishly did not
take my own advice and actually look at
the memory compatibility list that
asrock has on their site for the X 399
taichi I assumed that that Corsair
Vengeance help the X cubed would work
because I've used it in several other
rise in situations however hasn't been
validated on that motherboard and was
just given us all kinds of problems when
I tried to get it to run
29:33 therefore and because I promised
whoever the winner was gonna be to
actually be able to run memory at a
higher frequency I wouldn't check the
compatibility list which I should have
done from the get-go admittedly and I
found that there's a G skill kit
actually and I discovered this AG scale
kits selling for the exact same price
for by four gigs of memory so 16 gigs
total set for quad channel validated on
the asrock website to work in quad
channel as well as OC mode and it's
rated at 3200 speed rather than 3,000 so
let me install this real quick and
hopefully end this video by verifying
that I got the memory running at the
right speed
got it installed just fine and it's
looking pretty much the same still all
black does have some stickers on it but
I'll leave it up to the winner to decide
whether or not they want to take those
off
alright this kid is already playing much
nicer when it comes to just the initial
boot up and that kind of thing here's
the XMP profile for it ddr4 3200 casa
latency 16 I'm just gonna go ahead and
plug that in and
I did a UEFI reset to defaults here so
I'm also going to want to change all my
fans back to silent mode look at that
first try promising there we go our 1900
X and memory speed $15.99 there we go so
double that that's 3200 Casa latency 16
memories working I already confirmed
this system works just fine with 3200
speed memory since Kyle played with 3200
speed memory all day on Saturday so I
think we're good to go so this is very
good news for me because it means the
system is working even better even
better than originally planned so apart
from swapping out that GC member at the
core circuit everything is exactly the
same system's already been tested and
functional uh since Kyle played on it
for eight hours during the livestream on
Saturday so we're good to go guys again
if you haven't entered click link down
in the description and get entered just
need to go to the entry page again you
don't need to donate but you can you're
welcome to and then subscribe to my
channel and Kyle's channel if you want
