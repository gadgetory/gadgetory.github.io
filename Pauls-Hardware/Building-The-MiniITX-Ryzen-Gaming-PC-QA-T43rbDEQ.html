awesome builds like these on fractal

out via the sponsor link in this video's
description and get inspired for your
next project everybody welcome back to
Pauls hardware this is one of the
smaller builds I've done in quite some
time too so much that I kind of need to
crouch down here just to kind of bring
myself down to the level of all of the
parts the cute little boxes that I have
right here arrayed in front of me this
is effectively one of my monthly builds
although this project was initially
conceived of in last month's August
builds but then for this month I've
decided to put together because this is
going to be a portable mini ITX gaming
streaming multi-purpose system that you
could pack into a piece of carry-on
luggage take with you on the go so
they're going around the world or across
the country you should be able to fit
the system into a carry-on piece of
luggage to take with you on the go I'm
not going to tell you guys how to get a
monitor with you as well because that's
a little bit more of a challenge but
this is a Rison v 1600 based system so
you got a 6 core processor gtx 1070 so
very power powerful whether you're
gaming or doing other stuff with it and
let's get started by going over the rest
of the parts so other than our processor
which is of course the Rison 5 1600
extremely popular 6 core processor with
12 threads is only about 200 bucks
and although this does count with a
cooler in the box I wanted a cooler that
was maybe a little bit cooler haha so I
won with a cry rag c7 this has only just
recently gotten support for the am 4
socket and you do need the aim for
upgrade kit type C at least for now
until they start hopefully doing retail
packaging that includes that upgrade kit
bracket as well but it's a low profile
cooler and it's air-cooled and since
this is a pretty small case I needed
something that was a low profile enough
to fit in there since it is a very small
case in a small build wheel with is a
very small power supply you need an SFX
form-factor power supply which is a
little bit smaller to fit in our case
this is the xxx 500 - LG from
silverstone
500 watts is actually on the low end of
what I would recommend for a build like
this with a 6 core risin 5 and a gtx
1070 but for our purposes should you do
just fine and since it's a mini ITX
motherboard without very much expansion
I'm not too concerned about long term
additional power for adding on
additional components and stuff our
memory is the Corsair Vengeance lpx kit
that I've used many times before I use
this kit because it's low profile it's
very unassuming it blends in doesn't
conflict with CPU coolers that I have
worked with at least so far and this is
actually a three thousand sweet kid I
raised this bucks from a different kit
because I couldn't find the kit that
memory actually came in but ddr4 3000
and 2 by 8 gig kits so should get more
performance out of our arrays in
platform with the higher speed memory
our motherboard is the a/b 350 M -
gaming Wi-Fi from gigabyte which is a
tiny little board super cute one of the
first mini ITX boards for this platform
to come out and this one features Wi-Fi
as well which is one of those things
it's pretty useful especially with the
portable system that you might be moving
around to get easy access to Internet so
I'll give you got a wireless router of
course our graphics card is the ZOTAC
GeForce GTX 1070 this is actually the
mini one it does have dual cooling fans
though and open-air design so it should
keep things nice and cool and since
there's plenty of ventilation on the
side of the case we should actually be
able to take advantage of that style of
cooler normally with a more enclosed
case I might recommend a blower style
cooler like with the bounders Edition
but I think for these purposes this
should do just fine for an SSD I have
the old-school Kingston HyperX as one of
their original 240 gig SSDs but this one
hasn't seen very much use and this one
actually has a better programmer a
cycles than the replacement that they
did with this that has the gray instead
of blue on the outside so this one still
has plenty of life left in it and it's
still nice and responsive so 240 gig for
your operating system
and maybe some games and stuff and then
of course you're going to want some
additional storage so when I parted out
the system in the builds video that I
did just a few days ago I recommended
grabbing an old hard drive to use and
that is exactly what I've done here if
you're building in a mini ITX system
then laptops are great sources to
harvest old hard drives from this is a
640 gig Drive that actually came in my
Asus
laptops that I've been using for a while
I swapped it out and replace it with an
SSD so let's get some use out of this
drive and add an extra 640 gigs of
storage bringing the grand total on the
system up to just under a terabyte and
finally our case from silverstone is the
ML zero eight one of the tall and thin
style cases for Mini ITX
it does have the riser card for the
graphics so the motherboard goes in the
lower area and then you've got the
adapter for the graphics card to go up
in the upper area which is great for
saving space and keeping things very
trim this case was actually slightly
larger than I was expecting at least
from the pictures but I did double check
and it does
thankfully fit in the carry-on bag so
that's a very good thing and then the
other nice thing about this model is it
actually comes with a handle well it's
not installed yet but this will go right
up on top secures the four screws and
then you can use it to carry the entire
system once it is put together speaking
of the system being put together let's
do that next
so here we are paused at the midpoint in
the build as you can see CPUs installed
I got the cry rig c7 installed - that
wasn't too tough it was a little bit
more involved than installing the stock
heatsink fan but it wasn't too bad at
all now I'm dealing with the case and as
you might have seen the case section
there's two side panels that kind of
wrap around the top and wrap around the
bottom which is kind of interesting nice
interior all painted black and some of
the complaints actually read about this
case as I was reading over some of the
reviews and stuff was about cable
management now there's a definite
difficulty with this particular
motherboard because the front panel
connectors are up here in the top left
whereas in most motherboards you'd
expect them to kind of be down here and
these cables are only so long they're
definitely long enough to get over there
but I'm doing it gracefully might be a
little bit of a challenge there's also a
bracket that goes right in there to hold
the power supply so and then there's a
power supply extension cable because
that kind of goes all the way over here
actually where the plug is so that I
kind of have been moving around to try
to figure out where it's best to connect
it so the cable management is gonna be
challenging I'm gonna try to do some
under the motherboard there's also a
little bit of space under the power
supply for routing some stuff there too
so I'll get back to it and I'll see what
I can come up with
and I completely agree with anyone who
said the cable management is a challenge
in this case however I think I have
found what is the solution especially if
you're using this motherboard
I removed the power supply again and I'm
using the little bit of space to get
sits under the power supply to route the
USB 3.0 cable for example so you get it
out and around there to use up some of
the excess length from it and then it
has just enough to loop down and
actually plug in right there I've also
taken the front panel connectors and
just kind of wired them underneath where
the power supply will be fans gonna be
pointing up so no need to worry about
about blocking anything there and that
then I also routed them underneath this
corner of the motherboard so the
motherboard is not fully screwed in
right now to do that the front panel
audio HD audio I just read read it
straight back there and also kind of
lifted the motherboard up to widget
right along the edge right there so I
think that's allowed me to get at least
my front panel cables connected in and
then I'm also like I got a zip tie going
right here although it's not done up yet
because I do still need to get the
actual power cables and I need a 24 pin
over here and I need a SATA cable over
here and I need an 8 pin mic right there
dear God this is this is like the worst
possible layout given the motherboard
end case but well we get it all plugged
in
just a few more notes here guys before I
kind of close things off I wanted to
point out the graphics cards installed
that wasn't too difficult and affair the
riser card is a two-piece affair that
actually bolts to the side of panel here
which keeps things a bit more sturdy and
you can't actually fit much longer
graphics cards than this one we got this
one because it was the least expensive
of the GTX 10 70s that were available
when we actually purchased it so because
this is this was purchased as a brand
new card so yeah feel free to install a
longer one although this does leave some
room for expansion here potentially I
could imagine a 3.5 inch drive
installing in there pretty easily either
just drilled directly through the back
here or potentially with a little
custom-made mount or something like that
beyond that this is a bit taller of a
graphics card so that did nearly present
a pretty difficult situation up here
because just getting it installed was
conflicting with this piece but
fortunately this case is not riveted and
this support piece right here just has
three screws so I was able to remove
those give me a little wiggle room to
actually get it popped in and installed
so that was a very good thing too
speaking of expansion space there's a
little bit more expansion space even in
here so there is still room for a slim
optical drive which we're not opting to
install right now but we could and then
the last thing I want to show here is
since this motherboard has presented its
share of inconveniences due to some of
the placement of things there's a nice
convenient aspect here which is that the
nvme MDOT two slot is accessible through
the cutout here so if Rachel decides to
add an nvme drive in the future she can
drop that in there pretty easily as well
so guys this build is pretty much
completes and I'm just gonna wrap things
up with some final notes here in case
you're wondering I don't think I printed
it out yet but there's actually a little
sliding panel here on the front and that
is where the USB 3.0 and mic and
headphone jacks are tucked away so
pretty easily accessible and you can
also cover them up it's also where the
power and reset buttons are incidentally
beyond that everything fit in snugly
enough granted this is a mini ATX build
so there's plenty of things that are a
little bit different from a full-sized
build and I already went over some of
the potential expansion options that
might be available here in the future
there's the
on the back looking pretty clean and
then of course together a couple drives
motherboard and the main components and
the power supply down here now probably
the biggest difficulty in here is
definitely going to be the cable
management's and in particular I'm very
glad that I had enough cable lengths on
several of these cables for the 24 pin
for the 8 pin to reach over because this
is actually a slightly shorter set of
cables that comes with this power supply
it should normally be a good thing
because in a mini ATX build you're not
going to have a lot of space to tuck
away excess unused cables now the parts
that you haven't really seen as much yet
is is putting the actual side panels
back on and since they have this kind of
wraparound thing that goes around over
the top and then kind of tucks around
and curves under the bottom both side
panels are actually pretty much
identical you could swap them if you
wanted however the plastic covers that
go on them do present some potential
difficulties we're gonna have to I might
be able to do some testing on this I
hope I have some time still left today
before I need to deliver this but that
will be in a follow-up video but I've
heard that the dust filters here can
reduce the airflow pretty significantly
so here I've popped on one of the panels
and you can see I've also added the feet
at the bottom which keeps a lot more
stable if you're keeping it vertically
here now you can't actually also set
this case on its side and it does come
with some little rubber rubber ball
things that will give it a little bit of
spacing off the ground as well as the
Silverstone logo that they didn't apply
themselves so you can apply that
yourself and make sure that it's facing
the right way which is kind of nice and
here I've gone ahead and installed the
top handle as well as those bottom feets
by the way the handle is installed on
top and that does a pretty good job
pretty stable pretty sturdy it is
plastic but it does have some nice
structural integrity to keep things that
pretty solid as you're lifting and
moving the system around even with a
full complement of hardware installed
and there you have it guys my Mini ITX
verizon build a lot of power in a tiny
little footprint and a pretty portable
package as well this case of course was
a little bit quirky but I hope I have
clarified some of those issues for you
guys in case anyone's actually planning
to build the system in this case just as
I have shown you guys today I will
hopefully very much hopefully be coming
back with a bit of testing on this I do
have to deliver it to Rachel soon so I'm
not sure how much time I'll have
that but of course subscribe to my
channel if you want to see that video as
well as a couple more builds coming up
very soon this month thank you guys so
much for watching this one hit the
thumbs up button on your way out and
we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
