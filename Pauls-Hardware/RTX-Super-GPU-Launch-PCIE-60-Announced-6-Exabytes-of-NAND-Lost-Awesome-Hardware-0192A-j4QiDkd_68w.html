and I'll buy you an ice cream
that's an actual it's an actual one it
just sounds really creepy Sean Connery
all right it sounds like he's with a
child hi everyone and welcome to awesome
Hardware live show we stream every
Tuesday evening at 5:30 p.m. Pacific
time talk about technology computers
mostly gaming PC's the parts that go
into them and and whether they're good
or not since well we think about them
very it's a very good show thank you for
joining us if you're watching us live we
stream to twitch.tv slash awesome
hardware the entire show including like
messy setup stuff at the beginning
thanks twitch for helping us get the
audio better than it wasn't when we
originally started streaming with always
do so I rented a little late as usual
but thank you guys for being here quick
word of warning we do occasionally use
adult language on the show and we enjoy
a beer or two or three so thank you
thanks for joining us we're if you're
joining us and shout out to wifey sauce
forgetting the beers yeah we shut up to
sell in chat are a good friend of
moderator keeping things under control
smog City Brewing Company coffee porter
is what we are currently drinking it's
just straight thick coffee Lavo really
yeah it's amazing there's a lot of
decent amount of coffee in there it's
gonna keep me awake keep me awake job
that makes we're good fine shut up
anyway headphone users I'll put the mic
closer to my station here we go groovy
uh-oh yeah a quick plug for our stores
if you guys want to help support the
stuff we do is that um excuse me check
out our stores pulsar Burnett is mine
you can buy things they're shirts mugs
pint glasses
bottle openers and other stuff too like
like thumb screw keycaps
look at that get a thumb screw key cab
oh thank you tur
do you need one of those yes and adds on
your escape
keener where do you put it yeah it's
something escape key that's a good board
good option set up with everyone can
find the can locate the escapee
variously also a bit wait that tech
slash store if you want to buy Kyle's
merch it's also real nice it all comes
from the same place don't be shy about
ordering from both of our stores if you
do place your orders at the same time
they will ship together you get a little
bit of a refund on your shipping cost
and also if you buy the awesome hardware
merch it doesn't matter which store you
buy it from Thailand I both get your
money either way and that's the goal
yeah get get your money and you get a
super awesome quality merchandise which
you will cherish for I won't say forever
because nothing lasts forever but for a
good amount of time either they get
longer perhaps then you might expect to
cherish something like a shirt or a
mother a pen glass alright let's go a
long time too much on the on the stories
ok the hell's going on news I don't know
do some tech news where are we
technology news that's what we're
talking about it sounds super Paul of
course it's very super very now I just
want to point out that this in this drop
this morning right here radio -
apparently boom the the Nvidia drop for
this week so we've known this week was
going to be busy because AMD is
launching not just CPUs but also GPUs
that's on Sunday 7 7 but NVIDIA was like
we're just gonna slip in lunch just
buting's before that we're gonna call it
the RT X super cards there's a 2060 and
a 2070 super that reviews - one at 4:00
this morning and then there's also going
to be a 2080 super which will be
available I believe I'm July 23rd yeah
so the short story of it if you haven't
watched any of the reviews that went up
is that they're faster it's like 2060
super is better than the 2060 big
surprise 2070 super is better than a
2070 we assume the same will go for
2080 super that's the 2060 super is
actually a decent bump up over the
existing 2060 because you get eight gigs
of GDD are six instead of six you'll
also get more memory bandwidth so it's
like 448 gigabytes per second instead of
Bateman
anyway I should look at my chart before
a John's memory bus went from 190 to 286
yeah very nice went from 180 to do that
so that's that's what's the I asked a
video about that I was like is it the
memory or what like what because they're
aiming this current for 1440 gameplay
and they said actually the the bus
widths being wider is a bit more
important than having eight gigs versus
six of course there are some specific
situations where you might need more
than six but we're not calling that out
quite yet yes an obvious seven seven so
all that stuff watching seven seven
anyway they aesthetically the card is is
super shiny in the middle super shiny
that's got a reflective thing there and
they put the word super after certain
after the name of the card on the
backplate and everything yeah so when we
check out the videos that went up on
that if you want a little bit more
details I have linked specifically in
the description to gamers Nexus article
as well as Hardware inboxed article
gamers Nexus article is on the gamers
Nexus website there's also a 27 minute
video from Steve which I listened to on
the way over here man he talks fast he's
a fast talker sure does talk fast a
sweet talker but doesn't list you that
the specs and whatnot comparing the new
cards to the old cards and I also
derived a little bit more because it you
know we all have limited time for
testing and tests in different ways and
stuff like that and I found some stuff
from Steve's article for instance the
graphics processing clusters they're
listing 5 or 6 Steve goes into some
details about his theories about how
they're bending the GPUs but basically
saying like for the 2070 super they're
getting 28 like if you have a GPU diet
it can't quite be a twenty eighty
because some sm units are not quite up
to par not fully functional and you have
to turn them off then
using those for 2070 super and so 2070
super closer to 2080 and a lot of tests
and maybe people will be interested in
that because the 2080 formerly was
started at 700 bucks and I can get a
2070 super for 500 bucks the thing that
I kind of most appreciate about this
although it's slightly it's like it's a
slight clarification is something that
was already somewhat confusing which is
the founders edition pricing you know
unlike for the 2070 there was a $500
starting price but then the founders
Edition was 600 bucks for the 2080 there
was a $700 starting price within the
founders edition was 800 formulas change
for those yeah so that meant that you
had like the sort of entry level like
the budget option for for those cards
but that was usually the most cut-down
version of the cards and I think a lot
of vendors felt more comfortable pricing
their cards up 80 or 100 bucks kind of
more in the founders edition range
because the founders Edition existed
there at that price being like look this
is a legitimate price to sell that card
for yeah bringing the founders Edition
prices back down to the base level price
that being 700 bucks when the 2080 super
comes out and 500 bucks for the 20 70
super I think will help the overall
prices of those cards and bring it down
and maybe people will feel that they're
not quite as overpriced as a lot of
people felt they were in the past when
they first launched yeah 2060 super is
the one that does have a price increase
because it's 400 bucks compared to the
2060 which will still be around for 350
dollars that memory improvement I think
is well worth it so but yeah you do get
the memory bump but now you do also have
an hour a 20 a 60 class card a 60 song
for $400 yeah eventually her back what
was the what was the GTX 970 remember
the popularity of the GTX no yeah I mean
he was just 3.5 gigs like so for three
twenty three three two three thirty and
that was a 70 yeah series card so right
just has been happening with Nvidia for
many many years I've been sort of
harping on this ever
since they first lunch the Titan is a
$1000 card in the bag no it's not a
gaming card we look at it in all these
gaming PC's it's not a gaming card and I
feel like that was where they like
NVIDIA does this really it's like a very
smart game from a business perspective
but it's where they kind of steadily
inflates the costs mm-hmm they're the
prices of their cards you know at
different tiers and everything like that
so you know you can look at it both ways
sounds like in tow a little bit
performance wise for 400 bucks I think
it's gonna be a pretty competitive card
and I'm sure it will pair up nicely
against the knobby cards and that's
really what Nvidia was after but this
launch was just sort of reshuffling
their stack so that so that Sunday when
people do because if people can't if you
did all your testing last week and you
didn't know about the super cards oh
yeah you're screwed like you can't just
you know people next week aren't gonna
be able yeah here's Navi and here is it
compared to all the 2000 series cards
but not the super ones right like that's
not gonna count anymore
and it kind of sucks done something a
little but at the same time like Nvidia
can do what they want yeah and if
they've got the cards then they can
launch them and make them available in
in volume then ready and because the
nonce among sea pebble isn't it's
cutthroat and the non supervillain of
these cards are being phased out correct
yes so it's even more irrelevant look
you won't even be able to buy those
cards so like the benchmarks don't even
matter that much more yeah so yeah and
it's I feel like they're like this
launch has been received to wait one
like one of two ways where it's either
like oh people are super excited because
they're they're getting more performance
for less money technically than what was
seen it launched for the RT X cards and
then the other people the other half the
other school of thought is like well
this is what NVIDIA should have launched
these cards for in the first place and
they're kind of dicking us around and
shrouding this guising it as a deal when
in reality you know they kind of were
just they should have done this in the
first place all along but I feel I feel
like that's lazy so it's just capitalism
like Nvidia so ahead of the game that
their GPU game is so on point compared
to AMD right now that they can afford to
roll out really beefy products whatever
prices they want and then they can
easily just like slash prices as
needed to to top the competition I mean
I say top lightly because we haven't
tested our X 5700 yet to see how that
stacks up but it's nobody haven't Cal no
we haven't and you obviously haven't
either
no I definitely haven't and even if I
did it wouldn't tell you because a man
of honor
but wait see yes all all true true
points a couple more details from the
articles that I just wanted to pull out
I thought this was some stuff that was a
little bit more than just kind of the
benchmark numbers that have been thrown
around when it comes to performance
difference by the way you're looking in
about attended to ten to fifteen percent
performance bump more like a ten percent
bump for the twenty seventy and about
more closer to 15 percent from the 2060
of course it's going to vary depending
on the games that you're testing in
resolution and all that stuff but that's
why it's best to check out multiple
reviews and see what people experienced
when they did the testing I know
notice from the gamers Nexus review did
some frequency tuning a 30-minute 3dmark
burnin to test frequency over time and
especially sustained frequency noted
that the RT x 2070 super had a nearly
perfectly flat line in their charts for
frequency which means there's minimal
frequency fluctuation which is a good
thing i was running about 1890 1890
megahertz out of the box which is a
pretty much the same frequency I saw so
so good cards performing the same also
the r-tx 2080 super which had limited
information Nvidia did send out a spec
sheet for it just like it they or two
before launch so that information is
available as far as full specs of the
r-tx way a super 100 bucks is gonna be
price July 23rd is apparently going to
be the launch it's gonna have fifteen
point five gigabits per second GD d are
six memory Nvidia says it will be faster
than the Titan XP which is it should be
good also since I mentioned it but I
haven't shown it yet
hardware unbox did one of their
typically Steve Steve did when it was
typically very in-depth many many games
tested reviews of the 20 60 and 20 70
also as the charts there with all their
specs and I like his I really like it
Steve's charts they're really good I
like how he highlights so you can sort
of see this this is like a microcosm
that plays out in the stack
you got the 2080 TI and the 2080 and
then you got the 2070 below that 1080 TI
is also going to be playing around in
that same range this is battlefield 5
1440 DirectX 11 by the way below 2070
super yes in 2070 below that 2060 super
below that as the 2060 which is right
about around the same range of C 1080
and then you also have the Vega 56 and
mega64 showing up here and there in
there but honestly they get 56 and Vega
at 64 I feel like are not as I mean
they're still there they're still you
can still get them and everything but I
feel like nabis gonna really make Vega
56 and 64 even less relevance than they
already are
but that's coming on Sunday as far as
the comparisons their power consumption
our TX 2060 super is very efficient only
5% more power than the standard 2060 and
just 2% or four watts more than the
Radeon rx 590 so that's cool
given that it destroys the rx 590 when
it comes to performance 2070 super it
uses 11% more power than the 2060 super
so that is more it's understandable
given that it's got a different GPU die
and everything but it does use 20% less
power than the Radeon set anyway
articles into the description where you
come back from talk a little bit more a
little bit more about this later in the
show but we'll come back to that moving
on though PCI Express 6.0 6.06 6.0 why
it's article is actually a couple weeks
old but I wanted to bring this up
because we like to talk about stuff
coming in the future
an antique article and and there it is
we're just now getting 4.0 why don't you
6.0 is because because Kyle PCI the the
pci-sig
that's PCI a special interest group they
Sigma they're embarrassed they they were
embarrassed you know right wait what
happened right
way they were embarrassed by the amount
of time that it took them to get to PCI
Express 4.0 because we've got a 3.0
forever yeah
like try to make up for lost time
there's been times in the past when the
these specific these core specs for that
are used but then the computer get
upgraded and I feel like at certain
times you'll see rapid increase like
like SATA remember when SATA first came
out yet SATA revision 11.5 gigabit then
revision 2 and then revision 3 I feel
like 1 2 3 came within a relatively
short timeframe yeah and then suddenly
the SATA grab three six gigabit per
second was just like the top the peak
for a while like a while I could get a
SATA SSD and it took a while to get
anyway point being PCI Express a special
interest group actually committed after
Gen 4 when they were an initial but when
they initially announced Gen 4 they said
we are also going to be accelerating our
development schedule so that they will
be launching more revisions of PCI
Express more quickly so that's why we've
already talked about the PCI Express 5.0
that was just a few weeks back that they
announced the some of the details for
that doubling the bandwidth yet again
from 4.0 to 5.0 and 6.0 will double the
bandwidth yet again just cheese just
kind of crazy don't we don't need it yes
up to a so a by 16 slot will hit a
hundred and twenty eight gigabytes per
second holy Sh
holy Toledo it's a lot of bandwidth what
do you even do it without eight
gigabytes per second anything faster
SSDs they're expecting to finalize this
standard in 2021 they're continuing to
do this because they say hardware
vendors continually demand more speed
you can see this this is the this is
their chart showing you how much better
they're getting so if you look at the
older generations of PCI Express and
doubling the bandwidth every three years
mmm-hmm
there they're increasing that so by 2021
they'll be up here to 256 by 16 for
Jen's 628 by 16 for Jenna 5 and we're
currently right here that's plugged in
20 years this feels like it's 2018 that
this should be later because it's 2019
anyway does this necessarily mean that
next-gen motherboards will have PCI
agent 5 on them know like finalizing the
spec and then having hardware based on
it there's there's generally a decent
amount of gap okay so they just did that
for 5.0 and we're probably still a year
two out from having 5.0 based we might
see some stuff in 2020 right it's hard
to say I could see Intel trying to jump
on 5.0 to be like look you know you need
one of the graphic rising 3,000 serious
things of a sport point out we have 5.0
port before any 5.0 devices are
available yes
another reason for them to update the
standard is that other major
interconnect standards are built off of
PCI Express such as CCI X and Intel CX l
Gen 6 will remain backwards compatible
with all the other generations so that's
kind of nice you can still drop a Gen 1
device into a Gen 6 slot once it comes
out but and the article goes into much
more detail on this so I encourage you
to read it if you were interested
they're actually going to be doing a
pretty amount of drastic change under
the hood for how they actually handle
the signaling because the something
they've been doing going from gen 3 to
Gen 4 is they have to have really
specific short trace lengths so that
they can tighten the signal requirements
in order to go from what they are now to
Gen 5 and then Gen 6 they're gonna
switch from nrz or non-return-to-zero
technology that's been used since PCI
Express was introduced and they're going
to pulse amplitude modulation four or
pam-4 as you kind of see here the
comparison nrz basically it can carry a
it's got two States it can carry a 0 or
1 pulse amplitude modulation allows it
to carry up to four states so that's
cool it doubles the number of electrical
States a single transmission can hold so
rather than that
zero-one high-low signaling uses the
four signal levels and so that can
encode four possible to bit patterns and
that will be how they they wedge more
data into the same slot and the same
configuration because you know I guess
they're not anticipating any drastic
change from typical motherboard layouts
with px and spacing between the CPU and
all that nice cool but so good to know
that's in the works imagine just imagine
the s is that like crazy SSD that you
get that would go 128 gigabytes a second
that's probably maybe next year's see
that's that's that's the maximum
theoretical bandwidth so it would
probably go more like from 100 gigabytes
a second not much that there's a measly
little bit 100 gigs account for some
overhead everything 16 K yeah 16 K
anything 32k alright another bit of news
here this is kind of sad news I'm hoping
that this isn't significantly impactful
now they're an antique article here but
Toshiba and WD had a power outage that's
their shared NAND facility now I'm not
alright well let's let's talk about the
suck about what happened first and
Toshiba and WD have they just disclosed
on Friday then back on June 15 so we're
talking three weeks or so ago there was
a power outage of these shared
facilities production at facilities has
been partially halted as of like now
they're expecting to resume operations
by mid July it was a 13 minute power
outage so just 13 minutes and an
impactor impacted wafers that were
processed and impacted the facilities
and an impact impacted their production
equipment the incident will reduce their
NAND flash wafer supply in q3 by
approximately six exabytes of data which
is believed to be about half of the
company's quarterly supply of NAND so a
13 minute power outage and half of their
supply for a quarter just gone
what 13 13 minutes and this
is a significant the facility for Nant
production the where is it
and it's in the Yochai you'll watch I
yo-yo Chi Ichi probably oka Ichi
why aren't I using a UPS yeah that's not
gonna be Mike that like the yoga eat
your province in Japan know this by now
is where this is located the yoga Ichi
Operations campus which is jointly run
by Toshiba and WD produces 35 percent of
global man output in terms of revenue
yeah five production facilities there
and as well as an R&amp;amp;D center doesn't
mean storage prices are going to
skyrocket this is what we're kind of
concerned about we're not really sure
the article speculates that maybe but
hopefully not but you know this could
also be one of those things where I go
no we have to raise the prices of our
products oh darn
aw shucks too bad that's the only way we
can skirt around this yeah sorry our
hands are tied
fifteen twenty percent it's an aerial
are you out of the facility there but
yeah I mean like like you mentioned Kyle
you think they have a UPS or something
like backup generators right sort of a
fail-safe triple redundant thing to make
sure you think we're done didn't see we
doing and just go out look at a
no-brainer 4wd and and Toshiba yeah look
how is the house is possible should have
rate end rate end that freaking power
setup like like a boss but that's how it
works
there's how this so taking half half of
their name product production for which
is six exabytes that's from Toshiba by
the way that doesn't include WD so when
you include WD they say it could be as
high as nine exabytes total data loss as
far as what would have been produced
otherwise combine that together is
consider that it accounts for 35% of
global nan production and we're looking
at 1/6 or 16.5 percent of global nan
supply in q3 not being there
so like the article said like we've seen
in the past with commodities in the PC
industry this has the potential to be
used as a reason and could be completely
legitimate or it could just be used as a
reason to inflate prices I try not
speculate too much tinfoil hat
inconsiderate there here we come but
let's just say if you see a good price
on an SSD right now maybe you should
pull that trigger maybe you should buy
it rather than waiting for for Black
Friday yeah again don't take my advice
for anything like that but you know I
wonder if someone just like tripped on a
power cord yeah it's like oops
just like in the cafeteria like what
their food tray yeah well or it could
just be all conspiracy I think it's a
conspiracy I think so alright one more
news story here that is from oh oh oh
wow oh my god oh my god well oh geez all
right well thank you honey
this look at this way to beasts I feel
like I'm a Greek scholar here too
artichoke that is a seared frigging
artichoke this is only behind super this
is like on a pewter slab or something
like yeah well this I'm even know we had
this we want plates
okay give me a plate yes every to do
them oh wow I love that thank you for
the oh my god
okay she scooped out the the horny part
the spiky part horny what horny is
trouble with spiky was the word as hmm I
mean it makes me morning what kind of
chokes urine to but that's funny I know
like we were talking about her jokes a
day or two ago and yeah that I was like
we should make artichokes your - you
were just casually talking about
artichokes like that was a yeah topic
this you're watching them not a food
stuff cuz cuz Diana's been watching a
lot of YouTube because she sitting with
the baby a lot yeah get her started
yummy way food videos I'm getting
distracted listen back to this sorry I
gotta try this I know I want to finish
talking so I can eat that alright so if
you guys remember so renamed
they're announcements about Navi and
stuff and they should showed some demos
on stage one of the things they showed
was a PCIe 4.0 bandwidth test that was
rather than five 3dmark that actually is
not available to people at the time that
they showed the tests but it is
available now so 3dmark is now released
this test it is called the 3dmark pci
express feature test this is what it
looks like
although honestly you guys are probably
seeing something that's very pixelated
and stuff that's kind of interesting and
fancy we this is testing the bandwidth
available to your GPU over your
computer's PCI Express interface which
means that if you use it in a way that
AMD used it which is to compare a PCI
Express gen3 card to a PCI Express Gen 4
card like their Navi cards are that you
will be like wow yes there's much better
there's a lot of bandwidth things that
doesn't necessarily immediately mean
that cards are gonna perform in that
same range which is why a lot of people
criticize them for including that test
right they weren't necessarily false in
any of the things they said about it but
you can you could possibly point to it
being perhaps displayed in it in a
somewhat disingenuous way yes especially
for people who didn't quite understand
what it was doing it's very extreme
scenario this test aims to make bed with
the limiting factor in the test by
uploading a large amount of vertex and
texture data to the GPU for each frame
the results of the test is the average
bandwidth achieved currently available
in 3dmark Advanced Edition and 3 mark
professional excuse me professional
Edition and there's a sale going along
with it
until July 9th 3dmark advanced edition
is 85 percent off 4 dollars and 49 cents
from Steam or you can go directly to the
UL benchmarks website
do you have advanced edition yeah at
least I don't know about you you got a
upgrade if you wanna do like x by
extreme and stuff like that
hey I'm gonna pay up you shit yeah that
is a good deal if she applied you that
might be good for your Navi testing you
can do this PCI Express
well no no bandwidth and that's good
yeah compare it to a 20 atti and be like
look how much better
that's a 57 X didn't real-world
performance compared to this 2080 yeah
all right yay for news we're gonna do a
quick sword fight segment now we're
gonna switch to Kyle's half which is
basically gonna be us playing games yeah
looking forward to it
sword fight though sorry fight have been
a little while Kyle and I are going to
take up opposing sides but betwixt and
arguments and the sword fight today is
going to be surrounding the NVIDIA super
GPU launch we since the questions are
quite similar to each other are going to
look at both of the questions first and
then we will debate and then we will
debate about them right sure pretty
straight I'm a master debater yes yes
I'm not only I'm wicked these in chat
right now believe cells also sell yes is
also there thank you very much stuff for
you Lincoln those chairs first question
so the launch in general we've now we've
had our day 1 reviews I'm sure you've
watched all the videos and read all the
reviews cap yes
what's the assessments of this launch
2060 super and 2070 super is a good
lunch is it a bad lunch we're going to
decide that so those are the two options
right there we're not gonna argue quite
yet okay like I said trying to move to
this yep with some efficiency so your
question to the second question which
also Lincoln Chad right now wait hold on
you know Travis man so good I know just
got a talking stuff hmm oops
oh so the super GPU name mm-hmm RTX 2060
super and 2070 slipper and the aesthetic
choices combo question mm-hmm you could
are bad on those because I believe you
can have differing opinions on both of
these questions yeah
because as we've already kind of shown
you that's why a 60 super right here by
the wedding
speaking of those super cards this
stream is being powered by the 2070
super and I've sure cattle installed it
in the system down here that we're
streaming from that I did stuff words
been fine I know right great it's funny
that not go kart the car that was just
in there before that we've been using
for a long time was the Radeon seven
know any people get gamers mech sisters
Steve's video is that something about
like the super cards like killing Radeon
seven it's just kind of funny that yeah
that I just had just so happened to swap
that card out for a first you cuz life
imitates art it does that's that's what
I always say so my assessment of that
anyway that's only sixty super if you
guys haven't seen the close ups that you
might be seeing the reflection right now
they this design is extremely similar to
the 2060 in 2070 but they this middle
part here is now a reflective glass or
polished chrome it's it's like a mirror
finish basically a mirror and they laced
yeah it's exactly that's super
reflective then they took the word super
and put it after the 2060 in green and
in green with a bit of a bevel or an
embossed or daenam edenia I have figured
what that's called stamp looking the
stampton yes it's it's recessed there
yeah those are the aesthetics and then
the name I thought it was interesting
that in the past they've had like it
they've had a twenty eighty and then the
28t I mmm-hmm they've done that before
they had the twenty seven here that the
ten seventy that was up for a while and
then they got bored no we need to launch
new graphics card we don't need to
there's no competition it's just do 2010
72 yeah ten seventy TI better version of
the 1070 so right you could you know you
could say that that was that they they
serve similar functions when it comes to
the naming scheme anyway locale
do you launch good or bad what do you
think I'm gonna play what I think would
be devil's advocate here and say that
it's good better GPU same price and and
actually I do think there's some weight
to this because what we're I while I
very much see another person's point
that would say this this really screws
over the people who originally bought
you know in RTX 2070 2080 and now
they're just kind of doing this like
switcher
at the same time you would have had to
wait over like about a year you know one
of these cards was initially launched
like last year right so Union architects
the r-tx cards you less than a year but
still several several months in order to
get this deal so so at Gamescom I went
to get games come yeah that's right so
technically if it's an early adopters
type of privilege if you want something
if you want to do technology sooner than
everyone else you tend to pay a premium
for it and this this is a well known
trait of the industry and most people
can you know accept this this fact so
yeah well I think that there's some
argument for for the other side says the
student been the landscape initially I
also see you know the value and paying a
little bit more for something
immediately for something now instead of
waiting later for it to go on sale even
if it's branded under a different name
okay you're wrong okay first off Nvidia
they're much dicks because obviously
like there's no no changes to the
manufacturing process of the
architecture here with these new
versions of the cards so clearly the
original deep use that they launched
from the r-tx series last year they GIMP
them intentionally you know they made
them crappier than they shouldn't be it
should have been and anyone who's bought
any of those cards in the interim unless
you bought a 28 yet that's fine
those are the smart people the ones who
went and spent over $1,000 no graphics
great then obviously it's kicking the
balls
it's a slap in the ass it's pulling the
hair and generally it was getting kind
of kinky but what men they should get
around their customers just no nice to
them so what we should have had was
these cars it's launched a year ago a
little less than a year ago and
then they have no need to launch them
again right now and call them super this
is a stupid name that I'm getting I'm
moving under the next question so that's
my point
I definitely don't agree with anything
you said I'll stand by stand by my
argument let's see people say wow people
say as people very blurred wow that is
like literally within technically I
wouldn't buy two votes three votes of
each other 40 40 but yeah that's really
polarizing huh
holy moly that's interesting so and
twenty percent of people are willing to
go broke for the 28th eti super super
duper well that's gonna be $5,000 car I
mean 80s super duper is gonna be just
it's gonna be a horn Hornswoggle II it's
gonna be a real real a real it's gonna
be an amazing product I say it will be
good hi session a man decided choices
you have first on the first one so I'm
gonna um yeah pardon me guys I'm gonna
try to finish that's great before I talk
too much because people in chat were
getting offended talking with my mouth
full
all right he's on your low I'm gonna say
about the name in the aesthetic choices
okay they're both stupid yep no no girl
it's confusing if you've watched any of
the reviews on this the number of times
the reviewers have to say the word super
over and over again because the name is
so similar to the 2017 it you can't just
say RPX 2017 mr used to be some you know
the names of graphics cards are absurdly
long as it is the full name of this
graphics card is the nvidia geforce r-tx
2060 super bitch is that's like six
words yeah just wait we just way too
many words NVIDIA GeForce RT 2060 super
that's five words but one of those
numbers which counts more so the it's
it's just it's just confusing for people
and it also feels really like tacked on
like another another thing that Steve
mentioned in his article was he tried to
talk to Nvidia and ask their where'd
that Aenon came from and nobody could
nobody to tell him nobody which I think
that means it was Jenson's idea yeah
right I think that yeah that's what it
means
sure which means I'm cause like if he
ever sees this video he's bragging it
mad and that I'm gonna be cut off from a
video now Oh No so never mind I love the
name it's great he said it he were just
at my house but he fun speak on his
behalf
his words were his own sorry Jennsen
that's true RTX is technically three
words because it stands hard t x-ray
trace tracing extreme extreme say that
just works okay I'm gonna say that super
is good you know okay so here's a thing
the name super isn't great the way the
card looks the shininess and the logo
isn't great but at the end of the day
they don't have to be they don't have to
be great the name can suck the little
logo can suck at the end of the day
you're getting a product that performs a
certain amount for a certain cost a
certain price and if those two variables
work for you everything else should be
irrelevant
okay we're getting too wrapped up in the
cosmetics of things this is why
manufacturers keep cramming RGB into
every single product possible because
everyone just focuses so much on the
aesthetics of a product without giving
any attention to actually how it
performs or what a good value it might
be or might not be so I feel like at the
other day you know everyone has their
preference everyone's got an opinion
about this sort of thing but if you just
look at the actual hardware the
technology and and the pricing pricing
points for each of these cards I feel
like that's a very secondary petty thing
to really focus on so I'm gonna say that
and I think it does make sense something
that is super if you have X and you have
X super very obvious there's nothing
confusing about the fact that this cards
a little better are you okay
clearly as looking at my fingers and has
about to tell you that there might be
some greasy fingerprints about 20 60
super wifey phase in this garlic she put
garlic in it that is like cheating
you know that's double-double cheating
it's amazing okay alright that was my
argument probably know Lee's hey so
doesn't maybe mess up in my PC segment
yeah that's super true great good point
there we're good we're both liars never
listen to me
alright results bad bad Wow even even
good didn't even beat the on the French
people who didn't even want to make a
decision
holy crap which I could have steam
coming you know I think the the worst
part about it for me is that the
reflectivities is a fingerprint magnet
that reflects a piece in the middle yeah
and as a reviewer it's terrible for
b-roll like I was trying to get like a
shot of it I was like oh my god every
time any angle your ad there's something
in the back of a the your in the angle
or it's reflecting like the crap that's
let's yeah and you're set the right
horrible versus the set which which is
you've cleaned 10 minutes and it would
have been a little bit better had it
been a bit more like diffused reflection
like a bit smoky or foggy so it's not
like that pure it's like a mirror they
literally stat staple the mirror onto
the card which i think is just it seems
like an afterthought and honestly the
the word super seems like an
afterthought
so which makes sense because they just
sort of rushed this in response to AMD
it's not like they've been thinking
about this and really plotting it out
and giving good on his thought to it for
a long time all right well I hope this
information and discussion has been
super helpful for you guys
we're super stoked that you joined us
today for my half of Awesome hardware
we're going to end this half on youtube
if you're watching on twitch stick
around we still get more coming at you
mm-hmm and if you're watching on YouTube
check them excuse me the video
