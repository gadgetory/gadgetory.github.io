excellent welcome to today's video
everyone if you're watching this it
means intel has launched or at least
formally announced skylake aka Intel's
6th generation Core processor line which
we will now just call skylake because I
prefer fewer syllables this is a core i7
6700 K being held covetously by my
little msi dragon here and there's going
to be a ton of reviews benchmarks and
other content out there surrounding this
launch but I wanted to start with a
quick and simple first 5 video to give
you guys a better idea of the skylight
Hilux this guy like highlights Hilux Joe
Egan the first thing that you need to
know about skylake is that you will need
new hardware if you're upgrading at the
very least you will need a new socket
LGA 1151 motherboard as older socket
1150 and prior motherboards won't work
with the new processors I would
recommend a motherboard like this MSI is
z170a gaming m7 with the z170 chipset
since that unlocks overclocking 4k
Series CPUs like the 6700 K and 6600 K
but
there are other hundred series chipsets
like the H 170 out there if you're on a
budget
you'll also need ddr4 memories since
skylake supports dual-channel ddr2 but
apart from that you can probably upgrade
an existing system with a CPU
motherboard and new memory alone the
only other concern might be your power
supply which needs to meet the power
supplier requirements that were set out
when Haswell launched which most do but
some don't so double check the second
thing you will need to know is a bit
more about the memory situation skylake
supports dual channel memory for both
ddr4 and ddr3l that doesn't mean you can
pick up either one though as it will be
up to the motherboard manufacturer to
provide connections for ddr4 ddr3l or in
rare situations both let's just say that
you're basically going to need ddr4
memory like this g.skill ripjaws v kit a
new design by the way I'm liking the
look because pretty much every z170
board I've seen uses ddr4 only and for
desktop systems that will be the norm it
wouldn't even matter if you got a board
with ddr3 ll support though because note
the L in ddr3l it's not the same as the
ddr3 that you've been using for the past
however many years so saving some money
by moving ddr3 over the skylake just
won't work there's a slim bit of a
chance that some motherboard
manufacturers might shoehorn in standard
ddr3 support but for now just plan on
getting ddr4 a couple other memory notes
XMP 2.0 is now supported which is cool
just bear in mind that XMP 1.3 profiles
might not work so if you're using
slightly older ddr4 from haswell-e
system you might need to dial in your
speeds and timings manually also you can
now overclock memory in 100 and 133
megahertz increments as opposed to the
two hundred and two hundred and sixty
six megahertz increments that were
available before the third thing you
need to know is that these new case cue
CPUs the 6700 K which is a quad-core
with hyper-threading and the 6600 K
which is a quad core without hyper
threading sounds familiar right don't
come with stock heatsink fans anymore
just like the haswell-e enthusiast
processors hooray well kind of hooray
come to think of it apart from Intel
saving on some bomb costs and shipping
weight this doesn't really do us much
good apart from having one fewer stock
heatsink fans lying around collecting
dust
maybe that appeals to you but I will
also point out that the CPU socket
layout again
has not changed so any CPU cooler you
already have its LGA 1156 1155 1150 or
1151 compatible will still work and that
is kind of nice
Ln the boxes are fancy and more colorful
now to the fourth thing you need to know
is actually a small grouping of things
related to overclocking hooray for
overclocking okay so the fiber fully
integrated voltage regulation that was
part of the CPU die for Haswell and
Devil's Canyon CPUs has been moved back
off of the die this means that
motherboards control the voltage
regulation again which means higher-end
motherboards might actually overclock
better again and this will also
hopefully keep the CPU temperatures down
comparatively intel is continuing to use
their next-generation polymer thermal
interface material on skylake that's the
same Tim that they used on Devil's
Canyon which is also good news for
overclocking you also get granular
control of the BC LK or base clock
meaning you can ramp it up 1 megahertz
at a time instead of using the preset
straps that were available previously
like 100 125 etc to do this they've
actually isolated the peg and EMI area
from the base clock which I'm sure my
slightly out of focus slides are doing a
great job of demonstrating here
oh also the CPU core ratio can now go up
to 83
that's as compared to 80 with doubles
Canyon so I expect all of you to be
overclocking your 6700 k's the 8.3
gigahertz okay and the fifth thing you
need to know is that there's more IO now
up to 40% more depending on your
motherboard as there are now up to 20
PCIe lanes available off the PCH the PCH
is the peripheral controller hub that's
part of the chipset which connects up
stuff like storage by the way this means
that you can connect more drives you can
have access to multiple m2 slots for
example or Santa express ports and you
won't disable one thing by plugging in
another well ok you can still disable
one thing by plugging in another and
there is going to be some confusion
around what all can be connected at the
same time with full bandwidth available
but that will vary greatly from
motherboard to motherboard because
there's just lots of weights ways to
implement that connectivity remember
that these lanes are for the PCH not for
GPUs or other expansion cards you still
just have 16 PCI Express gen3 lanes
natively on the CPU for that I think
this was to allow for more storage and
i/o connectivity without starting the
6700 K to compete
to 5820k we can discuss that more in a
different video though finally there's
talk of Thunderbolt 3 support with this
new hardware providing 40 gigabits per
second of bandwidth and allowing you to
support Thunderbolt USB 3.1 DisplayPort
and Power all via a single USB type-c
connector that's pretty freaking cool
and that is all five things there's
still a lot more to talk about with
skylake though such as how does it
overclock I have an overclocking video
coming out very very soon the question
is how much faster is it then say fourth
or fifth generation Intel CPUs answer
would be about 10 to 20 percent
depending on what you're doing
how about comparing it to X 99 and
haswell-e well those six core enthusiast
CPUs are still going to be faster but
skylake does have an advantage in
instructions per clock meaning it might
get better comport better performance
and games are apps that can only use up
to 4 CPU cores but that's all stuff for
upcoming videos I want to hear from my
early adopters out there though who has
heard enough already
and will be diving headfirst into the
cool blue waters of sky Lake ASAP and if
you did dive into a lake in the sky
could you accidentally swim through the
bottom of it and then fall to a grisly
death these are the questions that not
me anyway though let me know in the
comment section down below do me a huge
solid and hit that like button but only
if you actually liked the video of
course share this video too if you know
anyone who might like it check out my
store and support my wide range of
personal vices by buying a shirt mug or
pipe blasts subscribe to my channel if
you haven't already for more tech videos
coming very soon and as always thank you
for watching
