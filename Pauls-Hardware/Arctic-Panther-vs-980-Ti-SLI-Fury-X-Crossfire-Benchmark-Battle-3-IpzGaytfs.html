nice
I wager that means someone's gonna die
the yard must always do
so I'm guessing that you guys probably
weren't expecting that but I could think
of no introduction more fitting for this
video the arctic Panthers trial by a
fire that's right
let me get one more arctic Panther roar
for the folks at home for that we're
gonna minimize the sound effects for
this video's duration so many moons ago
I embarked upon a long and arduous
journey the making of this meticulously
customized gaming computer though my
path was fraught with missteps and
frustrations and looking at you here
power supply sleeving I was fortunate
enough to have helped along the way J of
Jays two cents I owe particular thanks
to for teaching me to mend them tubes he
also lent me one of his fury X's and
also crucial modding guidance was
provided by Lee from PC junkie mods and
Bill from M NPC Tech the entire build
process is thoroughly documented via
videos on my channel though so check out
the description below for a link to that
playlist as well as links to Jay's Lee's
and Bill's channels and websites and
links to the parts for this builds and
also the like button is down there it
works by clicking on it if you liked the
video after several months Lee build
finally came together powered by an
Intel 59 60 X overclocked to 4.5
gigahertz at one point to 2 volts 32
gigabytes of g.skill ripjaws ddr4 memory
at 2666
and 2 gigabyte gtx 980 gaming g1
graphics cards now fully outfitted with
liquid cooling from ek water blocks my
next step after getting windows all
installed was to dial in my overclocks
and synthesis since the cpu was already
handled I turned my attention to the
GPUs I will spare you the gritty details
here but after some finagling and by
adding just a smidge of extra voltage I
settled on an OC of 1545 megahertz for
both gtx 980 GPU cores and 1804 the
gddr5 memory since I'm looking for
overclocks I can run all the time I
didn't want to push too much higher and
I also wanted to make sure that my
temperatures
hands beads didn't creep up too high
here is a listen to the system with the
quiet fan profile enabled and bear in
mind that speeds for all six of my
fractal venturi HP twelve fans are
regulated by the CPU temperature since
they're all routed through the divine
r5s fan hub here is the system at idle
and here's a listen under typical gaming
load
not too shabby at all and definitely
whisper quiet when you consider the
caliber of hardware inside across all of
my testing the hottest any cpu core got
was 71 C with average load temps around
60 the GPUs ran even cooler maxing at 59
see with normal temperatures in the 50
to 55 degrees range so as I have been
alluding to for quite a while now
eventually I had no choice I had to
benchmark the arctic panther to
determine just how good the gaming
performance is but I had a problem that
old bitter lesson that I learned so well
back when I first built my own computer
when the world was still young that is
that there's always newer and faster
components just on the horizon and
indeed while my nine eighties were the
fastest GPUs available when I got them
back in February both Nvidia and AMD has
since eclipsed them with the release of
the 980ti
and the fury x respectively and so it
comes down to this I will not only be
showing you the performance of the
arctic panther at 1080 1440 and 4k
resolutions but also side-by-side
performance of its greatest nemesis even
nemec's MSE sees the the gtx 980ti and
two-way SLI
and the AMD r9 fury X into a crossfire
let's get it on the 980 TI Zen Theory
X's we're benchmarked on my standard
haswell-e testbed with an EEG a x99
classified motherboard Intel 59 30 kcq
at 4.40 Hertz and 16 gigs of DC I'll rip
jaws for ddr4 memory at 26 66 and a
HyperX savage 2048 SSD the comparison
cards were running out there out of the
box feeds from the manufacturer which is
eleven hundred megahertz for our fury
X's and a maximum of 1265 megahertz for
the 980ti s which were synced with this
EVGA superclocked card 3dmark should
give us an immediate idea of where the
cards stand and immediately it's
apparent that the Arctic Panther will be
fighting an uphill battle there's just
no way the higher core clock speed can
make up for the additional stream
processors and CUDA cores in the other
cards so ap claws its way to a
respectively close third behind the
980ti s and the fury exits BioShock
Infinite reveals more of the same I will
point out the low minimum frame rate for
the fury X is here though as they did
encounter some stuttering team red does
pull out an average framerate win at 4k
though and the panther binds its time
and
third place once again waiting for the
right time to strike I have to assume
Metro last light has always been
troublesome in multi-gpu configs and the
fury X has continued to turn up some
stuttering problems that resulted in
very low minimum frame rates I will note
this that a single fury X did not have
this problem with these tests and I
think we're hitting a CPU limitation at
nad here which evened up the score for
the Nvidia cards Crysis 3 remains one of
the most graphically intense games to
play especially at 4k and if you're
playing at 4k do yourself a favor and
turn off msaa
I didn't because I'm a sadist or
something the 980ti still wins though
except for the upset that the fury X is
pulled at 1440 resolution battlefield 4
has a 200 frames per second limit just
so you know but I want to point out that
all of these configurations hit over 70
frames per second with a 45 FPS minimum
at 4k which is damn nice and that's with
anti-aliasing turned on
GTA 5 was pretty finicky with the
Prospera configurations so we got some
pretty low framerate dips on the fury
x's and performance didn't line up with
expectations single fury x didn't show
those problems so again I think this is
a crossfire support issue and yeah the
980ti is one again well that's all the
benchmarks guys and I'm gonna do my best
to turn lemons into lemonade here since
my beautiful custom build got outpaced
in pretty much every test what have we
learned everyone well I've often said
that I don't think it's worth water
cooling graphics cards unless they're
already the best of the best and I think
this supports that claim even with no
substantial overclock on my 980 T is and
believe me they have a lot of headroom
still they're relatively exorbitant
amount of money spent on the water
cooling loop wasn't enough to help the
extremely overclocked 980 s an arctic
panther catch up considering that it's
about a hundred and fifty dollars more
for a 980 TI or fury x over a 980 and
that's about the amount you'd spend on
an ice water block and back plate from
the 980 to say nothing of the rest of
the components in the custom loop you're
almost never going to be able to push a
lesser card to outperform a higher-end
card just with cooling and overclocking
I also want to mention power draw
briefly the fury X's are more efficient
than the last generation of AMD GPUs but
still pulled the most wattage peaking at
about seven hundred and seventy five
watts
the 980ti configuration pulled about 100
watts left less maxing at 675 for the
whole system and my overclocked and
fully outfitted arctic panther
bill pulled just 5 or 10 watts less than
the 980ti s but bear in mind that it has
all those fans and extra drives and all
that good stuff in there too
versus the testbeds which were pretty
minimal another lesson i relearned here
is one that i mentioned earlier and
that's the lesson of the rapid product
life cycle in the pc hardware and
electronics space there's just no
solution for this one but I find that
being mentally prepared does help
anything you buy will be supplanted by
something newer shinier faster and maybe
even less expensive and probably in the
very near future
now that we've accepted this we can move
on so what do you guys think of this
whole endeavor now that you've actually
seen some performance numbers it was all
of my time and effort worth it I think
yes because thinking the alternative
might drive me to the edge of insanity
but let me know what you guys think in
the comments section down below should I
remain calm and restful and happy with
my system or should I obsess over
upgrading the GPUs ASAP so that I can
have the fastest system possible hit the
