video for January 2016 basically how
this works is every month I create a
couple PC parts lists these are all
based on your votes in your feedback so
this month based on last month's straw
poll that I did in in December I'm gonna
be building a Haswell or LGA 1155 system
these were the votes it was very close
we also had PC gaming and streaming
systems and several of the other ones
like that so thank you to all of you
guys who went and voted in that and I do
have another straw poll for February so
let me go ahead and post that in live
chat right now by the way I'm streaming
this live as well as uploading it to
YouTube later so thanks to all you guys
who are jumping in and viewing this live
it's very impromptu I don't really have
a schedule for these when I record them
live but I like recording them live
anyway but for next month's if you want
to see me do other types of builds in
February I included quite a few from
last month because I thought there were
some good ones PC gaming streaming
farewell to am3+ build budget skylake
with an 1151 pentium cpu or maybe even
one of those ones that you can now
overclock with the bc ok or maybe a
silent passively cool HTC P I think
their HT HT PC I think all of those
would be fairly exciting so for this
month I'm doing an LGA 1150 build that's
a little bit older LGA 1150 is not the
current most most up-to-date generation
socket from Intel there's currently
skylake which is LGA 1151 so what we're
doing here is delving into just the
recent past in order to make things
hopefully a little bit more
budget-friendly and since I was also
doing a second build this month based
around this process right here which is
Intel's G 32:58 dual-core overclockable
Pentium anniversary edition actually
both of these systems are going to be
LGA 1150 so go back a month or two if
you want to see some skylake builds I've
already done a few of those the first
one is going to be a gaming system based
on your request that's going to be about
eight hundred dollar price point second
one that I've put together it's going to
be about a four hundred dollar price
point with the G 32:58
it's a little expensive for a G 32:58
but I'm actually gonna be building this
system for my parents next week I'm
going to be updating their extremely old
and slow computer that they're
using right now updating them to an SSD
and all that good stuff and I will be
doing a video on that so subscribe to my
channel if you want to see that when
it's out a few quick notes before we
dive into the first builds parts list
one is that the cost I'm listing is just
for the system and the hardware this
does not include monitor roll monitor
monitor or peripherals unless I say
otherwise also does not include an
operating system although kinguin is a
great place to do that and you can get
Windows 10 for like 20 to 40 bucks
depending on whether you go am or not I
also am going to be using PC part picker
because it makes for easy PC parts
shopping they also have compatible
compatibility filters and all that good
stuff and links to these builds are
going to be in the description below on
YouTube sorry to guys watching live I
don't have them ready for you quite yet
there's also going to be a strawpoll
link to this February voting so you guys
can go and vote on that and let me know
what you want to see I'm zooming in on
the chat instead of this over here yeah
that's better all right you can tell me
what you want to see in February okay
let's dive right into the first build
that's this one right here
PC part picture so this is about an $800
bang for the buck LGA 1150 PC and I'll
be honest I don't usually build with
with older hardware like this we're
hitting sort of a weird sort of
transition point when it comes to all
the the Haswell stuff which is that the
motherboards are starting to already get
harder to find you need a z87 or z97
motherboard if you want at least an
overclockable Intel Haswell chip for
this particular build I went to 4690k
and then the other thing I did since
this is supposed to be a bang for the
buck system is that I did include or I'm
at least gonna reference quite a bit for
mail-in rebates because mail-in rebates
are a great way to really save on a
system you just have to be able to do
that front cost and then be diligent
about well first testing your build and
then turning in the retail rebates like
right away
alright so our first product is gonna be
of course the 4690k I kind of had a few
other options here there's of course the
lesser I fives that are available but
they're not overclockable
there's also the Xeon 1233 v3 or
whatever it is that you can also drop in
here which is a quad core which you can
get for about two hundred and twenty
dollars now this one if you want a
really good
at 220 bucks you can get it for in-store
pickup at Micro Center chances are if
you're buying this online though you're
gonna be paying about 230 to 240 dollars
bear in mind that a 6600 que is going
for about 25 to 35 dollars more than
that so that's the price cut you're
getting by going with a older process
around here and when it comes to
strictly to gaming you're not gonna see
much of a performance boost by going
with skylake the main reason why you
might go is skylake over this is just
for the newer technology that's
available the newer motherboards stuff
like nvme supports faster m2 connections
and that kind of thing anyway though so
I stuck with the 4690k and that's what
the rest of the build is based around
and you'll see down here at the bottom
my total price came out to show you guys
total price came up that's a little over
$800 but that's not including mail-in
rebate so for instance if we look at the
hyper 212 Evo which I chose which is
kind of just kind of the default you can
get it first cheapest 25 bucks with a
$10 million rebate or about 30 if you're
just buying it straight it straight up
the motherboard is the asrock is a 97
extreme 3 this is a lower-end z97
motherboard but again here's we're
running into some difficulties with
actually finding compatible motherboards
for z97 they stock at retailers like
Newegg that sell new product is getting
smaller and smaller and usually with PC
hardware there's a transition stock will
start to drop off as parts get to say a
year to two old depending on what part
you're talking about and then I'll have
these secondary retailers who still have
new product but they grossly over prices
so for instance I was looking at 4770k s
as a possible option for this those are
all selling at retail for like four
hundred and twenty plus dollars which is
absurd don't buy a 4770k for that when
you can get a 6700 K which is two years
newer for cheaper anyway you can still
get $100 ish motherboards own z97 this
is a pretty decent little offering from
asrock it's blue and black overall color
scheme is always the first to go when it
comes to budget builds but this one
again has a $20 million rebate so even
though the price listed on the parts
list is a hundred you can actually get
it for 80 if you include that mail-in
rebate so bear that in mind
remember I just went with this very
simple Corsair Vengeance kits
again a sex go out the window here but
this is a great little kit I've actually
used this kit many times in different
varieties it's low profile it's black it
blends in the green PCB doesn't stand
out at all once it's slotted in and $35
for eight gigs and I don't care that at
1600 speed that's not gonna affect
anything okay for the next thing we have
our video card and for that I went with
AMD this is a power color PCs plus
Radeon r9 380 very powerful GPU a little
bit more power hungry but we have plenty
of power for that and 185 with again a
$20 ml and rebates so you can get it
down to 165 so again if you're if you're
looking to bang for the buck you know em
wait yeah sorry wrong there don't click
if you're gonna bang for the buck and
you lookin all these prices I have
listed here most of these are a lot of
these have mail-in rebate so you can get
it for even less than the 810 you see
here probably 750 even in a low 700 s if
you were to be diligent and redeem all
those for a solid-state driving with the
adata premier SP 5 50 60 bucks for 250
240 gig SSD is kind of like the price
point I'm going for right now 65 ish as
well there's other ones down in that
range this is the cheapest one that's
available straight up on Amazon right
now and it's an SP 550 and it will do
everything for SATA 3 drives sure you
can compare it to like a 850 Pro from
Samsung or something which is like a
little bit faster but by and large it's
gonna be plenty for you I also included
a 2 terabyte hard drive here this is the
fame tataki desk star that got really
well reviewed in the oh shoot I'm
forgetting the name of the place right
now but the place it does a bunch of
consumer hard drives in an enterprise
environments and these have been shown
to have very good lifespan as it goes 2
terabytes $70 still a little bit more
expensive than I would have liked to
have spent but I'm also clicking on the
wrong things
ok that brings us to pretty much
everything except the case in the power
supply let's talk about the case in the
power supply this is a Rozsival galaxy -
0 3 it's black and it's $30 after a $10
mail in rebate card I hate the look of
this case I'm not gonna even you this
case looks disgusting I hate I hate it
it's just it's purely for functionality
here it's got USB 3.0 on the front it
actually comes with three fans installed
which is unique I was looking for I was
looking at one case fan or one fan cases
adding a second one but this one comes
with the 120 on top front and the back
$30 painted interior again it's hideous
it's just hideous but I but it really
gets the job done for 30 bucks so if if
you really don't like the look of that
case then spend a little bit more money
I guess and get something a little bit
nicer because if you want to spend 50
plus there's a lot of other options up
there but trying to keep the price down
bang for the buck all right use power
supply deep cool 550 watt 80 plus gold
certified I was planning on 80 plus
bronze and I spotted this at new egg
right now it's from deep cool I don't
know a lot of reviews on this but it's
80 plus gold rated and it's got to have
decent internals if it's got that $60
without even being discounted and look
at the cables it's not modular bear that
in mind but the cables are all black and
I was just like wow that's a really good
deal for a 550 watt power supply which
will run pretty much any single card GPU
configuration that you could throw at it
right now
and all black cabling and $60 and 80
plus gold I was like I got to use this
in fact I almost used it in the second
system I put together as well but I I
decided to go with my initial choice
there but anyway that's the deep cool DQ
550 s T 550 watt and again that entire
build all together is eight hundred and
ten dollars straight up if you buy it if
you buy all the stuff from Amazon and
Newegg and I guess super B's which is
also listed here or take advantage of
some of those mail-in rebates things you
probably chopped a good 80 200 dollars
off of the total price once you get that
money back so hey I was pretty happy
with that little build there all right
let's move on to my second build second
build again is a G 32 58 built on this
one I'm putting together for my parents
who are using a very outdated system
right now I don't even know exactly
what's in there I built it for them to
log go from here remember what's in it
but they've been complaining to me
recently that it's very slow I'm gonna
update it to something new something
much smaller something that also has an
SSD for a base and this processor which
is overclockable and I'm going to
overclock it too so that's kind of where
I started off was with was I knew I was
going to use the G 32:58 so again this
is a second LGA 1150 system that's kind
of the theme for the January builds I
suppose I came out to about 400 bucks
overall a little over 400 as listed here
but again bear in mind there
some mail and rebates and some other
things that aren't necessarily shown
there so the g32 58 you can get super
cheap 50 bucks if you want to walk into
a Micro Center but other than that it's
going to cost you 65 to 70 which is a
very good price for a little dual-core
processor especially if you take
advantage of the overclocking I went
with the hyper 212 again just because
I'm either lazy or it's just a very
effective and cheap cooler there are
some less expensive ones like the hyper
t2 that I've used recently but I'm
honestly for 30 bucks the mounting
mechanism you get for this and I really
want to try to push this g32 58 decently
hard to try to make it nice and snappy
for a motherboard I ran into again the
same issue that I was running in with
the prior build which is that when
you're looking at motherboards I was
originally gonna do a mini ITX system
here and there's really really slim
pickins for z97 boards they're just
getting at retail they're getting less
and less common so places like Newegg
the recommend Amazon the reputable
places just don't have as much stock
available which does mean that the ones
that are there are often like kind of
the the longer lifespan more budget
models but this is this is a gigabyte
z97 em ds3 H it is $90 it also has a $10
meal and rebates so you know you can get
some some money back there micro ATX I
like micro ATX instead of mini ITX I
figured well micro ATX isn't too bad
does give a little bit of expansion
options I'm not going to be doing a
graphics card in this build because they
don't really need it but my mom did
retire recently so I'm not going to rule
it out that maybe maybe I will throw in
a graphics card there like in the future
or something and see if I can get her to
play some games who knows
we'll see how bored she gets now that
she's retired anyway uh 90 bucks or 80
bucks I should say after the rebate for
this nice little board and it's black
and it matches pretty nicely ok going
over the rest of the parts I hit the
back button CPU cooler the motherboard
of course memory I spent a little bit
more on the memory on this it's still an
8 gig kit 2 by 4 gigs I just basically
got faster speed memory since they're
going to be using the integrated GPU
faster memory will improve the
performance of that so with 2400 speed
this is the cheapest 24 824
speed memory kit I could find from
g-scale $40 for 2400 speed like a tiny
that little picture is I'm sure you guys
get the general idea right anyway it's
the area series yeah and again I just I
used the PC part picker drill down stuff
for a 2 by 4 gig kit I chose the memory
speeds are a little bit faster like 1866
2400 2626 66 and then I just sorted by
price and I chose the among the cheapest
ones that were the fastest speed looked
the best and more from brands I had
heard of like G scale anyway for the SSD
I went with the exact same solid-state
drive from the build before again 60
bucks for 240 gig and I don't tend to
discriminate too much unless I'm
actually buying an SSD like this you
know specifically for use with I don't
know video editing or something then I
might look more closely at the actual
full eye ops and megabytes per second
but look pretty much any like decent SSD
is gonna be able to do up or 5 you know
above 500 megabytes megabytes per second
reads and writes and then 75,000 I ops
that's perfectly perfectly adequate
especially for a home system and then of
course we wanted 240 gigs of space
alright go back to my build my build go
I lost it ok finally we have a case in
power supply and again here was
something that I already have on hand
which is a cooler master Silencio 652
now the weird thing here is that you
might notice I punched this in directly
for $60 that is because the specific
version that I wanted which is the
version without the window which is the
one that I have on hand here is $60 at
Newegg $40 after a $20 mil and rebate
card very nice little case it's very
quiet comes with two fans that are also
very quiet so I felt this was worth
spending a little bit more on especially
since some it's fair the parents said I
want it to be quiet and I want it to
look pretty sleek in all and I didn't
want to give them some hideous rose wool
abomination case anyway so gold award
silence award from overclocked 3d that
net this is a this is solid little case
and and I like it and I will build a
mini ITX system in it one thing to point
out is that it does have two fans in
that case
and one thing I noted when I looked at
the motherboard was a motherboard only
has one fan header so I've also added
this little guy here it's not actually
in the parts list but this is on Newegg
it's $2.00 it's just a sleeved
for pin to splitter for fan header so
you can I can plug both of those case
fans in and for the silencio and
everything will work lastly it's a power
supply and here I also what's cooler
master one this one again I almost
swapped out for that deep cool one
because the deep cool one is at 80 plus
gold so who knows I may still do that
we'll see how things go
this one is a little bit cheaper for
like I buy about five bucks at Newegg if
you get it with the mail in rebate right
now but the reason why it's not listed
as cheap or as cheap on PC park picker
is because it's sold out here it's out
of stock at Newegg right now get
featured Soler's out of my face yeah so
anyway go with a deep cool one if this
one's not available for you but this
one's also pretty decent from
Coolermaster modular so that's nice as
well
modular is nicer for a smaller case I
guess I was more considering the ITX
possibility that when I first chose this
power supply but hey there you guys have
it my two builds again I'm gonna be
building the second one here the G 32:58
base system that will be for my parents
I'll be posting that on my channel here
very very soon thanks to all you guys
who have jumped into chat and said hello
one thing to point out here before I go
when it comes to the Haswell based
systems has well and has well refresh is
all of the overclocking on these
processors is much more associated with
the processors capability than the
motherboards capability so the high-end
overclocking motherboards that they have
for z87 and z97 will overclock just as
well as the lowest end ones unless
you're talking about like exotic cooling
and stuff like that that's not the case
for sky lakes guy like the the power
delivery has been moved back off of the
processor but it is nice if you're
looking to overclock a Haswell processor
and if you're looking to get something
like I've the builds I've done today
where you're trying to get a little bit
more bang for the buck and you can find
a bargain on slightly older parts is
even a lower end z87 or z97 motherboard
will still overclock a 4690
okay just as well so that's nice too
anyway guys that's all for this video
thank you all again for joining me don't
forget to vote for next month's builds
via the link down there stay tuned for
more videos coming up soon I have an ass
build with Logan that I have been
promising for quite a while I'm actually
going to finish that up also you can
check out my store start out pulse I'm
red i net for shirts mugs and glasses
