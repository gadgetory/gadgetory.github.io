hardware it is a rainy Saturday
afternoon in Southern California and I
figured what better thing to do right
now
let the build a computer so I got all my
parts here set up this is actually sort
of a special build it's for my cousin
and he just recently contacted me
because his current computer which is I
think about four or five years old got a
nasty virus and he's like I just don't
want to deal with it I'm going to start
from scratch so we're gonna do some
recovery for his current hard drive over
there try to pull his data off of it I'm
gonna build him a new machine right now
in just a few moments and I kind of
wanted to run over the parts for you
guys and I'm going to show you a bit of
the build process I it's just me filming
this whole thing so I'm not going to be
able to go through it step-by-step but
I'll show you guys the end result once
that is all taken care of but um let's
start off with the building a computer
or choosing the parts for a computer
because every time I do that I always
try to make each one kind of
purpose-built for the whoever it's being
built for him whatever they're going to
be using it for so what they need is
really a home system he worked from home
so he kind of has a home office there
it's mostly office type jobs he's going
to be working with but I wanted to build
him a machine that was solid that's
going to last a long time I want high
quality parts because I don't want
anything failing I don't want to have to
go over there to be doing fixing on this
computer and the feet in the future and
then of course I wanted it to be snappy
because he's moving up from like a four
five year old machine and when he uses
this one I want him to be like oh my
gosh this is night and day different so
uh here's a rundown of the parts let's
see I usually start off with a CPU oh
one other thing about this build they
don't really play many computer games so
this is sort of built to be a home
computer office computer but I want to
give them an upgrade path because they
might play video games they have some
kids they mostly play consoles but you
know I'm going to push them towards PC
gaming that's never a bad thing so
they'll have the option in the future to
add maybe one or two parts to this
specifically a video card because
you might notice there's no video card
right now and that will give them some
more Headroom in the future so I base it
on the Intel Core i3 3225 processor this
is a dual core processor but it does
have the intel HD 4000 graphics so kind
of the best of the Ivy Bridge IGP you
that's available right now and I've used
the HD 4000 it works great if you want
to do anything from 1080p and 1080p
playback videos to even some light
gaming on it if they are going to go and
play some like more serious gaming on a
bike okay at any point drop the video
card into this system and you can
upgrade but that's kind of the basis for
that so I wanted a z77 motherboard of
course for the Ivy Bridge processor got
the Asus p8z 77m Pro I was actually
going to go with the PG 77m which is a
bit more of an economical choice I'm
trying to keep this with a price budget
price range for him but actually the
empro had a mail-in rebate that made it
the exact same price as the pre 77m so
if you are looking to do a build similar
to this the piece of PhD 77m by itself
totally fun and you can save yourself 20
or 30 bucks by going with that but
anyway uh for power supply I got the
Rose well hive 550 watt fully modular 80
press 80 plus bronze Rozsival power
supplies if you go back aways a little
hit and miss from time to time but
they've really stepped up their game and
power supply area you can look at
reviews on a hive series from the actual
good review sites like Johnny guru and
tech power up they really they either
really like them or said yeah this is a
really solid power supply especially for
the price so 80 plus bronze 550 watt
this is actually overkill for this build
right now but again if they do want to
drop in a video card any video card even
if like a 680 in the future this thing
will be able to handle apart from that I
for the CPU I got a custom or an
aftermarket cooler because I hate I
absolutely hate the stock coolers check
out the Zalman CMP s5x Performa really
solid CPU cooler this is not an
overclockable processor but this one
will keep it cool and it will run much
much quieter than the stock one in there
especially after you have it running for
a while remember I got some basic
kingston hyperx 1600 speed 2 by 4 gig
kit so it gives it gigs total make use
of the dual channel 4 optical drive
I have an optical drive optical drives
are so boring these days it's like oh go
find an optical drive it's less than $20
and that has decent reviews this is oh
gosh I didn't even remember what brand
this is I think it's I think it's a
light on or maybe a Samsung they're not
even being very clear with that right
here on the it's a Toshiba Toshiba
Samsung all right so this is Samsung DVD
burner I'll leave it at that we also
have a Samsung 840 series SSD this is a
hundred and twenty gig love the Samsung
SSDs as mentioned I want this to be
quick so SSD I wanted to be snappy and I
don't want it to ever fail in the future
so Samsung SSDs started with the 830
series tons of positive feedback from
that really little failure rate
continuing that with a 40 this is not
the 840 pro 840 Pro uses two bits per
cell mlc memory it's a bit faster a 40
by itself actually uses TLC three bits
per cell NAND flash memory but still
very fast still comparable to the 830
which was super fast but so rounding out
the storage Toshiba 2 terabytes
mechanical hard drive right there and
these prices have come down decently for
mechanical hard drives I think this was
like 110 for 2 terabytes not quite what
was pre-flood but it's getting it's
getting there
finally since this case oh did I say the
case rules will align M micro ATX case
is my first time trying this one out so
I'm just going to do a separate review
video just on that and then also this
has a blue LED fan in the front and I
didn't want that because it's kind of an
office computer so I did grab this is
just a leftover silverstone hundred
twenty millimeter fan and that's the
hardware so i'm going to show you guys
as much of this build process as i can
comfortably here filming it by myself
i'm going to use my Spyderco here to cut
things as often as possible and let's go
ahead and jump in to the build
by travelpod member
and I'm back and to be honest I'm not
sure at what point I got cut off but
basically I was building this system
getting it all set up I got the purse in
there powered it on and I realized it
was way too loud just far too loud for
my taste and I decided there must be
something wrong so deduce that it was
actually the power supply fan that was
spinning up so loud did a little test
with the power supply fan off and I
realized that system is very silent in
fact let me turn it on right now for you
guys
system is very quiet so it was I don't
know something wrong with the power
supply fan just spinning up too loud
actually have a little bit of video
comparison which I might show you guys
right now
so you can probably tell a fan was just
much louder than the replacement one and
it's got the replacement one in there
right now in order to replace the power
supply however and here's a bit of
poetic justice so I have a separate
video on that power supply just an
unboxing that I did and then the
unboxing I say it's partially modular
but it doesn't really matter right that
there's a couple hardwired cables
because those cables
everybody needs so it's not a big deal
well as it turns out if it had been
fully modular I would have been able to
unplug those those cables from the power
supply swap out the unit and put it back
in however since I had wired that
especially the big 24 pin cable very
carefully back through here
and I'll show you guys that in just a
second in order to remove the power
supply actually the pull motherboard out
basically almost rebuild the system so
it was more work than I would have liked
but just sort of weird confluence of
things that led to that but anyway
systems set up now it's good to go very
quick I did a test boot of it at Boots
in about 15 seconds and that's mainly
thanks to the SSD and the ACC 77
motherboard with the newest bios which
uses the cat format which is very fast
running Windows 7 so even with Windows 7
50 15 second boot superfast not really
happy with that but let me give you guys
a quick walkthrough of the completed
build and the cable management so here
is the completed ability guys and I'm
going to try to give you guys as good a
look at it edit
as I can given that I can't go back over
there to do any adjustments on the
camera at least if I do I mean I need to
take a quick break but uh here we go
let's start with them foot outputs input
outputs on the back you can see your the
exhaust 120 millimeter right there power
supply white IO shield for the inputs
and outputs I have removed two of these
some screws so I can remove the side
panel didn't add any extra fence or just
roll them with the stock fans these
stock fans right now at least the stock
fan in the back that replacement
silverstone when i did in the front fan
for the the cooler horizontally cool
right there
and then of course the fan on the power
supply the good fan on the good
power supply and you guys can kind of
see how I laid out the drives here so
optical drive up top I went with the SSD
on a 3 on a 3.5 inch to 2.5 inch tray
right here and I went with the the two
terabyte Toshiba down there at the
bottom as you can see did that because I
wanted to use the rubber mounts for the
Toshiba I also wanted to kind of space
out the weight a little bit since this
is a pretty decent power supply it's
fairly heavy that being up top made it
pretty top-heavy so if I had put this up
top it would have been really top heavy
as it is it's balanced out a little bit
more now so that kind of helps also I
wanted to configure it so that I can
only I would only need to use one of
these serial ata leads a serial ata
power leads from the power supply so I
have one goes up to the optical drive
down here to the SSD and then feeds down
here to the the two terabyte mechanical
Drive down at the bottom so there's a
kind of a quick look at the interior I
turn it this way hopefully you guys can
see the cable management yeah maybe a
little bit about this there we go it's
because if this case does have a
drawback it's definitely the cable
management because really there's no
room behind the motherboard tray you've
got a wedge pretty much everything back
here as far towards the back of the case
as you can so that's something to
consider and I kind of managed to get
most of them back there as far as I
could use the fair amount of cable ties
and whatnot to get those all sort of
sorted out there's another look up at
the top the power supply so I was also
able to do just the the single power
cable coming off the power supply routed
the four pin up around the top there as
you can see comes up here a little bit
of a tricky cable management with these
these guys here to get a zip tie in
there so I could secure it up there
secure it again to the back there so
that could get around to the four pin
connector which is right up there here's
a cable management coming from the back
and I think one of the biggest things I
was able to do here to reduce the
clutter and cable management was the
power supply which is right here has a
big fat 24-pin power cable and basically
I was
i routed that by removing this
motherboard standoff which is really
tight in this corner that's one thing to
pay attention to that is why I had to
remove the motherboard in order to
replace the power supply but by removing
this thumb screw you can actually feed
the cables up behind there and get them
between the hard drive and five and a
quarter inch bay and the motherboard
tray and doing that it will allow me to
route the 24 pin up around here and just
tuck it back into the corner got a huge
amount of that bulk out of the way and
tucked away and then just fed it out
there to go back to the front I also
tried to do my own little cable
management thing here by adding these
these zip ties which I don't know I did
it first and that was really kind of
excited that it worked and then when I
actually came time to use it I really
only used it to kind of put this front
panel a cable on so there's that then
the rest of the cables again just kind
of tucked away wrapped around zip tie it
up as best I could that way I'm so
there's a look at the cable management
and that is going to do it for this
video guys once again this has been my
little budget build featuring the
Rosewell line in case asus pz 77m pro
motherboard Intel Core i3 3225 processor
and all the other components that you
saw in there if you'd like to see more
build videos like this please let me
know in the comments because I would
like to do more of them it's just a
matter of if it's worth it if you guys
want to see that and gathering parts
together to actually do full complete
builds I would also love it of course if
you would subscribe give me a thumbs up
if you like the video thanks a lot for
watching you guys see you next time on
