Pauls hardware today's video is all
about this system that I'm building
right here it is currently being called
hotbox my wife came up with that name as
this is her computer that I am building
for her now I want to start off before I
get into anything else with a big thank
you to my sponsors for this build I
would not be able to do this without
them so first off ek ek water blocks
provided all the water cooling
components that are in here also
gigabyte provided the z170 n Wi-Fi
motherboard that's in there a little
mini ITX board as well as the gtx 980ti
g1 gaming graphics card which has
currently been outfitted with a water
block also from HyperX I had three
products two SSDs and the 32 gigs of DDR
4 memory and then finally fractal design
provided the defined Nano s case that
this whole system is housed in now it
might be a little obvious to you guys
who are familiar with building
water-cooled computers but this is a
work in progress and for this video this
is as far as I'm going to get so I'm
going to jump back in time and share
with you guys first off all the parts
that are in here and then second off my
assembly process so far at least as much
as it of it as I was able to documents
and honestly I am happy to even have
gotten this far at this point I had a
very late last night last night but I'm
excited to move forward once I finish
shooting this video right now I'm going
to move on to the next step and Lord
knows I don't have enough distractions
as it is coming in this isn't even the
only distraction right here I also need
to be continuing my work on benchmarking
and doing a review for this card there's
other things that I can't even tell you
about before I run down any of the parts
or anything like that though I want to
say two quick things specifically about
this build based on some feedback I've
already got because I've already done at
this build air cooled and did some
initial testing and everything like that
first is this is not a normal build this
is a unique build it is unique to me
it is something actually that I have
been working on in collaboration with my
wife she's had a lot of input and
feedback mainly on the color choices and
that kind of thing but this is not
really a build that I would go out and
recommend somebody hey here get all
these same parts that I did and build
the system
because of well many different factors
the sponsorship not being least among
those but also just the fact that I'm
using a motherboard that is not
necessarily high-end so about 150 H
dollar motherboard from gigabyte but
when I told them what I was doing even
they were like are you sure you want
overclock on that motherboard but I
chose it for different reasons the
aesthetics was a big reason there's not
a whole lot of colors going on also it
had both Wi-Fi and I'm too built in
there but it's only got a three-phase
power delivery system I've helped that
out a little bit by adding some of my
own heat sinks onto there but it's not
going to be the best overclocking
motherboard I'm still confident it's
going to get me an overclock that's
within the realms of what I'm looking
for with this chip 6600 K which I'm
hoping to get to about 4.6 or 4.7
gigahertz but I guess what I'm saying is
if somebody was building a ground-up
custom water-cooled system it's not
necessarily the motherboard I would have
chosen EVGA has some options that I
think provide a little bit more power so
if you can go for more high-end
overclocks but for my purposes I think
it act is actually working out just fine
the second thing I wanted to point out
is that this is an orange build and for
anyone who might want to jump in here
and say oh you're copying J's to cents
with a skunkworks builder Oh obviously
this is a Linus tech tips team built I
just want to point out I have been
building orange themed computers for my
wife for quite a few years now in fact
her past two systems which I have
documented on the channel have all been
orange theme so a little bit of history
there anyway enough of my rambling let's
actually take a look at all of the parts
the final parts list for what's going on
inside hatbox now since I already built
this whole system out with air cooling
there are some parts that I am keeping
and some parts that I have left behind
the parts I'm keeping are of course the
core ice I 560 600 K CPU from Intel quad
core with hyper threading and I've
already overclocked this to a 4.6 or 4.7
gigahertz I also have the gigabyte z170
and Wi-Fi motherboard as well as the
gigabyte gtx 980ti g1 gaming GPU the
case of course I'm also still keeping
that's a fractal define at nano s and
then new products that I'm adding are
from hyper X the storage configuration
of a 960 gig HyperX savage SATA SSD I'm
going to be pairing that with a 480 gig
HyperX predator MDOT
to SSD this one is not nvme but is still
very very fast much faster read and
write speeds that you get with standard
SATA and I think about one-and-a-half
terabytes of SSD storage should be
plenty for this built for memory I have
a 32 gig kits of HyperX ddr4 memory this
is 2400 speed 2 sticks 16 gigs each that
means I got 32 gigs even though I have
only 2 DIMM slots so I'm pretty happy
with the memory configuration now those
parts as well as the ek stuff was
sponsored but I do have some non
sponsored stuffs that I've thrown in
here as well starting out with the
custom paracord sleeved power supply
cables these were done by end sourced
customs that's en and sourced and he
does a fabulous job Joey over there
thank you so much for your hard work on
these this is a much better option than
when I did with the arctic panther where
I did it myself and it took several
weeks Joey got the order done within a
week from when I ordered them I was able
to custom choose all the colors and all
that kind of stuff and I'm really happy
with the work so far again it's paracord
and it comes with these little cable
guides here that are 3d printed
to keep everything lined up really nice
and makes it much easier for cable
training for Paris why I decided was
really important to have as much extra
room in the case as possible so I went
with the Silverstone Strider platinum
this is a 750 watt version basically
wanted to make sure I had 140 millimeter
length power supply and this one fits
the bill they do 550 millimeter length
titanium versions that I was considering
but honestly I'd much rather have the
extra space and I'm already happy that I
went with that choice since it came in
handy I do have a late product edition
that's the NZXT hue plus I decided to
throw that in the 3.5 inch drive base
slot behind the motherboard tray and I
think it's going to be a great option
because it provides RGB lighting and a
lot of control via the connection with
the operating system and the hue plus
software NZXT cam software I believe and
finally look at this massive pile of
parts from ek all in their colorful ek
boxes you're not I'm going to do I'm
going to take these out of their boxes
one at a time so you can get a closer
look because I feel like I haven't
really done that with my water cooling
parts so far so ek sent me a laundry
list of stuff so let's start off with
the blocks from ek the CPU block is the
ek supremacy Evo and the nickel finish
and this
also has a clear plexi cap on top so
you're going to be able to see the
liquid flowing through and the liquid
should be orange colored eventually for
the graphics card we have the e K FC 980
gtx 980ti wind force 3 version this is
specially made for gigabytes one-fourths
3 version custom-designed PCB for the
980 TI got the nickel finish on this
also with a clear see-through panel
you're probably not going to be able to
see much because it's facing downwards
but it's still in there
and I'll get some low angle shots of it
so you can appreciate that a little bit
also comes with a back well it comes
with a sold separately back plate but
you want to get that as well I got it in
black because it's nice and clean and it
looks sexy you gotta have a reservoir so
this is the EK res x3 110 millimeter
version very tiny i think this is
actually one of the smallest reservoirs
the ek sells but hey it's a tiny case
for the pump I have an e KX top Revo D 5
PWM this is going to be a very quiet
pump and it's also got that plexi cover
on it so you can see the liquid flowing
through I did get an assortment of
fittings and adapters so I have like a
tee splitter I got a bunch of fit 16
millimeter fittings that's to go along
with the 16 millimeter PE TG tubing that
I got several two-piece kits of it's
nice and clear and it comes individually
wrapped to make sure it will not get
scratched up moving on with the fittings
though I also have some extenders I got
a ball valve for a shutoff so I'm going
to use that for a fill port and drain
port some angled fittings as well as
some extenders and rotary fittings
we gotta have airflow over the radiator
so I have 5 EK Vardar f4 120 ER 2200 rpm
fans 2 for each radiator plus one for
exhaust at the back rounding things out
I got the DIY kit this is kind of
necessary and well they give you a saw
in there which is useful for cutting the
PTT PTT tubing but you also get the
little silicone inserts you got to put
that inside the tubing before you bend
it and it's very necessary to have the
insert that's the right size for the
tubing so that was a big reason why I
went with this kit and then finally we
have two radiators these are EK cool
stream SE 240s so they're slim they're
only about 27 millimeters thick each one
will support 220 millimeter fans and of
course I have Justin
Froome four booths one at the top and
one at the front it is now high time
that I get things underway and start
assembling the system but before I even
do that I need to disassemble the system
that the existing system or at least
removed the stuff that was there and get
it out of the way that includes the old
power supply as well as just pulling
some of the old components out pretty
much I got to strip this down to nothing
but for preparation because I want to
make sure that I have everything ready
to go before I actually start installing
anything and you got to do step a and
step B before he moves to step C I
started with flushing my radiators step
that has often forgotten when it comes
to new water cooling parts but it's a
good idea a good standard practice just
to run just standard tap water through
the radiators for a good 15 to 20
minutes and then finish off by flushing
it out with some distilled water that
you would use for your loop Elsa had to
prep the psu that included heat gunning
off the label on the side as well as the
label on the back near the modular plugs
and then it has like an all black finish
except for these single two PCI Express
power plugs the modular plugs on the
power supply side for some reason these
are blue they're not really going to
stand out much but I decided I wanted to
cover it up instead I started off by
going the quick and get a root by black
penning it I wasn't quite satisfied with
the results I ended up grabbing some
paints and using a paintbrush and just
using some matte paint around the edge
again this was not the cleanest job at
all but fortunately after installation
it is blocked a lot by the cables that
are above it so it's mainly just there
so that you don't see any blue peeking
through and turned out okay next I was
finally able to get on with installation
for this section of installation I'm
pretty much doing everything that you
have seen here since I started this
video except for the fittings and the
tubing so the tube bending is what will
be coming in part two so I started off
by getting the power supply installed
down at the bottom which I'm happy to
say fits nicely and gives you lots of
extra space since it's so short I
thought the radiators next I got that
front radiator installed first because I
needed to determine where I was going to
be able to put the fittings wanted to do
the fittings at the top because it would
make bleeding easier after I fill the
loop that wasn't going to leave me
enough room though so I ended up putting
them
the bottom still okay to have them down
there it will just make bleeding a bit
more of a pain in the ass the top
radiator I kind of set there but I left
floating because there was some more
stuff I needed to install and plug in
behind it but this was able to allow me
to figure out exactly how much room I
had and that yes I would be able to fit
both of these radiators as well all as
all five fans including this exhaust fan
at the back from there I went on to
prepare the motherboard that included
installing the HyperX memory of course
getting that MDOT to predator' SSD
installed at the back and the MDOT to
slot and then finally the CPU waterblock
installation the ek supremacy Evo was
fairly straightforward I've only done
this a couple times with eks blocks but
they have very clear instructions and
the hardware is all really top notch so
everything fits very flush and very
cleanly and I wasn't too worried as I
was tightening everything down to get
nice compression on my CPU heat spreader
with the motherboard prepped and ready
to go I have dropped it into the case
fortunately my IO shield was already
there and then I was able to connect up
the top row of fan and power plugs for
the motherboard really important to get
this stuff in there first because once
the radiator is installed in front of it
it's really difficult to get at those
with finished radiators installed I went
on to doing some initial cable routing
specifically for these fans
I got a swift tech fan hub that I've
installed at the back here so I can have
all fans read it over that and then that
single fan plug just for rpm is plugged
into the CPU fan header on the
motherboard that way all the fans in the
system will ramp up or down based on the
CPU temperature after that it was time
to get the GPU water block and backplate
installed again ek has very clear
instructions here if you've never done
this before I recommend checking out
some adjacencies videos because he has
quite a few videos on disassembling and
reassembling these again not very
difficult and thankfully the g1 gaming
graphics card from gigabyte also wasn't
too hard as far as removing the air
cooling assembly on that it also shaves
a lot of size off of the card it makes
it a couple inches shorter and it made
me realize finally like oh yes this
might actually work after getting that
on because there's just a lot less space
taken up by the the liquid cooled
graphics card and it's going to give me
a lot more room to work with over in
this area for actually routing those
ptg tubes for the GP waterblock setup is
able to drop that assembly into the case
and get it securely fastened in place
and that kind of moved me on to the
final stage of planning which was well
one getting these custom sleeve cables
actually installed and routed to where
they're supposed to be so I could kind
of figure out where I have room for
those and where they're going to be
routed to the 24 pin up at the top
actually had a very very tight squeeze
up against the fans from the radiator
but fortunately I was able to get it in
there and everything else I'm super
happy with how it looks so that moved me
on to getting the reservoir and the pump
set up where they should be so I could
actually figure out my tubing is gonna
go from here to here and here to here
and all that good stuff so let me grab
the camera and show you guys a closer
look and tell you some of my thoughts on
this build since we're so close to it
being finished
so here's hot box in all of her glory at
this particular point in time and again
240 at the top 240 at the front to
intake fans here at the front as well as
to exhaust fans here at the top one
exhaust fan there at the balk at the
back mini ITX board 980ti
everything is looking pretty pretty now
apart from the cabling which again I
think is looking pretty damn nice
this is I wish I had more space for this
one at the top because I would have
liked that one to have a little bit more
flourish to be honest but you know I
think it's getting the job done and
actually what ended up happening is this
this the two four pins for the CPU I'm
sorry the two eight pins for the two
eight pins for the graphics card are
much more visible but I think it looks
pretty nice this is a big swoosh right
here some folks were saying this might
have done better if I gone back behind
the pump but honestly the pump I didn't
even have in there I didn't know it was
going to be exactly where it is until
now we're late last night so I it was
difficult to plan that so had to make
this long enough that I have enough for
him to go back behind the motherboard
tray and then come back back out again
and connect to the power supply so there
that is now the kind of last minute or
not last minute but the solutions I had
to find last night for a couple things
were involving well first off this
pump down here because it has an inlet
which is actually right there at the
center and the outlet which was
originally up here on top fortunately I
read the documentation and I discovered
that you can rotate you can kind of
loosen the housing that this is in and
rotate the whole thing so I was able to
have that outlet come out the side here
and using a couple fixed fittings
I have already connected that up to this
radiator that was one of my biggest
problems to deal with was this tight fit
down there and how I was going to get
the in into the in on here that the
heads it has to come from the the
reservoir up top where the out was going
to go and how it was going to get over
here and then how I was going to manage
this that this radiator had to have an
in-and-out whereas it's down here wedged
in the corner with the pump and
everything so by rotating that is able
to connect that up directly the
reservoir that out is going to come from
out here and go down here you know with
an angle in it or something and then
from this reservoir from this radiator
it's going to come out and go up around
and into the the graphics card out of
the graphics card into the top radiator
out of that top radiator into the CPU
now the CPU and over into the reservoir
now my other dilemma was with this
reservoir because I had it oriented
vertically like is you probably see a
little bit more commonly and I was
basically gonna have these two fittings
on the Front's like here in here but I
decided you know what I really was
having a difficult time figuring out
where I was going to put a fill port a
fill port or a drain port and that's
specifically why I got this little cut
off this little ball valve here I
realize you know I can flip this do
ninety degrees that allows me to use the
top Inlet as an actual Inlet so that's
going to come from the CPU that's going
to fill this here and then the outlet is
going to be right here and that's like I
said going to go down to the pump and
then that allows me to have this little
capped off thing right here which is
going to be a fill port so I can just
you know twist that to turn it off uncap
this put a little fitting on there with
some tubing whatever fill up my
reservoir and then fill up the loop
draining is probably to be a bit more of
a challenge I'm gonna have to like tilt
it forward towards me to put it on its
side but again I'm hoping since it's so
tiny
and boxy that that will
anyway guys I better shut up and
actually get to work on the next step of
this stay tuned for that coming soon
stay tuned for other wonderful videos
that I can't even tell you about coming
soon thank you guys so much for watching
this video I'm so excited to be actually
getting work done on this build and yeah
hey don't forget to hit the thumbs up
button to give me a like if you enjoyed
this video if you're excited to see the
final bill and we'll see you next time
on pulse hardware you got to have a
reservoir side of the EK this is x-rays
vo stop hooking your your nutsack
stop looking the remainders of your
nutsack</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
