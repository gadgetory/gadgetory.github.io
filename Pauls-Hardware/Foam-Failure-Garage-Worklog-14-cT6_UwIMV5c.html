have yet to do a garage work log video
for this month this is my workspace out
here in the garage and my work log
series has gone over the past I know a
year and a half or so as I sort of built
stuff out here and done painting and all
that kind of stuff so if you haven't
watched them the link to that whole
playlist will be down in the description
but today I have two pretty simple goals
one is just to clean so I'm going to do
that first because like yeah the table
behind me is in really bad shape so I'm
going to get some of that done
maybe dust a little bit you know you
know typical types of maintenance things
and then I have this pile over here so I
promise to do this last year and I'm
finally getting around to it but um if
you guys don't know I have a sort of
strip of sound dampening material here
around the outside edge of my workspace
it's because I have microphones that
kind of float right in here and I found
that putting that in there helps to
reduce the echo that came from having
flat walls pretty significantly so I
like having it there but it's not the
highest quality stuff and it's
definitely not like it's not level a
hundred percent across the top here and
I'd also like to bump it up a little bit
so that the top edge is kind of hidden
by the Shelf a little bit more so
hopefully this will solve that have a
pile of the pyramid style foam here
which I think I like better than the
long ridges I originally had switched
these and gone flat and then vertical
every other one and then I decided it in
like that so I tried to go over tackle
and then I kind of gave up down here
because it was too much work and I do
the heat gun so I guess waiting till
winter was probably that's my excuse
that's why I waited this long now it's
winter and it's cold in the garage so I
can actually use the heat gun and not
get super sweaty so that'll be nice
anyway so this foam I just got on Amazon
and I'll link this down on the
description if you guys are interested
you know pretty standard pyramid style
film dampening strips there and then
I've also got this to try to get a
little bit more precision job on it also
from Amazon imported from China I
believe and this is basically like a
heat heat gun not a soldering iron but
it's got a long like metal piece that
gets hot that should hopefully though
allow me to slice through these a little
bit more precisely than using the
scissors and allow me to make room for
the shelf supports so those are my two
things I'm going to set up a time lapse
and get to work
wish me luck
so this sucks pretty much I've been gone
for I don't know what maybe like half an
hour to 45 minutes and I have gotten
this far I think that's like maybe three
three and a half pieces the adhesive I
use is just being really a pain in the
ass to get off leaving off little chunks
in here like this which sucks I can
kinda like rub them with my finger to
get them off of there but that just
sucks and it starts to kind of rub my
finger raw it's only just started to do
I was really afraid it was going to do
much of which is peel the paint up
that's not a huge deal because I'm going
to be putting more more foam pads over
this so I'm not too worried about how it
looks under there just take them off so
take so long if I try to like peel them
quick they just they're just kind of
tearing underneath and coming apart so
word of warning to anyone putting in
foam pads like these especially if
they're the cheapest ones that Amazon
sells they comfort really easily when
you take them down so maybe give give
thought to how you're actually mounting
them anyway here goes the rest
okay I have gotten all of the old stuff
off it took way too long much longer
than expected actually it's the next day
now because I got so tired of doing it
last night and my fingers are tired from
ribbon on the walls and stuff so I took
a break but now I'm back at it and I
pretty much got everything off
I left the tiniest little piece over
there in the corner that's just to piss
off people with OCD then I'm going to
put these pyramid sail acoustic foam
pads on there and I've been looking up
online some better ways to do this
because this is what I used originally
the 3m general-purpose spray adhesive
which again did a fine job holding those
up in place and everything but I'm
removal which is just not good so my
solution is based on a couple things
one is just some basic internet browsing
for trying to find a better solution
second it's based on the fact that I
don't want to leave the house right now
so I'm using what I got here but
actually one of the most popular
suggestions that I found on there was
liquid nails and fortunately I've got
some liquid nails right here so many of
that hopefully my plastic a caulking gun
here doesn't fall apart on me and the
idea there is that you just use it like
on the corners or maybe I'm probably
just going to do like some dabs here in
each of the corners and then maybe one
in the middle for each one so it might
like pulp the paint when I take it off
but I don't really care about that but
it should hopefully at least make
removal a little bit easier if I need to
do that in the future they should
hopefully stat for a while anyway so
here's the method I have devised for
making sure everything is level and even
basically I have this pile boxes this is
going to be my standard for measuring
the height and I'll just move this along
the desk as I move along installing
these pieces and this is composed of a
razor blade box a gigabyte bricks gaming
uhd box and this this box that Nvidia
sends over was for their order of ten
thing that they did last summer anyway
so this basically the foam pad just pops
in like that and I tested from looking
at it from
main camera and the idea was to not be
able to see the gap up there between the
top of the foam and the the shelf at
least when I'm recording from a typical
level height and that seems to do it so
the last question here is going to be my
my foam cutter soldering iron saying
which I'm really I don't know it's
pretty simple design it's plastic just
has a very cheap power supply you know
in the end does have an on/off switch
inline so I guess that's convenient to
have but again let's let's give this the
moment of truth switching on and explode
this is actually getting quite warm
quite fast at least as far as I can tell
from the scent of newly warmed up
electronic spurts but for lack of
anything better do I need to my first
cat is just going to be cutting one of
these straight in half and I have
nothing holding this down or anything to
keep it safe let's give it a shot oh my
god it's like butter I also think I'm
going to need to open up the door in
here and get some ventilation going
because those fumes coming off the top
they look healthy
I should also use two hands for this
hold
so here's my first precision-cut so to
speak with the wand and you know it's
not like as clean as I was I was kind of
hoping it would come out but it's it's
it's okay it's passable and then I mean
again if you guys don't know why I'm
doing this is because I have these
supports for the shelves that come down
and I want this to be clean going across
the back of all of them but of course I
can't attach this to the wall where
that's another thing so I feel like even
though the edge there is a little rough
once I actually match these up it will
block it a little bit I'm still going to
have a bit of exposed you know kind of
not prettiness going on there but I
think it'll be fairly minimal so this is
this is optional enough for me I know
God my wife this house the dogs all
start barking alright so now the moment
of truth I got some liquid nails on
there and I put it far more extensively
than I had said I was going to but this
is just for this corner piece to make
sure it stays in place and you know oh
hold on
alright so I sincerely hope that will
hold but I think I've think I've decided
upon my my method for mounting these so
let's switch back to time-lapse mode and
see how quickly I can get the rest of
the set
well okay guys here it is pretty much as
far as I'm going to get as far as the
garage work log itself goes for today I
think everything went pretty smoothly as
you can see I have this nice pyramid
style acoustic film surrounding the
outside perimeter of my set and I think
it looks a lot better than the stuff
that was on there before all that said I
did learn a few things so let's quickly
go over that thing number one was that I
don't really need this solder soldering
iron thing at least for this type of
foam I'm sure in some situations it
would be more useful but I mean it was
really it was just pretty slow to use as
far as actually cutting through the film
I'll put a link to this in the
description just because I want to put
links to the stuff I used today but I
wouldn't necessarily recommend this for
this type of job I basically discovered
that a sharp pair of scissors was pretty
much all that you really needed now this
is mainly due to the fact that this foam
already has kind of like partitions I
mean since it's all whole squares so
cutting in between these wasn't too
difficult and and it also made it easier
for spacing to figure out what should go
where but the other thing was even in
situations where I needed to cut like
straight up and half one of the one of
the pyramid Peaks it was easier to do it
with the scissors and it came out with a
cleaner kind of cut on the end I mean
obviously it's still kind of freehand
with scissors so it's not the best but
when I was using the other thing it came
out more like this which is quite a bit
rougher and unfortunately there's a few
pieces up here that do have that going
on like up in that corner and then this
one here so other lesson learned was I
probably should have started over
on this side where I would have cared a
little bit less about how it looked and
the move this way as I figured things
out and got a little bit better at it
but that's how it went and you know like
I said I'm just pointing out the minor
things that bugged me a little bit but
overall everything came out pretty good
I think the fatness all the time I have
for today and for this video guys so I
really hope you've enjoyed it my garage
work logs are always fun and learning
experiences and I hope you guys have at
least enjoyed coming along for the ride
with me or maybe even learned a little
bit yourself as you're setting up your
own areas whether it's for filming more
for just playing games and stuff now I
just promised myself that I would finish
that stuff back there first before I
moved on to the next thing which I'm
more excited about and that's all right
here so this is January's build I know
it's the very end of January so it's
going to leak over into February a
little bit I love a build for February
as well but I'm really excited about
this one it's an RVT build of a fan tech
pencil of all I got asus motherboard and
graphics card at 1080 and a Maximus 9
hero it's going to be RGB everywhere I
have g.skill memory g.skill memory still
on the way that hasn't arrived yet so
that's pretty exciting too 7700 K really
awesome storage configuration frumble
it's easy and sanitized even sent me
like extra RGB scripts that kind of
thing also an md80 kraken 62 which also
has RGB on it so RGB all the things
coming very very soon so anyway guys
again it's thumbs up button if you're
doing this video links to stuff I used
it down there in the description and
have a good one enjoy your weekend we'll
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
