excellent what's up guys welcome back to
Pauls hardware today's video is
hopefully going to answer the question
can a 65 watt TDP 8 core 16 thread rise
in seven and 1,700 CPU be cooled with
this family CPU cooler right here this
is a no fancy our 95 c fanless cooler
it's rated for CPUs up to 95 watts cost
me 130 bucks on Amazon and it shipped to
me directly from South Korea it is also
absolutely huge so it's not going to fit
in most cases and it's pretty much
always going to block at least the top
PCIe slot on your motherboard if not the
top one to two slots so well it works
let's get right into the test setup that
I have prepared first off I'm going to
be comparing this here 95 C's
performance to a relatively comparable
in price cooler the Corsa H 100 IV 2
which costs 110 dollars that's a 240
millimeter all-in-one liquid cooler so
the trade off is going to be better
cooling with that device versus you are
going to get added sound from both the
pump as well as the fans on there now
both of these coolers ship with am 3
mounts the H 100 IV to of course will
ship with the name format now but this
one the TR 95 C only ships with an A and
3 and 3 mat it has not been updated so
for that purpose I had to use one of
these ASUS motherboards across there 6
hero is what I'm testing with because it
includes both a m4 and an three mounting
holes that pass through the back of the
motherboard I did actually also have to
scrounge up an AM 3 backplate to mount
this cooler properly with other than
that I'm using an asus strix 1080 TI
graphics card g-scale flare x 2 by 8 gig
ddr4 memory kit at 3200 at least for the
initial testing Patriot Hellfire quarter
an 80 gig nvme SSD Leanne Lee PCT 60
open-air test bench that you can see
right here and the corsair HX 1000 a
power supply now the other isin 7 1700
has a 65 watt TDP it is still an 8 core
16 thread CPU like the 1700 X and 1800 X
the 1700 X and 1800 X run at higher
frequencies so the TDP or thermal design
power is rated at a higher wattage which
is basically the amount of heat that the
cooler needs to be able to absorb and
dissipate 95 watts of those higher end
ones
1700 only runs at 3.0 gigahertz base
frequency 3.7 gigahertz turbo and in my
testing was running at 3 point 2
gigahertz when it was under load across
all cores it shouldn't get quite as hot
as the 1700 X and 1800 X therefore you
have a lower TDP at 65 watts
now this cooler could theoretically be
paired up with a 1700 X in it or 1800 X
although didn't quite go that far my aim
was to get something that was powerful
but not quite pushing the limit as far
as what temperature it was going to be
running at 24/7 because my ultimate goal
it split this cooler in my home theater
PC my ultimate home theater PC that I've
been building which is supposed to be
able to not just do HTPC tasks but also
video recording as well as playing video
games at high resolutions 4k and doing
VR now for my testing my ambient
temperature was at about 80 degrees
Fahrenheit at least that's what I had my
air conditioner thermostat set to that's
about 27 degrees Celsius and that did
vary by a couple degrees but that's my
best bet at keeping things somewhat
scientific here now for the test I'm
going to be running of course I did an
idle test which is just a boot up let
the system go through startup procedures
wait about 15 minutes and then take my
old temperatures then I did I 264 is my
CPU stress test and that's not quite as
intensive when it comes to the max
temperature it will output when you
compare it to something like prime95 but
it is well beyond anything I will
actually do with this system especially
in an HT PC environment of course let
that run for 15 minutes as well and then
took the temperature reading then 3dmark
fire strike just to give myself
something would test a variety of
different configurations it has a CPU
centric test it has Gaming tests the
scores for that test shouldn't change
but I again took the max temperature
reading during it and then GTA 5 I just
did standard gameplay for 15 minutes to
simulate me playing a game on this
system and and how hot it would get so
let's jump right into the testing the
baseline was my again corsair h 100 IV -
with the risin 7 1700 idle temperature
was 32 degrees Celsius pretty standard
for my ambience the i-264 cpu stress
test only got the CPU up to 47 degrees
Celsius a testament to the H 100 IV to
cooling prowess 3dmark fire strike gave
me a couple scores the CPU score aka the
physics score was sixteen thousand five
hundred nine
six and the overall score was 6925 again
pretty typical for a 1080i in this
environment the max temperature while
running 3dmark fire strike was 51
degrees Celsius so actually a little bit
hotter than the CPU stress test with
lightest six before I think this is a
result of specific cores getting hotter
because when it's not using all the
course it will run a specific single
course up to I saw three point seven
five gigahertz when it comes to the max
core frequency then I played GTA 5 for
about 50 ms not only got the CPU up to
48 degrees Celsius now when I was
running across all cores with that under
full load it was running at 3.2
gigahertz across all cores and the max
temperature probably would have
increased a couple degrees if I had left
that itis 64 stress test run a little
bit longer I let it run about thirty
five minutes which is quite enough to
saturate a full-size during 40 mm 240
millimeter all in one liquid cooler but
there it is again that was just kind of
more at baseline for comparison next up
I swapped out the H 100 ib2 and I
installed the no fan CR + 95 C along
with the cooler itself you get a
mounting kit with hardware for AMD
platforms up to am3+ and Intel platforms
up to LGA 1150 which would also work the
bail GA 1151 the documentation was
pretty clear and concise and they did
include an extra set of spacers
specifically for am-3 mounts and then I
actually also had to go and scrounge up
the am-3 mounting kit from my 990 FX
board that I got that a m3 map from as
well but fortunately once those brackets
are installed in the back and all the
posts are installed on the top it's
pretty easy just drop the cooler
straight down on top of it the screws
going through the tops they are
spring-loaded to apply some pressure
there and it all comes together pretty
easily
except for my clearance issues I had
encountered two different clearance
issues one was with the plastic shroud
that's on the crosshair 6 here oh it
conflicted with that so I had to remove
it I might I might just shave off some
of the plastic when it comes to
implementing this with my home theater
PC but for now this was able to get
things up and running also the memory
the g.skill flex kit was just a bit too
tall conflicted with this soft it out
for a corsair
lpx kit which is lower profile
this kid is only running at its own leaf
rated for 3,000 speed though so I was
running it at 29 33 with the timings
that were installed there so bear in
mind with these next sets of tests
I was running slightly slower memory but
with everything installed I was able to
load up wait for things to cool down and
idle temperature was only at 37 degrees
Celsius just 5 degrees warmer than the
idle load with the corsair h 100 IV -
then I loaded up the I 264 CPU stress
test that got things a little bit warmer
but still not too terrible at all 77 to
78 degrees Celsius was the max
temperature I saw there and in case
you're wondering at stock settings at
1700 is running at about one point one
seven seven volts under load across all
of the CPU cores next up was 3dmark fire
strike CPU score here was 16,000 793
overall score was 7077 so even though I
was running a slightly slower memory and
the cooler was making things around a
little bit warmer when it comes to the
CPU let's look at a higher score but
it's just within the margin of variance
for testing something like three mark
multiple times anyway though the max
temperature was 66 degrees Celsius so
again a bit warmer than the H 100 IV -
but still very reasonable especially if
you compare it to something like a
decent rate stock cooler or something
like that
finally GTA 5 gameplay for about 15
minutes again and only saw temperatures
at about 65 degrees Celsius on the CPU
perfectly adequate for typical gameplay
experience now with the no fancy i-95
see I had an idea well first off I'm
probably not going to be using the
rising 7 1700 I'm going to be using a
risin 5 1600 X but you should be able to
under bolt these CPUs so that's what I
did next when you run a CPU at a lower
voltage than what it's set to you're
basically nothing that can go wrong
that's not the way I should phrase this
it's basically a win-win scenario as
long as you don't experience instability
so just like with overclocking you got
to test some stuff out you got to start
to tweak the voltage and bring it down a
little bit but just like with the
overclocking you can eventually
experience system instability I was able
to dial in a negative CPU voltage offset
of minus point zero eight seven five and
that actually ended
up in the CPU load voltage being around
one point zero six eight volts which is
pretty much what I told it to do I am
focusing on the voltage here while all
the cores are under load do note that if
you are testing this yourself if you are
only doing something that's going to use
one or two cores that turbo boost will
take effect with these rising processors
and you can see quick voltage spikes in
a one point four volts or above range
but as long as when you have everything
under load you're seeing those more
nominal numbers in the one point one
five to one point two range that's
usually more like what you would expect
anyway though I did run some quick test
after envel under bolting the idle
temperature dropped by just two degrees
Celsius thirty five degrees was what it
was at I to 64 CPU stress test sixty six
C average during those tests and it
peaked at 72 degrees Celsius and dropped
back down so about five to ten degrees
cooler than without that under voltage
applied and then 3dmark fire strike did
get a bit lower score but still not
terrible when it comes to the variants
that comes from test run to test run CPU
score was sixteen thousand three hundred
seventy seven overall score was six
thousand eight hundred and seventy nine
and my max temperature there was only
sixty two degrees Celsius so all L I am
pretty damn impressed with the CR
ninety-five C's performance and I'm
pretty damn impressed also with Rhydon
you know it's not often talked about the
efficiency of Rison but the fact that
it's only a 95 watt CPU if you're
looking at an 1800 X or 1700 X drops to
65 watts with the 1700 or anything below
that so even in my worst case scenario
testing which was stock settings at high
260 for stress test we only peaked at 78
degrees Celsius and that's still a good
15 degrees C or more from the seventeen
hundreds thermal limit of 95 degrees
Celsius you could even potentially
overclock this CPU just a little bit
although I didn't explore that because
once you start adding voltage and adding
frequency especially across all the
cores temperatures start to ramp up
pretty quickly so so I'm super happy
with the potential for this system and
an HTTP C and the gaming environment of
course it did not come up come without
its drawbacks compatibility when it
comes to the socket you choose
compatibility when it comes to PCI
Express expansion slots I don't think I
mentioned very specifically
but not only was my top by one PCIe slot
blocked but also the top or the second
slot which is the full length by 16 slot
that the graphics card usually goes in
was also blocked so when I installed the
Sirah 95 C I had to move the GPU down to
the secondary SLI position for that but
even though it's a by 8 connection it
still been performing just fine and I
didn't really see much performance
degradation at least when it comes to my
game testing the guys that is all for
this video I really hope you've enjoyed
it
I certainly have had a good time over
the past 24 hours or so given this a bit
of a test and I think there's a lot of
potential out there not just for this
CPU cooler because this one's a little
bit harder to find it's also a full
copper version of the CPU cooler it's
even more hard to find but I'd like to
see more family CPU coolers available I
feel like they kind of come and go
pretty quickly and there's not a whole
lot of them out there and available
I digress though as J might say thanks
again for watching this video guys hit
the thumbs up button on your way out if
you enjoyed it leave some comments in
the comment section down below I have
more work on arctic panther as well as
hg pc as well as typical video content
coming to you very soon and we'll see
you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
