actual product video in quite a while if
you're wondering why check out my recent
videos and there's a bit of explanation
about what's been going on in my life
but today I'm going to be doing a short
video on this very small keyboard this
is the Coolermaster SK 6 to 160 percent
size Bluetooth mechanical key switch
gaming keyboard I'm gonna start off with
the price for this thing which is not
cheap it's 120 dollars MSRP from
coolermaster just minutes made available
on may 7th so that might be expensive
for you if you don't regularly buy
mechanical keyboards mechanical
keyboards can often be $150 Plus this
one is just so tiny and cute though
maybe that makes up for the price being
120 bucks also slim low profile Cherry
MX true mechanical key switches so we're
gonna give those a test as well and see
how they actually feel and everything on
the box we can see some basic info about
the product the Cherry MX key switches
of course Bluetooth compatibility so you
can use this to connect up to your phone
or another Bluetooth capable device RGB
backlighting / key so you can do all the
fun customization with lighting that you
might come to expect from Coolermaster
RGB mechanical keyboards and again that
60% size just just makes it so small and
I want to get it out of the box so I can
look at it and be like oh it's so tiny
that does come in the premium velour
it's not really velour but I like to
save a lure carrying case so you know if
you want to take this on the go what you
should do if you're getting a keyboard
this small I feel like unless you're
trying to do one of Kyle's tiniest
setups possible this is really I feel
like made for portability thanks to the
Bluetooth connectivity but you also have
a USB type-c port on the back as well so
you can use presumably the included
cable yes indeed and included a USB
type-c to standard type a braided cable
with a velcro strap included so plug
that in I'm just gonna connect it up
here real quick and that means yes you
can plug this in and use it like a
normal keyboard because if you were
gonna use this for gaming you probably
don't want to use it via bluetooth for
gaming Bluetooth introduces a decent
amount of latency so input lag while
gaming never a good thing so plug it in
if you're going to be gaming with it I
do want to do a bit of game testing on
this at some point just to see if
it's a significantly different
experience from using a full-size
keyboard also included in the box though
we have a key cap puller here as well as
some documentation this one is
specifically about Bluetooth setup and
this is just the product manual this
does come with a warranty from
Coolermaster it is two years French
Chinese Japanese Russian should have
English here at some point
aha so just going through to see how the
bluetooth pairing works there's a bunch
of function buttons very similar to a
lot of cooler master keyboards that you
can use to adjust certain lighting
functions on the fly like red green and
blue as well as macro modes they're all
sort of subsets on the buttons here
since this is a smaller keyboard there's
not a lot of extra function buttons on
the top and bottom but coolermaster
button right here acts as the function
switch you can press that and then the
Bluetooth buttons right here which are
under Z X and C and there's actually a
one two and three so you can pair up to
three devices to this and have it
remember them and then if you switch to
wireless mode which is done via the
small switch here on the side then it
will go and attempt to connect to that
Bluetooth device one if it can't connect
to that device it'll switch to device
two and then device three so that can be
convenient if you have this set up to
work with multiple devices and you can
sort of set them up for your preference
also the caps lock switch right here
does have a little light that lights up
as well that light will turn red and
flash one time every 20 seconds when
it's at thirty percent battery and then
it switches to every ten seconds with
it's at twenty percent and then it
flashes much more often at five percent
and it will automatically go into deep
sleep modes and that's how you would
know that you need to plug in via USB so
you can charge the battery so now I have
gotten the keyboard out taking the
protective film off of the edges and we
can get a better look at it physically
so you'll notice very flat key caps at
least upon first notice but the he caps
actually do have a little bit of a
concave to them it's ever so slight but
it does allow your finger to kind of
rest more towards the center of the key
cap if you're finding your home keys
without looking at the keyboard itself
you'll also notice that there are pretty
much secondary functions or sometimes
even three functions per key just about
across the entire keyboard and that is
just because there's so few keys to work
with and so many functions that it can
possibly do so we have profiles that are
built-in down here we have a block of
like home page up page down and end keys
that are over here you have up down left
and right arrows over
here and then you have a bunch of extra
macro and function buttons up in the
upper left hand area so s-- will allow
you to use cooler masters built-in
keyboard functions to adjust the
lighting and macros which actually can
be pretty intuitive once you learn it
and figure out how it works I've been
using cooler master keyboards for quite
some time now so I sort of have a pretty
good idea of it if you do it a lot
it gets pretty simple but it does have a
bit of a learning curve since you got to
kind of figure out what's what but the
manual does have a pretty good rundown
of how to access all those functions so
you can do that in particular once
you're adjusting lighting for example
you have red green and blue switches
here and you can tap those up to ten
times for ten levels of intensity for
that color and then you can combine red
green and blue so if you do all of them
at ten it makes white for example or
different shades in between you also
have keys to adjust brightness levels
repeating or infinity loops for the
different lighting functions and then
you even have some media control buttons
here on the upper right for turning
volume up and down play pause forward
and back and yes even though they didn't
put gamer in the title of this product
it does also have a Windows lock button
up here on the top right so that will
allow you to lock out the Windows key so
you don't actually press it and take
yourself out of a game when you don't
want to take yourself out of a game the
key switches themselves being mechanical
feel very nice they have a good amount
of resistance and I will say they
definitely feel significantly better
than your typical rubber dome keyboard
does and comparing it to other Cherry MX
Reds which I have over here on the
coolermaster MK 850 which is their
flagship it's not all that different
it's slightly different but both of them
feel very nice I think the keyboard
itself has a nice brushed metal top and
a bit of a beveled edge around the
outside the underside of it is plastic
does have a bit of texture to it so that
helps prevent picking up fingerprints
and that kind of thing some rubber pads
on the bottom it does not have a little
vertical mats that help you tilt it up a
little bit so keep that in mind but
again probably just keeping the body
itself very slim looking at from the
side here you can see sort of how slim
that is unofficially I'm gonna say it's
less than one and a quarter inches tall
at least that way I did get a more
accurate measurement of the width of it
again at being a 60% keyboard it is very
tiny but about 11 and 5/8 inches wide
for this entire keyboard and the metric
system that is 224 millimeters so
that's that's very small one last thing
to mention before we get into some
testing is the battery life and that is
14 hours with the LEDs on or four months
with the LEDs off so the LEDs do use up
some power and I guess that's a
trade-off that you'll have to live with
I am going to not use the USB cable for
now I'm going to bluetooth connect this
to my phone original pixel XL by the way
still using it three years later I'm
gonna pair this up real quick pressing
the function and Bluetooth key for three
seconds which should hopefully put it
into pairing mode new device Bluetooth
keyboard eight one eight so now we're
connected coolermaster bluetooth
keyboard one now we can tap configure'
physical keyboard default layout sounds
good to me okay okay so keyboards paired
so now I should be able to type a
wonderful note here for myself note to
self
when practicing taping mom lock-on auto
focus remember that auto focus usually
well there's a quick typing test just
right here and it works as a keyboard
the keys that you push I represented on
the device you're connected to so that
wasn't too tough at all I would think
that if you like to do work on the go
but you know typing on the keyboard is a
lot faster than trying to tap something
out on your phones on-screen keyboard
this is gonna be really helpful for you
I mean just pair it up set it down
wherever type away and kind of gives a
much more like desktop like experience
with a keyboard even if you're just
using your phone but I want to give it
one more test and also give myself an
excuse to play some video games so let's
play some video games so now having
played some video games with this
keyboard my opinion of it has completely
changed no I'm just kidding it's still a
very good and functional keyboard and
all the stuff I said earlier still
applies and pressing the buttons caused
it to respond and do things in the game
so that's always a plus for keyboards
ultimately I would say this is this is a
nice little keyboard feels very premium
it does have that premium price $120 so
that's something that if you can get
past it if you're looking for something
that's as small I think coolermaster has
done a great job integrating a lot of
the functionality here as well as the
Bluetooth can
action I think that's just very useful
for versatility whether you want to plug
it into a desktop for some gaming there
or connected to a Bluetooth device so
this is the SK 61 from cooler master
I'll put a link to it down the video's
description thank you guys so much for
watching this video and for bearing with
me through this sort of tumultuous time
in my life but it's been great again
check my recent videos and feel a little
bit more update on what's going on there
but thanks again for watching hit the
thumbs up button on your way out and
we'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
