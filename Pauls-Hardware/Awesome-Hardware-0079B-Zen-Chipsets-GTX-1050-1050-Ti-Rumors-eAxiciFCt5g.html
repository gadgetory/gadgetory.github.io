you didn't deliver one of what missed
opportunity oh this is the worst tweet
ever that's things are misspelled okay
letters that shouldn't be capitalized or
capitalized going like that thanks to a
shirt a little what is it with what do
you call that Lincoln another squiggly
line tilde the tilde tilde tilde tilde
tilde yeah use that I might know that
Pedro Marz it's just titled Mars we were
out of time how do you think we started
on tight no it's good it's good we're
outside okay hey if we're going to
welcome to awesome hardware this is the
live show Kyle and I do it every tuesday
evening at five-thirty p.m. pacific time
and we split the show in half so the
first half of this episode which is
episode number 79 has already been
broadcast on Kyle's channel which is big
wit or awesomesauce news I mean if you
want to type it no no just but with
justjust only bit with we don't speak of
that name anymore we are now on the
second half which is on my channel
awesome or false oh god Paul is hardware
hey just in case you're wondering yes
I've had a few drinks normally I tried
it we both have I try to keep things you
know I try to have some semblance of
normalcy on my half of the show but
really this one might be a little messy
so let's start off by thanking joshua h
for your five dollar donation you need
to build for pc for someone and muse for
mass storage and gopro editing a good
cpu GP combo eight hundred dollar over
overall budget I don't know I get a 6400
or 6500 skylake processor and I mean
other x 480 let it be good if you're if
you're with an eight hundred dollar
budget he says mass storage and like
GoPro video editing
see an RX 484 because why not doesn't
matter that's the only thirty dollars
jeez also my tank you for your ten
dollar donation keep up the good work we
will we definitely will why do we have
no donation or or link on our twitch
channel because we also broadcast live
to twitch TV / awesome hard work and we
are not partnered with twitch yet mainly
because we are lazy yeah we we know
people at switch we have friends at
which I have directly talked to the guy
who was like I don't know if he's in
charge of partnerships but he works in
the partnerships department he Herman he
had like power and he was like send me
an email I was like yes and I never did
so later yeah that's where we're at
right now yeah finally Cody Bravo geez
guys stop donating Kody Brown with a
five dollar donation what's the best
1070 in the market right now I haven't
tested all of them oh yeah anyone that's
actually less than four hundred dollars
yea yea be yea you know asus gigabyte
msi I mean this I ya know that very nice
pick which one you think looks the best
yeah Andruw Jones thank you for your
five donation and I'm glad we are
entertaining you what's our take on star
citizen and the size of the game yes I
am very very minimal I tried out the dog
fighter module when it first came out
really haven't done too much besides
that is it really expensive how much did
how much space does it take up right now
I do not know what but if Elon Musk is
already like blueprinting plans to go to
pack colonize Mars then freakin the
desert star citizen yeah they should get
their to be on top of stuff it's
not look good for them yeah and honestly
at this point any yeah I feel like wow
here's this petite soeur something no
here that's probably just my wife
returning oh okay um yeah my wife's
trolley oh I'm sorry about the parking
guess
heroes making bad weird noises he is he
sounds me back yeah well he has this
like it's really like tense up in throat
area when he barks and then and then he
makes this weird noise it's strange
Chris Camarena thank you for your tendon
whoo and wow we're really distracted at
the beginning of the show I'm glad we
have entertained you and the various at
least I see him until dad guys
if you want to help support us not that
we've done much to impress you so far
but Paul's Harbor net or start Paul's
are bored at net is where you can check
out my store I have shirts mugs and pint
glasses they're all available there will
give you a little shadow at the end of
the show if you happen to order while we
are live also Cal store is bit wit tech
/ store he has a bunch of varieties of
shirts also available there so check
them out and help support us and our
endeavors also we are going to twitchcon
this this coming weekend we are right
now it's Tuesday twitchcon is this
weekend Friday Saturday and Sunday we
will be there we're going to have a fan
meet up at the tipsy crow this one has
been organized by josh from fractal
design so big thank you to him for
putting in the extra time and effort to
set this up I'm going to be there cow's
going to be there Luke from Linus tech
tips is going to be there steve AKA
steve OMG is going to be there and
there's probably gonna be some other
folks there as well so if you happen to
be over 21 and okay with a five dollar
cover charge please come and join us if
you are not over 21 we're going to do
another separate neat up that's actually
at twitchcon probably on Saturday yeah
and that way we can have everybody yep
follow us on Twitter for more like
updates and stuff oh yeah for both those
things and cows doing a Twitter live
stream on Thursday evening yes as well
on his twitch channel bit wit chi ya bi
Twi CKY correct and i'll be posting a
video on my channel later this week
probably tomorrow detailing all the all
the stuff you need to know about that
stream proving all right let's continue
the show with news just theoretically
that is why people
watch this show is to learn a few things
about what the hell is going on in the
tech world so we're going to start off
what is going on in the tech world Paul
well Kyle AMD has been sort of going
towards the launch of their actual Zen
CPU architecture which we're expecting
early in 2017 but along with that they
have new versions of their existing cpu
architecture which they are pairing with
these chipsets on the am for platform so
what are these chipsets mean thank you
for asking that question Kyle I can
answer that right now all right so
there's the X 370 the be 350 and the
a320 partly the best the xc70 is the
best one good as I'm getting that's
right at the top that's the high-end one
that one will allow you to do
overclocking everyone will also allow
you to do multi GPU rendering so if you
want a crossfire or sli configuration
you will want that one it's got two full
by 16 PCI Express slots that is gen 3
we've been waiting for the gen 3 you
know on an AMD said so that's cool yeah
and then beyond the X 370 we also have
the be 350 and a 320 so this slide we're
looking at right here is actually
covering those this is the mainstream
segment specifically the the a320
outside the be 350 is mainstream then
the a320 is more small form factor or
budget and all of these sort of more
detailed specs are listed right here
this is a guru 3d article by the way so
compatible 7th gen AMD AP use by H gen 3
so you're not going to get as much PCI
Express bandwidth but you will be able
to support at least a single graphics
card from md or nvidia that will that be
enough for that to jail ddr4 it's also
got USB 3.1 as well as 3.1 3.1 gen2 3.1
gin
and two point oh this is mainly going to
give you 4 3.1 gen 1 ports I would
imagine the 3.1 gen2 ports would be
reserved for the ex 370 chipset for
storage you have to say de tu nvm me or
to say to and tooth pcie of course the
chipset provides a certain number of
lanes and available connections and then
it's up to the motherboard manufacturer
to actually decide how they want to set
stuff up so more specifically for the be
350 for USB support two plus two plus
six is what you get for 3.1 gen2 3.1 gem
1 and 2 point 0 2 plus 1 on SATA and say
to express but plus 6 more lanes of pcie
gen2 connectivity so if you're looking
at santa connectivity in like wow that's
not very menace many SATA ports they
have all these extra gen 2 lanes to add
more Santa connectivity to the board so
you probably get additional ones of
those beyond the stata express and they
do support say to raid 0 1 and 10 so I
couldn't imagine say to say to our raid
10 support for example on a you know
with two available ports that one may
you have sense so probably most
motherboards are going to have more than
that but it's up to them so you know if
they want to if they want to push more
of these lanes over to nvme or something
like that they can what I'm curious oh
yeah go ahead I was just gonna say a320
which is more of a budget chipset for
small form factors will have a little
bit less connectivity only one USB 3.1
gen2 port and only forge four lanes of
gin to support for additional general
purpose connectivity so but still say to
say to read support as well so nice to
know they could get that raid support I
was gonna I was going to say I wonder if
since the a320 chipset is is intended
for small form-factor boards if if the X
370 chipset is still going to be offered
in mini ITX varieties
I would have to say yes I hope so yeah I
mean I'm that's a guess I would guess
yes yeah I mean a320 being specifically
geared toward small form factor is just
gonna be like look it's small form
factor because they don't need any
additional space for anything beyond
what they're putting in there yeah you
don't need the space for a graphics card
because you're directly you know you
have that be an APU or something like
that so you don't need the extra
connectivity for the extra stuff that's
in there so yeah I mean that'd be my
guess for the a320 but yeah x3 70
chipset in a mini ITX motherboard yes
hopefully we'll also see that as well
because there's going two people be
people who want to build a high ends you
know gaming system with in a toaster
yeah with the name DS n processor and a
vega GPU pref will be in a mini ITX form
factor i really hope they have support
for something like that view our real
quick flare storm 99 thank you for your
daughter donation did I get your package
ah maybe I haven't checked my p.o box in
a week or so so maybe it's in the p.o
box but i'll double check it again soon
but thank you for sending me your
package anyway a couple more slides here
just to show really quick they are
noting that the actual wattage that's
that's drawn by the different chipsets
that they have made in the past has been
improved upon so the be 350 chips at
least we'll draw 5.8 wats versus their
other chipsets such as the 970 which
draw up to 19.6 watts so when it comes
to power consumption and lower heat
generation which isn't something you'd
usually consider when you're talking
about a chipset you know but I mean
that's just a little improvement and
then if you're looking at the last
generation to current generation if
you're comparing what's what 990fx and
888 X on the am3+ and FM two platforms
respectively we'll both be replaced by
AMD x3 7970 and a 7
eight will be your place by the MDB 350
and the 760 G and a 68 h will be
replaced by the a320 sounds good they
have no equivalent in the small
form-factor area though so aim dxb a 300
so maybe they will have an even lower
end chipset beyond this for small form
factor yeah that will maybe go towards
like pre-built systems or integrated
solutions or something like that cool so
there's a little bit more information on
amd's upcoming chipsets now the one
thing I did notice from this that out
that I was specifically looking for was
zen exclusivity did I enunciate that
properly you need to help me out here
Kyle I fell too much to drink no yeah
you did well on that then exclusivity
George is something that we were hoping
would not be a thing because it would
suck to say like you can only fit a sin
processor in the x 37 x 370 chips that
motherboards yeah you know so yeah
that's the remains to be seen I'm sure
there might be connectivity and
exclusivity and compatibility that's
where I'm looking for there might be
compatibility limitations in the future
still but at least from what we've been
shown so far that doesn't seem to be the
case that's cool although overclocking
that's what I was going to say is why
would someone get his in-processing with
a non overclockable so might just see a
thing where like the Zen processors are
all all unlocked which AMD has done in
the past they've often touted that as
being like you can overclock any Andy
processor all the way down to the
hundred-dollar chips so they might say
that yeah you can you can overclock any
am DS n processor even the budget ones
that we come out with with fewer cores
or that kind of thing but you need the
extra 70 chipset for that definitely
seems like they're following the Intel
model yeah with which I mean which has
worked to some degree yeah although it
has made the cooler stuff more expensive
which
yeah you know what can even bound to
happen all right next up we've got what
the GeForce GTX 10 city and 1050 TI as
teased here on the video cards com
website so basically we have some specs
that elite we also have some frequencies
that have leaked these are all rumors
these are rumors and speculation it's
probably all it's all fake and none of
nobody should listen to anything we say
right now but if it is true we have a
new GPU at GP 107 GPU which is different
than the GPU 10 for example for example
in the GP what is it the 1066 we got to
yeah so the GP 107 has at minimum 768
cuda cores but possibly less than that
if you go down to the GTX 1050 according
to hardware battle the website where a
lot of information came from both of
these cards should launch next month the
1050 TI should be first in mid-october
and the non TI standard 1050 will be
further at least a little bit later at
the end of october bench life also
posted some actual so based on the specs
on the coup de coeur count of the tenth
idiom fitty and TI these are probably
going to be competing with the RX 416
470 i would imagine right this is
india's response to those two low end
card let's entry-level much of the bench
life website is in chinese because it is
a chinese website she's an anticipated
sorry yeah so this these would be mainly
competitors for lease on the AMD side
the we're sick for 64-62 gig for 64 gig
for 70s a little bit more expensive so I
feel like the 1062 gig is kind of AMD's
3d Oh what the 1063 gig
there's no 1063 gig I thought it was
three kings that is a four gig on a two
gig GTX 10 secs 1060 yeah I'm sorry I
think that's right I hope of that's
right I know nothing I've been drinking
it could be wrong get Celebi right did
you look that up right now the 1050 and
1050 I rumored three gigs you noob what
well 1060 is three and six gigs yeah
I've been drinking is true you get two
of those hard cider your ear ear out Cal
thank you for correcting me so that's
why we have two people here that's right
the girl you do the same for me google
translate girl your girl go to trans
date shouldn't lead to drunkenness the
Chinese ink why there's a three gig and
a six gig for the 1060 okay at least my
fundamentals were correct though yes
because fundamentally I was thinking you
were thinking if it were like I can
prove it you with your like 1070 of the
1080 what's your eight gig cards mm-hmm
they couldn't cut an eight gig card down
to six gigs or down to three gigs make
it all kind of eight gig 24 right that's
suing yes that's a formula in basement
library had in short I had fundamental
correctness in my thinking this is the
worst you dig in the words I've got
deeper that's all right let's go back to
the story we were talking about and
distract everyone from what anything
else let this be a lesson to all of you
to never drink hard cider yeah that's a
bad idea as Barry cider don't do it all
right this is a PSA for all of you so
the Pascal GP 107 based 1050 hands 1050
TI if they actually exist based on the
charts here on video cards com 1050 will
have a 2gig frame buffer the 1050 TI
will have a four gig frame buffer and
according to hardware battle the website
also linked to this article both cards
will launch next
months TI the first mid-october in non
TI tienen month bench life has posed
clock speed post to clock speeds of
these cards beads right here
or you can click on the bench life
actual article 1050 TI will run it 1290
base clock and 1382 megahertz boosts
clock the 1050 will be faster than that
from a megahertz standpoint 1354 base
1455 boost and on both cards will
feature a 128-bit memory interface and a
75 watt TDP okay all that sounds
reasonable and sounds legit legit well
I'm hoping for good things I don't know
I don't know so is this probably gonna
perform on par with like a GTX 10 there
I'm sorry like a 960 or maybe I have no
idea probably like nine sixty i do not
know but for way less money face he
sees it is a higher base yeah i
really don't know yeah my speculation in
that area is not my forte at least that
one I've been drinking so yeah well and
it's for video cards com video card
everything you read on that site should
be taken with a grain of salt is that
vibe a rumor and too much point in
speculating it next story here nissan
has been using is its automotive AI
technology to create self queuing chairs
why are you laughing about this is
awesome mmm he's okay you shut up shut
your mouth this is the pro pilot chair
program look at this video watch this
video here have you um how often have
you been sitting down thinking to
yourself man I don't want to get up this
is PSG right now all the times here to
that guy these Pro pilot chairs use
autonomous vehicle technology oh my god
it's Wally coming true yeah so so the
same technology that Nissan has been
developing to use in its automated
ours like self-driving cars the chairs
can now detect and sense the movements
of the chairs next to them as well as
move accordingly maintaining a fixed
distance along the queue and then they
can also go back and restart oh my god
are you serious so that Ike's mark chair
you've reached an all new low an
all-time low of how lazy we are where we
need oughta me at fairs Jewish that's
the chair which is call itself out under
the table for you to sit down on are you
tired of pulling the chair out from
under the table yourself super annoying
let's see what this one Wyatt this is no
that looks like it would give me motion
sick like so quickly no I wouldn't like
how are you gonna like read your tablet
or whatever the on up your own
pilot chair you're wrong these are you
Donald Trump you're wrong just write
code I grow and Robin just right now
they have no reintroduce the pro pilot
chairs and in a pilot program you might
say ah with certain actual
establishments in Japan for queuing
outside of the establishment but they
say they'll get plenty of real-world
testing across Japan this year as they
allow business owners to expand and
tweet a request to apply for a loan for
a set of chairs so you can tweet you get
the chairs what I'm curious about is
when you tweet to the chairs do the
chairs just arrived by themselves they
just roll up and like line up in front
of your establishments and just become
self-aware and kill your family yeah
that's awesome also concern is chairs
knowing who they are and who you are
what if you have my shotguns yeah so
that's that's a difficulty but I'm
excited about this new technology and
not having to stand as I wait in line I
mean I think it's important linked dust
thank you for your donation thank you
for your concern that I should stop
drinking so much I really actually
probably part of the reason this is
affecting me so much as
is this is Tuesday is my drinking night
good I have not drank at all this entire
week I the last time I drank was when
you saw me drinking honest I only drink
or use a hardware one we only drinks for
you guys what do you think if Nvidia
randomly decided to give the 1050 TI and
non sli option but no but not 1060 if
you could that would be really i really
doubt they will do that there's no point
the 1050 TI having sli support whereas
the 1060 not having sli support people
just buy a 1070 would make no sense so I
really don't think that would happen but
thank you for your donation um ok scary
chairs off the list yep next we've got
some sims 6pc requirements yes indeed 66
it's already that time final news story
here from hexa stuff net by the way
thank you buddy Chris for the ten dollar
donation yesterday thank you Chris I
will drink more i'll make sure it's
gonna get us wasted it's waiting so 6
i'm excited about sub 6 are you excited
about 76 cal i honestly have not
invested enough time to civ 5 to be
excited about 66 i'll be honest i
thought you were like down the civ 5
right idea i haven't lately you played
it for a while I've enjoyed many hours
of civ 5 yeah but I have not played it
to the extent that you have which I've
actually never finished a game in civ 5
that's okay you definitely have not
played as much as I have that no I have
no civ5 I actually was so excited about
66 that i played through a sieve
five-game a couple weeks ago and it ate
up a bunch of my free time you're mad I
I want to play I started a fresh game of
civ 5 like on a 13 hour flight I didn't
I felt like I barely got halfway through
the game it's incredibly tense
ridiculous I don't know how you have the
time okay so do it Sims six is rewriting
and everyone should play it but the
minimum specs are actually pretty
minimal the minimal I would imagine able
minimum specs a stone the so many Intel
skylake chips for example with HD 530
graphic
should be able to comfortably play the
game that means if you have a laptop or
an ultra-compact with a sky like chip in
it you will probably be able to just
place of six maybe not with the highest
graphical settings available but the
minimum requirement is at i 3 2.5
gigahertz for a phenom to 2.6 gigahertz
now I take issue with them just saying a
core i3 because I three covers many many
different generations of Intel
processors and they're not all
equivalent you know but anyway for gigs
of RAM 12 gigs of hard drive space one
gig Direct X 11 video card or a AMD 5570
or nvidia 450 equivalent so minimum
requirements are actually again maybe
pretty minimal so lots of people should
be able to play this game even if you
don't have a high-powered gaming PC
recommended requirements are a
fourth-generation or aka Haswell 2.5
gigahertz processor or an AMD 8354
gigahertz processor which is still
pretty minimal still pretty minimal
under under 150 dollar yeah like a 4th
gen 2.5 gigahertz like digs pretty far
down any port in the Haswell stackin but
AMD 8354 gigahertz is actually pretty I
don't know it seems like the Andy
requirements are higher than the non AMD
requirements I guess that's what I'm
saying a gigs are more of ram 12 gigs
are more of hard drive space 2 gig
directx 11 card or the equivalent of an
AMD 7970 or in india 770 which is
significantly since significantly higher
than the minimum specs it's now much
more significantly I can enunciate
you did but still not quite dad but what
yeah anyway that's that's not bad I mean
the fact that you can run the game and
I'm just not gonna finish that sense
that that those requirements I mean it's
not taxing at all so that's good I mean
it's not like you really need anything
more than 30 FPS consistently for a game
like so 5s 06 it's not a first person
shooter it's in case you guys aren't
aware it's like a top-down strategy game
so really frame rates and all that sort
of thing aren't really too important
boom 25th anniversary edition of sub 6
will be available this weekend that is a
retail product limited to 20,000 copies
so um you know if you're into like oh my
god there's only gonna be feel these
robots by one sorry think all the dogs
and they hit the camera that's really
good my wife is home good lord dogs will
come down shortly if you happen to buy
the anniversary edition eight includes
everything that you would get with a
digital deluxe edition plus the Aztecs a
25th anniversary coin set a display case
100-page hardcover artbook entitled
civilization through the years and
especially themed packaging Wow if
you're not into specially themed
packages then just wait for civilization
6 to actually launch which is October
21st like 3-4 weeks yep a lot of games
launched in october yeah or years of war
for yeah it's it's almost like q4 and
end of q3 is popular time to launch
products hot seat yep but are you on you
can also pre-order but nobody should do
that baby appeared nori shut up okay
dog let's move on to the next segment
which which Kyle's all right this is
hailing late know what I'm saying I'm
really not doing a good job of hosting
the show today you're doing great you're
doing a thank-you job thank you guys
hard to get up here in front of a camera
in front of thousands of people actually
I'm overestimating ourselves in front of
hundreds of people hundreds of people uh
and try to rehearse things in a rear
sight it's okay the news it is difficult
it's D'Amelio that I shouldn't have
drink nearly as much alcohol as a drink
on your half of the show but damn face
off hot heavy hardware let's talk about
stuff let's do it all right what are we
go starting with the razors new Death
Adder elite would write another elite
product the Death Adder elites yet the
theme for hot and heavy hardware today
is elite because there's so much elite
pneus going at so alright that's an
article on PC world that you guys can
read about this that was just a rehash
there's also a razor website on it that
you know has much more dramatic
photography dipped in tinton contingent
basis confusing fence look at the omron
switches oh look at that close-up shot
of part of a mouse one of the buttons
you click alright so the deathadder is
one of the most popular gaming money
since its release in 2006 it's crazy if
you don't believe me they'll behold
behold the deathadder this is a Death
Adder you get a day 2006 and i'm using
no it's not that old 30 2010 this is the
3500 DPI version from there's no a year
on this they usually don't pretty sure i
get 2009 edition or substance till seven
year old now still holding up though but
they're the Death Adder gets a lot of
props because it is one of the most
popular gaming license this release is a
classic scooped shape with two big thumb
buttons the forward and back buttons
that I like to use there
and it's also got a scroll wheel sweet
wheels are good you might look and be
like oh that's pretty standard you know
it closed it mainly the shape that's
mine that's taking it to critical
acclaim that's probably part of it but
it's also they've always used really
high quality switches and it really had
quality sensor so it's always just been
the type of mouse super at you plug in
and use and the reason that i often use
it for my traveling my mouse is that
often when i plug it into like
motherboards with finicky bios's or that
kind of thing he like the motherboard do
it's like oh we have mouse support in
the bios so then you try to use a mess
and it's like flipped upside down or
something like that yeah just this mouse
has for me at least have the most
consumer like oh I can just use the
mouse of the bios and that kind of thing
it's just it's a simple design but it's
also very elegant and they seem to have
done a very good job with it so of
course they're releasing the new version
and people would buy it spend more money
on it this is not a new elite version of
the deathadder this will actually
replace the Death Adder chroma so the
deathadder chroma that's been available
for the past year or two will no longer
be available huh and now you will be
instead be able to buy the Death Adder
elite sighs I mean there's no chrome
alighting on this thing no that does not
mean that it still has the same features
as the chromosomes eagle has RGB
lighting it also has the new razor omron
switches or a razor mechanical mass
witches that they developed with Imran
Imran is kind of that kind of I don't
like the companies do that well I like
when companies pair with like switch
companies and like make their own
versions of the switches but I'm Ron is
this is it very widely like established
just like just kind of the gold standard
budget but it's like if razor would have
liked go to cherry and like make the
proprietary cherry switch just for razor
products they wouldn't do that it's too
expensive I mean I guess that's kind of
like what corsair do with the rapid fire
the silent at
the silent MX may but that's still going
to be released on other keyboards in the
future not exactly but there's a bug is
a buggy go away jerem do feel again
geeing him a few worry now you got your
ching ching ching ching ching alright
sir alright so other than these
specially designed armor on switches
also includes the the new razor 58
practical sensor good your husband's
drunk the facts just saying with the
facts DPI have 16,000 16,000 good look
at no.6 i could not have been business
anymore well timed oh no this is the hep
I just need to drink some water is that
wander okay yes water checking to see if
it was over here I can't help you here
I'm you're right maybe I could um see ya
did a razer deathadder you already said
it's got a 5g optical sensor no that's
what i was trying to say was it as a 5g
optical sensor with the max api have
16,000 does I'll just fill in the blanks
of whatever you can't say and the
tracking speed of 450 inches per second
oh my gosh she shut your mouth I'm dead
looking rib okay okay I can fix this all
right just just wash it down with some
wash it down with some gin Paula's left
the good thing everyone hiccupping his
way out the exit door yes Paul is
lettuce it was true but he's
returneth water he's gonna he's got the
 in the bag yo oh my goodness this
more side are you have a five dollar
donation from Stephen for more cider
we'll probably not happen to thank you
very much even for the donation cells
dying mods are falling off like flies
I'm sorry dropping like flies I'm sorry
oh boy hey yeah that one time cider
 over entire ship so if this
doesn't work then I'm what okay
here's a good here's a good segue what's
your method for curing hiccups drink you
drink water upside down that's what I do
and that seems to work for you do that
too yes but if that doesn't work I have
another solution for you really yes if
that doesn't work which always helps ok
upside-down thing doesn't work so try it
out drinking water upside down work
works for me like ninety-nine percent of
the time there's like twice that that
hasn't worked and that's what I've truly
screwed okay means like I've been in
that state that that means tomorrow is
done like I'm I should that plan it
nothing will have a Shetty all right so
um you take the glass of water and you
put your mouth on the far side of the
glass then just kind of lean on oh okay
makes sense and how upside down do you
actually go you're like doing a
handstand or you just do it like that
straight up like that
interesting
my pop filters a little frame might be
oh that's your pop filter might not have
mattered might be screwed at all right
away is that a hiccup are there no I
don't know I can't tell sometimes it
takes a couple attempts okay mfp screen
okay uh uh make yourself cough a little
bit but usually I'm site sister okay you
guys all right shy Cohen thank you for
your dog oh okay I'm gonna do it
one more time I do over time and then
see I'll tell you my secret it's
actually you have a secret let's okay
it's not really a secret because
everyone it's pretty common but I feel
like people just do it incorrectly I see
ya let me all right you just do your
thing
guys in chat do you think Paul will ever
cure his this case of the hiccups or do
you think he'll cure them by the end of
this episode let us know i'll get
probably not my my guess is no at this
point how does i feel but also i
can't tell your burping from the water
or if that those are Hickox cat I'm kind
of in the same I don't know either
aashiq okay so here's what I do I hold
my breath for as long as possible now
yes that's very obviously right duh yeah
but the way I do it is you have to
inhale as much air as you possibly can
you have to take the deepest breath
you've ever taken in your life and then
hold it for as long as possible I feel
like most people just as long as they
like hold their breath they just try it
for like 30 seconds or whatever and they
exhale ago it didn't work you actually
have to like take the deepest inhale
inhalation you can and hold it for as
long as you possibly can and that's
usually when it works for me even above
the the upside down drinking thing
really really pack it in really oh
alright you're a lost cause I'm sorry
yeah I'm sorry I can't help you I can't
help you at that point I usually watch
for me it's probably fit guys you have
any other suggestions in chat honestly
here lost cause at this point all right
we should just roll on to the next story
maker week but by a definitely right now
it's a do it now oh god but all right
this next story i have extensive notes
on and i'm sure i'm going to be able to
get through them easily this is the this
is anna mantech article no why is
everything is really kiss knighting more
it's not fair becoming more attune
they're becoming more like strategic
like oh yes how many comic timing is
becoming before
this is letting me shut the up but this
is really bad oh my god i feel i'm so
glad hiccups aren't contagious cuz how
horrible would that be if you get ready
and we're you hey Paul baby would get
why don't you cut soon this is a
thermoelectric cooler thermo I don't
know what else to say about it it's the
next two point oh it's got two metallic
plates when current is applied one side
he heats up the other cycles cpu cooler
but that's this med this method of
cooling was and i can't even fill in the
blanks to help you out because i think
us are so stretchy look they're happy
happening more frequently now it was
like every 30 seconds now they're like
every five seconds like somethings
closing in on you eventually that's all
it's gonna be as hiccups over the next
20 minutes I'm stuffing oh my god people
are crying in China everybody sec
someone saying eat peanut butter
drinking vinegar be really just telling
you to eat all kinds of haters ok that's
terrible if it's doing all these
terrible ideas a cold shower hot coffee

right now guys on stream let's take a
shower while drinking coffee and peanut
butter hey straight Barry surfers yes
let's go to strippers hey oh my god I
think you're cured me right just from
the sound of that nope no damn okay
we're gonna need to bring him in here's
what I think we should do I think I
think we should go to QA QA what do you
think good yeah your answers will be a
lot more effective at Nick you a guys
I'm sorry we can save short fight for
neck we had more stuff to talk about
yeah I you you're watching as just this
is as good as it's gonna get it's not
like I'm in coherently drunker Eddie no
it's not just that I have you can't
physically touch rollable pickups to
keep happening so it's the Q&amp;amp;A we're
gonna answer some questions for you guys
and hopefully and this stream in a
somewhat dignified fashion you know you
know there's some guy named Charles
Osborne who is
I meant eight the end of the 1802
hiccupped for total of sixty eight years
straight well good yeah it could be how
longest said to pick up you you might
actually be breaking his world record
you don't even know yeah she's a piece
of mind huh what're witter bits said he
donated on YouTube but my hiccups cause
the message message to be ignored I'm
sorry Witter bits if we miss them I'm
star I in the corner just crying a
quarter now honestly I don't even think
anyone's going to ask questions at this
point they're just too focused on you
hiccupping they're just offering more
solutions of how to stop hiccups and
someone said try pornhub hold my breath
and swallow just a bunch of pornhub yeah
that's a 970 still a good card yes try
to be set record it's still a very good
car yeah it's fine it's perfect for
maxed out 1080 gaming no problem what's
your opinion on the fantex p 400s i had
the privilege of building in one of
those four system config the last
episode i did for the client jason he
really likes it so far i followed up
with him he's in love with it I think
it's a really nice case it's super easy
to build in and for the price point it
has a lot of a lot of quality features
for a case of that range that price
range Jay thank you very much for the
five dollar donation not tasty sense
I'll hold your breath will drink water
246 have another do we that we we he's a
lost cause guys don't even don't even
try to help them at this point their
breath while drinking water how do i how
can you do that aren't aren't you forced
to hold your breath while your water
because you can't breathe while you're
drinking water yeah it's like you're
forcing yourself to drown as the upside
down drinking of water usually solves it
for me like I said so I don't know I
think I'm screwed someone said sugar
works sugar spoonful of sugar helps
perfect perfect working modern monarchy
perfect perfect 1440p 144 first card
1070 I would say yeah yeah I agree with
that see 1060 instead of 480 they trade
blows right now 1060 overall is the
faster card but i would say give it a
year or two and maybe that's not the
case may be direct x 12 and things like
Vulcan those those newer api's will have
the 480 ahead of the 1060 but also in
one or two years you might just be
looking for a new card at that point so
just I don't know if you just want the
pier faster card for what the games are
currently then maybe that I'd say the
10-6 use the faster card overall but
okay you know reference reference and
stuff Dave wha three said what are your
thoughts on 191 hurts gaming monitors
but i will say having gamed it 100 hertz
120 hertz an hundred and forty forty
more for hurts that my experience at
least I 100 Hertz g-sync monitor has
been good to the point where 120 140
hurts hasn't seemed like something I
should go for so cranking it all the way
up to 180 or 200 Hertz seems less useful
to be but because if the end of it
you're probably gonna be paying more
money for that too maybe because I mean
for sure because how many 191 hurts
monitors do you see these days and so
it's like the first of its kind has a
few coming out center two hundred two
hundred dollars 200 Hertz Oh Turner yeah
but I mean it's still like the it's a
numbers game at this point like first it
was resolution and then it was response
time and now it's refresh rate like
that's the new numbers game that that
monitor manufacturers are playing so if
they can come out with the monitor
that's 200 Hertz that's obviously way
higher than 144 hurts they're going to
put a premium on that
and is that premium going to be worth
the visual difference that that the
common average gamer is going to going
to be able to tell coming from 144 hurts
200 Hertz is going to be worth that 150
200 dollar premium that you pay that's
too I don't is a question that the
person is it asking it's it's a personal
thing some people can tell the
difference in people can't I thought my
thought is once you get up into the mid
100 Hertz 100 250 Hertz range I feel
like you're you're appreciable t of the
higher refresh rate does start to fall
off it's a whole other angle to uh damn
is it cold what's that thing called a
diminishing value by a diminishing
marginal utility yes they're fishing
merging it's an economic turn whatever
linked dusts thank you for your dollar
donation would we consider a life a live
stream where we both picked parts
privately then build your own computer
simultaneously and then test them in the
end to see who's has better performance
that since one sounds cool sounds
difficult to do live that would take
like four hours or more unless we have
like a multi too much going on yeah I
mean if you're giving you a couple hour
one to two hours to build a system gotta
get like windows installed on it get
everything everything up to date and
then extra run benchmarks I'm just
saying doing that all live would be
there big good amount of downtime where
you're just like sitting way for windows
to install or something like that right
right yeah unless you already had
windows installed on the drive and you
already
the motherboard drivers installed on the
drive you are to assemble the Riggin you
disassembled it to only to reassemble it
again for the stream itself that could
work and we can have a split screen like
you on the left me on the right and we
could each be in our own corners of the
room not being able to see what else is
going on on the other person's end it'd
be kind of cool we'll think about it I
could be fun
no other questions are we getting all of
our donations someone's that they gave
40 bucks an hour ago and it didn't show
it maybe not because I have not seen any
forty dollar donations no I did not
either or if you gave it on Kyle stream
but you did it like after we switched to
my stream then maybe that was missed
that's cool down open house still okay
with that though but yeah it does seem
like the donations have been coming
through but yeah sorry if we missed any
of them if you did happen to donate $40
thank you very much as much appreciated
yes indeed but oh let's see maybe two
more questions sure all right how what
is the best know how do I give you money
you need to be on gaming youtube com
instead of www youtube com you /
whatever the URL is for a live show or
you can wait on us to become twitch
partner and then you can subscribe to us
yes that's another option but if you're
on the gaming de youtube com there's a
little dollar sign down there and you
can use that to donate we look five
years younger in this episode well
that's cool like we're back at newegg
I'm happy with that I'm glad that you're
lean slightly cleaner look as somehow
carried over to a new make me look
younger too yeah it's contagious it's
