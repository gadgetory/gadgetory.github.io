launched their GeForce GTX 1080i
continuing their time-honored tradition
of making a faster GPU with ATI on the
end I have a set of benchmarks at 4 km
1440 with overclocking included for you
guys today
the first let's plow through the
requisite specs and pricing info this is
the 1080 Ti founders Edition the
reference design from Nvidia essentially
and they are not charging 100 bucks 100
bucks extra for it this time
the founders Edition and third party
designs which are expected in April will
have a base price as $700 in third-party
designs will probably go up from there
depending on how premium they are the DC
X 1080 price is dropped to $500
meanwhile and somehow all of this seems
relatively affordable that is if your
relatives happen to be rich and willing
to give you money to buy high end
graphics cards Nvidia claims that the
1080 Ti is 35% faster than the 1080 and
we're going to find out for sure in just
a moment when we get to the benchmarks
as per spekt the 1080 Ti is based on the
60 nanometer Pascal architecture it uses
the GP 102 GPU specifically which is the
same one that's used in in Titan XP and
it sports 3584 CUDA cores across 28
streaming multi processors GPU itself
has 12 billion transistors and a larger
diocese in the 1080 at 471 square
millimeters
there's 11 gigabytes of gddr5 X memory
by way of 11 32-bit memory controllers
or a sort of odd 352 bit bus width and
the V Ram has also been refined even
further by Nvidia and their partners to
run at 11 gigabits per second the TDP
for the card is 250 watts a 600 watt
power supply is recommended for your
whole system and the card and the
sounders Edition requires one 6 pin and
one 8 pin PCI Express power connector
physically the founders Edition 1080 CI
looks pretty much the same as the
founders Edition 1080 with the die cast
aluminum shroud and blower style fan
although it does have a completely
redesigned PCB and power delivery system
also there are only for display outs on
the back 3 DisplayPort and one HDMI 2.0
you lose a DVI out but Nvidia did
include a DP to DVI adapter at least in
their retail packaging the upshot is
that there's a lot more space back there
that's cleared for the cards exhaust
stuff for hot air to escape the card
measure is 10.5 inches long and
so it should fit in smaller systems
where over built third-party designs
might not for today's benchmarks I'm
comparing an overclocked GT X 1080 Strix
Edition from Asus width to 1080 TI both
in its stock and me overclocked
configurations the testbed is my perfect
RGB system back there that I built a
month or two ago with an i7 7700 K
running at 4.9 gigahertz 32 gigs of GCL
Trident VR GB memory at 3,000 megahertz
an ASUS Maximus 9 hero motherboard and
the xt kraken X 62 CPU cooler 750 watt
EVGA supernova g2 power supply and an OC
z Toshiba RG 400 one terabyte nvme SSD
all on a fan Tex and through evolved
tempered glass case so taking a look at
GPU frequencies first you can see my
overclock on the 1080 Strix which hit
about 2000 88 megahertz on the GPU core
max level is leveling out to about two
thousand sixty two when temperatures
increased under load the 1080i at stock
is much more conservative with the basin
boost clocks but GPU boost hit 18:48 max
unfortunately it falls off quite a bit
under load averaging about 1620 in my
testing I used EVGA precision x OC to
overclock v10 80 TI managing to hit
eleven thousand four hundred megabits
per second on the memory and two
thousand 88 megahertz max GPU frequency
but again that dropped down to the mid
to low 1900s about 1936 on average after
the GPU heated up here's a look at my
benchmarks with all three GPU
configurations
so that's not immediately obvious 210
atti is very fast and significantly
faster than a 1080 the game tested
matters quite a bit of course the scores
were very much closer in a more CPU
limited game like six for example but to
1080 CI is undeniably the fastest
graphics card now available lets you
count to tighten XP which according to j
it still beats most of the time the only
false to be found with the 1080 TIR if
you actually take in videos 35 percent
faster claims seriously and if you look
a little bit more closely at thermals i
suppose the price as well but we've
already talked about that overall in my
test the overclocked 1080 TI was about
21 percent faster than the overclocked
1080 strix you can see that 35% number
in some games and if you're comparing
stock speeds between the cards or
especially if you compare the stock 1082
and overclock to 1080 TI but i think if
you are seeing disappointment there it
was mainly just his nvidia over-promised
just a bit pratense though i hit 80 85
and 90 feet respectively max temperature
and the GPU boost throttling is
definitely a factor with a 1080 TI when
the temperatures start to creep up for
this reason i will sum up by saying that
i think you should wait until april for
the third-party 1080 t eyes to see what
can be done to achieve higher clock
speeds and better thermals the founders
edition here is great for small
form-factor builds and for system
integrators but for DIY builders i think
one of the really cool look in 1080 TI
designs which are already starting to be
teased by some third-party and
manufactures will be a better bet
finally here is the bang for your buck
slide frames per dollar across all my
game tests and even at $700 MSRP the
1080 TI is still keeping it in the buck
62 buck 80 range just FYI the actual
Strix 1080 that I use cost about $550
right now but since most 1080 scan Otzi
pretty well I left the MSRP of 500 bucks
on there so that would be a little bit
less than the dollars per frame
performance if I was charging it $550
which you - have to pay for it obviously
the 1080p is for people with deeper
pockets but it is nice to know that
you're not paying too much of a premium
for the top-end GPU in
is stable and that is all for my 1080 TI
review guys I hope you enjoyed it and if
you did of course please make sure to

store down any description thank you so
much for watching and we'll see you next
