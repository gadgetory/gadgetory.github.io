Pauls hardware this is my monthly builds
video for November 2016 I have to build
part lists for you guys today using PC
part picker one is a mini ITX build at a
thirty-one hundred dollar price point
the fastest Mini ITX gaming PC I could
put together and then one is a much more
reasonably priced one at about eleven
hundred dollars both mini ITX and both
of these are of course based on your
feedback from last month's build video
which was asking these questions and you
guys all voted on this one here at the
top I do have another straw poll linked
in the description down below you guys
should check that out for what you want
to see in December have a bunch of them
listed here including at green and red
Christmas themed PC and updated
entry-level x99 build that ones thanks
to Darsh again guna who posted that
suggestion in the comments from last
month's video so thank you for that but
let's get right into it because I have
actually been out of the country for a
couple weeks and I may be suffering the
ill effects of jet lag at any moment so
let's start with the the $3,100 fastest
possible Mini ITX gaming PC of course I
went with an i7 6700 K and the reason
for that is because it's probably the
fastest CPU can get for gaming now there
is an X 99 motherboard you can get that
as many ITX that's made by as rocket is
called the X 99 II ITX slash AC but I
ruled that out because this is a gaming
build and for gaming I think the 6700 K
is a better choice even than some of the
Intel enthusiast level chips now if this
was an all-around PC or something that
you're going to be using for workstation
or video editing or something then yes
that might be a better option now of
course we do need an a water cooler for
this CPU you could go with an air cooler
but I decided to go with water cooling
since this build is a little bit over
the top the processors coming in at
around 330 dollars depending where you
buy it the water cooler I went with this
in NZXT kraken x31 and this is 120
millimeter so it's going to fit a little
bit better in some of the cases that you
might choose for mini ITX builds and
it's got a smaller size little pump and
block mechanism down there at the bottom
which I went with mainly because well I
needed it to fit on the mini ATX
motherboard that I chose which was this
ASUS Maximus 8 impact this is going to
cost you around 230 to 240 dollars again
depending where you buy it and this one
is limited a bit around the CPU socket
because it has these vertical areas here
that it gives extra power delivery for
as well as that supreme effects audio
module that's sticking up right there is
this zoom function really is not doing
much for me here on the Newegg website
but anyway you can still see it there so
there's a little bit more limited space
around the socket but the benefits you
get with this board even though it's
mini ITX are that it's going to be a
really good overclocker and it's also
going to have much better audio then you
might get on pretty much any other mini
ITX board and that is a limitation of
mini ITX boards because you don't have
an extra expansion slot assuming that
you're using a graphics card to drop a
sound card into for example now for the
memory I went with the simple I was
going to do it one of the PC part picker
parametric filters for this but I just
went with this Corsair Vengeance lpx 2
by 16 gig kit this is ddr4 2666
and I mean I have this stuff right here
and it's pretty much just really basic
simple black looks good gets a job done
if you find other memory that you think
looks better than go for it because it's
not going to be a huge difference to the
overall performance what is going to
impact performance though part mainly
from the graphics card in the CPU is
your storage and here is where I
actually had a tough choice to make
because when you look at many ITX boards
you can find ones that have MDOT two
slots on them this board from Asus
actually has a u dot two which is like
right down here and then went with you -
instead of MDOT - so I was kind of torn
at first I was like maybe I should go
with the Mini ITX board that has an MDOT
two because there are faster
MDOT two drives then then you dot two
drives this one is the Intel SS or 750
series one with the four-door gig
version this is going to have like the
little plug on it and then a little
breakout thing and that's got a 2.5 inch
drive and then you got to sort of
connect the little mini SAS there and
the little adapter and the power and all
that good stuff but it is a very fast
SSD nvme and it's faster than any SATA
drive that you can plop in there now for
those of you who are saying you should
have gotten with the samsung 950 Pro I
hear ya that is a bit faster than 750
but I can't fit that on this board
because it's only got u dot 2 and I
opted for the better overclocking and
the sound rather than that so that was a
toss up that was definitely difficult
choice but this is what I went with so
I'm stuck with it the crucial time X 300
I added in there for additional storage
this is a 2 terabyte drive and it's just
just $500 for just under $500 if you can
find it for that much but it's a 2
terabyte SSD and that's pretty drool
with drool-worthy so gives you about 2.4
terabytes of total storage and it's all
SSD storage and then you have a graphics
card which is the Titan X Pascal because
it's the fastest gaming PC possible a
mini ITX form factor I like actually the
Nvidia cooler for the Titan XP and for
their reference cooler for the founders
Edition because it is a blower style
style cooler and that is often a better
bet to go with if you're going with a
smaller form factor something that's
more cramped because it's kind of got
its own little airflow system and it's
not going to contaminate the rest of the
case with warm air and then of course it
is the fastest gaming card really that
you can get right now especially if you
overclock it at least until the 1080 Ti
comes out if and when that does happen
now bear in mind you need do need to buy
this directly from the Nvidia website
and yes it is $1,200 which is really
really expensive but when you say go for
the fastest thing you can then things
get expensive so there you go
cases of course Schefter atti agonized
over the case decision I was going to go
with the N case m1
I think it's m1 the end case is a cool
little mini ITX case but it's actually
not listed on PC part picker and I want
the three ATT mainly be
even though it's a little bit larger for
a mini ITX case it has really good
airflow it especially has like a
ventilated side right here for the
intake for your for the graphics card
for the Titan XP and it's got the
freaking carrying handle on the top and
I always say if you're going to build a
mini ITX system portability is often
like a really nice thing to have for
that so I like mini ITX cases that have
handles makes them a little bit more
portable and then of course it's got
space for your drives right here it
actually have space for 3.5 inch drives
but that will fit the slightly thicker
2.5 inch intel 750 series you do need to
have a slightly slimmer or at least not
as as thick not as deep I'm not I'm not
using the right words here the power
supply should be thin so I did go with
the thinner power supply and the
Silverstone Strider titanium 700 watt
this is about a hundred and thirty-five
dollars the case in the power supply are
fairly expensive here at least there are
other options but you know I was it was
an expensive system so I was like screw
it we'll go with that silverstone makes
some really nice very thin lengthwise
power supplies that's what i'm trying to
say is the length no why isn't there a
good picture the length front to back
150 millimetres I believe on this one
they even have hundred and forty
millimeter once if you go with the 80
plus gold all black cabling which you
know that's good to have as well and hey
$20 mil and rebate on Newegg right now
be sure to jump on that
oh I'm are I'm already jumping ahead
myself so that is billed number one
which again comes in just shy of $3,100
there's a little parts listed right
there links of course to these builds
are in the description down below and in
my opinion this is pretty much the
fastest gaming PC that you could build
in the Mini ITX form factor
you know barring a few changes of other
things that won't affect the speed like
the case and the power supply there are
of course other options you could go for
there but after doing all that I was
like hmmm maybe I could do a little bit
more reasonable builds also the Mini ITX
form factor also a gaming PC I'm calling
this the second fastest Mini ITX PC so
this is build number two
and again all the parts listed here
comes in again just shy of eleven
hundred dollars ten 1065 so it gives you
a thirty or forty bucks to buy a Windows
10 license over on kinguin if you want
to this one's based on hardware that's
just going to be a little bit slower
also if you hear snoring in the
background that's here oh he's very
happy to be home but anyway this is a
sixty six hundred K base system and then
the graphics card is an r9 fury cuz you
can get those for a pretty good deal
right now anyway so save about hundred
dollars going with the sixty six hundred
K over the 6700 K you don't get hyper
threading but it's still quad-core and
you can still overclock it's available
from a variety of merchants of course in
the 230 to $240 range for a cooler since
I did go with a pretty small case here I
went with the cry Rig c7 which is a bit
slimmer form factor also does a really
good job though I've used this in one or
two builds now and I am happy with the
performance of course it's not going to
be quite as good performance wise as
some of the larger coolers that you can
get but I like it as far as the looks as
well as the silence and you're still
going to be able to overclock with that
and it only cost about twenty seven
dollars for the motherboard I still went
with an Asus here this is actually the
motherboard that I used in my wife's
builds the hot box system which you can
hopefully find a link in the description
to if I remember to put that I actually
modified this to be all black but you
can just leave it as is for this build
because you're not going to be able to
really see it the nice thing about this
board is that it does still have pretty
nice overclocking support for of course
your 6600 K as well as the memory that's
you're going to drop in there and it
does have an MDOT two slot on the back
which I'm not using in this parts list
but it doesn't mean that you could drop
an MDOT two SSD in there in the future
if you decided to upgrade your storage
for the memory I have a motion black
line kit here I just mainly went with
the 16 gig 2 by 8 ddr4 and I was looking
for something I usually like to go a
little bit faster than the baseline 2133
so this is 2400 and you can get it for
$74 into egg if you happen to buy this
today you can also get a there's a promo
code listed here too so you can get in
even another 18% off
if that's not available though just look
for any memory kit that's relatively
little profile 16 gig ddr4 2426 66 right
in that range and you should be able to
find that for around $75 for the storage
I did use a parametric filter so this is
an option you can use on a PC part
picker where you just set up a series of
search definitions so I want the
capacity type and form factor for an SSD
as well as an additional hard drive now
since this is the case I'm using is an
ode to o2 down here from fractal it only
supports two 2.5 inch drives but I
wanted to have an SSD to install the
operating system on and then a bit more
extra storage because you know if you're
only got a 240 gig SSD in there you're
probably going to run out of space
pretty quick so what that ended up
giving me was this run down here for the
SSD option let me sort that by price
again all I did was use the capacity
sliders here to go down to make sure
it's a 240 or 256 gig SSD and that was
pretty much it
also a 2.5 inch form factor and then you
sort that by price and then right now
the AMD are three to 40 gig is right
there for 60 bucks
of course the ever-popular a Data
premier SP 550 is there for around the
same price anything you can get down
here in this range is going to be good
as long as it's a current generation
SATA rep 3 SSD it should be fast enough
for your purposes I did the same thing
for a mechanical drive also 2.5 inch and
I found this itachi travel star one
terabyte for just shy of $60 and
clicking on the wrong page here but
again not a whole lot of options when it
comes to higher capacity 2.5 inch drives
at least if you're looking for 7200 rpm
you can you include 5400 rpm ones as
well but a 7200 rpm hard drives they're
just going to be a good deal faster than
5400 rpm and you know it's about the
same price as well ok moving on to the
graphics card I went with a Sapphire
Radeon r9 fury 4 gig because the fury
from AMD is still really nice sapphire
makes a very nice version of the r9 fury
4 gig it's more visible
here look look it's got three fans and
even though it's a little bit larger
it's still gonna fit in the case don't
worry I'd check the dimensions $270 is
really good price for the r9 fury and I
like this version it's got really good
reviews from and heroes trying to focus
head on my lap that's okay he's been
he's been away from us for a while he's
he's been a little sad anyway so get
that graphics card and if you don't want
to get that crap expired you want to
spend a hundred more bucks and make this
system even more powerful as a gaming PC
spend about 100 bucks more and find
yourself a gtx 1070 from Nvidia
okay the case is the fractal node - OH -
very popular small form-factor htpc case
but it can also be used to make some
pretty nice gaming systems here's here's
a look at the internal layout
so the motherboard goes on this side
that's got our little riser card so you
can put the graphics card down here and
there's a ton of space for the graphics
card in this area and it's got direct
ventilation for all them fans and look
how tiny it is when it's actually
standing up and stuff that's pretty cool
all right so all that stuff and then
lastly you will need a power supply the
power supplies options are going to be
well you have to have SFX for the node -
OH - and you have a more limited range
of options so I went with a 600 watt
here just so I could support some
higher-end graphics cards so this would
still work like if you wanted to drop a
gtx 1070 in there if you wanted to these
are a little bit more expensive about
110 to 120 dollars Newegg again as a
mail-in rebate check that out to make
with their mail and rebates all over the
place
but all told your system here is going
to cost just about $1,100 again maybe a
little bit less that's a very powerful
gaming system though for about $2,000
less than that
really really fast this gaming system I
could build this one's going to give you
50 to 90% of the performance that's
going to vary of course depending on
what games you're playing and I'm
comparing mainly the graphics card in r9
fury 2 a Titan X Pascal which is a
difficult to make direct comparisons
with since I don't actually have either
of those cards to test I've mainly been
relying on other reports online but
either way you go
that's going to be really fast system so
there you go guys let me know what you
think of these builds in the comment
section down below also make sure you
vote on the voting thing for next month
I will be building one of these systems
later this month than if you're watching
this video and looking for me to
actually build something sorry I don't
do that in then monthly builds video
these are parts lists but I will direct
you to my builds playlist also linked in
the description I have lots of builds
that I've done there my builds playlists
including my how to build a gaming
computer so if you have never built a
computer before be sure to check that
out because it's got step-by-step
instructions to walk you through the
entire process and then I have a follow
up video that shows you how to install
Windows and get everything set up just
right anyway guys I'm going to go pass
out because I'm starting to get the cold
sweats you kind of get when you're
jet-lagged everything is getting a
little surreal Hiro is kicking me under
the table but you might be dreaming
that's all for this video though thank
you so much for watching and we'll see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
