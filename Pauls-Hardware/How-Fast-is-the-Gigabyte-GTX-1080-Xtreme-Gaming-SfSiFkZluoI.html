it's built for mini ITX water-cooled
systems just like this one but watch out
if you get one Josh might just show up
or your house randomly fractal design to
find Nano as is small quiet and built
for mini ITX water-cooled systems just
like this one but if you get one watch
out because frankly josh might just show
up at any minute
know what Kyle's full of oh well
that was immersive and pulse still
Nigeria we've been here for like an hour
dudes get the hell out of here excellent
so remember back when there were almost
no GTX 1080s on the market now there's
almost too many from the Nvidia founders
addition to all the various varieties of
third-party designs so how is a custom
card like gigabytes GT X 1080 extreme
gaming to differentiate itself from the
others well five different ways I think
cooling noise aesthetics overclocking
and extras like accessories and stuff so
let's start with accessories and by the
way this version that gigabyte sent over
is the extreme gaming premium pack which
is $700 right now or the same price as
the founders edition when it's in stock
of course there's some very
professional-looking paperwork which
does have details on the 4-year warranty
which is a very nice long warranty so
that's good there's also that wrist
protector in there that you've always
wanted a double six pin two eight pin a
peg power cable an XMP 300 mouse pad
with stitched edges that also seems to
be pretty good quality and HDMI and USB
3.0 five and a quarter inch front panel
Bay that gives you extra connectivity on
the front of your case for the extra
HDMI plugs on the card itself an
expansion slot bracket if you want to
route those HDMI ports to the back of
the case an extreme gaming 2-way high
bandwidth sli bridge with a white led
logo and one slot spacing and the
ever-important extreme gaming case badge
all in all a nice kit of accessories
with some good value added especially if
you need that high bandwidth sli bridge
aesthetics is next this card has sort of
an angular industrial design definitely
distinct from the founders Edition and
while some of the exposed heatsink fins
can get bent pretty easily FM
I do think it's a pretty good-looking
design overall it's a triple slot open
cooler with RGB LED lights on the
extreme gaming logo and the fan stop
light which lights up when the fans stop
and yes that can be disabled and there's
also RGB LEDs on the X pattern that's
over the fans themselves you get 3 100
millimeter double ball bearing fans with
the center fan tucked underneath the two
outer fans and spinning in the opposite
direction gigabyte says this doubles the
airflow where they overlap which totally
makes sense because there's two fans so
twice as much science it does seem to
cool pretty well though the shroud is
made of metal and it's black with silver
and orange accents orange is pretty
minimal here but I would have preferred
a neutral color to get more flexibility
for the RGB LED lighting the backplate
is black metal and it also has two thin
orange racing stripes going along the
length the entire card is eleven point
four inches or 289 millimeters long and
if you couldn't already tell it's a
custom PCB design with two eight pin PCI
Express power connectors of course it's
also got Nvidia 16 nanometer 7.2 billion
transistor pascal based GP 104 GPU in
there so all the same specs as the other
gtx 280s on the market as well as a
gigabytes of 256 bit gddr5 X memory and
10,000 megahertz effective clock speed
video arts are three DisplayPort 1.4 's
one HDMI 2.0 be one DVI and then the
other two HDMI ports on the other side
of the card internally which are
intended to provide front panel
connectivity for VR head mounted
displays they can also just be used as
regular HDMI ports you don't have to use
them for VR but you could connect them
with extensions to the front or the back
of your PC with the included accessories
that I already showed you
onwards to overclocking gigabyte told me
that the extreme gaming 1080 does not
use pin GPUs so the overclocking was
pretty standard pretty much all the
typical 1080s out there hit about 2100
221 50 megahertz max frequency when
overclocked then after temps even out
under full load they usually run in the
2000 to 2100 range this card was no
different hitting just over 2100 max but
fortunately only pulling back to about
2075 under load which i think is
attributable to the improved cooling and
power delivery compared to the founders
edition here are some 3d mark higher
strike results with the overclock
running just to show you what kind of
prefer
if you can expect if you go this route
for benchmarks I'm going to change
things up a little bit and run some live
gameplay testing kind of like I did with
my rx 480 21 by 9 video last week you
can check that out right there
I played each game in the preset OC mode
at 2560 by 1440 and 4k you can see the
on screen frame rates as I play and I
recorded the screen so screen capping
wouldn't conflict with the results so
let's start with some doom using the
Vulcan API at 2560 by 1440 all right so
we're playing some doom I've have it set
to Vulcan using Vulcan so the on screen
displays here in the top right that'll
have the frame rate as far as video
settings go starting off at 2560 by 1440
FXAA and then now we have set to the
ultra quality pretty much and of course
Vulcan
no no not bad at all Vulcan definitely
give some added performance compared to
DirectX 11 now let's try 4k 3840 by 2160
okay moving on to some gta5 I am set up
for 2560 by 1440 right now everything's
mostly set to very high with some stuff
set to high you can see all the settings
right here and I've also set up the
webcam so you guys can get a closer look
at the actual framerate

okay we are now at 4k 3840 by 2160
everything else pretty much the same no
AAA and everything else is it higher
very high
oh I dodged you sir
I'll watch as I just gas this monster
van just gonna easily outrun these
police cars maybe not okay moving on to
super mirage because why not so starting
off back in 2560 by 1440 we are at epic
graphics quality and I've set the render
scale to 100% to make sure that it
doesn't automatically change it because
that kind of messes with your actual
results anyway just going to play quick
play game alright so as you can
hopefully see by me dying repeatedly my
frame right here it's been fluctuating
it's definitely fluctuating more but my
favorite some fluctuate a little bit but
generally in the low range has been in
the 110 to 120 and then beyond that it's
being it has been peeking it like you
know 130 to 150 in certain situations
but you know I don't know I don't know
how to explain that exactly oh look a
lemonade someone and finally here's some
epic settings overwatch at 4k
so say in 60 to 70 frames per second
maybe up to 80 not too bad at all again
we're 4k playing overwatch at epic
settings so if you've got a 60 Hertz 4k
monitor like a s right about where you
want to be gigabytes extreme engine
software can be used for overclocking
fan control and LED lighting for
overclocking it gets the job done has
all the necessary sliders that it needs
but I think it still needs some
additional features in my professional
opinion specifically the monitoring
window which can be popped out but
cannot be resized and also it does not
show any min and Max values over time or
any values when you mouse over the
histogram so I'll be sticking with MSI
Afterburner or EVGA precision X for now
anyway though the LED control is there
and can be used to set the LEDs to solid
color breathing flashing or reactive
modes based on GPU temperature or load
for example you can choose a single
color or the rainbow mode and you can
also punch in RGB or hex color values
for the single color which is actually a
really great option to have and why you
can't control the individual lighting
areas on the card you can control the
lighting for two different extreme
gaming GPUs and the sli bridge at the
same time all via the software so I've
talked about aesthetics overclocking and
extras but what about cooling and noise
cooling is awesome on this card I don't
know if it's the overlapped fans or the
huge triple slot design or what but this
is the coolest running 1080 that I have
tested heading only 60 see max under
load while testing ambient temperatures
by the way we're steady 77 to 88 degrees
Fahrenheit or 25 to 27 degrees Celsius
this is using the stock fan profile and
the OC mode in the extreme gaming
software as for fan noise I will let you
listen for yourself here's the fan at
idle or zero fan mode here's 40 percent
which was about the average speed under
load
here's 70 percent which is what the fan
would hit if the GPU ever got up to 80
degrees C which it never even got close
to and here's the fan at 100% speed just
to hear what it sounds like
and now it's conclusion time so based on
those five criteria cooling noise
aesthetics overclocking and extras
gigabyte has designed a very nice gtx
1080 in the extreme gaming with all the
extra stuff you get for the seven
hundred dollar price tag this kit should
be a no-brainer compared to the founders
edition but there are other third-party
designs to consider if you like
gigabytes design aesthetically if you
want a cool and quiet card and if you
are interested in a two-way SLI
configuration of the future I think it's
a relatively good value if I were to ask
for more I would have liked to see
binned GPUs in this card like they did
with the extreme gaming 900 series as
overclocking wasn't really any more or
less impressive than other cards like
the EVGA gtx 1080 for the win or even
very much over the founders edition if
you don't consider temperatures and
throttling the orange accents also need
to go and it would be nice to see more
protection for the cooling fins that
protrude and just seem very prone to
getting bent of course there's also the
VR features to consider and front hdmi
ports for a head-mounted display are
pretty damn useful in a lot of
situations I'm very curious to hear what
you guys think of this card though so
