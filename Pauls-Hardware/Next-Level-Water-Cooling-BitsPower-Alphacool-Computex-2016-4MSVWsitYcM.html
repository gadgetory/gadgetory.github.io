sponsored by fractal design MSI and
g.skill alright guys I'm over its power
and I've decided to do a video all about
water cooling and just some of the water
quality stuff that I've seen here at
Computex because I've been kind of more
into it lately so I had to come by bits
power they have some epic builds here
some modded systems that are absolutely
amazing I'm going to show you a lot of
those at the end
first off I'm going to head over to a
couple other locations so why don't we
check out alpha pool continuing my water
cooling tool around here at alpha cool
they are out of Germany and they have
some fun new products so let's start off
with this one right here this is called
the high Shola all of their product
names are in German and I've been having
a difficult time pronouncing them so I
originally thought it said ice ice whole
asshole I don't know anyway basically
this is an external radiator 360
millimeter so you get 320 millimeter
fans in there it's got a reservoir up on
top it's got some alpha cool lighting
down at the bottom in blue and you can
basically set this up externally if you
have a small system and you're doing
water cooling and you don't have enough
space in there for radiators or you just
need more heat dissipation you can grab
that and place it somewhere outside your
case so there you go next up we have
some new fittings these are the eyes
popping eyes up eyes is Upton
I apologize to any my German viewers for
my terrible German pronunciation alcohol
was introduced to me by my good friend
Jay Jay's too since and I have learned a
lot about water cooling from him and he
works with alcohol and he has provided
me actually some ethical fittings in the
past now what he said about them was
that they're very rock solid as far as
performance he never really had any
issues is with leaks or anything like
that however he did have some issues as
far as the logos that were on them and
certain wibbly-wobbly miss so to speak
but they're new types of fittings are
much much better designed and I'm much
much better put together and
particularly they have this black finish
on them which is very clean and I've got
with a laser etching for the logos on
them which is going to hold up over time
much much better than a printed logo
that might go over the top so new
fittings from from alpha cool again
they're called eyes opt-in eyes happen I
mean happy hey here's something that
might be a little bit more practical if
you don't want to do a full custom loop
you can kind of go in between this is
the ice bear and these are made for
expandable closed-loop cooling so they
used unicorn fittings they even have
quick disconnects that are integrated
there as well these are actually similar
to the iceberg coolers that Coolermaster
used to have alpha cool actually worked
with coolermaster for those in
particular they of course have the pumps
which is down in the bottom it's got a
little clear window so you can see
through to what's going on in there and
ice and alpha cool has actually added a
lights via the alpha cool logo that's on
top of each pump / block unit that light
will turn off if the pump happens to
fail which is very nice feature to have
because you can't always tell if you
have pump failure and it's something you
definitely want to catch really soon
especially if you're
able to cpu overheating or something
like that anyway these have all copper
radiators and they're going to be
available with 120 millimeter radiators
240 360 as well as 280 and let's take a
look at the GPX Pro this is an
expandable GPU all in one unit so you
get the pump it's actually integrated as
part of that large aluminum block there
the pump does have a copper block on the
bottom the aluminum part is going to go
over the GPU and it's going to help keep
cool all of the parts that need to be
kept cool apart from the GPU such as
power delivery VRMs alpha cool already
has this available in a ton of different
variants for a ton of different types of
GPUs they even told me that if you
happen to have a GPU and they don't have
the design for it available you can send
them your graphics card they'll use that
to create a 3d model to create a new one
and then they'll send you one for free
just for helping them out with the R&amp;amp;D
by sending them your GPU for them to
check out which is pretty nice that the
other cool thing about it is that that
pump unit at the center can be removed
as sort of a standard size so if you
happen to upgrade your GPU but you want
to keep your same pump and loop you can
just swap out the aluminum part drop it
on a new GPU and then drop that pump
part back in there and you're good to go
it's even available in a variety of
colors so this is the actual GPU
standalone version that we're looking at
right here it doesn't come with an
all-in-one unit but it still uses that
same central copper block / pump so here
we have a bunch of different varieties
in different colors they have red they
have green they have blue you can't
order the colors individually you need
to sort of group up they do it have to
do them a little a little batch I
suggested maybe they trim master up for
that
kind of useful but as we can see here we
got a red version it's made for fury we
have a blue version it's made for a GTX
970 and we have a large green version
that I don't know watch a few that's
pork it's for a large GPU and yes it
does come with a backplate as well as
you can see here in this yellow version
very nice some cool water cooling
products from alpha cool guys I'm here
at Ida cooling and basically I came here
because I saw the video that's Wendell
and Kane made over here so I'm stealing
from tech syndicate well not really but
I D cooling they're currently based out
in China they actually distributes to
areas of Asia South America
not necessarily the US although I've
heard you can get some of their products
from like eBay and that kind of thing
anyway though I want talk about the
stream series of cases since this is you
know my liquid cooling video and these
are interesting concepts for liquid
cooling Sassy's so the first one we're
looking at here is the stream 2 this one
is actually in production and mass
production basically what they've done
is they've taken an aluminum frame
chassis this is a similar sort of
concept I think to the in wind chassis
but what they've done with the aluminum
is is they've treated the inside of it
and they've routed water cooling through
the chassis so there's different
channels there's different inlets and
outlets so you can pipe the liquid
cooling into it'll go over and through
to a different area of the chassis and
it'll come out and since it's created
inside even though it's aluminum you can
mix it with with copper blocks and that
kind of thing so you're not going to get
any mixed metals issues they're just so
unique concepts
here's another system with the stream
one this is available in red of course
and again this is the same general
concept but now it's in red this is a
different shape what do you guys think
now honestly I was looking very closely
at this because I know aluminum is
difficult to work with especially if
you're welding the well done here
exactly aren't exactly the phrase that
I've ever seen this one is actually more
of a proof-of-concept so this is the
stream core that we'll be at right
now this one is also in red this one's
mini-itx but you can see power supply
drives go down there at the bottom you
also have a graphics card in there I
think they're using some GPS and stuff
from colorful you know stuff again you
can't get in the u.s. since this is a
based out of China
this one has a unique feature though and
that it also has a monitor mount so you
can position this on your desk put the
monitor on the back of it and then
people walking by your desk would be
like holy crap you have a really cool
computer on your desk and finally here's
a look at the stream 3 the stream 3 this
one's in blue this one's very
eye-catching I like the way they have
the radiator positions it's right there
across the top three hundred and sixty
millimeter radiator of course and for
this one I actually know exactly how the
liquid channels will work basically even
though you have these two that are side
by side right here it's it's split in
the middle so you would go in here and
it goes across the top over to the other
side or you can get in here it'll go
down along the bottom rail and then it
comes out right there in the middle and
of course the other one from the middle
goes over and up the other side
Eydie cooling has indicated to me that
they are interested in entering the
North American markets and they even
suggested that they might be able to
send me one of these so let me know in
the comments section guys if you think
it would be cool to build a system with
one of one of these streams a cease and
let me know which one you think would be
best oh one last thing I wanted to point
out is
the nasals flow indicator down here at
the bottom of this one they're talking
about doing something to give you a
better visual in the actual aluminum
tubing itself so possibly maybe a flow
indicator or something like that across
the top I think that'd be a good idea
anyway guys let me know which is easy
like this okay nine back over a bits
flower as promised and I think I want to
start off by sharing a few of the new
products first off fittings this part is
very known for really high quality
fittings they have kind of a new finish
on their fittings now it's available in
a wide variety of colors and available
of course for hard tubing or soft tubing
or any kind of fittings you need to go
in between any of those I really like to
finish on them they do have the bits
power logo so it's a little bit more
subdued I think which is kind of nice
and we've seen these using some of these
epic builds that they have around here
so I think it's going to be a great
option as opposed to the standard finish
that we've seen them using for quite
some time I also noticed a few GPU
blocks that they have here we of course
have the reference GT X 1080 water block
just came out so great that they have
one available here and it's a different
sort of variety and we've seen before
has sort of a black on there and then
the clear acrylic as well you can see
through I think it looks pretty nice
granite it was behind a glass case so I
couldn't really pull it out and get it
give it a full once-over but I like it
very clean look overall they also did a
special version of Emmet for MSI's
specific version of the GTX 1080 and
1070 so for MSI's custom PC be able to
get those very soon as well since those
are actually coming to the market the
1080 should be available from MSI within
the next one to two weeks or so I am
told now we also have a really really
awesome mono block here it's actually a
combo block mono block for the MSI
godlike gaming motherboard I just saw
this and I looked really cool and I like
model blocks and I have this motherboard
so I'm going to see if bits prior will
send me one of these but we'll worry
about that later so some pretty cool new
products here from bits power but I'm
going to end this video as I
a couple of the videos of my copy text
coverage already with just a montage of
some really really epic modded systems I
hope you guys aren't getting bored of
epic epic modded systems and me showing
you montages of them if you are I'm not
going to stop I'm just going to keep
doing it anyway here's some really
really cool systems by bits power they
did a fantastic job I want to say one
last shout out and thank you to my
sponsors for this event MSI fractal
design and g.skill give them a thumbs up
then click their spots or link down the
description down below and hey if you
enjoyed my Computex videos let me know I
leave me a comment I'll see you guys in
the next one
