hardware i am back after a bit of a
hiatus after coputex but then jumping
right back into things with my June
builds video this is part of my monthly
build series every month at the
beginning of the month I hired out a
couple systems I build one of them
during the middle of the month and then
hopefully some time towards the end of
the month I actually test it give you
guys some performance numbers and some
feedback on the build process so
starting out for this week
everything is fueled by you guys and I
asked for your feedback by the way if
you want to see any actual build since
I'm not building anything today check
out my builds playlist I'll link that in
the description but last month I asked
what PC builds do you guys want to see
in June and overwhelmingly more than a
third of you guys voted for the ultimate
home theater PC which I'm very happy
about because I've actually put this
home theater PC option on the list for
quite a few months in the hopes that it
would be chosen at some point not
finally has I will be building my
ultimate home theater PC but I have to
confess that this month's part parts
list were a little bit difficult to
actually put together there's weird
things going on right now like the
imminent launch of a couple big
platforms from both Intel and Intel and
AMD there's the current issue with
graphics cards being difficult to find
due to aetherium mining and other
cryptocurrency mining that's going on
out there that's making the prices go up
for AMD cards in particular and make
them really hard to find and with Nvidia
cards is starting to affect them as well
so all that taking into can end them
into consideration
feel free to vote for next month's
builds which is also linked in the
description what do you want to see in
July put a pretty wide variety of
options there so you guys can choose
which one you feel would most suit your
needs or that you most like to see but
actually only have one build for this
month so this is my $1,250 silent
familis home theater PC and this is not
the system that I may be building later
this month although if you guys ask for
strongly enough maybe I'll consider
putting something together like this now
I went with a idea from the get-go here
that this was going to be a higher-end
system didn't decide till later on that
the graphics cards graphics capabilities
we're pretty much going to need to be
nerfed if it was going to stay families
that's why a couple of the parts are
higher ends but it's meant to
potentially be able to drop in
a higher-end graphics card if you decide
you're willing to deal with a little bit
of fan noise in return for a lot more
gaming performance so we've got a core
i5 7,500 T processor if you guys are
wondering why I didn't go with Rison for
this one because there are 65 watt TDP
processors for on the new Rison platform
that would be great options I wanted a
family schooler I decided on this no fan
CR 95 C fanless cooler and basically I'm
not I'm not confident that this has an
amp or mounting bracket yet so for that
reason I went with Intel this time
around so for the main processor I have
an i5 7500 T this is the low-power
version of the quad core i5 so kind of
like a 7600 K but no overclocking and it
runs at a lower frequency it's still a
reasonably high price it's a little over
200 bucks so this is a significant part
of this budget however you can keep that
cool with something that is familis
because it's only got a 35 watt TDP this
actually has a 95 watt dissipation
capacity for the no fancy are 95 C but I
wanted it to stay relatively cool so 35
watt TDP CPU this beastly big old fan
was cooler and you should be good to go
and keep your temperatures down and not
have to worry about any think it's
getting too warm in there I also had to
pay close attention to the motherboard
because with this massive cooler you
actually very very frequently lose the
top slot to the top PCI Express slot on
the motherboard and no fan actually has
a charter on their site that tells you
specifically which motherboards that
does that with basically you need a
motherboard where the top slot is one of
these single slot deals like here on
this asrock board versus having these
x16 slot on the top that gives you a
little bit more space so you can still
fit the graphics card in the by 16 slot
that meant that Mini ITX was out as well
because that top slot is too close for
and pretty much any situation you have
there and I did want to add a
supplemental graphics card so of the
current generation compatible with KB
Lake motherboards that are out there
pretty much as rack was the only one who
had a few that did to have that
configuration and I went with the asrock
h1 10m HDS it's only $52 probably the
biggest downfall here is going to be the
audio solution that you have but other
than that it's got all the connectivity
you'd want for the CPU memory and
everything else that you're going to
plug into this system for memory since
we don't have to care about aesthetics
internally in here at all just with the
Corsair Vengeance lpx kit low-profile
solid good compatibility and mainly the
low profile things that I was looking
again for clearance with that CPU cooler
I wanted plenty of storage I wanted a 2
terabyte SSD but I ended up going with
the Bushkin reactor 1 terabyte because
again that's a pretty significant part
of the price I wanted to have plenty of
storage for media and that kind of thing
that would be able to be called up
quickly and especially if you're doing
DVR capabilities with this that's
important so price per gigabyte this is
the cheapest one terabyte SSD that you
can get right now that's the current
generation product there of course
plenty of other options in here but 250
bucks for one terabyte is pretty much as
good as it's going to get right now when
it comes to a big SSD with plenty of
performance it actually makes more sense
to get 2 of those 1 terabyte SSDs
as opposed to like one of the two
terabyte SSDs because those start around
6 or probably 700 bucks at the minimum
right now going back to a family stuff
we have the pallets geforce gtx 750ti
calm x video card and here's another one
where i was just sort of confused and
had to figure stuff out first off and
passively cooled a gtx 1050 Ti so for
1080 gameplay it's going to do just fine
it's difficult to find in the u.s.
couldn't find it listed it just about
any retailer right now except one called
bonanza
that where it's available for a hundred
and eighty dollars it's a little bit
easier to find actually if you're in
like the UK that you like Europe area
because I know that's very general but
it just seems to be like there's more
fanless PC fans over there if you got
another option here's an XFX familis rx
460 again I think the price on this is
higher than it should be due to the
aforementioned aetherium cryptocurrency
mining that's going on but it is famis
it will allow you to do 1080 gameplay
and also connect up your 4k monitors and
whatever else you want to do or 4k a
home theater television and you know get
get off the ground if you can't find
that pilot card for the case I
checked out quite a few home theater PC
cases I ended up deciding on a 5min EC
its micro ATX first of all so it matches
with the motherboard it's practical case
so it's got a nice clean design so it
should fit in in a living room
environments and I've actually built in
this case actually my current HTPC is in
this case I did choose the family I'm
sorry the side panel version that is
solid not not with the window like this
one so that means it's going to block
the interior view as well as the noise
because we don't want any leds or
anything like that the shining out for
us now quiet PC comm is actually where I
browse for quite a few things today as I
was just doing some research on this and
actually have a listing here of a bunch
of other options for really quiet HTPC
cases that have been more designed for a
living room environment street comp has
quite a few as actually interested in
this one further down the cool tech cool
cube Mac cv4 which is an aluminum case
doesn't look terribly expensive only
about 51 pounds on the quiet PC site and
comes in black or silver and micro ATX
and seems like a good option but again
pretty much impossible to find in the US
so that I'm mainly given this as a
shout-out to you guys over in Europe who
might actually be able to get your hands
on some of this stuff sticking with
families we have to have a family our
supplies as well so we have the C Sonic
520 watt 80 plus platinum fully modular
you know it's it's a sea sonic it's
really solid build quality it gets a job
done
hey JD + platinum it's really hard to
find much higher wattage in this with
the fanless power supply but fortunately
you don't need much beyond that now I
wanted to say at the beginning of this
video and I forgot to but I'll say it
now that one of the big questions you
should ask yourself if you're building a
home theater PC is do you want cable a
lot of people don't because cable
cutting has become very popular and if
you have an internet connection you can
probably get access to all the stuff you
want however a lot of people do have
cable a lot of people want to still have
cable they might have shows what they
like to watch that they can't access
otherwise and having cable in your htpc
at least if you're in the US is a little
bit of a challenge depending on how you
go about it my recommendation if you
want a direct cable connection cable not
over-the-air is to go
something that has a CableCARD solution
you rent the cable card from your cable
provider whoever that happens to be they
should provide it to you for free some
of them will carry two to five bucks a
month rental costs for it which sucks
but that's usually less than a 10 to 15
bucks they charge you for a DVR and then
you can build your own HTPC that has all
the DVR capabilities you want I have a
Seton Card C eto n and that company is
pretty much toast at this point they
have gone out of the business but their
cards still work they're still
functional and the problem is that it's
really difficult to get them to work
with Windows 10 so my htpc right now is
still based on Windows 7 here's another
option though this is an external
silicon dust HD homerun Prime it has a
cable card slot at the back so right
there in that M card slot is where the
cable card goes in connects to your
network and then you can actually
connect up to three computers to be
simultaneously watching you know cable
TV broadcasts at the same time they have
a chart here for the differences between
their product it's only about a hundred
twenty-five bucks
and again it's external which is nice if
you don't have room inside if you don't
have expansion slots for something like
a PCI Express device if you don't want
cable then just don't get this and get
everything from the internet that's
that's the other option in there but I
wanted to include that for people who
want to keep cable and that also ties
into my second sort of build which isn't
really a building I'm getting ahead of
myself
finally I've got this device which is a
basically a remote you want a remote for
a htpc this one's by B bite or whatever
but it's inexpensive it's only about 15
bucks
Kodi remote and it's also got a backlit
mini wireless keyboard on the back so
you can type in stuff as well as using
it as the remotes works a bunch of
different stuff but it's PC compatible
so it will work with Windows to control
windows stuff and there you go that's
pretty much all the stuff you would need
for an HTP see again this one's a little
bit on the higher end it's well over
$1200 it is completely familis and
passively cooled though so that's kind
of the main thing about it it would be
silent so for watching movies or
anything else you want to watch and hear
the audio for nice and clear I think
that would be a great option now again
I'm going to be building what is my
ultimate home theater PC and I actually
have some questions at some dilemmas
overcome so my career HTPC has been in
service for well over a couple years now
and I have a couple other videos on
HCPCS on my channel if you guys want to
check it out it was like literally
nothing but a bunch of stuff laying out
on the desk at one point I had a bunch
of hard drives and raid5 configured in
there at some point as well but all of
this internal stuff is still in use I've
just swapped it over to the fractal
define mini see which I did I guess in
November of last year
define mini C is currently living out in
my living room which I should hopefully
have a shot of here in just a second so
there's my living room actually have a
new TV now but it sits over here on the
right side and it's been doing a great
job although you know it gets dusty and
stuff like that so stays quiet but
here's what I want to do for the next
version the next generation my ultimate
home theater PC if I want to be able to
get cable TV signals and have the DVR
capability I wanted to be able to game I
want to be able to do modern games which
means like DirectX 10
I'm sorry DirectX 12 Windows 10 support
would kind of be needed in there finally
I want it to be not fanless I don't
think I can go that route but I want to
be as quiet as possible and therein lies
my dilemma so if I want to stick with
CableCARD then I basically need to
either run Windows 7 or I need to figure
out how to shoehorn Windows Media Center
which is the current functional updates
and gets all the broadcast listings and
everything utility or software in
Windows that works for home theater pcs
they they removed it with Windows 10 you
can still get it and install it with
Windows 10 but I've searched the forums
and there's like it's like hit or miss
sometimes it works and sometimes it
doesn't so I'm considering taking my
existing HTPC once again which is based
on a Maximus 5 gene z77 motherboard it
has an Intel Ivy Bridge 35 70 K in it I
believe and then it also has of course
the Seton Fortuner cable card as well as
it's got a big hard drive in there and
sisty so if i want to stick with what
works I'll probably stay on Windows 7
and use the core components from that
system to be one part of my HTPC have
that working and it always on and
functional as the DVR but then have it
put the DVR'd captured footage into a
shared folder that I can then access
with a secondary system that I also
build that's much more powerful that
runs Windows 10 that probably has a
different UI or interface something like
Kodi that I might be able to use Kodi
it's Cody right now Cody it's all that
it's to say I need your guys's help in
choosing what I should do first off
should I stick with cable that requires
cable card of course it requires Windows
7 unless I want to try some janky
Windows 10 workarounds that may or may
not work it would also require me to
keep using my existing htpc core
components because it's got Windows 7
and it is functional already also my
wife might veto that so bear that in
mind as well because she has some TV
shows if she likes to watch should buy
HTTP see be based on dual systems again
I'm considering taking one system having
it always-on having that be the system
that does the DVR capture having a
secondary system that I turn on when I
want to actually watch TV that has
access to the DVR stuff and that it's
much more powerful and capable of VR and
that kind of stuff because I definitely
want this to be a VR capable HTPC or
maybe you don't care maybe I don't don't
care about those things finally should I
build all of this in a pre-made case at
one of those pretty cool HTPC cases that
you might have seen that already exist
should I do a custom or scratch-built
case since I might potentially be
building a system with like two micro
ATX builds in it or something like that
or maybe got the wall mounted root
because I could do that too if you
didn't notice in my living room I have a
decent amount of space I can't see it
very well here but I have a decent
amount of space right there to the right
of the television so thinking about
doing something vertical right there
just mount everything to the wall and
have it have it be there so that's
pretty much all I've got for you today
guys thank you so much for watching this
video of course let me know by voting on
those straw polls what you think I
should do as far as my next steps for my
ultimate HTPC build let me know what you
think of that passively cool fanless
HTTP
as well thought that was pretty cool of
course a challenge to get all of that
together if you're worried about price
to performance and you also want to keep
everything family but of course it
depends up button too if you enjoyed the
video subscribe if you want to see more
just like it I'll be back with more
videos coming very soon and we'll see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
