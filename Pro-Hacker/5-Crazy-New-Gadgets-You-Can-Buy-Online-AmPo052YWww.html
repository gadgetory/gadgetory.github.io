is the best we can come up with surely
there's a better way to mix our health
suffering us
on the sick of carrying around ugly
rattling bottles and drinking lumpy
nutritional shakes and half of which
would just end up in my shirt anyway so
I thought you know what I'm gonna do
something about this pro-mix is the
world's most advanced drinks bottle with
integrated vortex mixing technology the
pro mix mixing bottle utilizes a
scientifically engineered blunt blade to
harness the powerful mixing action of a
natural phenomenon the vortex where
studies have shown that the mechanical
stress caused by regular blenders can
damage fragile micronutrients a pro-mix
vortex mixing technology effectively
disperses powdered nutritionals keeping
them evenly distributed throughout the
liquid for the smoothest nutritional
shakes on the planet
it hasn't been easy we went through a
rigorous design process and 18 months of
development and too many prototypes to
count pro-mix is the perfect tool for
blending all powdered nutritional
products the sports nutrition powdered
proteins for other health supplements
it'll even make sure omelets for you
it functions brilliantly they were
equally proud of the beauty and
simplicity of its design we really tried
to think of everything from a totally
sealed easy-to-use drinks cap to
detachable motor unit leaving the bottom
in its own entity for improved
Portability and easy cleaning and it's
all powered by two triple A batteries it
couldn't be simpler
it hasn't been easy it hasn't been easy
it hasn't been easy we've been through
80 they all brushed or brushed and
finished aluminium it'll even mix your
mix for you you'll even mix your eggs
for your nuts
it'll even beat your eggs for you or
even mix a cocktail who can hot cheesy
go how about mixing your baby powders a
mean mojito in your pro mix
you
imagine if you didn't have to get your
phone out for every little thing what if
there was a simpler way to interact with
your devices flick is a wireless button
that connects to your iOS or Android
device so instead of going through your
phone you simply press the button that's
better I use the flick app to set it up
and then I can stick flick wherever I
want
I can even share this flick with my
roommate so he can use it when I'm not
around the flick isn't just for your
house you can stick your flicks anywhere
