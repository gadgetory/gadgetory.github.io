is the best we can come up with surely
there's a better way to mix our health
suffering us
on the sick of carrying around ugly
rattling bottles and drinking lumpy
nutritional shakes and half of which
would just end up in my shirt anyway so
I thought you know what I'm gonna do
something about this pro-mix is the
world's most advanced drinks bottle with
integrated vortex mixing technology the
pro mix mixing bottle utilizes a
scientifically engineered blunt blade to
harness the powerful mixing action of a
natural phenomenon the vortex where
studies have shown that the mechanical
stress caused by regular blenders can
damage fragile micronutrients a pro-mix
vortex mixing technology effectively
disperses powdered nutritionals keeping
them evenly distributed throughout the
liquid for the smoothest nutritional
shakes on the planet
it hasn't been easy we went through a
rigorous design process and 18 months of
development and too many prototypes to
count pro-mix is the perfect tool for
blending all powdered nutritional
products the sports nutrition powdered
proteins for other health supplements
it'll even make sure omelets for you
it functions brilliantly they were
equally proud of the beauty and
simplicity of its design we really tried
to think of everything from a totally
sealed easy-to-use drinks cap to
detachable motor unit leaving the bottom
in its own entity for improved
Portability and easy cleaning and it's
all powered by two triple A batteries it
couldn't be simpler
it hasn't been easy it hasn't been easy
it hasn't been easy we've been through
80 they all brushed or brushed and
finished aluminium it'll even mix your
mix for you you'll even mix your eggs
for your nuts
it'll even beat your eggs for you or
even mix a cocktail who can hot cheesy
go how about mixing your baby powders a
mean mojito in your pro mix
you
imagine if you didn't have to get your
phone out for every little thing what if
there was a simpler way to interact with
your devices flick is a wireless button
that connects to your iOS or Android
device so instead of going through your
phone you simply press the button that's
better I use the flick app to set it up
and then I can stick flick wherever I
want
I can even share this flick with my
roommate so he can use it when I'm not
around the flick isn't just for your
house you can stick your flicks anywhere
like in your car or on your bike
that's great
it's really cool
your destination is on the left
and you can clip your flakes it's great
for any situation where you need a quick
and discreet shortcut like now oh I'm so
sorry I have to take this but flight can
be so much more than just a shortcut to
your phone it can be integrated with
lots of different services beyond your
devices check this one out
take me home Gabby
and when I get home I want everything to
just take care of itself
Shh movies starting
another great feature of flick is that
it can be used as a safety device with
just a push of a button you can send
live updates of your location or even a
distress signal to your family and
friends
quick selfie first me and the Flik team

flick hi We're Swedish team that has
been working for almost two years to
create click and we're really excited to
finally show it to you we've gone
through a hardware incubator in San
Francisco we traveled all across Europe
and China to finalize design and to find
the right partners we have developed a
flake app to be super simple to set up
just open your app press the button and
select the function that you need we
also have an easy software development
kit that allows other apps to work with
flaky we already have some amazing apps
that will work with flick already from
the start and now we need your help to
make this all happen in order to bring
flick to the market and into your hands
we need to fund the tooling and
certifications that are needed in return

what if it was simple to use a regular
pen and paper notebook while saving
everything in the cloud perfectly
organized the way you want and what if
after you saved your notes in the cloud
and filled your paper notebook you could
just erase it with the push of a button
and use it again that's not magic

book app you instantly blast your notes
into the cloud using your mobile device

already use each wave notebook page has
seven symbols set up the rocket book app
to assign each symbol to a location
within Dropbox and Google Docs Evernote
OneNote or simply to your email inbox
let's see how Jake has his setup he
marks the diamond symbol and the rocket
book app sends the notes to his customer
meetings notes in Evernote when he's
brainstorming he marks the star symbol
which he decided are for the notes that
belong in his ideas folder in Google
Docs now that your notes are in the
cloud when your notebook is filled

make a cup of tea when our specially
designed thermal logo on the cover turns
from blue to white your wave notebook

reused and with your notes in the cloud

possibilities
