neighborhood in Hobart on our beer mixes
25 years later who was our passion for
cycling that led us to create innovative
solutions for active travellers and
commuters I came up with the idea for a
suit bag when I cycling to work in
Sydney there was nothing on the market
which enable me to transform my suit to
the office by bike or drive my clothes
in the office once a week I thought this
has got to be a better way my design
worked really well so together John
Lawrence Henty to improve the design and
sell to others with the same needs we've
now sold over 10,000 wingmen based on
customer feedback we've made over 20
changes to our original design to create
the copilot which is optimized for
travel the copilot incorporates that we
manage proven packing system the
patented rolling technology allows use
of transport suits and other clothes
Chris free the system has two bags which
can be used together or separately the
outer bag is compatible with a variety
of inner bags so you can tailor the
handi system based on your needs
the copilot can be carried on your back
so you can move through an airport or
onto a plane hands-free you can also
walk with it run with it or even jump on
a share bike our bags are now ready for
production with your backing and our
experience in manufacture and
distribution we will deliver to you the
best travel and commuter bag in the
market thanks for your support and help
to launch the anti co-pilot
let us introduce charges the world's
most advanced universal travel adapter
that also charges your mobile devices
without any additional chargers it works
in the USA UK Europe Australia and over
150 other countries the idea was born
out of the everyday struggle of people
on the go every time I go on holiday I
want to focus on what to wear but I also
have to carry around a lot of devices
that I don't want to think about but I
can't live without or when I am on an
important business trip abroad and I
want less luggage but I need my smart
gadgets all these devices require many
chargers that take up half of my space
and don't forget the countless number of
adapters around the world yeah I always
get those confused and there are never
enough outlets in hotel rooms to charge
all my devices at once that never
happens anymore because we have charges
charges conforms to plug standards in
the USA UK Europe Australia and 150
countries around the world
you can plug the device in any outlet
worldwide with all the plugs
conveniently stored inside charges saves
you space and the trouble of forgetting
or losing your Chargers the height of
the pins is adjustable to fit any mobile
case or protector now you can charge
your smart phones and tablets at the
same time using the two integrated pins
without carrying any additional Chargers
charges supports micro USB lightning and
USB C standards covering the whole range
of mobile devices and smart gadgets
great now we can charge my iPhone and
your samsung at the same time it also
works with other devices sharing the
same charging standards
char jest also has three additional USB
ports to make it the most convenient
Universal travel adapter and you still
have the outlet ready to use in addition
we created the charges Bank it's a power
bank that charges my phone up to three
times and has a USB port for any other
device it's been a great journey so far
we beta tested our ideas and pack them
into an awesome compact design we built
the PCB and model the design then we 3d
printed and tested some more this led to
the final working prototype that we sent
out to ten people to test for two weeks
we got their feedback and now we are
ready to go into mass production I love
to travel the world but I always find
difficulties in the outlet standards of
each new country now I visit yeah I
found charges and solve that problem
forever I mean it is so compact and
handy I've taken everywhere with me my
wife and I used to argue over who is
going to use the phone charger every
night yeah but chargers solve that
problem with its dual charging station
and we don't argue anymore forget the
old chargers go charges back us now on
IndieGoGo it started with man's most
primal ambition the desire to harness
the Sun alternative power has come from
humble beginnings but we never settled

fastpitch shelters can easily be set up
with two people lay out the roof palms
sign poles corner poles and fly start by
connecting the roof poles layout and
then assemble each side pole section
attach each side section to the roof
poles next extend the corner holders and
connect side poles to corner poles
once your frame is complete throw over
the fly
they'll crow the fly to the frame at
each corner inside
lift legs halfway clipping the fly two
corners and tighten once the fly is
firmly attached peg in the corners and
lift legs full way
finally PEG out guy ropes and your
