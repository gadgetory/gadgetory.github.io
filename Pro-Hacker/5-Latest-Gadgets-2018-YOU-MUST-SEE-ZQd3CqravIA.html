world through sight taste touch but
sometimes our senses don't give us all
the information we want now there's a
solution that can help identify things

introducing Linc square SDK a portable
spectrometer and development kit Linc
Square uses visible light to determine
the exact colors of objects and it uses
near-infrared light to detect their
molecular makeup included in your link
Square SDK is a link square spectrometer
a user's guide a set of sample color
chips USB charging cable and spectral
data collection software connect link
Square to a Windows PC using Wi-Fi next
place the link square in contact with
the object of interest then press the
button on the side of the spectrometer
link scale will gather data on how the
object responds to light and transforms
the data into a spectrum graph as a
developer you'll be able to use the
graphs you collect to careen
applications for personal use you can
cream absolute distinguish between
medications validate the authenticity of
gemstones and much more link square can
be deployed in a wide range of fields
such as research pharmacy education food
and environmental studies
strata OS engineers have tested the
software auto-type the hardware and
selected manufacturing partners all
that's missing is you

when I heard about cuvee I knew I just
had to have it my husband and I really
love entertaining having friends over
and while they used to come over and say
oh just whatever you're having now they
love that they can come in the house and
not have to settle for whatever is open
because they know I have everything open
the benefit of is accessing it you're
able to sample different wines and have
them on demand which allows you to
discover more wines and educate yourself
just really cool innovation which we
need in the wine business this is
something that it's going to help propel
technology and the future in terms of
wine packaging I'm really sad about the
cuvette wine portfolio because they
worked with famous great producers some
wineries with a great track record and
rate ratings and it keeps growing and
growing which makes me really excited to
see which ones will come out next being
intimately involved in the whole
production of wine and understanding
what it should taste like it's something
that I really appreciate about cuvee
I've had red wines that we've enjoyed
over six weeks that have stayed every
bit as good last glass to the first
glass that was poured is a real
breakthrough for me guaranteed wine
quality convenience and also fun
I am always afraid to bring technologies
that interfere with winemaking but this
is a very good way to help the consumer
who without changing the craft of the
one if you want a really nice glass of
wine on a Wednesday night with a good
pizza you can have that but you don't
have to open the bottle we can all start
with a glass of our favorite wine
explore different wines at different
times of the meal cuvee makes wine
really fun and now we have cube a
wonderful way for the consumer to
experience wine we're really big fans
we've become hooked on the whole cuvee
system it makes me feel like the most
awesome hostess in the world
you can put it in your pocket just walk
around with it sing just be free just
walk wherever you want and you can have
your fix with you instead of like dude
back lining control how long the effect
is cool people think I'm just moving
around that I think silly onstage but in
actuality I'm using my emotions to
control my vocal effects you get to play
with it and it immediately more natural
singing we all do it whether it's in the
shower or on a big stage it's one of the
greatest things to do and believe us
when we say we have something that will
take it to the next level
there are many professional singers
using sound effects on top of their
voice but why are more seniors doing so
well because effect controls are often
packed with sliders knobs and switches
add complex software into the mix and it
instantly becomes hard to understand a
singer needs to be free and expressive
they need to have an instrument that
follows their movements not the other
way around and that's why we created the
way to get an instrument that lets you
add effects to your voice
by simply twisting and moving it around
and around and around
this is not a revolutionary idea this is
a natural next step for singers and
vocalists it's an intuitive instrument
that does not interrupt your workflow
and will become an unmissable part of
your singing either on stage in the
studio or practicing at home so how does
it work
the widow automatically connects to its
app in the app you select a style or
genre so you can get started straight
away singing through the built-in mic of
your phone or tablet or use it with an
external one hold the wiggle in your
hand or attach it to your microphone
twist and turn the wiggle and you'll
hear the effects straightaway
export our ready-to-use effects in the
app or link it to your favorite studio
software over the last years we've been
developing the wicked with a small but
very dedicated team in the Netherlands

Kickstarter campaign two years ago our
project was successfully funded and got
picked up by many great artists
including some of the biggest lifx in
the world with the amazing support the
feedback of musicians and singers we now
proudly present the wiggle kit a product
designed and tested by artists or
artists it's compact intuitive and can
be trusted on stage even the big ones
