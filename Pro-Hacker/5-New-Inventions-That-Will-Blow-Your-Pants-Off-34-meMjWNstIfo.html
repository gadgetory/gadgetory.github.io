of the most important aspects of your
entire life
now Fitness is not easy we're out to
change that we're out to make putting
this more fun simple and social it's not
enough to just know that that you are
active or how active you were during the
day in order to really progress and
succeed you have to know exactly what
you were doing
Nuka is composed of two main parts the
first part is the hardware and the other
part is the software hardware consists
of a wristband and a shoe clip and the
software is designed to make your
experience is more fun social and
engaging we started out with some simple
concept illustrations until we arrived
at you know a beautiful and practical
design we wanted it to be as small as
possible and we went to great lengths to
make that happen
amigos about the details the details of
your activities and the details about
how your body is responding to those
activities our team has developed a
series of algorithms capable of
converting acceleration data into
descriptions of the activity that's
being performed which means you can
perform an activity at any speed and the
system will automatically recognize and
track the type of exercise and the
details of that exercise so things like
reps sets speed even intensity the
system can even differentiate between
very similar activities such as joy on
the treadmill which is the elliptical or
various types of bicep curls for golf
swings the system is designed to learn
about each user so the more you work out
amigo more valuable it becomes few over
time we can use your past data to better
predict and recommend workouts for you
in the future we get a fitness
experience where you can actually track
and see your activities and the
activities of your friends in real time
users can earn points they can set goals
and see their progress towards achieving
those goals they can set up competitions
and wager points with friends and
competitions they can even redeem their
points for discounts on supplements and
other health
gear because Fitness isn't fun when
you're doing it by yourself and that's
what amigo is all about that's the
essence of amigo when you can share
something that's really when you're
happy and the first thing you do when
you accomplish something great is share
it with some of them no matter what
exercise or activity you're performing
amigo will add value to the experience
fun simple and social and we've built a
platform that is perfect for that we
have a prototype that works and we've
created a brand new technology help us
put amigo into your hands preserve one
today
have you ever wondered what is causing
that slight headache or wooziness that
you feel at the end of your workday or
why your eyes burn when you cross the
street
do you wonder if this is going to cause
a long-term problem for you or your kids
air pollution both indoors and out is a
global problem today you can join us to
challenge it this is Admiral - a
wearable air quality tracker that
measures real-time air pollution
temperature and humidity it's the most
affordable and most compact air quality
tracker on the market today people don't
realize how what's in the air might
affect our health unless we have asthma
or allergies we don't notice any
immediate impact on our bodies and never
really care about the air around us but
during the day the concentration of
volatile organic compounds carbon
monoxide and carbon dioxide indoors may
increase dramatically if the ventilation
is not good enough with atmo tube it's
easy to track the pollution around you
and understand what you can do to
breathe better in the big cities we are
often exposed to air pollution outside
too but we are always too busy to pay
attention to it aDNA tube will
immediately alert you about potential
danger so you can prevent negative
health impacts admah tube can sense
environmental changes in real time to
help to make the right choices every day
and live healthier
we have been helping other companies to
invent and develop hardware and software
products for years then we finally
decided that it's time to solve our own
problem we've been working on a demo
tube for over a year to achieve the most
accurate readings from the sensors craft
it's beautiful and durable titanium body
and create the best user experience from
the data that the admah tube detects now
we're ready to share it with you
pre-order your atmo tube now and be
smarter about the air that you breathe
hi I'm doctor diva to me and this is
Lucy the flagship member of our Salonika
family say hi we see at Salonika we
believe that if the sun is shining we
should never have to turn the lights on
day lighting is the illumination of
indoor spaces with natural light and we
want to invite you to join the day
lighting revolution lucy lights up your
home or office with sunshine the first
ever of her kind
she is solar powered portable and
italian designed this is how lucy works
place lucy in a sunny spot indoors or
outdoors point her towards the area you
want to illuminate and turn her on lucy
will do the rest she will find and track
the sun for you and redirect that
sunlight back inside
turn off the lights and turn on Lucy
Lucy is also earth conscious powered by
solar cells she never needs to be
plugged in and think of how much you can
save by turning off the lights for half
of your day last but not least Lucy has
been built to be beautiful Italian
designed through and through Lucy will
never look out of place in your home or
office
besides the magic of day lighting made
simple what else makes Lucy special in
one word
sunshine Wow whoa
this is an entirely different room right
now I completely changed the actual
house itself I can read you can actually
see the color of that wall which you
couldn't do before
Lucy is no longer just an idea born from
the dark corners of my office at
Cambridge our engineering team has
already gone through multiple designs of
Lucy and we have a fully working
prototype the one that you see in this
video we have also started testing Lucy
in the field with our better tester
community and Telemachus head of
manufacturing is already hard at work
with a top three mass manufacturer to
bring Lucy to market that's why we've
come to IndieGoGo we're so excited about
bringing Lucy and all the benefits of
the sunshine she provides in indoor
spaces everywhere we really hope that
you will love Lucy as much as we do and
want to join the day lighting revolution

much for listening and let the Sun Shine
in
I have a child the life-threatening
allergy and if you do - you know how
important it is to definitely been after
I almost lost my son to a severe
allergic reaction I promised myself I
would always keep an EpiPen with him
wherever he goes no matter what the
problem is that epi pens have to be
stored in about room temperature and
with the skyrocketing price of epi pens
you probably don't want to have to buy a
new one if it accidentally gets too hot
or too cold
have you ever noticed that your EpiPen
packaging says the story rebbe pen at 68
degrees - 77 degrees Fahrenheit the
temperature requirements are on the
EpiPen box in the instructions booklet
and even on the EpiPen itself
these aren't suggestions they're
requirements from the EpiPen
manufacturer how can you go to the beach
go camping or go anywhere outdoors and
keep your EpiPen at about room
temperature
hi I'm Erik when Yuri the co-creator of
epi shell epi shell is a patented case
that protects epi pens from hot and cold
temperatures
the way it does this is surprisingly
simple
inside each efi shell is a patented
system that releases heat when it's cold
outside and absorbs heat when it's hot
outside it doesn't use any batteries
instead it uses advanced epi cells that
reset to room temperature when indoors
and then release heat or absorb heat as
necessary when outdoors so now whenever
you're running errands hiking or on a
field trip you can count on the
protection of an EpiPen after my son
almost died from severe allergic
reaction and nuts he made it a point to
always have an EpiPen with him but that
meant a lot of our favorite outdoor
activities were out of the question
that's not the kind of life we wanted
for our son which is why we created epi
shell we've been working on episode for
a few years and fortunately I have a bit
of experience with product development
after earning a master's degree in
engineering at Stanford I designed
medical devices as a principal engineer
at Medtronic then I started a company
making consumer products and some of my
inventions are sold in Apple stores all
around the world now after building the
first step you shelf to help my son the
process of bringing it to market to help
hundreds of thousands of people is
nearly complete over the past few months
we brought a functional prototype on
family trips to Yellowstone and Mount
Rainier it worked great here's the
dimensional prototype that represents
what we plan to start mass producing now
we've successfully tested every shell we
know it works and we've chosen
manufacturing partners who are ready and
waiting to start mass production so
here's what's next
custom manufacturing equipment is the
last thing we need to start mass
production and we need to collect enough
pre-orders to fund the purchase of this
women bringing Effie Shelton market will
save lives by labeling people to bring
their EpiPen with them wherever they go
even if it's hot or cold outside please
join us on our mission to Mable everyone
to keep their EpiPen
safe and close no matter where they go
thanks for your support
remembering to floss your teeth is hard
you practically need your own personal
dentist to remind you on a daily basis
wouldn't it be awesome if you had
someone who could not only remind you
but also encourage you to floss your
teeth regularly well now you do meat
floss time your personal floss reminder
floss time is the first smart floss
dispenser designed to help you build
daily flossing habits it simply mounts
to your bathroom mirror and acts as a
visual reminder to clean in between your
teeth with the push of a button
floss time automatically dispenses the
perfect amount of floss dentists
recommend you floss at least once a day
so if used regularly floss time lights
up with a fun smile for a job well done
but if a period of 24 hours passes with
inactivity floss time frowns at you with
a reminder light we know we're supposed
to floss but most of us forget
traditional floss designs are built on
century-old technology and are dependent
on us remembering to use them which
means they don't get used enough floss
time is a habit-forming device that will
make flossing easy yet nearly impossible
to forget the device comes with an
entire years worth of floss has a dual
user mode and includes colorful animal
snap-on's to make flossing fun for kids
as well
