immersive once in lucid dream you enter
a virtual world where everything you see
hear touch taste and smell is as
authentic as reality lucid dreaming has
been researched scientifically many
psychologists and researchers have
recognized that lucid dreams can help
with artistic creativity problem-solving
improving sports and language skills and
can even help people prone to nightmares

living in the future right now Jennifer
here has a smartphone that enables her
to auto ride home control the
temperature turn on the lights - face it
we're living in a technological
Wonderland and yet here we find Phil
Phil's forgotten the combination of his
travel lock is the current solution to
that problem we live in an era filled
with technological marvels and yet this
is what happens when Phil forgets a lock
combination is that the best we can do
no because we live in an era where the
airBaltic since the air box has a travel
lock you control with your smartphone
it's the law the future deserves a lock
with customizable security settings this
airball opens whenever my phone is
within Bluetooth rate well maybe you
don't trust anyone in your lives that's
fine the settings on this airball
require me to went to a password into
the app or maybe your air vaults been
stolen
that's fine too because you can set your
air Bowl to activate an alarm when it
moves too far away from your phone or
you can activate the alarm manually stop
that man
it's the justice the future deserves hi
Bill hi tell them what happened bill I
lost my bag you lost your we live in a
world where I can use my smartphone to
model my sleeping patterns but bill here
can't find his bag if bill have been
using the air bolt instead of some
antique you could have located it using
the air box crowd-sourced GPS networks
what if you lose your phone well you can
still unlock your air ball by logging in
for another device well you can enter a
backup button code using your hands like
some kind of prehistoric man
the air vault has a rechargeable battery
which only needs to be charged once a
year by a standard microUSB connector
it's TSA approved so F of security is
not an issue the app will record a
history of every time you've locked and
unlocked your airport you can even share
access to your a vault with your friends
so you'll be able to unlock it from the
other side of the world thanks pal

what is button we created the button
device for us humans to serve as a
physical touch point to the Internet it
is simple and intuitive everyone knows
how to use it just press it button tells
the end result of the press companies
distribute buttons to their clients or
point of sale to create a shortcut to
their services order a taxi food
maintenance services place reorders in
online stores or gather customer
feedback with buttons companies can turn
their products or services on demand by
offering super simple one press orders
or service calls some said they wanted a
smaller button something that is more
subtle it can deliver the same magic so
now we're proud and happy to introduce a
little sister or brother to the button
button mini it's not the size but it's
packed with the same magic Luton mini
has three different communications
alternatives to choose from mobile
theta6 Fox and Wi-Fi button mini has a
rechargeable battery lasting for a
thousand presses per charge the button
back end is the coolest thing of all it
lets you easily integrate buttons with
your existing infrastructure for example
have your service respond to the button
being pressed and then also deliver your
response back to the button for showing
green or red light to the end user
button actions are configured from the
cloud platform that comes in the same
package we're also introducing button
for commerce API which is a secure easy
and scalable way to deploy buttons as
part of any purchase ordering or other
commercial backend what does that mean
simple with a press of a button you get
your order done paid and delivered it
can't get any easier than that press the
button and the magic happens
chronic pains stress diet hot flashes
night sweats insomnia the list that
keeps us awake seems endless
whatever the reason most people look
over at their alarm clock each morning
and wish for more sleep temperature is a
key element sleep in fact it's
temperature change that triggers sleep
cycles I'm Todd Youngblood co-founder of
cryo our smart cooling sleep solution is
designed to help you sleep better by
sleeping cooler
the recommended sleep temperature this
is cool is sixty degrees Fahrenheit this
isn't a question of comfort this is how
we can dramatically improve sleep by
sculpting sleep cycles athletes don't
use a fan to recover they use an ice
bath or cryo chamber this is why we've
designed the cryo smart sleep system
with a thermo regulator that actively
cools water then circulates it in a thin
single sized mattress pad the quiet
control unit is small enough to fit
under the bed out of sight our cryo
system allows you to set the temperature
to the schedule you choose hour by hour
and day by day controlled by a
proprietary smartphone app either
manually or automatically the
temperature is adjusted to help you fall
asleep faster and lengthen deep sleep
the warm awake setting maximizes your
last sleep cycle by gently warm you
awake at just the right time by
connecting your cryo smart sleep system
to your Wi-Fi network we can access the
information on your favorite sleep
tracker or fitness
sleep improvement is shown on our app by
compiling sleep tracking data into chart
progress and optimize sleep efficiency
your core body temperature is at its
lowest during sleep but if you can't
maintain that cooler body temperature
you will wake up before you can truly
recover cryo offers a significant drop
in temperature that hacks into the sleep
cycle maintaining a cooler core body
temperature throughout the night testing
by professional Olympic and other elite
athletes has demonstrated phenomenal and
groundbreaking results several
professional athletes have mentioned
they now sleep through the night for the
first time in their adult lives through
that testing we're able to show lower
heart rates better recover times and
deeper sleep cycles resulting in an
increased sleep efficiency by as much as
20% that's like an extra hour of sleep
each night for free cryo combines three
elements track control and change track
using your favorite sleep tracker or
fitness band control using the
smartphone app and change change the
temperature to sleep cooler and enjoy
recuperative deep sleep
