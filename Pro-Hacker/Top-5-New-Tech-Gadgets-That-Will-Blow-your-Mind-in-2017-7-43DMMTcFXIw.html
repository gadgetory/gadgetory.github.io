runs out of juice when you're on that
important call or trying to get
directions say hello to go key
go Keys battery is capable of charging
your phone for up to two hours
keep it on your key ring for easy access
then use it to boost your phone on the
go to charge it plug it into any USB
port on your laptop in your car or right
into an outlet when you need to give
your phone a full charge you can use it
as a USB cable goki charges itself while
your phone is charging and it can sync
your data too we also included flash mem
to store videos pictures music and files
the USB 3.0 feature allows much faster
file transfer now your keys are
connected to your phone through
bluetooth whenever you lose them views
the goatee app on your phone to locate
the signal and then make your gogi ring
so you can find and when you can't find
your phone your bboki will make it ring
if you lose your keys go Keys GPS app
helps you locate them use goki as a
camera remote and let it snap the
picture for
koki lives on your keychain and it will
always be there when you need
countless thoughts passes by every day
without being remembered as they often
strike at the least appropriate place
and time like when we drive hike drink
coffee or work on something then we
simply don't have a chance to use a
phone laptop or even a napkin to capture
a thought and our sudden insights are
lost but even if you have a phone you
need to take it out of your pocket
unlock it find and start application and
do something do it 100 times a day and
two hours of your time are gone forever
and for nothing while me of your
productive tasks are interrupted and how
to be started over not speaking it's
also too distracting dangerous
embarrassing even unsafe this is why we
bring you my a gadget that instantly
captures your spoken thoughts and notes
without a phone or computer
automatically organizes your thoughts on
your tasks with your apps and software
in freeze you at least one hour day
every day my simple solution for complex
problems get Maya
yeah waking up is never easy thanks to
vick see one move and they could stop
their alarm and that's just the
beginning they can also control all
kinds of connected devices with simple
gestures it's very useful when alex is
on his bike and can't focus on anything
but the road or when Lisa is so busy
working doing stuff that she just can't
touch your device's just like them
anytime you want to do many things at
the same time bixi can help it's smart
seamless and easy well easier than
cooking apparently no need to stop doing
what you're doing no need to reach the
device you want or interact with you can
even switch from one function to another
from one device to another with a simple
gesture told you it was smart and
because it C is full of surprises it
also lets you control your environment
believe me that's something you will
like well you know almost everything
down so what are you waiting for
hi
you
men
we
and
Oh
as you need to support yeah I really
like in liner you know wind in hair my
favorite songs the freedom well except
for those heavy shoes I've got a hole in
my backpack hmm and what about hiking
sure I love my game being out in nature
is where I can unwind to get new idea
it's just really a drag lugging around
those heavy boots all day and what if
you use skynyrd water beginner is the
most affordable foot there in the world
also I mean they're like super cool
dinners in light get very durable they
fit into your pocket don't slip and have
a cooling effect and best of all
seriously yep you can throw them in the
washer
you
Jenner's were designed to be one
anywhere anytime like at our wedding
okay well almost any time if you're
tired of carrying an extra pair of shoes
with you all the time try Skinner's
they're lightweight portable comfort
simply put its foot wear to your
profession I get it so I can have
Skinner's with me all the time like when
we take a trip to Japan again hey
quickly that's right you can date them
pretty much anywhere hi cocozza I'm
Peter and here at skinners we spend the
last 18 months developing a better
alternative to having conflict where
many of us were willing travel or
exercise well we on an easier way both
for you and your feet our patent-pending
technology says goodbye to gluten themes
that could fall apart over time scanners
are manufactured in Europe using the
finest Swedish materials with a dual
coding of extra durable anti abrasive
polymer and we've tested them all over
the world in all kinds of conditions to
make sure they can keep up with you
wherever you go we even have guys
running marathons in them long story
short very excited with how Skinner's
turn out and the way they feel and
protect your people and people are
surprised to see how something so simple
can be so durable the next step is to
give more people to champ to experience
Skinner's for themselves and to do that
we need your help simply put Skinner's
are designed to be multifunctional as
you are
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
