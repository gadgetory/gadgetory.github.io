but this small device solves some very
large problem we live in a time where
everything you do online is monitored
tracked or censored just because you
don't have anything to hide doesn't mean
you don't deserve privacy by the way to
be private and secure is not such an
easy task services are fragmented and
none provide coverage on multiple
devices making it a hassle to stay
protected we created filter in order to
make privacy and security more
accessible and easier to use tofu
provides VPN support ad blocking
capability and tour anonymity and all
the devices in your home this is
especially important for devices that
don't normally support these
applications like gaming console Smart
TVs and media players those who not only
protects you from unwanted ad targeting
but to prevent companies governments and
internet providers from seeing more
personal information like your web
activity searches and even physical
locations in VPN mode filter uses
enterprise grade encryption to protect
all the devices in your home
simultaneous this level of security
keeps all incoming and outgoing web
traffic private VPN mode also allows
access to geo-restriction content or
censorship simply by switching regions
within the app filters asses incredibly
easy to use plus the VPN setting the
region you'd like to connect to or
automatics put a studious connection you
can switch between VPN modes and tour or
configure more advanced settings both
are also just a job of blocking
advertisements dangerous websites
trackers and malware infected
advertising is a huge threat and
annoying the filter you'll never have to
see a malicious add again stay ahead of
threats all security features and lists
are kept up to date automatically you
can choose what you want to have updated
or turn this off anytime also has a lot
of capabilities but setup couldn't be
easier on all of your network traffic to
filter simply by connecting it between
any modem and router so we'll start
working automatically and can be
configured within the app filter can be
used as a regular router which you can
connect your devices to via Wi-Fi or
ethernet filter is ultra portable and
can even be powered off an external
battery
even if you're in a public area you
don't have to worry about being secure
and finding power we have a great idea
and an industrious team working to make
filter the best it can be we need your
help we need to meet manufacturing
requirements and volume in order to make
filter affordable for everyone you hope
you'll support us and help spread the
word about our campaign every little bit
counts and helps bring us closer to our
goal to make your online experience to
yours and every day new technology makes
it easier for governments and
corporations to track your activity and
location through the internet and Anana

marginalized or eliminating by these
entities that's why we've expanded our
line of personal plug-and-play take
anywhere internet privacy devices to
include both VPN and tour access with
our nanobots pro but our dedication
internet privacy isn't the only thing

security communities and is also a
long-standing advocate for Internet
privacy and security known colloquially
as the crunch man John has inspired
fascination with computer systems help
to spawned the hacker counterculture and
has been a continual advocate for
Internet freedom and open source
software that's why we were honored to

that John had been working towards
publishing his autobiography but had
been hampered by ongoing unrelated
expenses
we decided to help not a box is proud to
announce Project Blue inside this
special limited-edition device is the

and homage to johns now infamous blue
boxes these devices provide all the

comfort in the fact your internet
activity is not being monitored by Big
Brother have you ever struggled to take
your keys out from your jeans the
problem that I'm trying to solve here is
something that I personally go through
every single day taking your piece in
and out of your pocket is something that
can be annoying for everyone especially
when you were 18 I mean form fitting
jeans this is just my personal opinion
but if you ever struggle to take keys
out from your pockets then I think you
know as well that jeans and keys are not
meant to be together as a new parents I
learned that running errands and
shopping for groceries become that much
more challenging when you have your
precious mini-me in tow with both hands
full of groceries balancing a diaper bag
and drink shuffling through my pockets
to dig out keys becomes a serious
struggle
that is why we created Magnus a portable
magnetic earring holder for your
everyday activity securing your keys has
never looked so simple cool and
convenient with Magnus you can avoid
wasting time taking your keys in and out
from your pockets Magnus allows easy and
fast access to your car and house keys
within milliseconds Magnus allows for
your keys to be right in front of you
and within reach at all times may from
the strongest super magnet we guarantee
that your keys will not fall until you
decide to pull it off yourself
laughing and opening the trunk of your
car never been so easy when your hand so
full with groceries magmas make sure
your key just an inch away from your
hand we have tested a lot of different
prototypes varying and strength and
sizes to finally find the best magnet to
be used for Magnus if Magnus can hang a
hammer I think it's safe to say it can
carry your keys without a problem please
help us to get magmas into production
and choose any of the rewards that you
like on the right side of this page then
forget to share our campaign with your
friends and family thank you for your
time checking on our campaign with
Magnus let's start changing the way we
carry our key in 2017 hi I'm sayin I've
been inventing for long time now i
started my comedy aventis as a way to
get my inventions for public you might
have heard some of my inventions like
the solowheel and hover tracks
a lot of news was generated around the
products called hoverboards but most of
all of the products you've seen a
knockoff of Mohammed racks which were
funded in kickstarter 2013
my team and I started to develop the
idea of Yoda because the sea by from the
solowheel and hard drive users we sell a
need for community solutions for light
applications which is easier to learn
lighter weight and still practically
I really enjoyed seeing people using and
loving my emotions i hope you liked this
one too
you
welcome to our enemy headquarters I'm
extremely proud to say that we have
welcomed more than 5,000 gentlemen in
our key holder family as you know we've
asked you for your feedback the majority
of those was extremely positive saying
howdy holders improve their lives but we
were even happier to receive negative
critiques depending on death we have
developed a brand-new version of a
decoder ladies and gentlemen say hello
to s
following our gentleman lifestyle reason
we are extremely proud on the new
product in our collection for the first
500 customers we have decided to offer a
special relief victim in case you liked
the video in the product will be
extremely happy if you share it and help
us spread the word thank you very much
and see amazing
we are surrounded by technology it's
entering our homes and helping us
automate daily tasks but I find myself
thinking there has to be a more natural
and accessible way to control the
devices around us it's the goal of
automation is to simplify our lives why
did you feel so complicated our goal is
a company is to solve this say hello to
naki naki is a small elegant device that
instantly transforms ordinary surfaces
in your environment into remote controls
using naki couldn't be easier simply
take it out of the box take a place to
put it select the surface to attach it
to and then define all the things you'd
like Nike to do naki can control a wide
variety of devices around us but the
true beauty of our technology is that
what it can do is only limited by your
imagination put one in your living room
for the kitchen or even your bedroom I
mean imagine rolling over in the morning
and tapping a simple pattern anywhere on
your nightstand to smooth your alarm and
start the coffee maker without even
opening your eyes you just bought ten
more minutes in bed and don't definitely
want to put one in your kids bedroom
it's exciting to think of how naki will
spark their imagination if they figure
out all kinds of ways to use it using
Wi-Fi which is proven to be far more
reliable and with better reach than
bluetooth you can enjoy using naki from
anywhere the number of devices and
software that nachdi interact with is
rapidly growing every day it currently
includes mess Philips you lifx smart
sayings I FTTP and more but even if
you're new to the smart technology world
you can still use naki for simple
functions around your home
other technologies the rely on sound or
voice control can be unreliable and
confusing to use they can be triggered
accidentally and don't always work at
respective our patent-pending technology
uses non acoustic sensors it's able to
distinguish deliberate tap or knock
patterns from random vibrations in the
environment the beauty of our product is
that it makes any regular environment
into a user interface think about the
surfaces around you so many of them
serve one or two purposes add an aki to
them and you instantly have a hub for
automation we carefully chose every
material and finish Funaki we've gone
through series of different tests and
prototypes to make sure that naki blends
in in your environment and also what's
beautiful unruhe services we're doing
our first production runs here in the
USA because it's important for our
entire game to be there on the ground
floor ensuring that we're manufacturing
the best possible product it's not some
far-fetched idea we have finalized our
designs we have beautiful working
prototypes and we need to raise funds to
actually get it in a production and
immediately start shipping them to your
door we couldn't be more excited about
how this product is going to change
lives and bring joy to people everywhere
nakia accomplishes what technology is
supposed to do instead of taking over
our life it enhances
allowing you to put more thought and
effort into the things that really
matter happen to the world around you
with the magic of naki
as an apprentice carpenter I was always
searching for the best way to complete
every staff one thing in particular was
material press I thought they were far
too many tools needed to complete such a
simple job I wanted one tool that could
do it all but it didn't exist so I
decided to invent one it's called the
reeses offering over three hundred and
fifty percent more functionality than
any other line tool it took me seven
years but I finally figured it out it
also has applications in other fields
such as steel fabrication and roof
plumbing I wanna do but I could invite
she goes to the game you're playin
for the game you're playin see again
girl
she go to the games all things
the game
la clowns are free of that mountain then
the boat is start to drop
see all the smiley
and I'm falling she'll stop she'd oh
stop I was
dogs are the game of the end
for the game you're playing the game
I saw through
wasted
real away
you dragged me along
the Roofus is now at production but we
need your help with crowd funding to
receive the high volume discounts for
all the required components we're
offering this brand new innovation at a
discounted rate to those willing to
pre-order their very own research and
benefits on this new innovation before
anyone else if you don't have a need for
the workers maybe you know someone who
does well you may just want to support

donation to pledge but if you'd like to
help out and make this new innovation
