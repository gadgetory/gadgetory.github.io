call from God is a good reason for you
to record your call well I'm sure there
are more reasons than that to record an

external server dependency oh and by the
way it's never free that's why we
invented leak the first iPhone in the
world that can record your call
now you can record both incoming and

always when we started designing the
case we knew that our biggest challenge
was to ideally position the components
for high quality recordings while
keeping the case slim elegant and
doesn't fully let on what it actually
does jig is so easy to use to start and
stop recording press the stop button to
playback press they are the small button
you don't have to worry if the server is
reliable everything you record stays on
your ethical jig can playback your
conversation or upload it into your
computer
the an Ethernet jig an iPhone cover that
can also record conversation dawned on
me when I was having multiple
conversations with my internet service
providers constant I was sure that there
had to be a better fairer way for iPhone
users to take control of their own
conversation and I became upset with
finding a solution and today I'm proud
to share with you that with Jake we have
