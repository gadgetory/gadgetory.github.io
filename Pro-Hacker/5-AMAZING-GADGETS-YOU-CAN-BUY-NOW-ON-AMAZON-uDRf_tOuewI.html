Oh
a new version of the famous wake up late
since its introduction in 2006 the wake
up late has proved to be immensely
popular for people who want to start to
be in a more natural wig the inspiration
for these new models came from where
else the Sun so late the Sun every
morning we get brighter and brighter
starting with a deep red Gore moving
through orange then eventually giving a
warm yellow light and like the Sun as
you can see but also rains in
unlike the Sun they managed to fit onto
your bedside table but small enough for
that and in fact that a good deal more
compact than the predecessors it offers
a number of natural stones to wake up
gently - and in certain models you can
also dock with an iPhone or an iPod now
this gives you two advantages the first
one is that you can wake up to you doing
music but the second one is through a
special app but you can actually control
the wakeup light from your iPod or your
iPhone giving you more functionality
more possibility
