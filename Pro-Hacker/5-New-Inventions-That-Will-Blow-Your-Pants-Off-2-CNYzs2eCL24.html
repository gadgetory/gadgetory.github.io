gun you must always be prepared have to
be trained you are your gun scene when
it's not on you you want to know it's
secure and accessible safes are not
always accessible or easy to open
especially in the dark and locks are
nuisance to operate as for smart guns
while smart guns are a dangerous concept
taking an unreliable technology and
embedding it into your gun is not a
smart decision our mission is to bring
you the perfect solution introducing
zorax the new generation of gun stone
sore exes caliber specific and has two
modes the first mode is awareness if
someone tries to tamper with your gun
you're immediately alerted and when you
need your gun charging it will eject
sorex and chamber a fresh round the
second mode is when your gun is locked
when Zoar is locked
no one can charge your gun if someone
tries to charge your gun the locking
mechanism will immediately expand
preventing the gun from being loaded
special polymers in the locking
mechanism prevent any damage to the
barrel soraa's developed a revolutionary
unlocking mechanism rapid dial rapid
dial is a simple mechanism which counts
clicks while you turn it you don't need
to start from a specific point even the
direction that you turn the lock doesn't
matter these two factors allow you to
unlock your weapon without looking at it
even in the dark you can choose a simple
code or any length code you wish you
won't believe how fast and simple it is
until you try it you can also open zorax
from your phone but you can only lock it
by physically pressing the lock button
zorax normally communicates with your
phone directly through bluetooth it also
comes with a zorb bridge a Bluetooth 2
Wi-Fi router when plugged into the wall
near your gun you'll be made aware from
anywhere in the world if your gun is
being tampered with now if your home is
your safe and you don't lock your gun
but you still want alerts we have a
solution the zuhr watchdog the sore
watchdog is not a lock but rather
notification device its sole purpose is
to notify you if your weapon is tampered
with
sar X was invented by veterans of elite
IDF technological and combat units we
worked on it for two years bringing it
to perfection door x allows you to be
ready aware and safe more than ever

it's time to rework work
we think things should be easy and that
you shouldn't have to waste time on
every demonstrations like this so we
designed nipple
nimble is the world's first one finger
cutting tool you can use nimble to open
almost any type of packaging made from
plastic an in-built isn't just opening
packaging it can be used to cut out
vouchers for crafts present wrapping and
more I believe solution should be simple
and that's what we've achieved with
nimble we made countless prototypes of
nimble during development and tested
them with over 150 volunteers around the
country to make sure that nimble does a
job better than anything else out there
it's rubber body especially designed to
be one size fits all so you don't have
to worry about choosing the right size
you can use nimble with either hand left
or right a safe blade design means that
although or packaging should be afraid
of nimble you need to be nimble x' blade
is made out of ciconia ceramic a special
material which is much harder than steel
so you won't need to worry about finding
replacement anytime soon nimble it's
bright color vd you can be confident
that you won't lose it in kitchen or
desk drawer it's compact and portable
size makes that deal to have around the
home or on the go we believe nimble can
save you time and frustration on a daily
basis we've worked really hard to get
nimble to the point it's up now and now
ending your help to take a last big step
and get nimble produced on a larger
scale so please back us and say goodbye

fly charges wireless charging down right
it uses conductive technology which
means it charges on contact
this means it works with virtually any
device and you don't have to worry about
device orientation it emits no
additional radiation and is safe to
touch the Flyway 40 is a 40 watt
high-speed charging pad that can
simultaneously charge all of your

campaign and share with other
forward-thinking people just like you
it's time to live on the fly thanks and
we'll see you on the other side flat
side it's growing onto you well it turns
the carrot Reese I figured might do it
he's looking for something
all right a library in every village
think about that it is a powerful idea
and it is already possible today anyone
can build a homemade receiver pointed at
the sky and receive free information
from space but we want to go even bigger
well actually smaller a library in every
pocket introducing lantern we don't just
want to help the 4.3 billion people who
lack internet access we want to make
something every person on earth can use
Lantern is one device that receives free
data forever
lantern continuously receives radio
waves broadcast by outer net from space
and turns them into digital files when
you want to view the content stored on
Lantern just turn it on and connect your
Wi-Fi enabled device to lanterns hotspot
all you need is a web browser it's like
an offline version of the Internet that
updates constantly you can also charge
your phone with Lantern and when power
isn't available Lantern can charge
itself with its built-in solar panels
Lantern is like a Swiss Army knife for
offline communication how much better
will we respond to the next Hurricane
Katrina Indian Ocean tsunami or Syrian
refugee crisis when everyone has the
right information Lantern is also a
critical addition to your disaster kit
when cell towers go down and terrestrial
networks are compromised you and your
family won't be
get your news anywhere in the world
whether you are abroad on a mountain or
in the middle of the ocean Lantern
receives news from major news outlets in
several languages and don't worry about
what your kids might find online you
control what your Lantern keeps from
outer nets broadcasts so you can create
the perfect digital library and in many
parts of the world Lantern means things
that have previously been impossible
outer net broadcasts educational
material from videos teaching literacy
to courses on computer programming
making learning possible everywhere on
earth imagine when education becomes
truly universal it is already happening
we are working with the World Bank in
Sudan and I Rex in Namibia to turn on
Lanterns all over those countries and
that's just the beginning Lantern is not
just a library it can be a school
because we're broadcasting from space if
you have a government that says you
can't read this or you can't watch this
outer Nets they're everything that a
user consumes is completely anonymous
it goes beyond income it goes beyond
access location geography the random
lottery of where we're born Outernet
cancels all of that out which is such a
powerful idea
the doors are already open we've already
started putting books on the shelves and
we just want to make the library bigger
and more accessible and we want you to
be a part of it for decades I've been
working to bring the world great
literature free literature what Outernet
does is it gives us one more way a great
way of getting content to people the
Project Gutenberg content and we're in
favor that we support it there are many
people all over the world who can't
afford what it costs to download that
kind of data I don't have to change all
of that it's going to be able to
broadcast data to every corner
for free being part of this project is
really great for this reason the
opportunity to make technology work for
people Outernet broadcast knowledge
everybody on this planet deserves the
same opportunity OS YZ goal is to create
the open source economy based on such
open access to knowledge we design and
build open-source industrial machines
and publish the plans on the internet
for free personally I'm excited by
somebody downloading our plans in a
remote corner of the world maybe far far
away from the internet backbone and
creating a better life for themselves
there's nothing more heartbreaking than
seeing a problem whether it's in a third
world community or urban area or place
of dire poverty where their solution
already exists but people in
experiencing the problem don't have
access to that solution or access to the
information to help them solve that
problem imagine if we found a cure for
cancer and many of the world's cancer
patients didn't know about it because
they simply didn't have access to that
information that's the problem that
Outernet is seeking to solve this isn't
hypothetical it's not theoretical just
recently we announced our broadcasts on
two satellites we're on galaxy 19 and
hotbird that covers North America Europe
Middle East and North Africa with the
addition of about five other satellites
we'll be able to cover the entire world
what happens in terms of the ideas that
get generated from consuming you know
the entire corpus of wikipedia what
happens when you know young and old
alike are self educating and thinking of
new ideas there really is no end and we
don't even know the full range of things
that are out there that we could put
into the archive so we're asking for you
to know and for you to tell us what we
put on our shelves for everyone to
consume this is a matter of something
for Humanity it's all of us that we can
see unfold in real time it's incredibly
possible for us to be on our way almost
next week we can completely change
the world as we know it now and forever
with your help
supporting Outernet
you
