we all know about air pollution for me
it became personal recently when Alma my
daughter was born I started to look at
the effect of urban air pollution on
baby's health what I found wasn't good
say the leak death when I came up with
breathing
Brizzy is an app operated dual fan
filter that cleans the air in a baby's
or child's breathing area
it's an autonomous device that is
activated when high pollution levels are
detected by the sensors attached the
urban environment exposes us to a large
variety of pollutants carbon monoxide
sulfur dioxide particles of metal rubber
and dust are all present in the air we
breathe every day children are
particularly vulnerable their lungs and
immune system are not fully developed
during their first few years of life
putting them at greater risk when
exposed to air pollution 30 to 60
centimeters above ground is where the
heaviest most dangerous particles are
concentrated frizzy is designed to stay
with you and your child throughout the
day it delivers 1.5 liters of filtered
air every 10 seconds to babies or
toddlers breathing area through its
patented innovative filter this unique
and high-quality filter is a
multi-layered
medical grade nanometric woven fabric
the woven layer removes particulates and
the carbon layer removes harmful gases
reducing both particles and chemicals
being inhaled there are a number of ways
of reducing the exposure of the Fulton's
the one of the simple ways is to find
the route where you can avoid the
hotspots the other way is to create a
clean air zone around it and Vigi can
provide both these solutions
Brizzy has undergone a series of tests
led by professor Prashant Kumar what we
wanted to see is how clean actually this
can make the air for the kids who might
be sitting in this kind of frames
the Brizzy app visualizes pollution data
in the form of a real-time heat map
which is updated by users sensor
readings Brizzy has a sensor only option
that can be used separately with the
free app this information is collated
and displayed in map form via the app
and the website sharing air quality
information visually within the Brizzy
community so as you can see in the real
world scenario you are really seeing a
lot of these spikes and these spikes are
normally due to the fact that there are
buses which are idling all there are
emissions actually coming from other
different sources when you look at the
new curve actually so that seems to have
removed these spikes creating a much
cleaner zone removing those bigger
spikes and the higher concentration
inhaled by the the children sitting in
the pants protect your loved ones and
inform the community about air quality
join breezes
you
Jenna and Dale are young parents and
they believe that they and their babies
are on the same page they are not and
sometimes this happens not this we're
just taking a break Oh
introducing the new ear most smart
thermometer a doctor and a thermometer
in one device the ear most smart
thermometer can detach it oh it just did
yep
it literally takes one second and you
can clearly see the temperature through
your most sleek LED display okay I got
it
by swiping your finger you can see the
previous temperatures the data is
instantly transferred onto your phone
where you can compare her current
temperature with her past records and if
you're unsure about her symptoms you can
consult the app I can't pronounce it but
serious and if you want an easy
confirmation simply send the data from
the app to her family physician with a
quick confirmation from her doctor
Jenna is feeling pretty good about
herself and about ear mo and with ear mo
you can check your child's temperature
anytime anywhere the ear most smart
thermometer won't turn you into an
amazing parent overnight but it might
make your life just a little bit easier
thank you sir
you
oh the joy of being new parents what a
miracle
look at this precious angel the hair a
baby here showed up like a knight in
shining armor you and your baby we're
constantly losing sleep scoot and when
you finally were able to gets more done
you can hardly focus on anything because
you were constantly thinking about the
baby
then let's face it that old baby monitor
you're using it just wasn't much help
now you have rain baby on-call 24/7 with
the first truly smart non-contact maybe
wellness tracker with this brand new
state-of-the-art technology parents are
able to track their baby's vitals such
as respiration rate and sleeping habits
brain baby is light and easy to mount
simple setup no complicated hardware no
lithium batteries raise technology is
superior similar to ultrasound ray baby
has an ultra wideband radar to track
vitals all in a safe distance so your
baby can rest comfortably and now you
can finally sleep in peace knowing your
little bundle of joy is safe and sound
it's scientifically proven that sleep is
extremely important for your baby's
mental and physical development try
organizing your days based on Ray baby's
data and see how much your lives improve
don't worry ray baby notifies you when
she's awake
and gives you some recommendations based
off of your baby's vitals and sleep
patterns we know that life is not all
sunshine and rainbows 365 days a year in
those days when your baby is sick are
some of the most nerve-wracking of all
but when you have ray baby reporting
accurate vitals around the clock you're
able to pinpoint the problem and
immediately take action now your baby is
always a button away closer and safer
than ever you can ease your mind knowing
your baby doesn't just appear to be
doing fine now you'll know for certain
that everything's okay and when all your
friends and family badger you for
updates and more pictures of the little
princess Buttercup you can show them
significant moments like this this in
this
supported by Johnson Johnson innovation
and hacks joint consumer health device
accelerator program our team is always
thinking about the baby safety first
that's why we developed this non-contact
wellness baby tracker made with
fda-approved components only so no
matter how far away you are you'll
always feel right at home with the one
you love most
while working on my PhD I realize that
sixty-second could change the world
that's because it only takes 60 second
of UV LED light to kill the germs that
have plagued humankind since the
beginning of time just 60 seconds
underdeveloped immune systems are unable
to fight off deadly germs and viruses
which is why there is le the world's
first portable medical grade sterilizer
just place your baby's bottle pacifier
or teething ring into le and in 60
seconds it's germ-free
UV light particularly UVB particular
type of UV kills all sorts of germs
including viruses bacteria and fungi by
damaging their DNA or RNA Ellie runs on
a rechargeable battery and it's very
compact so you can take it anywhere and
while it's grateful bottles and binkies
Ellie can sterilize anything that fits
into the chamber including water for
mixing formula small toys or even breast
pump accessories just put it into the
Ellie and in 60 seconds it's safe to use
Ellie's true violet UV digital
technology kills germs and viruses at
the core by breaking their DNA strand
including antibiotic resistant superbugs
we clearly do need to have available
portable devices for when we're carrying
around food or other items such as baby
bottles or other types of things that
might become contaminated and
particularly with their more vulnerable
populations such as a very young child
true violet technology also has many
promising applications that address
global concerns such as air and water
sterilization especially in areas
without centralized water supply or
electricity and 60 seconds is all it
takes
thank you for your time
you
