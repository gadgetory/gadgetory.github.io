that wall of barrels evil Prime gets off
the first shot but it looks like it
breaks up inside the barrel the second
shot is effective exposing kuratas to
another attack Eagle Prime crashes to
the barrels I bet you they can't even
feel that that robot is 12 tons and
there's a third shot how about this
kuratas launches a drone they've spotted
it they're gonna try to knock it out and
they make contact with it look at that
smoke is pouring out of the drone
finding a huge quite hook on the top
vehicle there and it comes crashing down
team megabots is really taking advantage
of the 430 horsepower that they have
that allows Matt Andy to really control
the arena with that arm
Eagle Prime kuratas engage in close
combat a big body shop by kuratas keep
in mind that steel fist is 600 pounds
and another body shot try this looking
to do damage Eagle prime counters with
the claw firing a big shot that 10 and
another Eagle products targeting the
midsection of carotid Oh check this out
Eagle prime using that cannon as a
battering ram targeting the area on
kuratas that has a lot of sensitive
electronics
Eagle Prime continuing to do damage with
that cannon these armored panels are
being torn off of carotid wait a second
the robot is now appear to be stuck
carotid here we go
karate get into position turning
slightly and Eagle Prime takes the lead
here knocking over barrels with that
powerful chain saw
that's a four foot forty horsepower
chainsaw and it was originally designed
to cut through rock
we'll see how kuratas attempts to deal
with this attack those six barrels can
fire up to 2,000 rounds per minute that
could easily take out Eagle Crimes
