oh yes I back this company definitely
hi my name is Kevin and I'm the inventor
of motivate my team and I would go to
this great new product that's going to
change the way the world travels so
here's the scenario just right the
airport you need to make your flight you
want to walk or do you want to ride and
here we go today we have the fold of
that three times faster than walking tsa
and FAA compliant so you can actually
fly with it goes right in your overhead
22 by 14 by 9
we've got 85% of the storage space if
you have regular carry-on it will charge
your devices you have an optional GPRS
GSM tracking mechanism so you can keep
track of your luggage wherever it is and
never have to worry about losing it
again it really changes your experience
at an airport what do you think for next
fifth over yeah it all started a few
years back after this little family of
break dancers as we're going through the
airport we loaded up with backpacks and
all the different gear and boys are
taking turns as I'm pulling my carry-on
right not Davo also they got a beer you
know what why not motorized what a
better way to get around well I was in
need some help and the first person I
thought of was my buddy boy we've just
got to actually stay cozy on earth we
want and haven't came with this idea
about the motor bags I looked at it I
thought wow this is a great idea and I
said we could motorized it so
immediately we went out and started
getting some parts one of the biggest
hurdles were fitting all of this into a
carry-on size sack we wanted to retain
at least 85% of the interior we've got a
CNC machine steering column telescoping
aluminum bars put back that pop out
we've got a lot of stuff that's sitting
on anything that's currently on the
market like Kevin boys
would feel long local bank temple days
hey there we were just a motor back oh
 it's so much fun it's amazing just
had a great opportunity to accessorize
the moto bag is great piece of
technology I'm really excited about it
imagine that riding around on a suitcase
this thing is awesome it handles great I
can't even believe I'm saying it like it
it looks great
oh they're cool they're really cool
they're fast too and you can charge on
the go
this is fantastic everyone should have a
hollow back to the back I guess see
we're ready to be immediately I don't
really have to be running and sweating
in heels
we've gone through proof of concept and
we've had over a thousand people like
them the response to T's be unanimous
li+ there you put on the bag once if you
hit two pegs or they hit the throttle
it's just a smile I don't is it super
functional
it's an incredible amount of fun so
after two years are really hard worked
we're finally ready to streamline our
manufacturing process and to love our
molds
after all we're really something that's
never been built before is why we need
your support in our campaign he'll bring
moto bag to market together we can
change the way the world travels

strawberries all year-round and with a
simple swipe in our app you can change
the light settings to suit your own
needs in Herbert you can produce around
80 to 90 heads of lettuce every year

lettuce every four to five days for
three years we've been installing

restaurants and offices and with your
help we can bring professional gardening
into everyone's home so please support

you
hi I'm Tony Gonzalez and I'm excited to
introduce to you today fabulous new
product the wine squirrel decanter the
special decanter allows you to have a
glass or two of your favorite wine and
enjoy the rest of the bottle days or
even weeks later the wines cool story
began after a conversation with my
brother we both experienced the
frustrations of one thing built in a
bottle of wine and having just a glass
but not wasting the rest of the bottle
problem is that once you open the bottle
gets exposed to air and continuous
exposure to air causes joint oxidize and
go bad right there at dinner I grab the
pen and the napkin and started to draw a
conceptual sketch of a product to solve
this problem now there were some
products that tried to solve the problem
by inserting a device into the wine
bottle itself problem is that was
trapped there and oxidation still
occurred I thought why not tackle this
problem a bit differently and decant the
wine bottle into a special container
that completely avoided any contact
repair this avoid not only having
trapped air but also avoids any kind of
consumables like gas canisters to take
my napkin sketch and turn it into a
product we teamed up with Australian
designer fives Larry we are now proud to
present the wine squirrel decanter
this unique product can completely
change the way you drink wine I can now
enjoy a glass of wine with dinner and
not worry about the way so how did this
product work well it consists of this
lead-free crystal decanter and a seal
after you pour the wine into the
decanter we simply insert the feel at
the level of the wine and turn we've now
formed a completely airtight seal the
seal you've just created is so effective
that you can even turn your decanter
upside down no wine will come out when
you're ready to drink the wine simply
disengage the field and remove that's it
your wine will now be beautifully
preserved for days or even weeks
we're here in Sonoma County California
with vineyard owner Jennifer crane who's
been using our wine coil I opened up a
bottle of my low farm crane vineyard
designated poured it into the wine
squirrel
after a week flavor was perfect it was
like I just opened the bottle resealed
it with the wine swirl
two weeks later opened it again tasted
it again just as if I'd opened up the
bottle this product work
it looks fantastic you can put this
right onto the table every wine lover
needs this in their help
we know just how well wines go works we
need your help to get this product out
there we thank you in advance for your
support and I can't wait to send you
your very own wine squirrel DK
you
while I'm tense
I thought that's one requiring mind and
I love to see way to improving the world
we're improving a lot some 20 years or
so as I was involved in a in a little
road accident I was on a bicycle
I will hit by a car I got thrown up my
sleeve in to occur and my fittest kerbin
wipin was my shoulder broke my key got
it smashed my hand thank God was fine my
exams because I was wearing a helmet
we've got a bike scheme here where mom
can just hire bikes and these schemes
are so popular every city wants one out
in the world there's over 100 cities
with these like ice cubes in the world
my notice that cyclists particularly on
cyclists in number and especially those
using bike hire schemes and this applies
to most black arts games in the world
will hardly using helmets at all and
when I asked them I found out that the
main reason was because they were too
cumbersome to carry around all day
we also asked them do they think they
can put in their own light and alleged
by not wearing
and slicing the operating sentences yes
I think I want to be my life in danger
but I don't care inaudible day so I
thought I wonder if there's a better way
if I could create a helmet that could
fold flat then I might say drives so
more than two and a half years have
passed since that time and I've hit and
overcome some major obstacles and with
your help
morpho will soon rise this is it this is
more fun goes completely flat as you can
see fits into any small laptop case
fittings of that mackerel okay and yet
when it opens up it performs it's set to
attend collection and the systemic
knowledge
so what's your money going to be useful
well the mine will be used to finish off
the tooling this is a big steel tool
we've never had at all before that's
molded three materials together to form
a helmet including EPS nylon and
polycarbonate so that's the first part
the second part of the money is going to
be used to pay for with the testing
that's necessary around the world most
of the money raised will be used as
working capital which will allow the
company to produce helmets to supply all
of you and also to supply retailers
based around the world with more four
products depending on the level of your
investment purple very and you'll see
the details the perks on the side or the
Indigo their websites but hopefully your
investors will get you help it very
early on or hell it's for you your
friends and your family I really want
you to join me in this because why is
this an investment where you're going to
end up with a helmet with something you
can use and potentially save your life
with that you'll be saving the lives of
other people around the world that's my
mission
I hope you can join me on
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
