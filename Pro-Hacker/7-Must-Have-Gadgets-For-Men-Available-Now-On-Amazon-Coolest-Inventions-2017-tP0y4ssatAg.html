why don't many cyclists use locks
they're too heavy too cumbersome too
bulky and not designed for those people
who really want to ride their bikes Auto
law is an all-new cinch lock for both
cyclists and outdoor enthusiasts who
value their gear and need a small safe
and lightweight solution for their
lifestyle it's far more secure than a
cable lock and much lighter than a you
lock in your saddlebag in your pocket or
anywhere on your bike
Auto lock is so lightweight you won't
even know you were carrying it
Auto lock is very secure because of an
engineered design that uses multiple
layers of high temper
18 millimeter wide stainless steel bands
coated and scratch resistant santoprene
and reinforced with Kevlar making it
extremely cut resistant conventional
theft tools like wire or bolt cutters
alone are just not enough to cut the
auto lock auto lock also has more uses
beyond bicycles but for example ski and
snow tools and sheds camping gear water
sports and more the possibilities with
Auto lock are limitless the auto lock
weighs under 115 grams and coils to
under 3 inches in diameter making it
easy to pack and store on the bike in
pockets backpacks purses or jerseys in
comparison new locks or chains are ten
to twenty times heavier than auto lock
and much more difficult to carry the
cinching function keeps your gear locked
tight
we've designed auto lock with three
resettable combination wheels and a
durable aluminum head the auto lock
comes in multiple colors and is
available in different lengths starting
with the all-around 30 inch version
which offers the most versatility auto
lock also comes in a super compact 18
inch pro ride version and a 60 inch
extended version the 18 inch Pro right
version is intended for cyclists on the
go offering the fastest coil times the
lightest weight the most bike storage
options and just enough length to cinch
your bike up to any pole or post up to 5
inches in diameter in seconds the auto
lock is both designed and manufactured
in the USA now there is simply no reason
not to carry a lock
I'm here to tell you about coin it
solves a problem I think most of us have
see my wallet is filled with cards
credit cards debit cards rewards cards
gift cards filled with them too many
this is a coin it's a simple card just
like a regular payment card you can
swipe it just like any other card the
difference between a coin and any other
card all these cards are inside my coin
and I can pay for stuff with any of them
I'm gonna use the personal card for this
my coin has all the same data and acts
just like my debit card would when I
swipe it this is a business lunch so I'm
gonna expense it on the business card I
just tap this button to select the right
card and that's it how do I get my cards
in my colon you're asking it's a fair
question I use this thing and the coin
app to swipe them in take a picture so I
know which one it is and that's it Oh
security this is cool too let's say you
pay with your coin you've got a lot on
your mind
you leave your coin behind like a dummy
see that coin uses a low-power Bluetooth
signal it knows when your phone is near
and when it's not in this card all your
cards
you can add as many as you want and it
stays the same size and all you ever
need is one one coin for all your cards
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
