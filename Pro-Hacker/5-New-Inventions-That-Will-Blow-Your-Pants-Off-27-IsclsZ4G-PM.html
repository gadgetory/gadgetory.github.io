all over the world the dresser is
basically the uniform of successful men
you wear to work when you have a
important interview even at your own
wedding left fess is using smart success
to make your life easier
our research shows that men basically
prefer to have three properties in a
dresser no stains no smell and as little
ironing as possible we found a way to
offer that in a fabric that's also soft
and breathable we get a lot of questions
about how it's possible for sure to have
such magic properties and still feel
natural well it implies working on every
aspect of the fabric from the cotton
selected to the way the yarns are spun
and then we'll wind our cotton is also
treated so that the fibers are
transformed that they're very cold this
allows the shirt to block out all flus
and bacteria before it enters the fabric
which is unlike other existing
technologies where it's only added to
the surface and can be washed off so
together with our designer we created a
great fit we did it in a minimalistic
design so it will never go out of style
left versus more about just making life
easier for busy men we also care about
changing irresponsible consumption
patterns true sustainability is when you
wear the same shirt for years instead of
buying new stuff all the time
the biggest hassle of wearing a shirt is
not buying it but keeping it fresh when
napkin when you eat bike slower so you
don't sweat maybe even do laundry on a
Tuesday a leather shirt can be worn for
many days in a row and you still don't
have to wonder if your date can smell
how long a day you have well it took us
quite some time to create our day jumps
but we're really excited that we're
going to go all in on bringing this
technology to market we believe this is
the next generation of shirts with our
background in sourcing and fashion we
think we are the right founders to
create this unique product that will be
worn for years to come
now all we need is your help please back
our campaign today and help us create
the next generation of shirts
action sports are challenging to capture
unlike other sports
there's unstable movement and there's
techniques that can't be captured by
ordinary cameras and that's why we're
excited to bring you my drone the
world's first multifunction auto follow
drone
my drone is a camera drone that provides
action sport enthusiasts and filmmakers
the unmatched solution that they've been
waiting for with extraordinary footage
unbelievable accuracy and unmatched ease
it's a quadcopter that automatically
follows you and captures spectacular
angles with high-def 4k quality camera
or your own GoPro camera it's time to
discover new perspectives from great
heights and capture your adventure
sports in high quality 4k resolution
with a super smooth 3-axis camera
stabilization
we're redefining the way that
enthusiasts capture some of the most
amazing moments no matter the sport of
the epic action your personal camera
buddy my drone is only a click away from
making movie magic come to life
our team of engineers software
developers and designers have conducted
nine years of independent research and
development along with over 10,000
flight tests to ensure that safety and
reliability and bringing every my drone
user a seamless hassle-free experience
you don't have to worry about not having
in a remote control piloting skills the
drone operates autonomously and captures
every move smoothly and efficiently now
you can sit back or better yet launch
forward and do you think have fun and

simply attach the sport watch on your
wrist along with the follow module on
your arm or put it in your pocket turn

filmed or right about anything else my
drone will act as your personal
cameraman its auto follow so it follows
you everywhere as long as you have the
module on and no matter the angle of the
drone you won't have propellers in your

can also use my drones smartphone
application with live telemetry and live
display to perform auto flights simply
set several checkpoints on the map and
the drone will automatically fly the
route without any manual operation and
when the battery gets too low my drone
will land itself safely
by backing this project could be one of
the first owners of my drone help us
make your action sport experience one to
look forward to look back on and
remember and we thank you for your
support
you
working in the security and payment
industry has completely opened my eyes
to how antiquated and messed up our
digital world really is seriously think
about it in terms of functionality ever
it's like we've been stuck in the 90s
for the past couple decades I mean why
are we still entering the same personal
information over and over again every
time we go online endless amounts of
street addresses account numbers URLs
first-name lastname credit card info
birth date email address postal codes
frustrating huh
what about logging in how are you
supposed to remember endless usernames
and passwords it's a waste of my time
and it's only getting worse
and don't even get me started on
security do we really think that our
personal information is secure the web
has way too much control over us but
what if there was a world where you
control your online experience after
several years of research and
development we've harnessed the power of
chip and pin technology to create a new
intuitive digital experience that's fast
user friendly and more secure than ever
before with kyookie you control the new
Internet
no more keyloggers then we're purchasing
on corrupted browsers
no more phishing scams it all happens on
the key we've assembled a team of the
best technology experts in the world
help bring Q key to life after years of
engineering continuous improvements and
rigorous testing we're ready to change
the digital world forever an intuitive
online experience is just the beginning
please bat Q key and share this project
with your friends and family welcome to
the new Internet
well my grandfather not founded the
Tiffin company his philosophy was simple
find out what the customer wants and
give it to them two years ago we asked
our engineers at steadicam headquarters
in Burbank to create the best electronic
handheld stabilizer with no limitations
we took our Steadicam technology that's
been used in Hollywood for the last 40
years and coupled it with Steve Wagner's
genius software design and by partnering
with aerial drone manufacturer unique it
allowed us to create this Steadicam
vault the best electronic handheld
stabilizer with no limitations the study
can volt like all its predecessors is a
expanded system with the center of
gravity right at the gimbal it accepts
any phone any case that allows you to
walk around precisely frame the things
that you want to see and move the camera
in the way that we're used to seeing on
a feature film
it's an electronically gyro augmented
study cam for smartphones that weighs 1
pound with the inertia and the feel of a
big 40 pound rate
three axis gimbal they're not terrific
at following action one two three one
two three a little lag there the study
chemical gives you stability and agility
and that's the key the Volt effectively
puts Steadicam technology in the palm of
your hand our mission has always been to
help people create the world's greatest
images
so back us today we can't wait to see
what you guys are going to create
you
