the way and cause more problems than it
solves

we do freeing us to make all of those
keystrokes gestures motions and

wrists well this is exactly what we've
done and after two years and more than
100 prototypes we've developed the

hey Kickstarter I'm Tom I'm an f16
mechanic in the Air Force and I was
tired of my tools lighting off the
aircraft so it's that out to creative
product so keep everything you need to
do your job at your fingertips so after
two and a half years of prototyping in
my basement I came up with a grip man a
flexible non-slip tool tray with the
ability to hold tools at extreme angles
for variety of worship we launched the
product four months ago at the world's
largest air show and fill it out of the
original grip mat within the first week
because we not only love the product but
they reinforce the decisions they're
going into other markets and expanding
our product
so I got to work and design three new
grid mat a large medium and small we are
excited to watch these three products to
the Kickstarter community never chase
the run away screw again the small grid
mat is comprised of six compartments
that will keep your Hardware organized
within arm's reach the medium is
designed to help keep your hand tools
together in close proximity such as
under the hood or on top of a ladder the
large is designed for more involved jobs
where a handful of tools just won't cut
it
aggravation industries we believe that
simplicity is key our grip mats are
comprised of our unique formula
specially designed to provide high end
friction and chemical resistance thank
you for watching our video and please
help us make this a reality
by supporting our campaign and sharing
our story
and
they say this is good luck but good luck
or not it's still a mess and a mess like
this can't be clean with just paper you
need water to get the job done right
whether you're cleaning your car or your
hands so why when it comes to that do we
use just toilet paper bathroom goers
meet your new best friend les oh sorry
Pete not you buddy bathroom doors meet
your new best friend the swash 1400s

already have that will give your butt
the Royal Treatment it deserves with the
heated seats dual positionable stainless
steel nozzles adjustable warm water
spray at the touch of a button and a
warm air dryer your butt will think
you've died and gone
you get it so what's so great about
Braun Dells new swash bidet see it's
simple
wash don't wipe it uses water to clean
the messes that can't be clean with just
paper he's always doing stuff like that
and with rondelle's bidet ct-10 because
it has a citable lid you think that'd be
standard issue with bidet toilet seats
right wrong
unlike most bidet seat lids rondelle
supports a person's weight meaning Pete
can use it however you want
another great feature stainless steel
nozzles there positionable because they
got to hit you in just the right spot
and there's self-sterilizing I mean
they're washing my butt they're washing
Pete's butt move you got to make sure
those things are clean man what's up
Pete

rondelle's new seat it has a nightlight

seat has customizable memory settings
that means I press one button and get
the seat temperature nozzle position and
water temperature I want I don't have to
remember anything because my swash does
it for me
