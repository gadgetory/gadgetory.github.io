only recently they boast so popular now
the fact is that there are drones among
beasts and also in ant colonies but
today we're really excited to introduce
early spider at the first leg drone
powered by Ubuntu this is an app enabled
and sixth leg computer that has been
specifically designed for V there were
none of the drones have been before with
always believed that the future of
Robotics wouldn't be about humanoids of
thousands of euros but it will be a
bubbling of space accessible and
affordable technology that will allow
the people to put their creativity into
real applications Anna spider will be
released in an open way so that
developers can actually create the next
generation robot applications early
spider is a fully functional leanness
computers that have many sensor onboard
and spawn several audio interfaces it
can be control over Bluetooth Wi-Fi and
even 3G or 4G networks thanks to sniper
you want to pour le spy that has access
to a cloud-based app store for robots
and drones a marketplace that allows
developers to create behaviors and make
money out of it pretty much the same as
it works with mobile phones
at the center of this platform replace
Ross the robot operating system the
ultimate framework for developing Robert
applications that is tightly integrated
within the app store
Ellis Tyler has been designed with
simplicity in mind a drone for the
future that can even build 3d printers a
supporters of this next generation of
smart drones early spider will allow
many to plan and execute autonomous
missions using the drone code foundation
tools we've got everything ready but in
order to make other spider affordable we
need to produce big quantities thereby
we need to support support this campaign

there's something about working out and
the way it makes you feel almost
everyone when tasked would like to have
more fitness in their lives but for most
of us it falls to the bottom of our
priority list so we developed the body
boss 2.0 we wanted a product that would
empower people to reach their goals
where you'd be able to exercise more
often and consistently we want a product
that is compact something that could do
it all with no restrictions this
equipment is something that anyone could
use no matter their fitness level a
product it takes all these concepts from
the gym and combines them into one
solution bring in the gym to you
the platform is strong if the posts are
spaced evenly apart on both sides so you
can simulate any exercise movement and
quickly adjust difficulty the base is
made wide enough to stand comfortably
during your workout and we even added a
layer of non-slip material to assure you
stay in place the bands were customised
for this concept and can handle any
height
there's even cloth in the band's to
protect you simply clip in to get
started
shorten the bands or add bands to
increase difficulty our most popular
exercise is squatting with the bar it's
like a workout bar you would see at the
gym but more portable it can unscrew and
it features grip padding for comfort
the ends of the bar spend a full 360
degrees and are shaped to avoid the
clips from sliding providing you the
most natural feel possible through all
of your exercise motions adding or
dropping bands easily provides many
resistance levels we added accessories
to simulate even more solutions such as
handles that will add weight padding
bands are like increasing your weight
with a dumbbell
the wrist straps are double padded for
comfort and sweat resistant to stay in
place we even added a door anchors so
you can increase the workout the body
boss is lightweight made of high-grade
injection molding and capable of
handling hundreds of pounds of force the
underside has non-slip feet for safe use
on any surface the adjustable posts make
for easy storage starting from day one
you can choose your color green pink you
can choose your package and choose how
you want to follow workouts live
reflect programs all on your own
normally exhaustive thousands of dollars
to buy or recreate all of the support
but by backing this Kickstarter today
you can get it for a fraction of that
price our hearts and souls have
developed the body boss 2.0 and we're
making our first prototypes to be able
to produce the product and make it
available we'll need your support
together we can make this happen make
this a part of your lifestyle share this
video with a friend help us expand
practical lifelong fitness
