the floater paddle is so easy to use
just follow these simple steps and you
and your floater paddle will be enjoying
the water in no time to use the
inflatable version start by removing the
floater paddle from its packaging and
unfolding the device to inflate the
floater paddle gently squeeze the base
of the air valve between your thumb and
forefinger and raise it to your lips
take a deep breath and blow into the air
valve you'll feel the flow to paddle
expanding in your hands as you blow when
the device feels like it's fully
inflated stop blowing and use your thumb
to press the lid of the air valve into
the chamber to form a tight seal
once the floater paddle is inflated you
can give it to your child to try on all
they have to do is slide their arm
through the hole in the device and wrap
their fingers around the handle if the
inflatable floater paddle is too tight
and doesn't fit your child you can
remove it and gently release some of the
air but always make sure the device is
fully inflated before swimming once your
child has secured both floater paddles
to their arms they're ready to go in the
water it really is as simple as one two
three and if you're an adult it's even
easier to use the floater paddle because
the foam version is ready to go the
moment you take it out of the box now
all you have to do is slide the device
onto your arm wrap your fingers around
the handle and hit the water once you're
in the ocean pool or lake all you have
to do is float paddle or kick using the

you've probably heard the saying before
that necessity is the mother of
invention and it turns out the invention
of sit tight really wasn't any different
than that I had taken a desk job years
ago found that after sitting in front of
a desk for hours upon hours day after
day my health was starting to diminish I
was putting on weight I realized I was
going to have to find a way to utilize
the time that I spend sitting
as a way to improve my health and not
damage it the real magic was sit tight
lies in its simplicity the ability to
simply balance on your center of gravity
have your body engaged muscles working
to keep your posture stray burning
calories your mind be involved as its
controlling all those muscles is really
what allows people to turn sitting into
an activity that improves their health
sit tight is a chair that combines
physical activity and mental focus we
call it balanced active sitting this
stabilizes your spine as it strengthens
your core which improves posture and
makes you burn calories simply by
sitting resulting in an overall
healthier lifestyle plus balancing
requires you to stay mentally engaged
which allows you to be more alert and
productive we want to introduce the
world to balanced active sitting and
help people get fit while they sit
