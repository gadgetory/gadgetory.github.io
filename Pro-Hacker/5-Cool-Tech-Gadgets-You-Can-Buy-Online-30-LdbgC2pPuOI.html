hey guys my wife and I Hey we're packing
for our trip to Savannah we've got this
new fused smart card that's going to
help us with our purchases throughout
the trip
this card can store information from
almost any card in my wallet debit cards
credit cards reward cards gift cards gym
membership anything with a barcode and
EMV chip a magnetic strip or NFC text
view stores it you just swipe or take a
picture of a card through your
smartphone and it appears on whew now
you may be wondering about security
defuse card runs on Bluetooth and
connects directly to your phone if
necessary you can delete all the
information on the card with the push of
a button I've got my key I've got my
phone I've got my wallet fuse allows you
to select any card to use when you need
it for instance when you pay for gas you
might rather use debit and credit you
can also add your gas pay membership
info you can even use multi pay mode to
combine the two cards for a simpler
transaction view's makes it all easy
I've got like 30 different cards all at
once oh it's got my debit cards credit
cards gift cards membership cards that's
awesome
see if it works all right it worked
fused has the capability for NFC
technology NFC means you can tap the
card to make contactless payments using
its buttons you can create a six tap
password to lock and unlock the card so
if it ends up in the wrong hand
they won't be able to access your
information by pressing the hold button
for three seconds you can freeze the
fused card so that your preferred
payment method doesn't accidentally
change the card stays locked and active
for ten minutes unless it's told
otherwise
it's cool too because if you forget your
cards your phone will sends you an alert
before you get too far away plus its
battery lasts an average of 30 days that
means you have about a month before you
have to worry about recharging it but
when you do have to charge it fees this
portable charging cradle has a built in
battery allowing you to charge the card
