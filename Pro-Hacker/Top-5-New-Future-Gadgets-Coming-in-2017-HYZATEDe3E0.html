you
let us introduce charges the world's
most advanced universal travel adapter
that also charges your mobile devices
without any additional chargers it works
in the USA UK Europe Australia and over
150 other countries the idea was born
out of the everyday struggle of people
on the go every time I go on holiday I
want to focus on what to wear but I also
have to carry around a lot of devices
that I don't want to think about but I
can't live without or when I am on an
important business trip abroad and I
want less luggage but I need my smart
gadgets all these devices require many
chargers that take up half of my space
and don't forget the countless number of
adapters around the world yeah I always
get those confused and there are never
enough outlets in hotel rooms to charge
all my devices at once that never
happens anymore because we have charges
charges conforms to plug standards in
the USA UK Europe Australia and 150
countries around the world
you can plug the device in any outlet
worldwide with all the plugs
conveniently stored inside charges saves
you space and the trouble of forgetting
or losing your chargers the height of
the pins is adjustable to fit any mobile
case or protector now you can charge
your smart phones and tablets at the
same time using the two integrated pins
without carrying any additional Chargers
charges supports microUSB lightning and
USB C standards covering the full range
of mobile devices and smart gadgets
great now we can charge my iPhone and
your Samsung at the same time
it also works with other devices sharing
the same charging standards
char jest also has three additional USB
ports to make it the most convenient
universal travel adapter and you still
have the outlet ready to use in addition
we created the charges Bank it's a power
bank that charges my phone up to three
times and has a USB port for any other
device it's been a great journey so far
we beta tested our ideas and pack them
into an awesome compact design we built
the PCB and model the design then we 3d
print it and test it some more this led
to the final working prototype that we
sent out to ten people to test for two
weeks we got their feedback and now we
are ready to go into mass production I
love to travel the world but I always
find difficulties in the outlet
standards of each new country that I
visit yeah I found charges and solve
that problem forever I mean it is so
compact and handy I take it everywhere
with me my wife and I used to argue over
who is going to use the phone charger
every night
yeah but charges solve that problem with
its dual charging station and we don't
argue anymore forget the old chargers go
charges back us now on IndieGoGo hi I'm
Eugene and I am Vladimir we're founders
of pehla pehla at some point we've all
felt uncomfortable due to the hot
weather even if you is equipped with air
conditioner the cooling engine often
can't cope and of course each of us
wants to set the temperature comfortable
for himself we discussed this and came
up with the idea of creating a
personalized solution
we created evil polar the world's first
portable air conditioner designed for
personal use it can be used to enjoy a
cool and moist air exactly where you
need it you're poor which huge cooling
effect stand where air is coordination
by water good provision creating this
natural BRE that cools your body gently
it's very safe and reliable clean
principle Eliza one used in conventional
air conditioners that can easily give
you a cold as the major element in
making ever polar we use the specially
developed high-tech evaporative material
it consists of mineral nanofibers
although it has a simple look the inner
structure is complex
this material allowed us to take a fresh
look on a conventional air conditioner
and exclude anything that makes it bulky
it was also very important for us to
develop the material that is not only
safe to use but absolutely eco-friendly
the polar was made to niche from the
fees interior design business office at
home or any other place you needed think
of your personal comfort here finally
you can get to read or things that are
cluttering up your space and control
climate around you by yourself
ever polar is very easy to use all you
need to do is to fill the removable
water tank select the desired power and
relax as you feel cool within a short
time it is noiseless it doesn't vibrate
this will help you to focus on what is
really important for you in today's
world technology can serve people in
simple and invisible things over the
last year we've done a lot making our
way from the idea to the finished
product
and now we need your help to succeed in
the next step all you need to do is to
select the pledge and don't forget to
tell your friends about it
join us spread the word enjoy personal
coolness

rearrange your room that outlet always
seems to be in the wrong spot

flip your switch controlled outlets it's
as easy as plugging in a transmitter to
your switched outlet and a paired
receiver into any other outlet you want

turn on your lights fans and other
devices if you want to control more than
one light just add additional receivers
to switch on as many as you want
pairing additional receivers is easy
just plug the receiver into the
transmitter and it's automatically
paired in this room this switch controls
that outlet but my bed's over here and I
want this switch to control that outlet

my switches to be the way that I wanted
