now this should we do with nothing
network sharing and the lipo customer it
can incite when people shoot videos with
smartphone and holding with bare hand
during movement the image is waters
shaking caused by natural movements
especially in strenuous access situation
using a 3-axis electronic stabilizer is
the most effective solution at present
currently on the market
illness where access much and stabilizes
following same traditional structure
which is were regularly used for action
camera compact smartphone have very
sizes and weight it's not easy to
achieve the best stabilization for
formats traditional Street access
structure is difficult to achieve a
balance between the cousin instability
for the bottom of last year we spend a
lot of time developing a brand news we
access the blind and structure of both
natural we can balance map from much
better and perfectly realized 360-degree
freedo taking without adding extra
hikers and also meteorolo needs to
access other reason of cuddly
using stop at the smartphone chemical
active abilities
and he'll give us into active shooting
control extending twisting shooting
masses like rotation time-lapse
360-degree panorama at a macro exposure
you want to make the majority of
smartphone users so that shooting a
smartphone can easily own after that
naturally to select price

watch in a medical quality device it's
made of leather and metal it's very easy

will develop epilepsy at some point
during their lifetime everybody with
epilepsy should be able to have a device
that alerts a friend or a family member
to come help at the time that they might
need it
this device will measure both movement
and physiological signals the
combination is likely to be very
important for detecting potentially
life-threatening seizures these sensors
and algorithms were originally developed
here at the MIT Media Lab we learned
that combining the stress data we could
sense from the rest with the activity
data led to the most accurate seizure
detection
we have been working on a medical
quality wearable for many years our III
sensor is being used by the top
physicians and scientists in the world
to acquire clinical quality data for the
studies no other device on the market
today can do anything like this now we
are making embrace so that everyone can
benefit from our technology
we've done a lot of work with a truly
passionate team that believes in this
