keys all day your car opens four doors

everything else ovo is a revolutionary
breakthrough you can change the
combination to give it maximum
reusability it has all the applications
of a typical one-to-one lock but with
greater flexibility
the ovo pair lock has six main features
easy to manage it has all the
applications you're used to with a
standard
new tenant same lock
for anyone renting or sharing their
space the hassle of changing locks is
gone
multi-layer management one incredible
feature is that any communal space you
can imagine can now be accessed by
multiple people by having some digits of
their past codes in common this leaves
room for individuality in each key for
areas that aren't shared lost key be
your own locksmith if a key is lost
there's no longer a need to call a
locksmith or replace existing locks you
can easily find a new ovo key secure
plus if you want security beyond the
standard four-digit combination each
order will include a custom cylinder

digit wheel upgrade will make any
passcode exponentially harder to guess
remotely unlocking the pair lock perhaps
the most convenient feature is the
ability to share your key with friends

phone call away pass codes can easily be
reset if sharing temporarily
now we need your help the cylinders and
various lock applications are fully
developed for production and marketing
we need you to be part of our team
thanks for your support
ovo one key for all
you
okay so all of us own a few phone
accessories right and some of them can
actually do some really impressive
things but right now if I asked you to
get one you probably say I don't have it
with me
so most of the time you end up leaning
your phone against some random object
instead of actually using that expensive
tripod that you left at home so because
there weren't any real solutions we made
our own and back in 2013 we launched our
first Kickstarter campaign for the
pocket tripod a fully adjustable stand
for your iPhone and holds our device in
both portrait and landscape doubt
covering the screen best part is that it
transforms into the size of a couple of
credit cards and hides away in any
wallet or purse until you need it again
people loved it we raised more than our
funding goal by almost double and even
Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak the was
said why didn't someone do this before
what a great idea that I wish I thought
I put one of them in my backpack which
is always with but then a few of our
very clever backers realized something
that we missed and told us I've got a
case on my phone I'm not going to take
it off every time that's just too much
work and someone else said so what you
guys some kind of Apple fanboys you know
some people Rock Angela Wright that got
us thinking can't make a pocket tripod
for every phone and case model out there
there's at least a million different
combinations who knows so as soon as we
shipped all rewards to our two and a
half thousand backers we started working
on a universal pocket tripod instead of
limiting it to only bear iPhones for
months we studied case designs got
feedback from our backers and tested
ideas once we had a universal opening
shape we made it in a range of sizes so
that it fits as many case and phone
combinations as possible
this is the new universal pocket tripod
does it work with the Apple silicone
case perfectly how about the Galaxy Note
yup works fantastic in landscape and
halfway in portrait does it work with
every case almost unless it's gigantic
we've also created this guide that lets
you know exactly what pocket tripod you
need just by knowing what case and
device combination you have okay but
what if I like it bare but also
sometimes with protection
do I need to pocket tripods nope because
whenever you swap your case or your
phone you can also get the adapters to
match their new size good to go the
pocket tripods been used and tested for
the past two years by thousands of
people worldwide they use it as the
primary tripod every day to take amazing
time lapses for making video calls and
even to create light paintings we've
made the pocket tripod with the highest
standards of engineering materials and
manufacturing they say the best camera
is the one that's with you and the same
is true when it comes to tripods the
pocket tripod is now a proven product
and with your help we want to make it
one of the most practical smartphone
accessories for as many people as we can
we hope you join us thank you
you
