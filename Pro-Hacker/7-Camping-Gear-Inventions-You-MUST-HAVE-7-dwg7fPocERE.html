lightweight waterproof plant for a few
hours of charging the Sun it provides at
the eight hours of LED light that might
purchase a solar panel during the
daytime and the energy is stored in our
chargeable battery inflates eliminates
to diffuse LED lights increase severely
sources lows will press the button twice
to the low setting and twice foot height
so we needed waterproof and Catholic and
is extremely portable tightly
so in a light was originally designed to
address the needs of coast replication
we could automate the life that could be
easily distributed and ties with our
vision is to make them accessible and
sustainable for everyone
one way we do this is get light get
light
thank you support of our customers and
partner organizations thousands of
loonies have been given to people in
need all over the world tape aluminum
like we do in a message under twist tuck
it away in your forsaken orchestra get
together plate your path ahead
new technology is making life easier in
many ways but it hasn't really been
applied to outdoor and camping equipment
until now this is the world's first
outdoor smart lantern for both - tech
first I hope you agree that it looks
great your granddad may have taken you
camping but your equipment doesn't have
to look like it the lantern can be
adjusted here but it can also be
controlled by a Bluetooth app on your
phone
at the end of a long day outdoors you
don't have to keep getting up and down
to adjust the lanterns brightness you
can do so from wherever you're seated
you can adjust it to a range of 16
million colors to suit your mood or
later you can even turn it off remotely
without getting out of your tent or
sleeping bag that's great when the
weather is breezy or you have something
else to do have you ever been hiking and
had trouble finding your tent now it's
easy just set your light to flash but at
otech we have gone much further the
lantern comes with built-in weather
sensors temperature humidity barometric
pressure it will even give you weather
alerts our smart lantern comes in two
sizes the 200 lumen and the powerful 400
room that illuminates to a range of
nearly 10 paces at full power it will
last eight nights at low power 39 the
lantern is strong durable and
lightweight it is water resistant so no
worries would spray on a boat with full
batteries even the 400 L is just over
three pounds or 1.6
it also has a built-in tripod for uneven
surfaces and the handle it won't break
it uses rechargeable batteries or board
D cell batteries you can even use it to
charge your mobile phone or other
devices because it has a built-in USB
port Oh tink Tech is developing a number
of other smart camping devices here is
our CEO who can tell you more my name is
Riley I have had 25 years experience in
electronics and technology marketing
including building and taking a company
public on the stock exchange I also love
skiing sailing camping and the outdoors
I have put together a team of some of
the best engineers designers marketing
and sourcing people I know people who
also love the outdoors together we aim
to bring the latest in technology and
the best in industrial design to the
outdoor market our mantra at o2 Tech is

hi my name is Glenn clucker this is my
son Nathan hi I've been a engineer and
designer and inventor for about 14 years
now and I've designed a lot of knives
and multi tools that you might be
familiar with I came up with the idea
for the class last year over the last
six months I've been designing
developing prototyping and testing out
the clocks to end up with the floor
versions that we have here today the
clacks is more than an axe the clacks is
the multi-tool built into the head of an
axe it has a lot of useful features
built-in carabiner jimping for your
thumb to hold on to bottle opener gut
hook axe blade which doubles as an Euler
knife a knife blade lanyard hole hammer
the built-in ruler five wrenches and a
hex bit driver the clacks has a lot of
useful features like wrenches hammer
head and knife blade along with our
innovative new clamping system that
allows you to take the axe to the field
and be able to break it down for easy
transport
the clacks is useful for people who are
involved in hiking climbing camping
survival experts people who do bushcraft
all sorts of things including emergency
preparedness I'm Mike peel for Mike Pihl
logging Vernonia Oregon and I'm a logger
the clock it's a great tool this morning
I use it to wedge over a Douglas fir
tree and it did a good job this is the
clacks lumberjack it's our most popular
model because it includes all of the
features this is the clacks woodsman the
clacks woodsman has the clamping system
carabiner hammer and knife blade but the
more rustic version that we've created
is called the clock cellar the clock
cellar attaches using the paracord
bracelet by pulling the paracord out and
wrapping it around the handle like you
would a tomahawk this is the tie clacks
the tie clacks is a titanium version of
the clocks lumberjack it is our top of
the line model and it includes all of
the features plus it has blue anodized
highlights and it comes weighing in at
half of the weight of the seller that's
why the tie clacks
is our top of the line model
Glock thanks for watching we appreciate
your support
