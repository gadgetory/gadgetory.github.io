honey wall has been known as a trusted
reliable and innovative brand for
decades in the security space here in
over 150 million homes globally we're
also the market leader installing over
15 million systems annually we need to
provide simple elegant solutions that
our consumers are excited to experience
are excited to interact with and excited
to bring as part of their daily lives as
Honeywell enters a brand new DIY space
with our smart home security system
we're making available security and
peace of mind to a segment of consumers
that have never had access to it before
we wanted to create a new kind of
experience in security one that's really
built around awareness in the home and
it's really built around our digital
first lifestyles we were thinking about
a busy mom she's working an extra shift
at the hospital how does she know that
everything's fine at home
Honeywell smart home security system is
different in a few ways one it's about
awareness first and what that means is
it's really about knowing what's
happening at home who's coming home
what's going on there while you're away
it is truly an all-in-one solution
we've got HD camera that night vision
got to a audio we've got motion and
sound detection alerts we have Alexa
building we have facial detection
through our app beacon connected to all
of the major ecosystems keeping you safe
is a core job of this so it does it in a
few ways one is obviously if you set the
system to away and someone opens your
door and will trigger an alarm when it
detects motion it'll make sounds that
simulate people our home and then
thirdly if it's your eyes and ears in
the home it starts with the base station
that has a camera you combine that with
a suite of sensors and then the motion
viewers which are really unique because
not only can they detect motion but they
also record what's happening so you get
a video clip so if someone does come
into your home you can see livestream on
your camera someone's in there so smart
home security system was designed to be
a completely hands-free experience so
when you come in you just look at the
base station it recognizes you and your
family and it automatically switches
from a way to home motion viewers are
these cool little things so they're a
wireless battery-operated motion sensor
that has a video camera in it so anytime
there's any activity detected
you always can see what's happening from
what we've seen this is the first market
of a product of this kind
we've built Amazon Alexa right in and
overtime we're looking forward to
offering a choice of voice assistance
yet Siri Google or whatever is right for
your family we wanted to create
something that wouldn't lock a customer
in but would actually be an expansive
platform over time smart home security
suitable for the whole family anyone
who's got a phone can use it anyone who
can pick up the key fob can use it and
it knows when you're home and when
you're away so it switches modes
automatically if you want you can open
the app and make all sorts of settings
changes but basically come and go as you
please and the system works it's modular
it's scalable its adaptable it's a bit
like family life
most importantly it can be installed by
yourself and you can control all these
things now we're using one app or your
voice and in addition to that it's made
by a company that's been innovating for
over a hundred years and we feel like we
have a real shot at delivering the right
all-in-one solution for home IndieGoGo
is really exciting for us this is the
first time Honeywell has done anything
like this it's a new experience for us
we hope that you're excited about what
we've shared with you today and we look
forward to working with you and learning
about how we can take a great product
and make it something that's amazing for
the future
we spend about 90% of our time indoors
and the air we breathe in here is 2 to 5
times more polluted than outdoors
imagine all the chemicals dust and toxic
gases trapped in a room with nowhere to
go and the worst part is we do nothing
about it simply because you don't know
you who is a smart indoor air quality
sensor that detects an alerts you of
allergens and toxins in the air you
breathe think of the places you and your
loved ones spend the most time in do you
know the quality of the air in your
office at work in your hotel room when
you travel how about in your own living
room or your child's bedroom these are
important because VOCs are found in
paint and household cleaning products
dust can accumulate unseen in fabric
around us and humidity encourages the
growth of bacteria and mold all these
cause respiratory problems skin
irritations and overall poor health in
the long run you who let you know when
something's not right and what you can
do the simplest and easiest things to do
make the biggest difference cut down on
chemical cleaners wash your child's
favorite toys air out your living areas
and check on possible gas leaks don't
leave it to chance or guesswork you who
keeps track of the air you breathe
round-the-clock so that you and your
loved ones get to live work and play in
the best and safest possible environment
it is the most comprehensive indoor air
quality detector on the market today
with eight dedicated sensors that detect
volatile organic compounds dust carbon
monoxide carbon dioxide ozone air
pressure temperature and humidity hi I'm
Dustin co-founder view and there's a
very simple reason why we created you is
there's a real need for the air we
breathe affects all of us why do we
spend so much energy and money on
nutrients and supplements and yet ignore
the air that we breathe we spoke to
numerous professionals who are otherwise
healthy with all this fatigue we heard
from asthma sufferers who have
persistent symptoms and travellers who
fall ill because the air quality in
their hotel rooms are not at optimal
levels we also heard from parents who
always worried about what their kids are
exposed to both at home and in school
and the thing is we can fix what we
don't know and there has never been an
easy and affordable way to find out
until now
with yoo-hoo your world just got a
little safer and you and your family
just got healthier
you
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
