buck plug to incorporate rotating beads
for a rimming sensation with powerful
vibration in the tip resulting in
exhilarating dual stimulation what's so
special about the rimming our bodies

endings located directly at the entry

and tease the most sensitive nerve
endings located around the entry or rim

from anal play occurs due to the shared
wall between the anus and the pee spot

footwear company that specializes in
adjustable height heels bringing
convenience flexibility and practicality
to the everyday woman we women love our

elongate our legs and enhance the
femininity of our gear but we've also
developed a love-hate relationship with
them the sharp pains aches and cramps
