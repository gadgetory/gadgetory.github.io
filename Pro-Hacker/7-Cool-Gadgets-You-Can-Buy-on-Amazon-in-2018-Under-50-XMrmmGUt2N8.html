from civics now if you could play air
guitar you can make real music with air
jams simple motions trigger notes
and even power cords at the touch of a
button
I once ate a whole box of Girl Scout
cookies Samoas or they're really good
and daddy takes a nap I'll eat as much
candy as I can
once I was watching a movie and at the
end I realized I ate a whole pint of ice
cream I love hot cheeto I love bacon I
love hot cheeto
once ate 50 pieces of bacon in a single
day those that's with hot cheetos I
can't stop eating hot cheeto help me I'm
excited to introduce you to the kitchen
save it fun and easy way to control
temptation the kitchen safe is atomic
container that puts you in control let
me show you how it works first place an
item in the container next rotate the
dial to set the timer and finally press
the dial to activate the lock once the
container is locked it cannot be opened
until the timer reaches zero it's that
easy I came up with the idea of the
kitchen safe will completing my graduate
studies I was looking for something fun
and easy to use and help me with my food
cravings lose a little weight and live a
healthier lifestyle all while still
being able to enjoy the occasional snack
to design a product that lives up to the
highest standards I work with Ryan
saying an engineer and classmate I met
while studying at MIT the kitchen safe
is a time lock container that puts you
in charge you put an item in the
container and set the timer once the
timer is set and the button is pressed
the container locks and cannot be opened
until the timer reaches zero it is a
simple concept that produces powerful
results the goal when designing the
kitchen safe is to create a high quality
product that works well looks good and
it's fun to use
the product has a large clear display a
smooth dial sturdy lock and a clean look
that compares to the highest quality
containers available in stores the
design process took over a year we
investigated many options and with each
prototype we'll refine the design until
we ended with the great working product
the container base is made from four
millimeter thick acrylic for durability
and a clean look the LCD display was
custom developed to incorporate large
high contrast characters for easy
viewing the dial is specifically
selected for its smooth action time
could be set for short as one minute or
as long as 10 days the electronic
locking mechanism was designed to ensure
a strong seal we have tested the kitchen
safe and we're confident that it is a
great product there you have it the
kitchen State we have worked hard to
develop a great product and I've lined
up a factory for production and this is
where we need your help by ordering a
kitchen safe and spreading the words to
your friends you can help us turn it was
just an idea into a product that
thousands of people can use and enjoy
from all of us at the kitchen safe we
thank you
the force the force is what gives a Jedi
is power
it's an energy field created by all
living things it surrounds us penetrates
us it binds the Galaxy together may the
force be with you
host around you
I sense a disturbance in the force
you have found a holocron
remains to be discovered
while creating I blazer - we've
optimized the physical design and made
significant improvements to the
electronic components and now our flash
became more functional and easy to use
at the same time there are new photo
opportunities appearing with a new light
blazer - now it can be paired via
Bluetooth and work with the native iOS
and Android photo application we've
added a sensory panel into a blazer -
you can now adjust the light temperature
with itself this will allow you to make
your photos more professional and it's
become even more easy to use just double
tap and your picture is ready we made a
new mounting system for a blazer -
smartphones and tablets clip with a
silicon coating that will work with
devices from 0.23 inches to 0.3 7 inches
width and cold shoe for digital cameras
we have also and large type laser -
possibilities in our new application
with itself you will be able to
synchronize several devices at once and
set individual adjustments for each of
them now your photos will be even more
beautiful and brighter I blazer - can
also be used in constant light mode it
will help you shoot videos in the dark
and catch lovely moments making them
more brilliant we believe that only
together we can make this product even
better the eye blazer team has already
been working on product enhancements for
two years we are a small team of young
aspiring people who build products
solely by our enthusiasm and love for
photography now we are looking for funds
to start I blazer to mass production and
need your help
we have never raised investment and this
is actually what we are very proud of
that is why we've come back again to
Kickstarter join us and support the I
blazer - project
