hi I'm Camilla and I want to tell you my
story doesn't two years ago I decided to
buy a slim wallet because I was tired of
my big and bulky wallet which caused me
back pain made my pockets super
uncomfortable what I found was that all
the slim wallets in the market and huge
plus such as print collections of cards
especially cash others were somehow
functional but use cheap materials like
elastic bands Tyvek or cheap leather and
so I couldn't find the wall I was
looking and because my brother and I
have always had passionate quality goods
we decided to join forces to create the
best wallet on the market a super
functional in wallet near top Wally's
Castle introducing French world's first
speed walking
we call it a speed wallet because fo you
go with it it's good for fat to take a
bill out simply open his left choose the
one you want and pull it up it's really
that fun to put it back in sample is
light it up to get your for most use
cards sample for this you tap list of
the cards can be easily accessed by
you're playing the walls and pulling
them out
we made it rfid-blocking than just one
side so you can keep your information
secure but still be able to use an
access card when needed we also made it
one of the smallest and slimmest around
so you can keep it in your front pocket
and barely notice it's there
after that we realized that a pocket
will have to carry bulky keychain so
probably with normal teaches that your
keys point everywhere poking your games
and scratching out of savages pocket we
saw there has to be a better way to
carry these and that's why we signed the
Frenchy key
it features a flat designs because
that's when far the shape to fit every
pocket
it's those many that you want in
excelsis carry it all souls up to four
cards so you can use it as a car builder
all our products are hand made of
top-quality capstan the same material
most luxury brands use because of its
smoothness and resistance

to be more productive and also cares

mmmm
I am ugly from stat gear and we're proud
to introduce our latest EDC items the
try pack EPP pen we spent months
designing the perfect blend between a
tactical pen and an EDC a pocket knife
we wanted to have all three features
included in the design but we also
needed it to be as functional and
comfortable to use as possible we
wouldn't consider using any other ink
cartridge in the fitter space ink that
allows you to write in all different
conditions like upside down or on a wet
surface
we've spent countless hours focused on
the curvature of the pen grip making it
as economically correct as possible so
you could write comfortably for long
periods
we've made the knife blade razor sharp
out of 440c stainless steel and easy to
pull out even while wearing heavy gloves
we'll be using the same factory that
manufactures many of our other
top-selling products and have a complete
fulfillment team on hand to get these
out to you without a hitch
thanks for your support
and it is
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
