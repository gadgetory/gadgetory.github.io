in plants my dad was a botanist so he
wrote a lot about plants and worked in a
botanical garden and as a kid I would
look at plants and see them as like mini
universes and there's so much we don't
know about plants about a year ago I
began exploring these concepts of
levitating plants and what's so cool
about magnetism is a force that we we
can't see but we can feel we're
levitating the plant from the ground in
midair and rotating so that it gets
sunlight from all different directions
the idea of a plant not needing soil to
grow really fascinates me and that's
when I got interested in air plants air
plants are plants that grow from the air
they don't require any soil they they
literally take particles from the air
and get nutrients from them I wanted to
create an experience for people in their
homes where they can enjoy plants but in
a new way house plants don't always have
to be the same and what happens if I
levitate this planet in the air will it
grow differently will grow more who
knows
maybe we're gonna discover a new way of
growing plants
we love music and we don't want anything
to get in the way of how it sounds but
placing speakers on a surface leads to
sound quality loss not anymore
welcome to the future of wireless sound
introducing Mars the levitating portable
bluetooth speaker with high fidelity
sound subwoofer and eight hours of
battery life

inch high-frequency horn by using a
world-renowned audio compression
solution that retains the full integrity

built-in high sensitivity microphone and
the portable subwoofer has two USB ports

conference calls Mars can also adjust
its volume based on your proximity to

your phone we believe that our
technology will forever change the way
you listen to music and enjoy industry
designer and news earner design and
music a part of my everyday life but I
really disappointed with the four new
products in the
products is allowed to interpret
co.design with good sound quality or the

out of reach by those people so I
decided to do it myself

experienced acoustic engineers designers
and things from structure design to
attract big elements apply to the
speaker we do everything to achieve zero
loss of sound quality we have created
