I'm a brush the world's first automatic
toothbrush in today's world technology
is constantly evolving and new products
are emerging yet most people still
listen to music using traditional
headphones or earphones we wanted to
bring you a new way to listen to music
with the most advanced technology the
next step of listening to music is now
here introducing 0.i a hat with built in
bone conduction technology that is
wireless and hands-free the battery PCB
on/off switch an LED light are located
in the Bill of the cap 0.i uses bone
conduction technology that sends
vibrations into the skull and directly
into your eardrums the bone conduction
speakers fit snugly offering enhanced
clarity of sound 0.i uses bluetooth
technology that allows you to listen to
music and answer phone calls and it's
all put together into the simplicity of
a hat it has a built-in microphone so
you can answer calls instantly without
the need of an extra headset or
earphones 0.i brings you high quality
sound that is comparable to listening to
music through stereo systems with for
bone conduction speakers compared to the
usual two of our competitors this allows
you to listen to music more clearly
when using 0i you'll have free range to
conveniently listen to the clear and
crisp sound without blockage of your
earphones but at the same time external
noise is audible for safety reasons when
you may be cycling or jogging outside

port from damage with a built-in LED

oil coating that prevents damage from
rain sweat or accidental spillage 0i can
be easily worn anywhere at any time the
possibilities are endless
0i comes in to sleek designs a snapback
and a baseball cap and comes in three
different colors black white and blue
this is a cue ball it's a hard rubber
reaction ball with a moderately erratic
bounce that means if I bounce it to
waist height
it'll deflect up to 18 inches
horizontally forces me to watch and
react to each and every bounce but it's
not too erratic I don't have to chase it
all over the room
so I can bounce the ball really quickly
faster I go the more challenging it is
but it also keeps me at the best of my
ability and keeps my brain fully focused
my mind wanders I'm going to drop this
ball there are two core elements or
exercises to be done using the cue ball
the first is called bounce and catch you
take one or two cue balls and you bounce
them to waist height alternating hands
as you go you try to go as fast as you
can you count how many bounces you can
do in 60 seconds to keep track of how
you're progressing it trains I hand
coordination vision and reaction time
the faster the better the next exercise
trains peripheral vision if you think
about it the center of our vision the
one we used to read with is really quite
small
everything else is peripheral vision so
we can train that we expand our visual
awareness there's very little on the
market that will do that but the cue
ball does it really fast and efficiently
and that this is how it works you do the
same exercise again but this time
instead of watching the balls as you
bounce them you fix your focus on a
point on the ground and you bounce the
cue balls around that fixed point
they're erratic and they're bouncing and
they're small you have to track it with
your peripheral vision and catch it with
your hands you know increase your
confidence in the ability to do that and
as you do it faster and more your brain
will automate that skill so you don't
have to think about it anymore you will
just react and you'll react quickly the
cue ball adapts to any one skill level
you can go slow or you can go fast it'll
work with children as young as five
years old all the way to the elderly
it'll make driving your car a better
experience you'll be able to see more of
what's going on around you if you're an
athlete you'll be able to see hit and
catch better if you're a student or an
adult you'll just simply get better at
eye hand coordination you'll see better
and your reaction times will become much
faster by some cue balls and try these
exercises you'll be amazed at the
results follow me on Facebook follow me
on Twitter there's lots more information
where this came from thanks for watching
you
