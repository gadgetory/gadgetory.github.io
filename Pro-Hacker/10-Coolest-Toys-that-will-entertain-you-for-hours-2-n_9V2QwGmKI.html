not the end of the world because I got
this little thing Hatchin ride is the
new tool that makes having a flat tire
stuck way left it's a quick and
permanent solution to fix just about any
flat and here's the real kicker you
don't even have to take off the wheel I
used to be just like you
shelling out big bucks for tubes and
tires regardless of how bad the damage
was occasionally I'd even try it on my
own
maybe you do too if you're into that
hole self-punishment thing not the
cleanest job in the world either
basically I murdered my bike let me show
you how it works
remove the cap from the patch and ride
tool insert it directly into the hole
pull back the slider then push forward
remove the tool then pump your tyre full
of air and you're up and running or :
and patch and ride works for all types
of tires road bike mountain bikes
cruisers kids bikes clincher and tubular
tubes even jogging stroller tires pretty
much anything with an inner tube catch
and rise cleaner for the environment too
with patch and ride you reduce your
carbon footprint by hatching instead of
tossing that's pretty great getting a
flat tire sucks a patch and rise makes
it suck left

vomitus
drink smart be safe but it wasn't just a
pretty deco same card
I'm Andre and I'm a magician I was born
in Prague Czech Republic and I moved to
Los Angeles for my love of magic and my
desire to grow as a performer and a
human being I've been studying magic for
the past 20 years and I've been working
on a very special principle in cosmetic
for the packet pouring I've done a lot
of research and I made eight different
prototypes each time making the specs
better and prettiest I'm a big believer
in cooperation so I send the prototypes
to the world's greatest life and magic
and I was overwhelmed by the response
I tried my system was managing until I
decided it's time to make my own design
I teamed up with a Swedish designers
Stefan Eriksson and mate butterfly
playing card you may ask why butterflies
well we like butterfly and honestly
together
imagine having someone shuffle the card
give you a value fork and a suit damn it
and you would know exactly where the
four of diamonds is
imagine having someone shuffle the card
hide one shuffle again and just by
looking through the cards very fast
you'd be able to say which card is
missing imagine you had someone shuffle
it hard
pick one without you looking they put
the card back and immediately shove look
like all that without you looking you'd
be immediately able to say it was the
King of Diamonds the static sliders just
blows my mind but a little ways this is
a utility device hidden in a beautiful
deck of playing cards and if you have it
you will be able to do all that the next
step is to get them printed I went to
the top three manufacturers of playing
cards and chose karna Mundi words
leading manufacturer of cards and game
cardamon link immensely cares about
their cards and we have prepared some
amazing stressful for you that have
never been done before and I know you're
going to love them it took a lot of time
patience and money to get all the way
here and together we can have a deck of
playing cards that I strongly believe
not only deserves attention of all
magicians and mentors for their unique
secret but also everybody who likes our
beautiful things and dreams that come
true
lost for once said the great beer can
slow down time and in Oregon we've got
plenty of them best when poured into a
glass circle in a glass and do it as
long as you like in a glass the problem
is the glass doesn't keep beer cold too
even finely crafted perfectly toward
fear against a warm up loses flavor
balance almost immediately
introducing the chalupa the first
vacuum-sealed to propyne blocks that
keeps your beer cold until the very last
sir
any Brewer will tell you that drinking
great beer from a glass is the way to go
the pours better taste better drink up
unique flavors of the beer better than
anything else when served at the right
temperature it just isn't anything like
here has a natural flavor balance and if
it serves to warm it loses that balance
so temperature is crucial the laundry we
can maintain the beers temperature
the longer we can maintain the beers
aromatics and flavor profiles people
have come up with all sorts of ways your
cool there haven't been able to keep
your glass cold until now the chilies
will keep your philosophy or cold for
product a few hours
just drop your blocks right in and
you're ready to start shelling the chili
BB to the stainless steel through old
lines cold rooms cold you can keep
hotter and hotter and in the backing
filled prevents conversation no more wet
hands and water range while the soft
bottom of the squeezy ensures a simple
landing enough - imperfectly we'll never
need a poster again drop in our
infeasible chill pill into the same
chilled forefinger monger the jacuzzi
also works just as well by itself then
pour in your drinks enjoy the same chill
without the glass so how does a too easy
stack up
speak for yourself with the to losing
you don't need to worry about rushing to
your beer so you can sit back relax
enjoy the great outdoors we're seeing
unharmonious leave your favorite song or
simply do absolutely nothing
hi I'm John Saunders Chile's our mission
of the stage hill plane we started to
lose me not only because we love great
beer but we also know that the times
been enjoying it just as important
we've already done the hard work and now
we just need your help to launch
after months of custom design prototypes
and manufacturers we're looking to build
an initial batch crematoria please help
us by backing your campaigns again
remember OS stage the first scanner came
into the world in 1984 since then the
scanning technology updates very slowly
in a highly developed smart office today
people still have to use the traditional
scanner which is not user-friendly or
efficient enough we want to make a
change this is the seiza
scanner a redefined smart office
equipment it is fast able to store data
in the cloud
and it can easily scan books to improve
the scanning speed to less than 1.5
seconds per page
Caeser innovatively uses the CMOS
scanning technology and equipped to a
32-bit m IPS DP you to transfer the
information easily and omit the
complicated procedures of installing
driver caesar cloud enables automatic
cloud processing and storage to achieve
the goal of scanning bounded books
Caesar is equipped with the advanced
smart algorithm which can flatten curved
remove fingerprints purify background
and split pages automatically in
addition with Sony HD camera Caesar can
guarantee the high quality of scanning
with embedded OCR function Caesar can
make image evitable with one click with
the innovative visual presenter function
Caesar can output 1080 video at 30
frames per second Caesar is a smart
scanner based on cloud computing and IOT
technology no matter where you are in
office or at home no matter what they
are financial invoices business contract
or private collection books
Cesar can always help you scan easily
and efficiently
just another nutshell what is this all
about - an expression ballot yeah
everything look at it gorgeous
how do you first open it well how do you
have you turn them on and get them years
ago so simple to connect he just
literally twist it it's the only moving
function on the actual device twisted
select whether you want line in or
bluetooth parallax your phone and then
you're going to get exploring you'll
find the best surface that you want to
you the best surface for the type of
music you're listening to if you place
on the back of a window and you'll hear
sound through both sides bigger the
surface you're placing it on as well but
bigger the sound you're going to
recreate
this isn't just a speaker that you're
going to take home important aside and
see sounds great
you've got to show people a lot so the
other feature we've got that's inside
there as well I think it's really quite
neat so if you were at its place like
this you can place two speakers either
side you've got the stereo sound coming
out of it makes it amazing
we've done things really differently I
think for this campaign we want people
to be able to get hold of this product
quickly we've got five thousands of the
sizer our products there it's done you
want this by Christmas get it signed up
before December the 10th and worship
that you for Christmas
beat drink me the smartphone
breathalyzer so fits your lifestyle
simply remove the cap plug drink made
into your Android phone and follow the
instructions on the free app drinks made
is powered entirely by your phone so you
never need to worry about replacing
batteries after a few seconds to warm up
and stabilize drink mate is ready to use
low for around four seconds and see your
blood alcohol content BAC immediately
displayed on your phone
looks like I'm sober the happiness may
come to be well to discipline with
breathalyzers right now they're getting
more accurate but people are making just
as many poor decisions like driving
ordering one drink too many or calling
that activated they'd never speak to
again we believe in the concept of
social spaces what's the most powerful
motivator in existence peer pressure
why not turn peer pressure into a
positive outcome drinks mate is perfect
fittest using drinks made it's fun but
at the same time would you really let
your friend make a bad decision after
blowing a high number we don't think so
we focused our hardware design on
decreasing the cost and size of anything
we wanted to create a breathalyzer that
was truly inexpensive convenient and
encourage sharing begun the stigma of
bulky breathalyzers that requires
frequent battery swap recalibrations and
gross malfeasance
size of the priority and drink maybe
design nobody wants to add more salt so
what they take with them on the gun you
have a chapstick on your desk
transmitted smaller have a double a
battery lying around drink maid is
smaller join us in having fun while
being safe drink me it's always got your
back this was me every time I went out
to the beach with my family we can all
relate having to carry a mountain of
items across the sand that was one of
the situations that got me thinking of a
multi-purpose carrier to help make our
life a little bit easier that is why I
invented the ear over the ear over is a
lightweight transformable adaptable
carrier designed to replace all those
job-specific carriers that have
saturated the market today
I designed the ear over to consolidate
all your carriers into one package with
just a few simple and intuitive
adjustment that you've over simply and
quickly transforms from one form
into another and another
and another
with a sophisticated design to fit your
lifestyle and thoughtful engineering
that provide strength and durability the
ear over is built to look good be
versatile and work hard send it up in
any closet or slide it underneath your
bed light enough to pick up and pack in
the trunk of your car I created the
earth rover so it can assist you and I
in everyday life adventures
now you can load your cooler tacklebox
hand fishing rods
all in the ear over making the walk to
the pier easier and stress-free so you
can focus on the things that really
matter
for the weekend warriors you'll likely
find yourself buying supplies and
materials for your home project getting
those bulky items from your truck into
your house condo or apartment is always
a burden at least it used to be
and since our family enjoys having
picnics and bike rides now we can load
and go with the ear over so no time is
wasted we make less trips and have more
fun we have been working for more than
two years developing ear over and
getting it ready for production our
engineers have worked tirelessly to
bring this unique and functional
products to life help us take it over to
the next level by contributing to our
campaign and we will do our part and
making sure you have an ear over of your
own thank you for your support
traditional construction bricks are a
work of genius when it comes to building
rigid structures but when you add flex
oh and the little creativity a new door
opens to a world of flexibility like so
when added to regular construction
bricks changes the dynamic of building
and adds you functionality flexibility
strength and support we have seen but a
fraction of what the system can do in
the hands of master builders my name's
James and on the son of mark the creator
of flexor when I saw the product I just
thought you know this is something
pretty special pretty amazing and really
wanted to get on board with it and be a
part of what flexo is and what it can
offer wind flick so was designed we
wanted to give people the opportunity to
really unleash their creativity and that
in turn would just absolutely maximize
the enjoyment they get out of this set
of construction works what led me to
develop pxo was that I was in that
physio and I had a torn arm tender and I
was just amazed absolutely amazed that
the beauty of the body and how bones and
tendons work together over the bone of
the very fixed construction and then
attendant allows
struction to move with elegance so how
does flick sir work it's really simple
the ends of the flexor tendons that's
smuggling into the openings of the
flexor bridge and when you want to get
really extreme you can further secure
the flexor tendon by placing another
brick flexor or otherwise on top then
you can twist bend stretch and flex to
your heart's content
the only limitation to what you create
is the vast expanse of your imagination
and your flexor collection the Flex
though is an add-on to regular
construction bricks it was designed to
add to the experience and the
opportunity that regular construction
bricks allow in terms of creativity as
well as design and ideas it allows you
to for a very small investment basically
and twice if not three times the
functionality to existing correct
collection you already have you are
using uses that coming up every day
would flex oh and how it interacts with
construction bricks it can provide
rigidity X ability stored energy
playability and even bling ability just
like you we love construction bricks and
we love our collections and what we can
build with them we want to add to that
with the release of flex own all we need
now is a little help from you pledge
today to get your flexor
