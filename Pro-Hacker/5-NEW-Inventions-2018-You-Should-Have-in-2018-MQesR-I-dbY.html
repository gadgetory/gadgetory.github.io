weather has an even greater impact on
our lives daily activities work and
plans in general we rely heavily on
weather channels and apps using local
weather stations that could be dozens of
miles away and its values are most of
the time inaccurate what about all the
outdoor plans like sailing camping
safari hiking beekeeping
or agricultural activities with no
access to Internet weather channels or
apps we reinvented that concept and got
a solution to help you take this matter
into your own hands we have created
weather at point the world's smallest
weather station that fits on your
keychain and reads weather values right
at the spot where you are
simply plug whether it point into your
phone connect with app and read and
store values whether at point consists
of sensors that measure temperature
ultraviolet radiation atmospheric
pressure humidity current altitude and
even ambient light for your perfect
photo does not require the internet and
does not need a battery every time you
use weather it point it gathers
information now with the introduction of
weather a point cloud that information
is sent and stored in database that
database is accessible to all so we can
see what the weather was like in the
past the present and the future
anywhere in the world the housing is
made of aluminum and titanium making
this device durable and ensuring a
longer lifetime building hardware is
costly we invested a lot of resources
into making weather at point possible
and now we need your support to make it
affordable and available to anyone
whether at point take your weather with
you and there will be no more rain on
your parade
