snagged your headphone cord if you've
ever been listening and needed to
recharge your new iphone we present to
you air link by me or blab
feels right voices in the morning
feeling like beam the Atlas throttle
walk is a mechanical cruise control that
bolts on in two minutes and requires no
modification for most motorcycles
it's made of heat treated hardened
stainless steel and held together with
u.s. military grade rivets it rotates
with your hand as you accelerate
allowing predictable engagement and
disengagement of the button with your
thumb it's natural and always right
where you expect it to be each kit comes
with everything you'll need to install
the Atlas on nearly any motorcycle the
Atlas was created to solve the issues
other throttle walks presented like
designs that are motorcycle specific
forcing you to sell the device with the
bike taking up grip space when installed
or require a non dominant finger for
activation and guard interference or and
this one's a very common problem needing
to decelerate to disengage the unit the
Atlas suffers from none of these
shortcomings and is 100% source and
manufactured in the United States to
activate the Atlas you simply press the
button in pressure and friction are
applied to hold your throttle in place
to disengage the Atlas press slightly
and then down
put the Atlas engaged you can still
adjust your speed by rotating the
throttle if your motorcycle didn't come
with cruise control the Atlas throttle
lock will be your favorite accessory for
those long days in the saddle the idea
of this new throttle law came to me
during an around-the-world motorcycle
trip while I was clocking hundreds of
miles on my motorcycle day in and day
out after receiving support and
suggestions from literally thousands of
riders we developed a throttle lock to
answer all of our long-distance needs
take a ride with the highest quality
most ergonomic throttle lock everything

nature it the beauty of an aquarium
without the maintenance the no hassle
design is stress-free compact and easy
to use just fill it with water plug it
in and enjoy never change the filters
ever the Eco cubes unique aquaponics
filter use plants to filter the water
fish create waste that fertilize the
plant and as the plant grows larger the
aquarium gets even cleaner it's the same
way nature cleans our rivers lakes and
oceans this is the best low maintenance
eco system ever and it's affordable

dollars to set up and maintain the eco
