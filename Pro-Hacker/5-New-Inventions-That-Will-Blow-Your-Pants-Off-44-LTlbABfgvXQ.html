it's the little things interruptions
that steal our time or focus maybe it's
just a small part or tool but we
searched frantically for a solution to
make it right well now there's n go Ingo
is a handy pocket-sized bar made of
moldable non-toxic polymer that when
heated can be molded into practically
any shape three three minutes in hot
water to make Ingo pliable - you'll have
two minutes to mold it into whatever
shape you need just let it cool down to
room temperature which only takes around
five to ten minutes then it's completely
cured and ready to work an endo is
reusable with hot water or even a
hairdryer you can reheat the part as
many times as you like to modify or
create whatever shade you need
Ingo is strong enough to be used to
fixed and modify the world around you
and it's easy as three two and done Ingo
comes in five colors but what's cool is
that you can mix these colors to produce
nine additional harmonious colors just
follow the color mixing instructions on
the chart provided in each box for
example take a pip of bread and a
pickled yellow mix them and you get an
orange color dingo recently we gave out
samples of n go to try and even we're
surprised at the variety of ideas where
Ingo has made people's lives I
accidentally broke my kitchen spatula I
love to cook I'm always in the kitchen
and when that broke I thought I might
need to buy a new one but then I got out
in go and put it on the spatula and it's
just like new that I use you know to do
my eyebrow makeup and my I use a pencil
sharpener so it gets really shorts where
I can hardly get you know get it to do
it so what I did is I used ego to just
make it longer tasting it
make like a handle board really help me
fix it get your door hinge which my wife
complained about and we'd love to be
able to offer the benefits of in go to a
lot more people but in order to do that
we need additional capital in order to
produce and go for a larger market

the little things
