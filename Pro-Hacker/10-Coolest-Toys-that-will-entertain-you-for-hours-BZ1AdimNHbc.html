be a lot of fun growing up but the
technology just wasn't good enough to
let us do what we really wanted back in
1997 we set out to turn pogo sticks into
a whole new sport our concept was based
on the idea of having a portable
trampoline something you can jump three
six or even ten feet high on but also
take any where you want to go the v4 is
the portable trampoline we'd always
dreamed up with the v4 you have the
ability to add or remove air and
completely change the stiffness of the
bounce someone who weighs 300 pounds can
jump on the same exact v4 as someone who
only weighs 80 pounds all you need to do
is change the air pressure in less than
a minute
you can perfectly tune the v4 to each
riders preferences pumping more air in
to jump higher and taking air out to
jump lower this makes sharing it with
friends and family a fun-filled
experience that everyone can enjoy
you can also collapse the v4 to make
transportation a breeze whether you're a
pro or just stepping on to the v4 for
the very first time you'll love the
weightless flight like experience you'll
get the basics in minutes and from that
point on there's no limit to how far you
can challenge yourself with the v4
you'll be able to jump up onto ledges
down stairs and over gaps of all sizes
while nailing down some pretty awesome
tricks after playing around on the v4
you'll never look at your surroundings
in the same way again
obstacles and features that are too high
for bikes and skateboards are perfect
for the v4 so those of you looking for a
fun way to stay in shape the v4 will
work most of the muscle groups in your
body and get your heart pounding
immediately it's a killer cardio workout
and the best part is that while you're
having fun bouncing around you won't
even realize how quickly you build a
sweat
in order to achieve superior build
quality and maintain the high tolerances
necessary for the v4 to work we
manufacture and assemble it right here
in our Southern California shop we work
closely with our suppliers to become a
part of the build process and as each
component is made or right there to test
them
this streamlines are manufacturing and
ensures that every v4 we make is up to
our standards if you're looking for the
portable trampoline that we always
dreamed of v4 is going to knock your
socks off whether you want to use it
simply for exercise or to jump eight
feet high and do crazy tricks on is up
to you and we know you'll love every
second of it
join us and help change the way pogo
sticks are seen forever
for so long technology has been held
back by one important thing emotion
that's why we created oli the first
robot assistant with an evolving
personality and a deep breath outwards
let the stress fall away Megan I would
suggest raising the temperature by 10
degrees hot yoga can increase weights
loss and build muscle tone let's do it
not a problem at all oli is proactive
meaning it anticipates your needs
just a thought Megan shall I set the
mood with some jazz while you read yeah
music through only sounds amazing -
because it knows where you are in the
room it can best direct the audio to
your liking no matter the track and no
matter the mood our AI system and
character engine creates a unique
personality for every ollie
that means each one will relate to you
in a distinctive way go go go one more
Kevin and you hit your target for the
day well done good morning Angela it's
time to wake up
hey Ryan long day long which I think a
bit of a guitar therapy might do the
trick
what I was started with mission to chant
human relationships with technology all
is the first robot a system with
evolving personality people are
different
how one is unique and so is our robot
our team is also made of an incredibly
diverse group of people with when the
best talents from AI neuron science
engineering robotics design and
animation that avoids life into a robot
we've also unfortunate enough to work
with some top professors in their
respective field Ali's the first
robotics product that has won four
Innovation Awards in CES we do that in
2017 we've come a long way and iterated
quite a bit through our journey now we
are ready to manufacture at a large
scale and we need your help to take all
you to the next stage of production ok
now it's time to join us and we're not
here's a list of stuff from kind of
magical to unbelievably magical body
wash that's also shampoo Mentos and cola
things that fly with your help the
magical is about to get magical her meet
shy a pilot an industrial designer and
an inventor he loves things that fly he
wants try to turn his car into an
airplane no success shy Olli said that
his dream was to bring the joy of flight
to everyone a few years ago he made a
breakthrough in the field of cool stuff
that flies he invented the power up the
first electric paper airplane but then a
friend of shai's told him nice gadget
really but you can't make a
remote-controlled paper airplane shy
took a moment to think and said
challenge accepted two years of research
and 57 prototypes later he made it
happen
Meech eyes unbelievably magical
invention power op 3 the first ever
smartphone controlled paper airplane
using state-of-the-art technology power
up three turns your embarrassing paper
plane into a lean mean flying machine
just fold a piece of copy paper to a
plane attach power up three and install
the app now call your mom and tell your
a pilot because it works out of the box
in the back of the module are a
propeller and a rudder that are in
charge of controlling the plane in the
front there's an advanced ship with
powerful Bluetooth smart technology for
an amazing 60 yards of controlled flight
and a tiny rechargeable battery to power
this amazing beast out of juice charge
the battery with any microUSB cable as I
learned and his career as a pilot planes
should be billed we're flying and for
crashing that's why all components of
the powerup 3 are super durable and
crash proof but here's where shy made it
really cool
powerup threes smart shape is programmed
to optimize user happiness you don't
need a PhD in aeronautics to be able to
fly it the prototype is fully functional
and the super ultra magical powerup 3 is
ready for production this is where shy
need your magic beings if you help shy
get to 1,400 backers you'll help him
bring the joy of flight to everyone and
obtain the privilege to look down on
regular paper planes for the rest of
your life
so back power up 3 and help make the
magical magical herb
you
GoPro videos are always shaky and
stabilizers out there are too complex
heavy and too big to be mounted anywhere
at noir matter we wanted to create a
solution that was so convenient that it
would become part of your camera
so we developed Clark the world's
smallest waterproof stabilizer for your
GoPro that stabilizes your camera to
keep it leveled and create amazing
cinematic shots no matter what Clark is
so small that you don't need to remove
your camera anymore it becomes an
extension of it allowing you to mount it
on the camera mounts you already have
just turn it on with your camera and you
are ready to go
mark is a lot more than a stabilizer
it's a real tool with built-in moving
time-lapse feature to brings a new way
of creating content and empowering you
to be more creative
developed by engineers and athletes we
went through many iterations of
prototypes to develop a product
optimized for your camera
together let's start a new era in
personal video maker so we are now ready
to bring that product to market but we
need your help
so Bacchus today any questions from the
way you create
start with an idea make coffee just
kidding I don't drink coffee sketch the
design kill the design think some more
get out the sewing machine make a seat
sit on it stop sitting start doing find
it found it test it back to the drawing
board tear tear tear let's do this for
real machine it love it right reveal it
give it a leather seat give it red
stitching give it a shiny paint job give
it a handle for precise steering did I
mention it spins
consonant get it in the newspaper patent
it again we're on a mission to make a
product that is not only unique but fun
as well when you're sitting five inches
off the ground suddenly every tree
becomes an obstacle every ramp becomes
an opportunity in every corner becomes a
drift
spin-spin-spin your way to happiness
find your path or your turn because in
the end it's all about the feelings and
the excitement this is what you've been
waiting for this is Harrison he loves a
good game of ping pong but finding a
competitive partner is hard
Shane is unbeatable not fun
catherine is still learning also not fun
and Matthew now there's a great partner
but he's not always around introducing
trainer bot it's your new ping-pong
partner that's always available and
always competitive he can shoot any spin
anywhere on a table on any table it's
got the accuracy of a machine triple its
size but it fits in your back and it's
the first of its kind they'll let you
control all of this from your phone
trainer bot lets you pick a setting
that's perfect for you beginners can
practice beforehand with slow easy shots
just choose a location spin type and a
slow interval as you improve Tara Bach
rose with you you can create a
that involves multiple shots like
forehand and backhand and for advanced
players trainer Bob becomes
unpredictable you can make it shoot
randomly and maximum speed in close
games there's no feeling like hitting
that epic shot those moments are rare
but they don't have to be because
trainer BOTS can recreate a me match
situation hit a hundred smashes slice a
thousand shots it never misses having
trouble beating your friends trainer ba
can turn their toughest shots into
drills with enough practice will beat
them next time and never waste another
tutorial trainer Bob transforms hours of
YouTube into hours of gameplay it's also
designed to help people connect
regardless of their experience level now
anyone can play together without holding
back or feeling outmatched
it's your ultimate ping-pong partner it
was so much fun especially that crazy
setting where it just shoots everywhere
I'm kind of sweating a little bit right
now within 20 seconds I was already
starting to make small adjustments to
how I was holding the paddle I was
started out and it seemed but then it
got so much harder I mean there's
something for every skill level I've
actually played ping pong robots before
not actually blew my mind
hi Kickstarter I'm Alex and I'm Harrison
me and my brother always try to kick
each other's ass while we play ping pong
so we start shooting first turnabout
with just a garbage can to just search
for us to smash but later on we find out
with app and software you can do a lot
more you can simulate games you can
create your own drills and the coolest
part is you can share those drills with
anyone in the world three months ago
we decide to join axe which is the
world's largest hardware accelerator we
source a lot of motors and we also
designed all the mechanism from the
ground up to give you the fun experience
that we want you to have we have talked
to many manufacturers now now the last
part it's just pulling and Kickstarter
that's why we need your help please back
and share this campaign on Kickstarter
so we can bring Turner bot to you
Bobby that don't do that
