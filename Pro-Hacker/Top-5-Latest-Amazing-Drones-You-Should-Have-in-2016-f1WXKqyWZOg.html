ground it's that simple
every time we innovate it becomes the
standard often imitated but never
replicated our newest creation is all
this and more the Phantom 4 is an
easy-to-use flying camera powered by the
world's most advanced artificial
intelligence technology now all you have
to do is directed where'd it go
here let's take a closer look at this
thing
it's a total redesign polished shell the
vented composite core underbelly
engineered for strength and weight sleek
refined elegance but there's tremendous
strength and elegance look a reinforced
gimbal for greater stability and the
motors refined for increased flight
efficiency raised so you can go faster
without propellers hook it into footage
where they don't belong that's gonna
come in handy when you're going fast how
fast that fast
we've added a new support mode for more
experienced pilots to get i popping
shots and maybe just to bring out your
inner speed demon philosopher immanuel
 said all of our knowledge begins
with the senses the phantom fork the
same exact thing we've added four
sensors like eyes in front and
underneath that do sonar detection point
cloud stereoscopic recognition look it
can see everything in front of it from
nearly 50 feet away and over 30 feet
underneath it obstacles like trees rocks
bison it hits the brakes full stop
check this out
the phantom4 self-flying innovations are
made possible by two revolutionary new
features that simplify the flying
experience cap fly an active track with
tap fly you need only to tap the live
view on-screen where you want to go like
save right there right now the Phantom 4
is intelligently adapting to its
surroundings detecting ground elevation
and obstacles in its way when in tap fly
mode it will even reroute and navigate
around an obstruction all by itself and
all you did was a tap active track
allows the Phantom's camera to
distinguish specific objects in its
viewing path and track them with just a
tap of a finger and without any sort of
remote receiver it's this adaptive
machine learning that allows the Phantom
to understand how you look from every
angle even if it can only see you from
one that means you a friend your pet
virtually anything you can think of and
it has a flight range of up to five
kilometers are you seeing this the
Phantom is flying long and circling a
moving subject capturing smooth perfect
video this is an incredibly challenging
shot to pull off a skinny pilot but now
even the most demanding shot becomes
uncomplicated achieved with a simple
flick of the stick by the way this
intelligent technology means return to
home is even smarter than before with
this new sensory technology it returns
to you while avoiding and rerouting away
from obstacles it's safer easier and
more reliable than ever before the
addition of these new autonomous
features means more usable shots than
ever before no more set up no more
ruined footage because of a bad angle or
camera bump now all of your shots are
going to look like this
or this or this so that's awesome
the phantom force camera is better than
ever its new lens is composed of eight
separate elements for improved sharpness
and chromatic aberration handling it
also shoots in 4k Ultra High Definition
at 24 25 and 30 frames per second and 60
and 120 frames per second at 1080 and we
couldn't forget the battery completely
redesigned reform to be more compact and
easier to access all while increasing
the flight time to 28 minutes all in a
composite core unibody which is lighter
and sturdier than aluminum your senses
are what dial you into all aspects of
life in the world around you we are only
the capacity of what we experience the
phantom 4 is the first quadcopter to
harness those senses and show you a
world without limits it is truly your
flying companion by your side actively
involved in every adventure and burst of
inspiration you might stumble on with
the phantom 4 the world is your blank
canvas what are you gonna do with it
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
