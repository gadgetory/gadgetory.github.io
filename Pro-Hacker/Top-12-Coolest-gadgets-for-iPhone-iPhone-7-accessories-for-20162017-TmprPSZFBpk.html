have a great flight and always on pop
slate it's everything you need at a
glance well nowadays people take
thousands of pictures with their cell
phones but they never look at them so we
decided to create an object that will
make them able to share pictures with
their their friends and family in a
tangible way print is the first
smartphone case that prints out pictures
instantly you just have to drag your
smartphone snap a picture and imprint
instantly we worked during a year on
about 15 different prototypes to come up
with one product that's really easy to
use for example it doesn't use Bluetooth
technology or Wi-Fi you can take a
picture but you can also use pictures
from Facebook Instagram any picture that
is already on your smile
my biggest design challenge was to
create and objects that will work with
different type of smartphones who are
compatible with the iPhone 5 the iPhone
6 and also the galaxy s4 in galaxy s5
and we are trying to bring it to more
smart phones we don't need any ink
cartridge all the ink is already in the
paper you just have to hit it and the
picture will appear like neck magic like
I said what we really love about instant
cameras is the whole experience so we
try to capture it by recording your
short videos at five six seconds just
before you take a pictures this video
will play automatically on the paper
through augmented reality when you scan
it with our app
we wanted to go further than just
printing pictures we wanted to bring
memories that you could hold in your
hands and that you could give away
whenever you wanted print is for
everybody because everybody likes a
printed picture that you can hold in
your hand you know it's like a memory
that you can get away trees the stone
must stop this shake and distance go
see Devils is a charge Wow right so
you're not only stabilizing with that
but it's charging so it's like put your
phone in never have to go home a charger
is charging my shoe Wow
you
you
phones have evolved so much over the
past 15 years there's one problem you're
too big for our hands in fact in the US
alone a phone breaks every two seconds
costing us time money and sometimes even
our dignity that's why we created loopy
in first case with the loop to stop the
dry the first thing you'll notice about
being in the loop is how secure and in
control it feels loopy literally makes
it hard to drop your phone these phones
are so big and slippery
they're impossible these one-handed they
seem to put all the most used buttons
and the hardest roof spots both loopy
reaching your whole screen is a breeze
even with the iPhone 6 plus
using your phone with loopy is truly a
one-handed experience and who isn't
always telling a million things at once
the Malta grasp is a lifesaver
simply flip grab and go you don't
realize how nice having an extra hand is
until you're in the loop loopy is a
perfect running buddy all of your apps
and music conveniently in your hand
no more frustrating hard-to-reach arm
bands your phone has an awesome camera
and with loopy you can use it to its
full potential for study pictures and
video even in crazy places you've never
imagined pulling out your phone before
in fact this entire Kickstarter video
was filmed using nothing but iPhones and
our loopies how cool is that we found
through countless prototypes to find the
perfect design and even secure the
patents after testing dozens of
materials we chose silicon loops for
their unique properties our lips are
strong they're durable they're super
secure ensuring that your phone goes
Noah most importantly loops lay flat fit
into any pocket using the tightest ones
in there perfect for when you don't have
pockets at all they're super comfy
so no more face drops and lips even act
as a kickstand for sharing videos loops
are easy to install and adjustable to
fit any finger size plus they're
interchangeable make a loop be perfect
for any edges
loopy is the perfect balance of slim and
protective with wraparound bumpers to
ensure that your phone stays in mint
condition
and thanks to early customer reviews and
surveys no detail was overlooked
including oversized accessory ports easy
press buttons and durable materials are
designed to outlast your next phone up
drip loop you won first prize at both
Purdue and Indiana University
entrepreneurship competitions
those are the loop love they're even the
pro this is one of the highest rated
slim cases that we've reviewed out of
three dozen cases always really
refreshing to find a product that
actually makes the technology that we
have is supposed to make our lives
easier easier to use
and now we need your support please back
this project to help make loopy a
reality and please share this with
everyone you can and with your support
we can stop the drop
share this project on Facebook Twitter
or Instagram and we'll toss in one free
Kickstarter addition loop with each case
in your pledge
you
you interact with your phone every day
more than any other object or person for
most of us it's the first thing we wake
up to and the last we look at so why not
make your day that little bit easier
that's why we've invented a SAP X
connect to improve the way you interact
with your phone and USB devices forever
please help support our IndieGoGo
campaign and take a step towards making
your day easier

smartphones are a brilliant invention
they function as our camera our GPS our
flashlights and even as our entire
computer app developers do their best to
make user interface as simple and
intuitive as possible to play music roll
your eyes message sent to mom but
sometimes it's easier to manage things
with a physical controller meet nimi and
Busey the inventors of pressing a new
way to control and automate your
everyday smartphone actions Pressey is a
tiny physical button that connects to
your headphone jack and sends unique
signals to an intuitive app that can
activate one of many commands here are
some of the many things you can do with
your press e take instant photos and
upload them to your favorite social
network turn on your LED light send your
location for emergencies start a
discreet tape recording don't tell
anyone but I like bears check into your
favorite social network and much more
Pressey is not just a one-trick pony you
can easily configure the Pressy app to
execute different actions for different
sequences of clicks for example two
short clicks can call your mom and two
long clicks can call your dad but what
if you want to use your headphones just
let press e rest in the special key
chain and use the headphone button as
pressing it all still works press E even
has an API so developers can bring you
more cool features press e the almighty
button

if you need to carry two phones on the
go for whatever reason peace is a simple
a solution this is how it works take the
SIM card out from your work phone put in
beefs connect piece to your private
phone via bluetooth and now you can get
rid of your work phone when your friends
or family call your private number hey
I'm gonna shoot right now can I call you
back in a minute
or your boss calls your working number
it all happens in one phone via the P
stop so you can control all the settings
of both your numbers separately manage
your contacts send text messages
basically just work your phone like you
normally do peace is so small it fits
easily anywhere you barely even know
it's there
oh one last thing when your phone and
peace are over 15 meters apart peace
will ring to prevent you from losing
your only phone you can also use peace
to look for your phone just like you
would your car in the parking lot that
way we make sure you have one and only
one phone on you at all times
likewise if pieces in your wallet
you can use the peace app to look for it
so it's nothing big just this piece
right here and it will certainly make
your life a little easy thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
