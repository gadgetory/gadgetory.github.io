medical system is that you only connect
with the system every now and then we
are in the biggest tsunami of
personalisation in the world but for
medicine we are still waiting in line in
an emergency room with your smartphone
you can find out about anything anywhere
but what you can't find is information
about your own body in 2005 I spent
almost a year in hospital with one of my
children I started to look at all the
machines and all the readings after a
couple of weeks I understood it and it
was very liberating to have that
knowledge I want to make a company that
you know gives people these numbers the
Scout will allow people to see the
fingerprint of their health in very
minut detail when you have a visit with
a physician or you go to an ER the first
thing they do is check the vital signs
to see where you're at right now this
just hold it to your forehead in a
second you have all of it the Scout
gives you your heart rate your blood
pressure your temperature your
respiratory rate and your oxygen levels
in your blood
scanadu scout works everywhere it
analyzes all your readings and then
stores it in when people have a scout
they can connect with their physician in
ways that was never possible before we
are competing in the XPrize this is
important because what we aim to do with
scanadu scout is to bring the five
senses into a single recording device we
will have essentially a doctor in the
palm of your hands this is the ultimate
consumer device for medicine we put a
lot of thought into giving you medical
grade data that's easy to understand
records it and enables you to
communicate with your physician and make
smart decisions together we have a
relationship with NASA although their
medicine was never actually destined to
be for consumers it was listened to
before astronauts in space station this
is exactly the kind of responsive
platform that we need this allows us to
go further and enhance our performance
right now when you buy a cup of coffee
you can see that transaction on your
smartphone even before you leave the
store with the Scout you can see the
impact on your health before you leave
the store so for parents you can find
out early in the day if your child is
gonna be sick later than they are not
it's something that's good for all of us
this is one of the most exciting times
in the history of medicine and the
history of health we can finally
understand our bodies and adjust them in
ways that it's never been possible
before but that takes all of us working
together so join us in making this a
reality what if it was simple to use a
regular pen and paper notebook while
saving everything in the cloud perfectly
organized the way you want and what if
after you saved your notes in the cloud
and filled your paper notebook you could
just erase it with the push of a button
and enjoy a fresh new notebook that's
not magic
that's rocket book with the rocket book
notebook and the rocket book app you
blast your notes into the cloud as fast
as you can flip through them in a
fraction of a second rocket books scans
and processes each page even two at a
time
rocket book sees where each set of notes
starts and ends and sends everything to
the cloud services you use in the places
they belong each rocket book page has
seven symbols set up the rocket book app
to assign each symbol to a location
within Dropbox Google Docs or Evernote
or simply to your email inbox
let's see how jake has his setup he
marks the airplane symbol and rocket
book sends the notes to his client
meetings notes in Evernote when he's
brainstorming he marks the crown symbol
which he decided are for the notes that
belong in his ideas folder
now that your notes are in the cloud and
your notebook is filled up there's no
need to go buy another book or let use
two notebooks clutter your life
rocket book has you covered here's how
you can use the same rocket book over
and over by erasing it after each use
with the mere push of a button take your
notes using friction pilot pens
available in many office supply stores
and amazon.com friction pilot ink turns
clear under heat and the rocket book is
specially designed to be microwave safe
that means you can reset rocket book in
your microwave faster than it takes to
warm up a cup of coffee and who doesn't
like to start the day with a fresh new
notebook the utility of the cloud and
the joy added neighbor
that's rockin hook

with a leading global manufacturer to
build a fantastic high-definition screen
for the Smart Remote
but you have seen is just the beginning

when was the last time you got excited
about a home theater experience and not
about the movie or game but about the

2014 we invented the first levitating
speaker using magnetic repulsion to lead
the speaker up in the air because of
zero friction helping to bring our
speakers best performers we spent the
past two years developing our own
electrostatic tampering drivers
traditional dynamic drivers need to have
a chamber to create resonance
electrostatic dam friend drivers is very
thin and only a chamber which can only
be found in the most expensive and best
headphones ever built and rarely in
compare speakers with our own patent
