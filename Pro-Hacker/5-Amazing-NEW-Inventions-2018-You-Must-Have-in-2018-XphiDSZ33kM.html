name is Vader and his last name is
Skywalker oh hi this is no go ahead
mount display with image quality that
doesn't suck
like other head mount displays Mogu
turns your phone into a big screen but
unlike other head mount displays Mogo
doesn't lose pixels the magic of bogo is
in the lenses they were created by this
guy Arthur Sze the lenses of other head
mount displays can only see half the
screen so the devices cut the size of
the original screen in half then puts an
even smaller image side-by-side that
allows you to watch 3d movies but also
creates pixelation so even if you have a
2k phone you'll only see 1/5 of the
pixels and that's less than HD
with mojo Arthur creatively special
lenses each covers the whole screen thus
maintaining the full quality if you've
used other head mount devices you might
have noticed that your eyes ache you can
get dizzy and sometimes even nauseous
that's because their lenses need to be
perfectly aligned and adjusted to the
distance between your eyes mogo's lenses
don't need any adjusting so you can
watch a full-length movie without any
side effects man I feel so fucked
Mogo has a lot of other advantages
unlike other devices mochou allows you
to see your peripheral environment so
you don't look like an idiot to use Mogo
just put your phone in that's it and any
phone fit and there's also a foldable
version
logo fits perfectly even with glasses
and if you want to pause or rewind just
use your finger
that's good rewinding oh and ask for
drones you know when you use them to
shoot fancy high-resolution video
wouldn't you want to see the full
resolution of what you're shooting yeah
GameChanger look at that well that's a
man drowning we should call for help
Mogo also has an app that shows your
actual drone location on your phone
screen even when the drone is out of
sight now that's at a site so if you two
want to watch content in the best
quality or phone offers get Mogo
this is filter it may not look like much
but this small device solves some very
large problems we live in a time where
everything you do online is monitored
tracked or censored just because you
don't have anything to hide doesn't mean
you don't deserve privacy finding a way
to stay private and secure is not such
an easy task services are fragmented and
none provide coverage on multiple
devices making it a hassle to stay
protected we created filter in order to
make privacy and security more
accessible and easier to use filter

capability and Tor anonymity and all the
devices in your home this is especially
important for devices that don't
normally support these applications like
gaming consoles Smart TVs and media
players those who not only protects you

prevents companies government's and
internet providers from seeing more

activity searches and even physical
location in VPN mode filter uses
enterprise grade encryption to protect
all the devices in your home
simultaneously this level of security
keeps all incoming and outgoing web
traffic private VPN mode also allows
access to geo restricted content or
censorship simply by switching regions
within the app filters app is incredibly
easy to use

like to connect to or automatic for the
speediest connection you can switch
between VPN mode and tour or configure
more advanced settings filter also does
the job of blocking advertisements
dangerous websites checkers and malware
infected advertising is a huge threat
annoyance with filter you'll never have
to see him let's just add again to stay
ahead of threats all security features
and lists are kept up-to-date
automatically you can choose what you
want to have updated or turn this off at
any time filter has a lot of
capabilities but setup couldn't be
easier on all of your network traffic
through filters simply by connecting it
between any modem and router filter will
start working automatically and can be
configured within the app filter can be
used as a regular router which you can
connect your devices to via Wi-Fi or
ether

powered off an external battery even if
