almost half your tooth surfaces most of
it is between your teeth sir told to
floss but who likes flossing anyone
that's what I thought and I don't blame
you it's awkward it's time-consuming and
here's the real kicker it's not even the
most effective way to clean between your
teeth according to a recent Associated
Press report there has to be a better
way until now water flossers have been
one of the only players in the game
their tedious messy and more often than
not end up stuffed under a cabinet
similar to 'the shower is next level
water flossing and so much more it's a
complete oral hygiene experience from
the comfort of your shower
simply attach it to your shower wall and
hook it up to the water source tooth
shower uses water pressure so no
annoying plugs or batteries are needed
it's got three different attachments for
a triple threat approach to oral care
first there's the dual headed toothbrush
which hits the front back and chewing
sides of your teeth for comprehensive
surface coverage then there's the
irrigating tip it reaches where the
toothbrush is handed it's like a water
flosser only it's in the shower so it's
no mess no fuss because it's in the
shower you'll never run out of water and
you won't have to sacrifice any precious
counterspace and let's not forget about
the revolutionary dumbest on your ear
gaining and stimulating blood flow in
your gums this is a huge part of gum
disease prevention and in less than 10
seconds you can flush out everything
between all your teeth what we saw in
your go
for the first time ever you'll actually
enjoy with each attachment you can
adjust the water pressure and
temperature to your comfort level and
use with your choice of water mouthwash
or tooth whitening when you're ready to
switch attachments just remove this one
worried about getting water everywhere
well you're in the shower so it doesn't
matter and with multiple attachments the
whole family can use to check which
means better oral hygiene for everyone
that means a lot fewer expensive and
painful dental procedures and fewer
instances of gum disease you probably
won't be surprised to learn it was
created by a dental hygienist Lisa's
been deep in the tooth world for over 25
years and she realized there wasn't a
single easy convenient way for her
patients to effectively clean that to
you so she decided to design one herself
no power source no mess and because it's
in the shower to shower is easy to
integrate into your routine becoming a
second major as washing your hair place
Lisa and her team have been hard at work
perfecting 2 showers design and
prototyping program
now they just need your help getting to
shower to the masses with the funds
raised here they'll be able to place a
bulk first order to get these made and
bring to shower to market for a whole
new approach to rural hygiene tooth
shower the future of oral hygiene is in
the shower back our campaign today

the NY SW is a sophisticated analog
fitness tracker and a stylish timepiece
that encourages you to exercise more by
sending you a reward when you hit your
goal
we've leave a time patient offer you
more than just the time so when it came
to the design we were extremely
conscious of its appearance as well as
functionality
we wanted to capture the energy of a
bustling city with all its power and
sophistication based on our very own Big
Apple with decades of experience poured
into this project we spent over 15
months to work through that
forward-thinking functionality and
standout designs we see in our watches I
believe there were customers who liked
the idea of the Smart Watch but we're
missing a classic and sophisticated look
this beautiful watch has found a way to
incorporate the most important smart
features without sacrificing its
pearance
gonna be the most was the idea of an
analogue SmartWatch I love the
possibilities of a SmartWatch with the
technology but I hated the fact that I
lost that classic look the NY SW is a
perfect match it's sophisticated style
was exactly what I was looking for I
love the fact that I can track my steps
and calories with the fitness counter I
travel for work the watch automatically
syncs to wherever I am as a personal
trainer I'm always encouraging my
clients stay health-conscious even when
they're not at the gym Smart Watch is a
perfect tool for that but many of my
clients didn't wear them to work some
because they're so tech you're looking
they have no style for the guys who work
hard and dress to impress this analog
watch does exactly that if you are
someone who doesn't want to sacrifice
your style for function this NY SW watch
is for you

each mill and brushing for at least
three minutes but honestly who really
doesn't and who bothers always
performing the right movements both

been the same for decades often in a
