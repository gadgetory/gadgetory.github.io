basically always on you're texting using
your apps clicking your tweets and even
in the car you have this compulsion to
treat it the same way but you can't
because when you do bad things happen
mother you can mount your phone on the
dash for navigation sure is that any
safer no it's not bad you need your eyes
in front of you you need to have these
now being the portable device we put on
your dashboard with every mobile app you
keep your eyes on the road ahead
it's a heads-up display just like what
commercial airline pilot sees when
they're landing
you hear that pilot using safe there's a
tiny super high quality projector that
puts the UI on a transparent screen in
the field of view projected like it's 2
meters out in front of you so you never
have to adjust your focus away from your
driving it connects wirelessly to your
phone on iOS or Android and has its own
apps all designed around the driving

driving in the future said and I think

my name
through the
you
you
you
keeping our home safe is important to
all of us getting your house broken into
socks it's not just stuff that you lose
but because your home feels violated
what you want is to keep it from
happening in the first place that's why
we created Kuna help you prevent
break-ins
this is Kuna Kuna is a smart Wi-Fi
camera built into an elegant outdoor
light fixture it detects people and
alerts you you can see and talk to them
on your smartphone hey could you leave
the package out front we're a little bit
it's best way to actively prevent
break-ins most burglaries are crimes of
opportunity the burglars were actually
knocking on your door to see if you're
home and when they realize you're not
home they'll attempt to enter your house
keeping them outside is the most
important thing you can do and Kuna
allows you to do you can deter burglars
by talking to them or setting off from
his alarm yeah no thanks don't leave and
all this happens when they're still
outside before they even try to break in
making your home safer it shouldn't be a
chore for one of these you have to climb
in the Attic run wires drill holes it's
a pain and it's not cheap that's why we
built Kuna into an outdoor light just
replace your old light fixture it and
use your existing wiring connect to
another Wi-Fi and you're done it'll take
15 minutes do we want Kuna to look good
no matter where it is so we're making it
in three different styles to match your
house you can put Kuna anywhere front
door back door even the garage to wash
your car
oh and your light get smarter too you
can control it with the Kuna app turn it
on turn it off set a schedule or just
let it turn on automatically when it
gets dark when there's a person you only
want to get alerts that matter Kuna
ignores trees and small animals and it
recognizes people's behaviors so you
don't want to know every time your
spouse goes out jogging
you can tell Kuna to alert you only for
visitors waiting at the door
and it'll learn and get smarter over
time
there's a peace of mind that comes from
knowing what's happening at your home
whether it's your loved ones of the
delivery guy Kona will always let you
know and if someone bad now you can do
something about it kuna stop break-ins
before they happen hey are you so ready
yeah all right do this
oh wow that is so cool I've always
believed it's best to show your child
where to look but never tell them what
to see because children are natural-born
explorers mother nature is their
favorite teacher puddles are seen as
opportunities not obstacle
challenges are to be readily accepted
what are you want and not fear
their greatest adventure is always what
lies ahead
just do that awesomely and now you can
see more than ever before
with a hangs ghost drone 2.0 but on the
propeller it's super easy to take
anywhere the controls mimic the movement
of our smartphone
and she thinks that's pretty cool and
the VR goddess gave us both a whole new
perspective to share in the experience
elevate your view of the world but he
hangs goes drone 2.0 the first vr drone
fully controlled by your phone welcome
to the next level
a single rep that's how it starts a
movement of your body inspired by the
promise of a better place a place that
is not always easy to find but a place
you've been before
a place where hard work is an indulgence
and pain and sweat are the spoils of
success you know how good it feels there
so you keep going another rep every rep
becomes a step in every step and fatik
yes yes to feeling good yes to better
help yes to a natural high yes to more
energy
but at times unannounced
this place can start to fade doubt
wanders in do you let it slip away or at
such times you just need a little
direction a map of where you are where
you've been and where you need to go
next to get to that place yes to me
yes to life yes to a place of true
sustainable fitness
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
