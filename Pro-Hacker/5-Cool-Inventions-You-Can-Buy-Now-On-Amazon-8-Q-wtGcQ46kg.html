asked the world to imagine a pen that
could literally draw in the air two
years on we've made the world's first 3d
printing pen even better with the new

plastic allowing instant 3d creation and
with no software or computers the
possibilities are limited only by your
imagination we've shipped over a hundred
and thirty thousand first generation

them to create amazing things and
jewelry to RC planes fully three doodle
dresses architectural models and even
writing Braille it was because of the
