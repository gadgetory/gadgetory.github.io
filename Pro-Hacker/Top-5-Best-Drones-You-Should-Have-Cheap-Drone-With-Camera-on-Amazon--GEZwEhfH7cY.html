this era selfie gadget that can take
unique pictures to all but it has a
small size so much that it can fit in
the pocket and they can make you look
cool anywhere anytime
the answer is Dobby
you
are you interested say goodbye to your
selfie sticks let's dock hi everyone
this is Jack Xiong the co-founder of en
many of you may heard that we are about
to release the new product this November
that's why I'm here to talk about the
next generation of realms the ghost
ground 2.0 it's been nearly a year since
we released the first generation of the
ghosts realm in the past one year we
brought it to over 70 countries and has
grown our team from five nearly 200
since we released the ghost 1.0 we've
been thinking a lot how can we make the
next generation better today we're ready
to share our new products with all of
you
the ghost drone 2.0 is a completely new
flying experiences we combine the first
person virtual reality diagram and the
gesture based smartphone control
together so everyone could enjoy the
most immersive slide experiences ever
and capture the world from a bird's eye
view dos drone 2.0 which do focus on the
flight control and we're viewing a
gesture based to the control into our
new app the eham play all the way to
control a drone is to use a radio
control transmitter which we don't think
it's really all that fun the two control
enables you to steer by handling your
phone as if the drone was flying in your
hand and that's why we call this the
auto mode the even virtual reality
goggles gives you - at first I view
through the half tracking camera with
this goggle the video is livestream from
the drones Logano and the Hat tracker
sensor follows the movement of your head
up and down when you look up you'll see
the sky and when you look down you'll
see the ground compared to our current
meter the combination of Hobbiton mode
and hand tracking your goggles make
narrow room extremely easy everyone also
you can easily switch between the front
view and arrow view anytime you want
so we completely redesign the ghost to
oil from the Guandong not only adding a
brand new color view but also creating
better flight controls power systems and
a smaller battery the Ghost Dog 2.0 has
highly integrated processing power new
sensors backup and an upgraded global
GPS and system which combine to make the
drone more stable running flight the
ghost 2.0 also has a stronger power
system for faster flight made with a
special facing down rotor for s motor
and eight point five inch
self-tightening propellers it also has
an integrated smart battery to
automatically protect itself from being
overcharged while maximizing the flight
duration we also have created two new
color schemes that even redesigned the
landing
making it safer and easier to take off
and landed wrong we'd love to introduce
the first dose 4k camera resolution of
this new camera is four times higher
than a 1080p camera it works extremely
well with our three axes involved which
makes an arrow footage super static even
if you are flying in strongly all of
these enable anyone to capture their
live moment goes to foil in the
platforms we have four options for you
to protect choose the one you want come
and fly with us life can't help but be
structured sometimes too much so it gets
to the point where you create not
necessarily the lack of structure but
more freedom freedom to be expressive
creative to take things that people tell
you that you can't do and bump it up to
the top of the bucket list we're always
looking for ways to enable that the
pencil to your standard is a flying
camera that matches your lifestyle it's
a fully integrated user-friendly
quadcopter and is ready to fly

it is to have to always hold a
traditional camera capturing photos and
video with the Phantom 3 standard brings
a new dimension to experiences as you
