go
what is this
any ideas
I'll be right back
JIRA teaser Chinese sorry I'm deep in
three two one
fancy a flyer you're welcome
okay LUMO
this isn't Vonda a great bag
over the last few years we've done
extensive research on bags and after
asking thousands of people we found the
number one use of bags to carry so
we created on Vonda a great bag
it has two features it carries and
it looks great and vonda doesn't
have solar panels smart sensors or an
app it just carries our pocket
system follows a unique philosophy
there's no special pocket for your
battery pack or your wood necklace just
put your in whichever pocket you
want it's your bag and vonda can
hold over 10 billion different items
there are a few examples yes it can hold
the sweater mom pocket we don't judge
Vonda comes with straps because we
realize you need straps to carry a bag
to carry your since we didn't want
to decide on the way you carry your
inside Vonda you can move the straps
around and carry in a few different ways
like this like this or like this great
options to help moving the straps around
we use the unique method of hooks and to
close the bag we're using something
known as zippers our hooks are made of
zinc iron and the zippers are
top-of-the-line YKK zippers it's a
simple bag but high-quality our bags are
lined with the best quality leather we
could find AKA full grain italian
leather but if you don't like leather
there's a leather free option made from
the best not leather material our back
fabric has silver in it to keep bacteria
and bad smells out so you can even put
smelly in your bag without worrying
it will harm the rest of your
it we do have a third
and vonda comes in many colors and all
of them look great some might
say they look really great too
will allow it whatever color you choose
you can rest assured you'll be able to
carry your you can use in Banda at
school at the office or at the bus stop
really anywhere you can carry a bag too
it can be used by both guys and girls
now that's freaking versatile Banda was
made by people who wanted to make a bag
that can carry and look great while
doing it so they thought about it
designed it probably ate something in
the process and now it's here you need a
great bag this is a great
 bag it's also pretty affordable
so it's a no-brainer
great bag carries reasonably priced
and looks great what more do you
need to put in bag now the key I'm
Vonda a great bag from the
people that brought you the five tribe
range of powerful resonant speakers
which took the world by storm five tribe
now brings you the mini trouble the
world's smallest Wireless resident
speaker it turns anything into a speaker
by literally spreading the sound waves
through the material in his place come
on and it is still small enough to fit
in your jeans mini pocket
the mini troll is based on an innovative
technology developed by the US Navy for
military use in submarines the unique
thing about this is its resonance core
that transforms electromagnetic pulses
into vibrations which spread directly
across any surface you choose
transforming any surface into a powerful
speaker simply turn on your mini troll
place it on the hard surface and enjoy
your music with quality powerful sound
its vacuum base will make sure your mini
troll stays right where you put it in
the small traditional speakers the sound
is propagated from a small membrane and
this naturally limits the sound power
instead with mini troll the sound is
projected by the mass of the chosen
surface allowing much higher sound luck
furthermore in the traditional membrane
speaker the sound comes from a specific
direction in
the chosen surface projects the sounds
in every direction creating a surround
effect everyone will hear the same sound
making it perfect for entertaining
camping relaxing at home even the office
the minute rope is great for extending
the audio of a laptop or for making easy
hands-free conference calls the 360
degrees M will ensure everyone hears the
same information we've been working
tirelessly over the last 12 months to
miniaturize the technology of our
well-loved vibe tribe resonant speakers
without compromising the sound quality
or losing any of the key distinctive
brand factors we need your help
to mass-produce the mini troll and get
it to your doorstep
stop listening to your music with
low-quality plastic feet Bluetooth
speakers that last a few weeks at best
choose the quality of the solid metal
Italian design mini troll which comes
with an automatic 24 month warranty
world walk enjoy the vibe - in the tribe

support
what if our definition of success is all
wrong in our work obsessed culture we
assume that success comes from optimal
productivity yet no matter how much we
get done the world throws more and more
at us how is it the more we get done the
worse we actually feel we all know the
feeling of waking up full of energy
excited to crush it but at the end of
the day we're completely drained our
obsession with killing it is killing us
we knew there had to be a better way so
like all good entrepreneurs we became
the experiment we tried everything
planners books apps seminars coaches
masterminds meditation cold showers
there was even a sweat lodge and what we
learned is true success is not in this
productivity it's a feeling a focus flow
and freedom and it turns out we don't
all work the same way because we don't
all work the same way every human being
organizes and processes information
differently and so we need a system that
works the way we do after 73,000 beta
users more than a dozen prototypes and
countless hours and development we
finally did it
introducing an Evo the world's first
personalized flow system it had to be
beautiful so we spared no expense on
design copper gilded pages full-color
throughout
and the smarts of interior layout but
Evo is more than just a planner it's a
dashboard for your life first you start
by taking the assessment to identify
your brain type so we can send you your
customized planning then use the Evo app
to track and measure your daily progress
this helps you recognize patterns and
see what's working for you are you
happier and more effective when you get
outside does your workflow take a dip
when you skip your morning meditation
Evo will show you by focusing on the
right things Evo ensures that you evolve
and get better every single day with Evo
you get more done have more energy and
become more aligned with who you really
are
and this productivity is not the answer
its focus focus equals flow and flow is
freedom our founding members get the
lowest price ever on you join us and
