this before I didn't think so
no one has Sam crap kindiy
the thing I love most about the hammer
craft is whether you're on lands we're
in water trees no trees you can hit
anywhere in the world with the hammer
crack
gotta get gotta cook up gotta get gotta
cook gotta get inside
gotta get gotta go gotta go gotta get
gotta go gotta get I gotta get gotta go
gotta get gotta go gotta get gotta get
gotta go I gotta get
I think we can all agree that we're
living in the future right now Jennifer
here has a smartphone that enables her
to order a ride home control the
temperature turn on the lights a verdict
face it we're living in a technological
Wonderland and yet here we find Phil
who's forgotten the combination of his
travel lock is the current solution to
that problem
we live in an error filled with
technological marvels and yet this is
what happens when Phil forgets a lock
combination is that the best we can do
no because we live in an era where the
air baltics is the air bolts is a travel
lock you can throw it with your
smartphone
it's a lot the future deserves a lock
with customizable security settings this
air ball opens whenever my phone is
within Bluetooth range well maybe you
don't trust anyone in your lives that's
fine the settings on this air ball
require me to when to a password into
the app or maybe your air bolts been
stolen that's fine too because you can
set your air ball to activate an alarm
when it moves too far away from your
phone or you can activate the alarm
manually stop that man
it's the justice the future deserves hi
Bill hi tell them what happened bill I
lost my bag you lost your we live in a
world where I can use my smartphone to
model my sleeping patterns but bill here
can't find his bag if bill have been
using the air bolt instead of some
antique you could have located it using
the air box crowd-sourced GPS network or
if you lose your phone well you can
still unlock your home qui logging in
for another device well you can enter
our backup button code using your hands
like some kind of prehistoric man
the air vault has a rechargeable battery
which only needs to be charged once a
year by a standard microUSB connector
it's TSA approved so F of security is
not an issue the app will record a
history of every time you've locked and
unlocked your Apple you can even share
access to your a vault with your friends
so you'll be able to unlock it from the
other side of the world thanks pal
you're welcome buddy
and look how small it is seriously look
at it it's really small ambled it's the
travel lock we all deserve
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
