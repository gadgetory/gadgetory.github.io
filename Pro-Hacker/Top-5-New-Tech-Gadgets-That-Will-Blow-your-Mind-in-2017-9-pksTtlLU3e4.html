first digital 3d microphone that plugs
right into your iPhone as a musician
it's important I can have high quality
audio at a moment's notice
like when we need to record a demo the
second inspiration strikes and I barely
have to think about it because lolly
doesn't need a separate app battery or
memory card it's as simple as plugging
into your iPhone and recording lolly can
also be a great addition to a filmmakers
kit it'll instantly give you industry
standard 44.1 for 48 kilohertz audio
lolly is designed to be three beats so
no matter how you turn your smartphone
it adjusts the orientation so that when
you listen to it back it creates an
immersive feeling like you're really
there
and with the reversibility of the
Lightning port Raleigh can easily be
used with either camera we understand
that you guys are debuting new song
tonight and for the podcaster a radio
journalist lolis portability means you
can always be ready to record
professional interviews and when you're
going to conference
Lalli is a great way to document the
excitement getting crisp sound even when
your front row
recorded lolly because great sound
matters
you
EcoPlus River is a new generation of
smart clean mobile power it's a portable
lithium ion battery with the world's
most comprehensive array of charging
ports and one of the highest total
energy outputs of almost any storage
solution on the market it's designed for
everybody from outdoor activities and
indoor leisure to industrial
applications and emergency services
River releases you from the shackles of
an outlet so you can power a free life
the unit is equipped with 11 independent
charging ports which can all be used
simultaneously for a total output of 500
watts to put this in perspective that
means you get power to iPhones to iPads
to MacBooks
a mini-fridge a lantern a drone battery
a mobile Wi-Fi unit and stereo speakers
all at the same time without limiting
the output on any port with the storage
capacity of 416 watt hours rever gives
you more power than almost any battery
of its time you can jam on your electric
guitar for 20 hours straight or you can
watch a 10 hour marathon of your
favorite TV show by campfire
rivers battery can be recharged in three
different ways a standard outlet or a
car charger can replenish the battery to
full capacity in just eight hours with
eco flows portable solar panels River
can be recharged with absolutely zero
carbon emissions in just 12 hours the
real-time display allows you to monitor
the battery's current output power
remaining capacity and charge time being
a documentary filmmaker a lot of my
shoots happen outside a lot of times our
locations are way out in the middle of
nowhere first time I use River I was
really surprised at how much these
little units can accomplish on location
everything runs on batteries we have to
set up a DI T station a battery charging
station and we could even run our LEDs
when we need extra lights could never
have to worry about the noise and the
pollution of a generator applications
for battery power are endless River
isn't just an accessory it's your power
companion for harnessing clean energy
anywhere so you're free to go everywhere
and by the way this isn't just a concept
river has been tried and tested and as
you can see this entire production has
been lit by River
communication is beautiful it keeps us
together it brings us close it is the
key element of love
but although we can find it almost
anywhere it hardly exists on the roads
driving and communicating at the same
time is almost impossible how many times
have we wanted to say please let me
merge
or please lower your lights
or thank you for waiting
what if we could tap our finger to
deliver our message
introducing auto top
a digital sign that shows anything we
wish to say by a touch of our finger
it can easily be installed on any car
window and program to display our own
list of messages from our smartphone
boy from a special remote control we can
add or delete messages based on our need
with support for different languages and
even emojis we can use it for our safety
for our assistance or just for fun Auto
talk is based on LED lighting technology
to ensure that our message will be seen
in any time of the day and in any
weather conditions
it's a beautiful and simple way to greet
the world and to let the world greet us
back we see communication devices
everywhere these days people are more
connected than ever by inventing Auto
talk we wish to connect the roads to
this new age of communication after six
months of development we finally have a
functioning prototype our goal now is to
complete design and bring the product to
consumer level and we can't do that
without your help help us bring in
communication to the road
