first digital 3d microphone that plugs
right into your iPhone as a musician
it's important I can have high quality
audio at a moment's notice
like when we need to record a demo the
second inspiration strikes and I barely
have to think about it because lolly
doesn't need a separate app battery or
memory card it's as simple as plugging
into your iPhone and recording lolly can
also be a great addition to a filmmakers
kit it'll instantly give you industry
standard 44.1 for 48 kilohertz audio
lolly is designed to be three beats so
no matter how you turn your smartphone
it adjusts the orientation so that when
you listen to it back it creates an
immersive feeling like you're really
there
and with the reversibility of the
Lightning port Raleigh can easily be
used with either camera we understand
that you guys are debuting new song
tonight and for the podcaster a radio
journalist lolis portability means you
can always be ready to record
professional interviews and when you're
going to conference
Lalli is a great way to document the
excitement getting crisp sound even when
your front row
recorded lolly because great sound
matters
you

remaining capacity and charge time being
a documentary filmmaker a lot of my
shoots happen outside a lot of times our
locations are way out in the middle of
nowhere first time I use River I was
really surprised at how much these
little units can accomplish on location
everything runs on batteries we have to
set up a DI T station a battery charging
station and we could even run our LEDs
when we need extra lights could never
have to worry about the noise and the
pollution of a generator applications
for battery power are endless River

companion for harnessing clean energy

been lit by River
communication is beautiful it keeps us
together it brings us close it is the
key element of love

anywhere it hardly exists on the roads

merge

deliver our message

a digital sign that shows anything we
wish to say by a touch of our finger

window and program to display our own
list of messages from our smartphone
boy from a special remote control we can
add or delete messages based on our need
with support for different languages and
even emojis we can use it for our safety
for our assistance or just for fun Auto
talk is based on LED lighting technology
to ensure that our message will be seen
in any time of the day and in any
weather conditions

the world and to let the world greet us

connected than ever by inventing Auto
