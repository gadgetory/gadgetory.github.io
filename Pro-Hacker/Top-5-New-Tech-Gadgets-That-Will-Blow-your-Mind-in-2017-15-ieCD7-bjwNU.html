we are extraordinary we are innovators
we are leaders the future doesn't just
happen it is created by those with a
vision to change the world
sleep we spend winter for our life
sleeping with only dibs and many of us
wish we got more of it yeah
technology which has transformed so many
of our behaviors has done very little to
improve the way we sleep some would
argue that technology has been worsening
sleep I can't stand for AI fidelity
canopy and will change this way of
thinking back in 2008 I can become the
world's first smart bed ever conceived
we believe it represented an icon in the
industry this first success give us the
motivation to go back to work and
concentrate all our efforts for the past
years developing a new again that is
much better in every way while designing
a came bed I was thinking about what
kind of experience we could create in
order to reach people lives this
experience is the driving force behind
the design of the product and it comes
to life thanks to technology we name it
our bed I can because its design
suggests a new interpretation of the
classic canopy creating the ultimate
comfort zone around bed and expanding it
to a new concept of cocoon the new icon
is much more than a bed combined with an
entertainment system I can is the first
bed integrated platform based on
open-source software every feature can
be tailored to individual habits because
few things are more personal than the
bed environment people working on
Advanced Research in sleep technology
will find I can to be a great hardware
and software framework for the
development of new sleep related
applications the new again is also
easier into the pews and will be
provided with amazing new features like
voice control and the health monitoring
application your idea of birth relations
dreams and entertainment will never be
the same
you
hi I'm Jessica banks I'm a scientist
robot assistant founder of rock paper
robot the design and engineering firm
out of Brooklyn
we make kinetic furniture what's kinetic
furniture well it's basically decor that
moves like these levitating tables or
this bouncing one or our latest ally
Czech inspired by our experience living
and working in New York
see this is our office but this is our
office the city inspires us informs us
and acts as a constant reminder of the
diversity of people and problems that we
have to consider when we design plus the
responsibility we feel to not create
more come see what we mean
the Olli chair retracts to two inches so
it's ideal for small spaces
at flat packs for transport and we all
know how important that is
it's lightweight so it's easy to move
around
Dahle chair has a built-in lumbar
support so it's super Dunphy after a
long day on your feet
because the chair body is made out of
aluminum and the default amber is made
out of teeth it's great for outdoor
environments and because we're fans of
personal expression oli is customizable
the Tambor the flexible slanted seat
part is interchangeable so you can swap
it out to suit your style and just for
our Kickstarter backers we're offering
some limited edition finishes for your
chairs including an awesome silkscreen
by our talented friend Wiz be no extra
space no problem
store your holly chair on the wall like
a work of art and of course the chair is
perfect for home to Holly can be your
primary seating or accommodate your
space for extra guests so storing the
chair might seem like sleight of hand
manufacturing it doesn't take magic it
takes money that's where you come in by
supporting our Kickstarter campaign
you'll be the first to get your butts on
the Ahly chairs at far lower than the
expected retail price and you'll be
supporting a female run manufacturing
company that's Moo manufacturing so
thank you from all of us at rock paper
robot support Holly and let all I
support you and don't forget to share
the chair
cowboy beer niala chair get yourself the
Kickstarter and show those
what an amazing city I need to write
about this place did you ever miss a
flash of creative genius well you're
definitely not alone I need to bring
Jessica here she would love this place I
have to share that with everybody we are
building a first smart voice recording
wearable
it's handy and allows you to capture
your thoughts with a quick motion

focused on what really matters to you
organize your notes with hashtags can
integrate them with your favorite apps

identification
take notes and capture your greatest
ideas with ease when you're out for a
walk or run it works offline just fine
so don't worry about leaving your phone
at home a full battery charge lasts for
about four days of average use sandstone
has futuristic design to make it
memorable and you remarkable it's
created in the intersection of waves and
symbolizes the sound that you create
when you speak it fully charges in 30
minutes on a specially designed dark
station that can fit the device and all
of you interchangeable backs with all
the distractions and life on the go it's
so easy to forget a great idea sandstone
is a note pad built for your busy
everyday life it to the soil a here to
build the first Ronald I now we need
your support
to produce the first batch we're gonna
have a team of five engineers and
cyclists with a clear goal make cycling
safer it's amazing to see how many
people have joined us since the
beginning of our journey we are being
one year working on our first project
blinkers we cyclists are the most
vulnerable users of the road to wheels
to balance no chasis to protectors and
we still need to use our hands to
communicate with cars blinkers is the
one thing that was missing for cyclists
to be safer and to be a natural Tarleton
road
it starts with the regular bike lights
that you know the blinkers actually
backs everything you need to be seen on
the stood and respected by everyone else
in the road with blinkers cars will
always know when you are turning and
when you are breaking a laser projection
makes you even more visible and allows
cars to understand better what is your
space and what is their space blinkers
were designed to fit in your life it has
no buttons and turns on as soon as you
plug it in
blinkers also has a powerful battery and
is very easy to recharge blinkers is the
ultimate safety solution for cycling
hey Bobo it has been a long journey but
it's thanks to all the people that have
shown us that we made it so far
we'll be a successful Kickstarter last
year in which we use the funds to take
the product to the level where we are
now we team up with 2k a top choice
engineering company for the technical
development of the product in which we
take blinkers to a stage that is ready
for serial production and that's not
what we come to in the lower we need
your support to give the rest push to
blinkers and make it a reality
let's make cycling safer</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
