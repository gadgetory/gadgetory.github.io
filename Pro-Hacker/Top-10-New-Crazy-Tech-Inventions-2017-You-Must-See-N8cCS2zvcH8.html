until now creating a stunning music
synchronized light show was difficult
and expensive current high-end options
could cost you up to thousands of
dollars in lighting gear and countless
hours learning and programming complex
DMX controllers mainstream budget
options include sound activated LED
controllers with boring displays and
erratic flashing to random sounds we
didn't like any of these options so we
built our own the VV music LED
controller syncs to your music in real
time separating it into three ranges and
outputs them to addressable LEDs for a
stunning light show control your
experience through the mobile app and
choose from dozens of animations and
color options to make your own unique
performance hi i'm matt and i Rajeev

enthusiasts who have seen firsthand how
light shows can set the mood and
complement the rhythm of music in any
environment our desire to recreate these
experiences pushed us to develop
unprecedented music reactive technology
that allows everyone to bring music to
light
we have completed development and now we
need your help to get to the next stage
your pledges will help us get our first
run of production complete and help us
change LED lighting forever please share
with your friends and thank you for your
support
hi guys I'm Lorenzo
hi I'm Carlo every day smartphones are
becoming smarter but the battery life
remains critical we'd like to use our
phones without the fear of running out
of battery of course there are solutions
such as bearer cases and extra batteries
but are either not portable enough or is
to forget we designed a product so
compact that will follow you everywhere
a cable the size of an inch we call it
in charge it's a very simple product
it's so useful that we believe everybody
should own one that's why one of our
main goals was to keep it affordable
a tiny product at the tiny price we
spend an average 70% of our day next to
a USB port and every time it's a chance
to top-up for batteries there are over
five billion USB ports around the world
in charge will fit in your pocket and
you won't have to fight with tangle
cords ever again thanks to its
remarkably compact design you can snap
it onto your keyring and there isn't a
chance to forget it at all we spent the
last three months and designed the
product and testing the prototypes and
now we are finally ready to start the
production in charger will be available
with both lightning connector and micro
USB so it's compatible with most of the
devices out there we are really excited
about this and we hope you're too now we
need your help to bring in charge into
your pocket
as a supporter you will get your own in
charge at a special price so please
consider backing our project and share
it with your friends thanks for watching
we really appreciate your support thank
you
