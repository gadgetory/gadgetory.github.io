hi I'm John Madden and I'm from Newport
Beach California and I'm on a mission to
build the best electric bike for every
scenario imaginable biking is a huge
part of our culture here so we
understand how it should feel to ride
bikes have been around for a long time
now but with little change so I thought
what better time than ever to give bikes
a tech upgrade between functionality
after many iterations prototypes and
hundreds of hours of R&amp;amp;D I can humbly
say that I've come up with a perfect
bike for everyone let me introduce you
joy Jules is not your typical bikes it's
electric foldable and affordable for
everyone pay for any time any situation
and any rider and designed and
engineered in the u.s. jolt will get you
anywhere you need to be with a smile on
your face every time enough for the
details
let's take Joel for a ride Joel is our
answer to connecting people within
cities without polluting the planet or
breaking a sweat
it makes hills easier to overcome and
arriving in style without a sweat so you
can focus on what's important to you
like having fun we design Joel to be
funner faster and easier than anything
else you've ever experienced with jolt
you can ride over 50 miles on a single
charge using our patent pending and the
spinner wheel technology jolt is hand
crafted with top of the line components
comes with a six-speed onboard computer
and comes in a variety of hip cool
colors Joel will never let you down it
even allows you to charge any of your
mobile devices thanks to its built in
USB charging port jolts is perfect for
getting around town fast without
breaking a sweat but if you still want
exercise just ride jolt like you would a
normal bike without any assistance
or rat in hybrid mode and set the level
of assistance you need using a six-speed
an on-board LCD display the choice is
yours
don't feel like peddling hit the
throttle sit back relax and let jolt do
all the work
drill it is fun for all ages and riding
styles day or night whatever your
mission is jolts got you covered
one of my favorite things about Jules is
how compact you can be in just a few
quick steps short folds up in a matter
of seconds so you can transport it in
the back of a car or keep it stored
inside without taking up tons of space
I'm on a mission to revolutionize the
way we community day but that's not all
in addition to a greener form of
transportation I'm going to donate a
portion of all proceeds to the
Greenpeace nonprofit organization who
since 1971 has been fighting toward
greener healthier world for our oceans
forests food and climate this is just
the beginning
my dream is to globalize the electric
bike revolution but I need your help too
far this once we get you a fully funded
we can start production immediately and
start rethinking how much more biking
duper
this is a switch bike and so is this and
this and this one this one to switch is
an affordable state-of-the-art the
electric bike system that converts any
bike into an e bike and I mean any bike
with switch you can go faster and
further without breaking a sweat
turn the power up when you need it turn
it down when you don't or switch it back
into a regular bike simply put it's a
bike and an e-bike my name's Oliver I'm
proud to be a British engineer I studied
at Oxford University and I'm dedicated
to inventing low-carbon technologies
that are good for the planet the way we
usually get around is not
environmentally friendly or fun
astonishingly most of the journeys we
make a less than 10 miles a switch break
has a range of up to 50 miles so why not
make some of those journeys with one of
these it's fast convenient and way more
fun than getting on a bus here's how it
works we send you a brand new wheel with
our lightweight hub motor built in a
pedal sensor brake sensors and the
bracket that connects everything
together simply attach the switch bag to
go further and faster it really couldn't
be easier
please support us by placing an order
now and we'll start putting together
your custom switch package right away
thank you
we're tagging a family by company for
the last seven years we've been creating
bikes rollers that are loved and enjoyed
all around the globe this is our latest
project and we do not hesitate when we
say this is the next step in the
evolution of family bikes see three
years ago we searched for our next
project we turn to a lot of people and
ask them what they would want in a
family bike some answers were strange
you make it fly somewhere eye-opening
young babies should be facing their
parents and some were just adorable
we listened and set out to create the
ultimate family bike for two years we
made sketches prototypes studied
materials carried out experiments and
explored every aspect of family bike
should have basically we reinvented the
family bike this is a toga 2.0 the most
comfortable safe easy to ride practical
and just all-around coolest family bike
you could possibly imagine
the targa 2 has everything our customers
wanted and much more safety first
tanka has three wheels so it's
inherently stable the cargo box
materials are super strong plastics with
a metal frame inside that makes the
seating area durable and resistant to
impact the child seats themselves have
endless features and options
tugga can take one or two kids facing
forwards backwards or facing each other
or a boatload of laps to keep it
versatile in seconds taka two turns from
a family bike into a lockable cargo bike
with extra load space on top we use disc
brakes and a Shimano gear and you can
always easily turn it into an electric
bike for effortless long distance rides
now for the fun part apart from the wind
in their hair we wanted the kids to have
a truly enjoyable adventure on our bikes
so we added the accessory bar to which
you can attach a variety of fun add-ons
yes there's also a water gun and when it
rains or if the kids just want some
privacy
there's the royal canopy let's see what
else nope it can't fly yet but it can
all be taken apart to fit in your car
truck oh and the seats come in a variety
of colors because you know the personal
touch transforms our own ultimate bike
into your own ultimate fighter last but
certainly not least the price while
creating the Targa - we never forgot the
one thing everyone asked make it
affordable make it affordable so we did
because to turn the family bike trend
into a real revolution we had to make it
accessible for everyone whether you use
it for a weekend trip and drop-off
for shopping or to carry your loyal
friends Watauga 2 is an ideal solution
our company has a proven track record so
this is one of those projects you can
back safely
we need your help to make this piece of
family on a reality so backed agha and
help us make the ultimate family bond
tog ah
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
