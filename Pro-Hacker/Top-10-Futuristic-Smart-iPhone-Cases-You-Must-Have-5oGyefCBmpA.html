modules will always work with you from
the first idea it took us about two
years to arrive where we are now we were
originally inspired by brainstorming
cases that allow you to add one new
feature to your phone and we thought why
not make one case that allows for many
features that you can customize for your
lifestyle we have an experienced team
with members spread across the world all
bonded together through our passion for
next pack we've been working around the
clock to collaborate on each other's
time zones and get our device to where
it is today
we are currently working on additional
modules for the near future but even
more importantly we are building a
community for developers to thrive and
meet the needs and wants of next packet
users think about an app store for
modules that can enhance your phone
whenever we show it to someone we get
some crazy ideas for future modules what
about a tiny lipgloss or a little blush
knife isn't camera 3d camera
walkie-talkies to talk with your friends
food books a fingerprint scanner a game
controller a baby monitor a lie detector
for my boyfriend you see this really is
just the beginning a roma case a case

arrow Mackay's hi i'm michael co-founder
of perry where we've developed the
iphone accessory that we have all been
waiting for a compact case with an extra
battery that fully recharges your iphone
and detaches to become a bluetooth and
Wi-Fi enabled speaker that goes with you
everywhere you go this is my longest
Danny Franklin he's here to help me with
my big Hollywood gig I spent three
hundred dollars to use my iPhone the way
I want to because no one created a
single device that can solve the two
greatest needs of every iPhone user
longer battery life and louder speakers
no one had done it so we did we call it
the Perry duo for $99 as to how we did
it well we started with advanced circuit
design technology but I got this
day
Oh D piace
feeling really good the deals gonna go
through I think we should sell Medavoy
Johnson
you're probably wondering how we crammed
all this technology into one case so
here's how we did it the key to our slim
form factor is our proprietary circuit
design that has condensed typically
large circuits for recharging in audio
processing into a fraction of their
normal size this allowed us the space
necessary to house our 3 and 4 watt
speakers and a 2500 milliamp battery the
dual utilizes an impact resistant
polycarbonate to house the speakers and
internal electronics in short this
thing's hard to break the duo features a
patent-pending smooth glide locking
mechanism that enables you to easily
install and remove your phone in less
than two seconds the perry duo is the
first mobile case with peer-to-peer
Wi-Fi multicast functionality this means
that you can stream your music from your
phone to dozens of cases imagine a multi
floor dorm party streaming your music to
multiple rooms throughout the building
this is the parry duo for $99 thanks to
our friends and family and believers who
supported us we've made it through phase
one with product design and engineering
complete we're ready for phase two
we've got production facilities ready
for the green light all we need is you
the sooner we hit our reward goals the
sooner we'll have the world's with
portable high powered speaker and
recharging case in your hands so choose
a reward pledge and help us make the
parry duo a reality thank you

there are a lot of ways of looking at
the world there's the obvious realm of
light and shadow the basic shapes and
outlines that the naked eye perceives
but there's also an entirely different
perspective the dynamic alternate
reality lurking just below the surface
hidden patterns unseen infrastructures
an invisible universe governed not by
light and dark but by cold and hot this
is infrared thermal imaging and it gives
you the power to see the heat military
technology that was reserved for the
battlefield just a few short years ago
has found its way into the palm of your
hand
introducing FLIR one
the world's first personal thermal
imager slides right onto your iPhone
five so you can see the heat wherever
you go you can see the heat of danger
lurking in the wild or through dense
smoke or fog you can see the heat of
mechanical malfunction or from the onset
of a fever you can see the heat and
where it's escaping and from hiding
intruders the FLIR one blends an actual
picture with an infrared thermal image
so there's never any doubt what you're
looking at the dark ages are over
because once you see the heat you'll
never look at anything the same again
FLIR one see the heat
