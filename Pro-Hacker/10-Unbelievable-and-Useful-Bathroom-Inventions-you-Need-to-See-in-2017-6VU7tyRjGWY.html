fundamental elements it makes them about
70% of the Earth's surface and a similar
percentage of our body each day we have
an intimate interaction with water for
most of us this starts with our showers
showers are deeply personal our long
time to wake up to think to rejuvenate
to unwind and met yet we set out to see
if you can make this important part of
our daily rituals better and every way
we started with a nice Carlos one of our
co-founders ran a large fitness club
company and was deeply concerned about
the high use of water together with his
father Emilio they search for a solution
it turns out showers are one of the
highest wasters of water and it hasn't
been any meaningful innovation over a
century nearly five years later dozens
of prototypes built we've had 500 people
try it and now we think we've built
something pretty special imagine being
totally embraced by water from the
moment you step into your shower imagine
an experience of water so moving you
never want to step back your skin feels
soft hydrated maybe is about
experiencing water in a way that you
never have before the innovate on the
shower experience we had a look outside
of the current industry and of course
the engineering problems with a
completely new angle the last half
century of nozzle technology has
completely changed what we can do with
droplet sizes and distribution however
this technology has only been applied to
very specialized field like rocket
engine in medical device we use these
same tools and technology to develop
methods what we do is atomized streams
of water into millions of tiny drops by
doing this we can achieve 10 times the
surface area of water compared to a
regular shower while using a fraction of
the volume I just got out of my first
nebia shower it was a total unique
experience and I loved it I was getting
hit with these little water droplet I
love the feeling all the chocolates
hitting their skin
like you're being enveloped by water and
as an Airbnb host there are a lot of
showers going on in my blood and this is
important you know this thing is if not
only makes the experience better for my
guests but it saves you money health
great it was a really fun comfortable
experience the whole thing just felt off
I could take that shower every day we
put nebula to the test on average
Americans take about eight minutes to
shower for the normal shower there's
over 20 gallons of water for the Navia
it's only six that's seventy percent
less water we built a negative II easy
to install you simply unscrew your
existing shower and screw on nettie with
a wrench and plumber's tape and included
adhesive you don't have to call the
plumber or break tile in addition many
slides up and down a couple of feet
pivots at an angle and includes a
portable watt which you can position
wherever you choose neba provides a
totally new and refreshing shower
experience we partner with world-class
design firm box clever to create a
design that is both beautiful and
intuitive yet offers a totally new
degree of adjustability on top of that
the water and energy savings just makes
sense we still have to build a company
that will transform the way we interact
with water over the course of the next
few decades
we've assembled a team thermal fluids
experts to solve some of the difficult
engineering challenges that have
prevented innovation and showers for a
long time and finally we're ready to
bring that into the world introducing
new blade a revolution in toilet
cleaning technology hi I'm here to tell
you about an invention that will
revolutionize a chore that we all love
to hate cleaning the 12th recognize this
the classic toilet brush design has
remained unchanged today sad factored
completely under reflects the bristle
clogged up very easily meaning they're
extremely unhygienic and are the key
they retain water meaning they drip
everywhere and they're also extremely
inefficient at the Scott back and forth
and they never clean under the room two
years ago I decided to do something
about it
in 2013 Gary brought together a team of
product designers engineers and material
specialists and went into the lab to
work on a new product that would help
change the way that toilets are cleaned
forever with its patented swipe clean
technology the silicon blades follow the
contours of the toilet bowl and reach
under the rim with ease swiping the
surface clean a silver based additive
kills germs both during and after
cleaning and helps cut down bleach use
the blades do not get clogged up like
bristles and have a hydrophobic coating
that shit's water and dries quickly a
hollow-point head feature also helps
clear blockages air flows freely through
the holder to quickly evaporate any
remaining moisture let's look at how Lu
Glade helps overcome the main failings
of the toilet brush the bristles of a
toilet brush quickly become cloth which
is hard to dislodge especially after it
has dried weather Lou blade the smooth
flat surfaces are easily kept clean and
clear with just a gentle shake after
shaking look how much potentially germ
filled and smelly water is still
contained in the brush Lou blades
hydrophobic coating ensures that all
water is almost immediately removed
the bristles of a brush only touch part
of the surface which is why you need to
scrub back and forth to get things clean
with continuous contact blue blades
swipes the surface clean in a single
pass introducing new blade a revolution
in toilet cleaning technology take
cleaning to the edge
Oh
you
you
Oh
we'd like to start off by thanking you
for helping make our first Kickstarter a
smashing success the tough room proved
to be the best drain protector and hair
capture option for your bathroom tub
drains now because you demanded it we're
bringing that same winning design to
your bathroom sink drain so you can say
goodbye to clogged drains and costly
plumbing bills forever we're on a
mission to completely eliminate the need
to use harmful liquid cleaners by giving
you a greener and easier way to protect
your dreams see for yourself just how
well sinks room works and be among the
first to receive one by pre-ordering
today
you
you
Oh
go
Oh
shaving us we know it is far from
perfect
it causes razor burn ingrown hair cut
bleeding and even infection and if you
have sensitive skin for a skin condition
it's even more difficult the u.s. alone
throws out two billion rays of the hit
most can't be recycled because they
place a health risk so they end up in
garbage done there must be a better way
can we create the razor that that's not
cause irritation a razor that shapes new
recruit a razor that helps reduce waste
this is why we created discard razor was
working on lasers for cosmetic and
medical purposes I wondered could I put
this technology to barriers I wanted
something that would benefit every
single one of us shaving what's the
obvious officer the industry has been
looking for laser shaders behind you the
discovering a viable technology has
eluded everyone until now wavelengths of
light have been discovered in touch with
dark hair but not light for gray hair we
wanted a laser that could cut all hair
many prototypes were built and of the
years of experimentation we as well
exactly what we were looking for we
identified molecules on the hairs that
are serve a particular wavelength you
should call it promo for this
chromophores are the only continuous
structure in the head they're shared for
every sermon regardless of age gender or
for rate this operator is for everyone
to use and it works great on any area
this is how it works
a traditional razor cuts the hair shaft
at an angle this is all corded your skin
to feel rough when the scalp razor makes
contact the laser melts through the hair
shot completely level to the surface of
the skin this leaves a smoother softer
finish the last longest for such we
really need your support for the start
browser into production we have
preliminary agreements with
manufacturers we require capital to
forget Mordor
we spent many years developing this
rapist it is we believe after 5000 years
of using the clean technology it's time
to make shaving easier safer and greener
help us bring shaving into the 21st
century
we wake up each morning to a brand new
day a day of balance and wellness we
nourish our body with healthy foods we
physically stretch our bodies in hopes
of stretching our minds everything we do
goes back to our well being but there is
one piece we often tend to neglect from
the wellness puzzle introducing turbo a
simple and effective addition to your
daily routine before the 19th century
toilets were non-existent people used to
squat to release two thirds of the world
actually still do and for good reason as
we adopted the toilet into our lives we
unknowingly added tension and straining
during bowel movements
studies have shown us the perpendicular
posture brought on by the toilet creates
a kink in the colon which makes it
difficult to go it also makes us
susceptible to a number of other health
issues by elevating your feet that kink
disappears your muscles are able to
relax and your colon is open for quick
and efficient release and that's why we
invented turbo turbo is an elegant yet
affordable solution that makes a great
addition to any bathroom it's sleek
design allows for flexibility and
comfort the unique ramp design makes
using turbo easier for any person of any
size the lower toe area allows you to
easily load your feet then you can
position your feet forward or backward
on the ramp to adjust to a squat that's
just right for you and with turbo
squatting is only the beginning turbo
comes with interchangeable massage
rollers to further increase your comfort
on the toilet not only does it feel good
but it can help with constipation too
your feet have pressure points that can
stimulate your colon when it's time to
massaging with turbo also helps with
blood circulation which can improve your
energy levels to get you through the day
we have come a long way and we are
almost there the only thing missing is
your support

Network that's not exactly the best
alternative how about these but wait
that wouldn't work in my home unless
stop using bacteria-infested raves and
help save the environment introducing
