it's not just tap the device once while
it out so silent it take the speed trap
is no longer there double tap to remove
the alert and update the community
thinking about setting fake alerts don't
bother we have algorithms prevent false
positives but fancy socks for it won't
work I know what you think Scotty I

twisting there easy is and not
distraction at all

dangerous they force you to take your
eyes off the road now this this is easy
and safe all right let's say your car
isn't available and if you use your
friends right you can't take that fancy
nav system with trap tap it's simple to
change cars just pick it up and move it
