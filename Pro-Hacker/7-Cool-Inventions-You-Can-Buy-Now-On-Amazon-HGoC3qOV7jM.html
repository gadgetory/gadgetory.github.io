the Wi-Fi router is one of the most
important utilities in our lives that we
usually take for granted but many
routers are really difficult to set up
configure and maintain
security for our Wi-Fi shouldn't be
taken lightly but we usually don't want
a password that's too complicated and
hard to remember we've sacrificed
security so the combination is but even
with the strong password it's scary how
easy it can be for someone to hack into
our personal photos and information
typical home routers are optimized for
just a few devices and nowadays each of
us owns multiple devices cheap
components equal a weak signal which
means we're sometimes left to do some
signal strength yoga we're gonna say it
a good Wi-Fi router is something that's
worth investing I'm going to show you
the greatest thing your eyes have ever
beheld
and that's why I've built a router
that's easy to set up and use has
innovative new way to authenticate your
devices and has strong powerful
enterprise-grade
hardware and software key Wi-Fi is
designed to be simple sophisticated and
secure to set up key Wi-Fi just plug it
in
and you're done we've simplified it all
to connect we've patented a unique
authentication procedure that is simple
and secure just go to the Wi-Fi
selection page tap qi5 and you're
authenticated now you're able to connect
devices that aren't authenticated simply
can't join the key provides an trust
level hardware and the software for
kokum chips that is with
elaborately intelligent have been
forming those where devices and targets
a stronger clearer faster signal to your
device here's a spectacle might warrant
a moment consideration everyone notices
when the internet slows down there are
thousands of possible problems that
might have nothing to do with your
internet connection but something to do
with the connection between your modem
and your router or your router and your
devices we've designed something that's
so much more than a simple reset button
the Zen button it runs a self-diagnosis
the most common connectivity issues and
attempts to resolve them automatically
our team were firmly it--is Cisco aruba
and juniper and have worked on some the
most powerful and the price and consumer
address available we fri allocate a tool
on to bring this technology to people
it's about time we provide better tools
to managing our Wi-Fi working on an app
with bands features with device
management you can lock and unlock key
Wi-Fi as well as approve forgetting and
even ban users you can also put a time
limit on how long device can be on the
Wi-Fi and you can also use key Wi-Fi as
a range extender for your existing
routers even configure multiple Wi-Fi
networks using either traditional
passwords or our proximity
authentication procedure your choice so
that's key Wi-Fi easy to set up and use
a new secure way to authenticate devices
and protect your information and
equipped with powerful enterprise-grade
hardware and software to provide a
strong stable signal for all your
devices
