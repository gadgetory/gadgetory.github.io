filling their notebooks and then just
buying more see the notebook industry
has given up on innovation hey what's
this the notebook Hemingway wrote on
that's cool I guess
we're from rocket book and we make
notebooks from the future at rocket book
we are already famous for inventing the
wave notebook the smart notebook that
can be erased in the microwave we've
shipped 100,000 waves to satisfied
customers around the world others may
stop there but we're maniacs
obsessed with blending old fashioned
notebooks with future and awesome so
we've spent a year in the rocket lab
designing a new notebook that feels like
pen and paper but is endlessly reusable
and completely integrated with your
digital lifestyle
introducing the Everlast notebook from
rocket book the Everlast brings cloud
scalability to pen and paper simply
write scan and erase imagine 1000 of
your favorite notebooks in one sleek
design that fits in your backpack here's
how it works
Everlast pages look and feel like paper
but they're actually constructed from a
polyester composite rather than would
you write on the Everlast
using any pen from the pilot FriXion
line which are available in-store and
online writing on the Everlast feels
perfectly natural and smooth and as the
ink dries it forms a complete bond to
the polyester page so it won't rub off
but what makes this formulation so
unique is that each page can be wiped
completely clean with a moist towel so
it can be used over and over and over
again the ever last notebook is also
compatible with the rocket book app so
before you wipe your notes off the page
you can blast them online to your
favorite cloud services
a fraction of a second rocket book
machine vision scans enhances and sends
each page to the specific destination
they belong on the cloud services you
already use each Everlast notebook page
has seven symbols set up the rocket book
app to assign each symbol to a location
within Dropbox Google Docs Evernote or
many other services you could configure
your diamond to send meeting notes
directly to your shared team folder in
Dropbox or students could configure
their star symbol to send notes right to
a math folder in Google Drive so you can
make your list break out that diagram or
color in that drawing then tomorrow
start your day with a brand new notebook
with the ever last one notebook becomes
one thousand notebooks the utility of
the cloud and the joy of pen and paper
that's rocket book

treble and cut 9000 holes in the speaker
grill to make capsule the world's first
pico projector with omnidirectional
sound but we didn't just want it to be
small and loud we wanted to make it

this is forum card handy pocket-sized
card of meltable bioplastic that you can
use to make fix and modify the world
around you you can mold it quickly and
simply to make little solutions to
everyday problems
when it school is really strong like
nylon so you can make solid durable
solutions with it
and then you can reheat it again and
again to adapt change
and reuse it
because it's handy card size you can
keep one in your pockets wallet kitchen
drawer or toolbox so that it's there
whenever and wherever it's needed and
because you know it melts in a cup of
hot water that might be in a cafe to fix
a broken umbrella
all around a campfire to fix broken
temple it's strong enough for quick
solutions to emergency situations like
when you've forgotten a tool for a job
or handle grates on something
plastic has got a bit of a bad name it's
associated with a cheap disposable world
in which things break easily and then
end up in the beam form card is the
opposite of that world when it's very
hot it sticks to other plastics so you
can actually use it to instantly fix
things say a plastic shovel when you're
on holiday there are loads of amazing
applications and we'll be posting more
examples online as the project develops
hi I'm Pete America the designer and
developer for garde
low-temperature thermoplastics have been
around for a very long time and I've
been working with them for the last
couple of years I've been running public
workshops to explore their potential for
use in our everyday lives and I've
developed form card based on these
experiences normally these
thermoplastics are supplied in
granulated form which makes them all in
to use the granules have to be squashed
together which is messy wasteful and
sometimes even painful
this is restricted they're used to
people who are familiar with making
things but I believe if this material
has place in everyone's kitchen drawer
toolbox and backpack like blues heck of
sellotape so I developed it into a flat
card form that would always be around
and always be ready to use the size and
thickness of the card is exactly the
right amount material for the quick
types of fixes that are needed it fits
in your wallet and it fits in a cup so
you can take it and use it anywhere you
can find what your time is quick clean
simple instant and fun we've made form
card affordable and everyday product and
are now producing them loads of amazing
colours for every possible application
I want forum card to reach everyone who
thinks about fixing things instantly
when they break just take one out of
your pocket drop it into hot water and
fix things it's simple thanks for
watching and please support our project
forum card melt mold making mend this is
filter it may not look like much but
this small device solves some very large
problems we live in a time where
everything you do online is monitored
tracked or censored just because you
don't have anything to hide doesn't mean
you don't deserve privacy finding a way
to stay private and secure is not such
an easy task services are fragmented and
none provide coverage on multiple
devices making it a hassle to stay
protected we created filter in order to
make privacy and security more
accessible and easier to use filter
provides VPN support ad blocking
capability and Tor anonymity and all the
devices in your home this is especially
important for devices that don't
normally support these applications like
gaming consoles Smart TVs and media
players those who not only protects you
from unwanted ad targeting but to
prevents companies government's and
internet providers from seeing more
personal information like your web
activity searches and even physical
location in VPN mode filter uses
enterprise-grade encryption to protect
all the devices in your home
simultaneously this level of security
keeps all incoming and outgoing web
traffic private VPN mode also allows
access to geo restricted content or
censorship simply by switching regions
within the app filters app is incredibly
easy to use
select the VPN setting the region you'd
like to connect to or automatic for the
Speedy's connection you can switch
between VPN mode and tour or configure
more advanced settings folds are also
just a job of blocking advertisements
dangers websites trackers and malware
infected advertising is a huge threat in
annoyance with filter you'll never have
to see my let's just add again to stay
ahead of threats all security features
and lists are kept up to date
automatically you can choose what you
want to have updated or turn this off at
any time filter has a lot of
capabilities but setup couldn't be
easier on all of your network traffic
through filters simply by connecting it
between any mode
and rotor filter will start working
automatically and can be configured
within the app filter can be used as a
regular router which you can connect
your devices to via Wi-Fi or Ethernet
filter is ultra portable and can even be
powered off an external battery even if
you're in a public area you don't have
to worry about saying secure and finding
power we have a great idea and an
industrious team working to make filter
the best it can be but we need your help
we need to meet manufacturing
requirements and volume in order to make
filter affordable for everyone we hope

word about our campaign every little bit
