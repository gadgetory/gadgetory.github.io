let me show having approached the love -
lights and they want to introduce this
tungsten Kingston there's a first two
really powerful flashlight with better
backup and functional at this point it's
taller really amazing you can use the
anyway running walk rather bite you on
trips and make porta of inner space
this is respond and then night
also you can change the smartphone
anything else that have a big commotion
they have taken all the mr. steps
when sketches disfigure others
completely prototypes to test in
functional prototypes they have an
arrest a lot of our money
flipper smart non-stop art and education
and now we need to help take those final
steps myself innovation bring in rod
which is the portal podium we get just
more implanted device and it will give
life then you back thank you
experiencing the outdoors through
backpacking and camping is fun and
rewarding but it can be equipment
intensive especially on longer
excursions among backpacking essentials
of water and food and equipment for
fruit preparation which can add bulk and
weight to an already loaded tack the
worst offenders are propane and liquid
fuel so we've designed a camping stove
that uses a fuel source readily
available in forests wood burning
camping stoves exist but they can be
bulky because of the nature of a
combustion chamber our products started
with a simple idea inspired by a camping
car by making a collapsible combustion
chamber we could create a compact and
effective system that uses readily
available wood from the forest we
explored prototype and refine developing
a new product to enable the enjoyment of
the great outdoors the end camp stove is
an effective tool for cooking and it is
compact for storage just unpack and
unfold the stove expand the combustion
chamber fill the chamber with
combustible material and life within
minutes you will have a fire hot enough
to cook or boil water the end camp stove
burns wood from the forest eliminating
bulk from your pack but it can also use
liquid or solid fuel it is compact it
has a useful work surface it is made of
aluminum and stainless steel and is
durable stable and lightweight
we've worked very hard to make the end
campstove a great product now we are
counting on you to help us and take it
the next step please back us on
Kickstarter so that we can make it
available to anyone
hi Kickstarter I'm Jake and I'm the
founder of singe two years ago Yelp has
been the ultimate popping 10 to over 30
countries worldwide and the response was
phenomenal you've proven that Kicks down
as a world's best focus group of your
feedback we've made even more
improvements I came to you with a vision
for exceptional camping without
compromising you brought my dream to
life all the benefits were regular
temples
tons more with none of the hassle I'm
designed every singe 10 so you can
attach a solar power pack this captures
solar energy on the roof of the tent
channels it inside through a web
approved thought into a pocket-sized
power bank which we've upgraded this
year's about three times at the capacity
of the previous model the solar pack is
so versatile you pal all of the USB
powered gadgets and there were two USB
ports so you can power two devices at
the same time we could take the power
bank with you on the move just unplug it
and slip it into your pocket the two
entrances each with their own port
finding loads of functionality you can
tailor to your own needs
you need to cinch each entrance that
it's all kind of be with detachable
poles and new to 2016 it's a super
extended canopy which lets you extend
your living space by naked for four
square meters
all the kid that's nearly away into the
back this year each such as to kill
safety music attach the inside of the
tent cinch comes in three sizes two
three four person each one is the
largest in its class a format with over
six and square meters of living space is
the biggest problem ten in the world
every ten is double skinned to stop
common assertion we use advanced
waterproof fabric which is three times
the industry standard give me a peck to
protection really wet conditions you
don't want to get to a campsite master
spend ages assembling your ten want to
be able to enjoy yourself straight away
and meant the most to being outdoors
I came up research after years ago into
music festivals on camping trips and
never find an attempt to suit my needs I
went through dozens attempts the big
manufacturers always let me down
they had ventured as an airman our Sun
Goes Down nighttime is just as important
as day since his fully equipped for the
dark every singe is packed with LED
Tampax to cool torches of the turn into
lanterns
well now made the live effect the
guylines glow-in-the-dark
we designed a blackout canopy there also
regulates the heat it's super easy to
fall in a matter of seconds in the
morning can sleep in their temple as
long as you want still stare cool and
comfortable temperatures instantly it
takes less than a minute to pack down to
pop-ups a grave be still on space
comfort and good quality materials the
sort of stuff you get when you spend the
time in putting up a regular tent
I could have found my ideal tent
anywhere so I decided to make it myself
the criteria was non-negotiable light
and easy to carry with everything packed
together Lords of cool features some
really serious kit underneath easy and
fun but made from the highest quality
materials and built to last in 2014
thanks to you the kickstart community we
were able to produce cinch on a bigger
scale than ever before there's a massive
success in his haul in the beginning
that jumped on me loads about
large-scale manufacturing process and
made it clear that we can go even
further the next generation cities were
ready to go testing is complete and our
manufacturers fully briefed we just need
your help to finish buying materials and
get production underway in return you'll
get the new and improved cinch before
anyone else in le 2017 some really cool
extras just take a look at it was to see
what's enough there you have confirmed
my belief that scent is that ultimate
problem 10 as make the hassle camping
and thing of the past
and give people an experience to fit the
great outdoors
hot summer days and nights just got
cooler from backyard to beach Lake to
tailgate camping no crazy festivals
