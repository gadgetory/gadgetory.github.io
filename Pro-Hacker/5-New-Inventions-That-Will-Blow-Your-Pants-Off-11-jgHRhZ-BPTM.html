serve my customers the tastiest drinks
the biggest problem I have is that
regular ice melts too quickly no one
likes a watery drink
I decided to invent a better way to make
ice slow melting crystal-clear ice
there are plenty of blogs on how to make
clear ice
but none of the knees are entirely
effective
after months of research and testing I'm
settled on the perfect
is to mimic the way ice freezes in lakes
and rivers full of ice Craig puts the
beauty of nature into the drink
polar ice cream the perfect ice for the
perfect drink
hey we're 30 minutes late sorry it's not
like I'm a master at ironing what's a
big deal get a flipper what a flipper
time is the most valuable thing we have
going to the cleaners or ironing your
shirts on your own takes a really long
time I found iron is difficult after
looking at product in the store I had
the idea of creating revolutionary 360
degree flipping available we've
shortened the ironing time from eight
minutes to two minutes by eliminating
the unnecessary steps of traditional
ironing we've completely redesigned the
board to the modern consumer featuring
pan clips sleeve detail board and many
other remarkable features and benefits
for the very first time since the 1800s
the ironing board has been completely
redesigned with a human being in mind he
is both side iron both contoured like
human body we need to secure enough
demand to ensure that we can bring this
innovative product to market in time for
the holiday season with your backing and
your support we'll be able to make this
dream a reality and bring the flipper to
the masses worldwide
you
mr. Schmidt's please
even I hate that sound then just like me
would like to consult people have them
write up the t's what we do mostly is
repairing T's when it's too late the
Germany over 12 million teeth had to be
expected last year we want to change
that I tell all my patients that for
healthy teeth it's mandatory to use
floss or interdental brushes using the
toothbrush only is not enough the
problem is people just hate to do inter
them to clean all devices like floss
oral irrigator and interdental brushes
are too inconvenient to use them every
day this is why we invented to wing wash
with the intelligent feeler you can
easily find the interdental spaces and
slide from one gap to another by pushing
the wing brush together the brush runs
through the feeler in between your teeth
we are mark Luis and Buddha we founded
our company last year mark and I have a
business background and Luis as a
dentist he convinced us of this
incredible idea combines the easy
handling of an oral irrigator with the
effectivity of an international brush
today the wing brush is the revolution
of interdental cleaning we did a
scientific study on 1,000 incidental
spaces and decided to bring the wing
brush on the market ourselves the
results were clear with the wing brush
test process could reach significantly
more interdental spaces than with a
conventional interdental brush and top
the test persons preferred the wing
brush over common interdental brushes
scientific research has shown the
material responsible for the most oral
diseases if we find a way to eliminate
these bacteria we are able to prevent
carriers and pout entitles various
cleaning aids exist to fight this
bacteria but how come that over 50% of
all people have parent Titus and 92% of
all grown-ups had experience with
carriers using floss is cumbersome it is
really hard to reach all interdental
spaces even more important is that floss
does not have effective cleaning power
interdental brushes have the highest
effectivity
unfortunately their usability is more
difficult the wire inside the brush can
hurt your gum and advance in all
directions the wing brush is the
solution
if a fan and fan hamburger is that the
idiot so simple Gustavo in Tata he is
problem he asked prototype conversions a
group above I have not studied see ones
film I am over Kazakh meant and they are
wonderful in leaving Washington
following guns and fish within survived
confirmed apology own stop we are ready
to start we need your help to boost
winger support us to really find oil
care and make it more simple the wing
brush is just the beginning

bits needed it's time to get smart and
save space zero gravity racks take back
your space
my name is Mark I'm the founder and CEO
of zero gravity rack so this is my son
Nick he's in charge of product
development and social media we need
pretty active lives
he likes to surf he likes to stand up he
loves a snowboard and he needs two skis
to stand up your legs is fixie he loves
his mountain bike but all of our gear
was taking up too much room in our
garage so much so that I couldn't park
my car in there many of the storage
solutions that we looked at we're going
to work many worse unsafe or clunky so
we came up with this idea to raise all
of our quipment up off the ground in
that apartment way and that became the
zero gravity read if you back is now the
university get in zero gravity racket it
discount so don't miss out thanks for
the support nice the convenient squeeze
tubes we use for many products at home
and at work have been around forever but
as convenient as they are it's
impossible to completely empty them
until now we all have accepted the
struggle to get everything out of these
tubes
amazingly they can take up to 20% of
their precious contents to the landfill
look around your house how many tubes
can you find you'll be surprised
let's end this nonsense once and for all
and start saving you money squeeze tubes
get ready to feel the big squeeze hello
I'm Steve and I'm Clark
we're mechanical engineers from Denver
Colorado we're pros at designing new
products the idea of wasting anything
really bugs me the squeeze tubes no
matter how hard I try I know I'm not
getting everything I paid for there are
a lot of products out there that come in
tubes and many of our really expensive
so a few years ago we set out to design
a product that could completely empty
any tube including medications cosmetics
and moisturizers sunscreens art supplies
food items and of course toothpaste and
today we are excited to announce the
world and we have finally created these
simplest and best way to empty tubes the
big squeeze is a patented hand tool
specifically designed to eliminate waste
and save you money on all your tubes
here's how it works take any partially
empty tube open the jaws if you enter
the tube in between the gears squeeze
the handles and turn the crank the gears
do all the work it's that easy
all the contents are pushed forward
ensuring to get every last bit it took
many rounds of prototypes to arrive at
the ultimate solution but we knew it had
to feel comfortable in your hand be
extremely easy to operate so we spent
months fine-tuning the ergonomics for a
great grip and a quality feel it's also
engineered to last a lifetime with
diecast sink handles and extruded
aluminum gears to handle the toughest of
tubes we are proud to say that the big
squeeze will be backed with a lifetime
warranty and made entirely in the USA
it's a tool just like a can opener it
doesn't stay with the tube you just use
it as needed one big squeeze around your
household or business give all your
tubes an extended lease on life it's
like squeezing money right back in your
wallet get every single ounce out of all
your tubes help kick-start the big
squeeze today
with your backing the big squeeze can
become a big success thank you for your
support
you
in today's constant drive for super
efficiency we seem to have lost our
ability to play and it's a feeling that
we personally miss we believe happiness
has something to do with playing and
having fun and that includes going out
and being active so we've created a new
vehicle to awaken your natural instinct
to move a vehicle that drains your
balance and reflexes in a completely new
way one that distracts you for a moment
from your day-to-day worries and allows
you to focus solely on your body and the
ride itself and the result is an
experience far better than we ever
expected meet the half buddy</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
