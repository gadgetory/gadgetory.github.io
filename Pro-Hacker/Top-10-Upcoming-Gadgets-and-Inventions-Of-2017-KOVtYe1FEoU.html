programmer any engineer any designer
will tell you that if you want to do
your job productively if you want to do
it well you need at least two monitors
you need one to write the code and you
need another to check the graphical user
interface changes that are made back in
the old days we had desktops to do this
which were great but you needed to add
an extra graphic card to add another
monitor to it but for us
luckily laptops came along soon after
and made everything a lot more
convenient laptops are great they allow
you the flexibility to work from home
hotels restaurants and friends houses so
all of a sudden with laptops everything
got a lot easier and more convenient for
everybody but for people like us who
still need more than one monitor it
wasn't that simple you can't take a
monitor into a coffee shop a it'd be
weird be it totally defeats the purpose
of the ease and convenience of a laptop
so what we do we came up with expand
expand expand your laptop's display real
estate
expander is a secondary monitor for
laptops that slips on and doubles as
protection it runs efficiently through
only your USB port that's right no extra
power cables to deal with it keeps you
portable while greatly increasing your
productivity expand only needs one USB
port for both video and power it offsets
the very low consumption of the LED
panel with photovoltaic solar panels on
its backside these panels provide a
trickle that will continue charging your
laptop even when it's not in use on the
macbook model expander we'll add two
extra USB ports allowing for charging
and other peripherals while you're using
expander essentially we've given you the
best of both worlds you get all the
portability and convenience of a laptop
plus double the working space so you can
truly work how you want where you want
and when you want now we've been pretty
extensive in our prototype phase we've
designed our board and have a working
prototype the last 18 months have been
spent talking with vendors both home and
abroad to figure out how to bring you a
really special product and we have
everything in line except for one thing
figuring out our mass production
pipeline and that's where you come in we
need funding to pay for expensive
manufacturing tools we need capital to
buy components at a volume discount and
by contributing to our campaign today
you guarantee yourself a lower price and
bypassing any wait lists when the
expander hits the market thank you so
much for partnering with us as we bring
you guys a really special product that
we believe in

when you're fishing and you know you you
get a bite and you hook on a fish and
you're reeling that sucker and I mean
you have all that action throughout that
process but then when you catch the fish
you know you take a picture with it you
smile for the camera and you share that
to all your friends saying look at this
cat so we want to make it so that you
can share the actual action go fish cam
incorporated it was developed by me and
my brother and then we developed it to
be a technology for what we found to be
an underserved market there are camera
technologies or fish finders in the
market but what we found was they're not
capturing where the action was and by
seeing which baits are attracting fish
and how a fish might strike just having
the data and learning about those
aspects of fishing will allow you to
make better decisions in what to use and
why and when that's something that it's
very hard to do without an application
like this one of the key features is
that it sits on the line and it works
with your fishing line so it's not gonna
be fish or your fishing style and top of
that we have infrared and green lighting
around the camera room so that you can
fish during night timer and darker
lighting and then we also have the depth
of it so that can go up to 150 meters
underwater as well as the ability to
last for four hours so we really put in
a lot of work into making sure
when they go fish that their good news
go fish camp when we started the project
with go fish we broke down the process
into multiple steps we started initially
with a conceptual design looking at the
product from a both a visual as well as
a future benefit standpoint it was
important to us that we had a premium
product that had future benefits that
just weren't available on the market
currently in terms of looking forward to
production the three-dimensional CAD and
mechanical drawings are all completed
the coding for the app is completed at
this point we're really just using
Kickstarter to get ourselves into
production and get this product out into
the marketplace this is a new product
that a lot of people are excited about
and by their support and their backing
of us it's going to allow us to get to
the next step so that we can share our
vision with the world as well it's an
awesome technology that allow you to
capture kind of action-packed footage
and share it with your friends and
family and definitely bring a lot of the
excitement of the industry
paddlin we're back since our first
campaign we've shipped thousands of
units to people in places around the
world we've heard your feedback we've

what kind of snorer are you
introducing the silent partner the
world's first smart mask to quiet
snoring noise silent partner is a smart
lightweight and compact device that
elegantly tackles what other products
don't the silent partner creates a
silent zone around the person wearing it
giving you and those around you a better
night's sleep how does it work silent
partner uses patented active noise
cancellation that detects the unwanted
snoring sound and generates the counter
sound which suppresses it the result
well it's as simple as a plus and minus
they cancel each other out
many of us have probably been there
being around or creating a symphony of
snoring noises that create frustrating
nights for us in our apartments most
snoring products today don't fully solve
the snoring problem
they are often intrusive and disrupt the
quality of sleep so instead of tackling
the snoring we decided to simply find a
solution for the noise using vast
experience with a and C technology and
sleeping experts the silent partner was
designed and developed to be effective
from as close as twenty centimeters away
simply wear the smart mask the way you
would wear a traditional sleep mask and
enjoy a quiet night's sleep
be one of the first to experience silent
partner and finally give you and those
around you a real silent night
let's be honest upgrading your home is
hard home automation should be easy but
today's products are difficult to
install and use that's why we created
switch mate switch may turns your
current light switch into a smart switch

control it from your phone or a tap
simple right switch mate attaches with
magnets which means no rewiring or
modifying your switches perfect if
you're renting or on the move with
switch mate you can set timers for your
lights to come on when you're away from
home it's simple to control any device
powered by a light switch for the
additional ability to control your
lights from anywhere an optional hub can
be added and finally the comfort of
knowing that you never have to come home
to a dark house again so let's make our
home smarter one switch at a time
starting with yours

make switch made a reality but smart
lighting is just the beginning we want
to create a suite of products that are
extremely simple to use and our users
can take right out of the box and
install in seconds by backing us if
you're joining our mission of making
home automation simple
