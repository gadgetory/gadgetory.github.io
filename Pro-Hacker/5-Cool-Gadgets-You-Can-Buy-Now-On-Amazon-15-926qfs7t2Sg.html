going to show you our new type C power
meter what this will do is measure power
input or power output to your type CD
device I'll show you how it works here
so I've got my power bank and my type C
cable
so I'm going to do is connect the type-c
cable to the power meter and then plug
it into my macbook pro you'll see the
tsuitachi logo come up here and on this
readout it will measure the voltage and
volts the current and amps as well as
the current over time and milliampere
that's flowing into the macbook pro now
let's change modes and we'll show you
how to measure output power so I'll grab
my satochi hub over here
plug this into the power meter then plug
my power meter into the macbook and then
I grab my iPhone and plug this in to the
hub you'll be able to see on the screen
of the power meter that arrow has
changed direction so it's measuring
output power now
so again it'll give you the same the
voltage the current as well as the
milliamp hours so this device is really
useful for testing your accessories and
peripherals to make sure that they're
operating at their advertised
specifications this will let you weed
out if you have any counterfeit products
or any products that aren't functioning
as they should as well as showing you if
you're charging your type C device such
as the MacBook Pro it will show you how
many milliamp hours have charged over
time as well as showing the drain how
many milliamp hours have left the
MacBook Pro to charge the iPhone so yes
that's our new type C power meter hope
you guys liked it let me know in the
comments if you have any questions and

thanks have a good day welcome to the
world's most evolved robot vacuum
it's not a sweeper like other robots
it's a true vacuum the most powerful
automated vacuum you can buy the most
clever computers with its advanced laser
vision
neato scans and maps the room and adjust
as it goes while others just bump around
neato is off on a mission to clean and a
methodical pattern moving from room to
room and a fraction of the time it
systematically goes around things in its
path over multiple surfaces and away
from anywhere you mark as novak
territory it detects and avoid stairs
and nito's low-profile eases underneath
where the dust bunnies go and you
they're not Nieto sees in the dark and
seeks out unsuspecting dirt then with
its extra-large filter it stealthily
sucks up more dirt dust debris and pet
hair than any other robot vacuum nito's
wide brush and side brushes get up close
and personal with walls and baseboards
and gets in corners where round backs
can't if it runs out of juice Neto is so
much smarter it goes back to its charge
base and starts right back where it left
off Neto works how you schedule it for
cleaning everyday a quick spot clean or
an instant multi room cleaning then it
goes right back to its charge base for
next time leaving no spot unpacked and
other robot vacuums in the done neato
