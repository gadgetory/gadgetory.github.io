I've always been one for new gadgets the
latest smartphone the latest speakers
the first ever mp3 player but these days
my priorities are a bit different I
don't just want gadget to play with
anymore
I want them to help me look good too so
when I discovered the Philips beard
trimmer 9000 I knew I'd struck gold it's
the only trimmer with pop-up laser
guidance so creating sharp edges and
perfect symmetry is easy plus that's a
frickin laser styling goes a little
something like this
the laser guidance makes sure I stay
within the lines so I don't get too
carried away creating my style
you see I don't think I'm alone in
finding it's a bit of an art form other
trimmers couldn't get to every part of
my face and add in detail was a job for
the barber now all I need to do is twist
the dual head from trim to detail and
Lingam Allah ransom even the length of
my hair was hard to get right before but
with a precision zoom wheel in a beard
trimmer 9000 I can choose anywhere
between point four and seven millimeters
then cut the perfect style every time
what's more taking care of this is just
the start there are no fiddly
attachments it's simple to clean and
100% waterproof so to clean the trimmer
you simply rinse it under the tap plus
the ladies love the laser well they
certainly like the style it achieves
