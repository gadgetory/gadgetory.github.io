three years ago we set out to design the
Seaboard the world's first week's
fencing collection skaters since then
we've worked to improve the board in
every imaginable way today we're decided
to announce the boards to best weight
sensing electric skateboard we've ever
made
Oh
the Z board is a portable easy to use
weight sensing electric people ride you
simply lean forward to go and lean back
to stop speed a totally variable if you
lean forward a little bit to go walking
speed then you can lean forward a little
bit more to be cell rate up the tops of
the Z board is great for all the
in-between commutes that all of us face
each and every day since you can just
grab it and go it's really perfect for
any trip that's too far to walk lets you
short to drive
you chip the D board the customers in
every US state and over 50 country heard
what you've had to say we're excited
about all the improvements that we've
made to deport - we've improved upon our
one-of-a-kind weights into control by
incorporating foot pads that are larger
and more sensitive the result is a board
that's easier to ride in a lot more fun
our new lithium battery is lighter and
slimmer greatly reducing the weight
while simultaneously improving range and
cutting charge time in half our
brushless motor more efficient faster
than ever finally our new motor
controller is rugged and flash / powers
features like headlights taillights and
regenerative braking our designers and
engineers have worked tirelessly over
the last two years to make the Z board -
the best electric skateboard on the
market and it's almost ready three years
ago you helped us take the Z board from
a project in the garage to a real
product now we're taking it to the next
level your funds will allow us to move
forward with production to link both
purchasing and final design get the Z
board - underneath your feet check out
our IndieGoGo page and be part of the
next chapter of the board story thank
you for your time and we can't wait to
get you writing

kids spend five to seven hours in front
of screens every day rocks appeared to
change that
we bring gaming action offspring and
into real life imagine playing Mario
Brothers in the backyard I got my name
is Killian and with your help we get
kids away from screens to make them run
and play around and realize again get
kids active we have to engage and
entertain them in the same way as video
games and that's where rocks come to
play
lock a wirelessly connected super
durable high-tech box each box has
several smart sensors inside and comes
with different lights and sound effects
the different game categories 7go games
at the Crazy Chicken target rogue memory
game wolf games and different kind of
test case zombie text for example is the
game that kids love the most everybody
slept on a rock and one of the rocks
would come to make the sounds like a
zombie this then had to tape the
other kids and when taking somebody he
or she will also become a doctor goal is
to turn everybody into zombies in our
testings with more than 250 gift we have
found that no game has to be the same
kids come up with new crazy ways to play
all the time unlike many other
crowdfunding project we integrated the
manufacturing perspective right from the
very beginning of the development
process our interdisciplinary team of
industrial designers engineers and
manufacturing professionals has more
than 50 years of combined working
experience in product development and
bringing products to market we spent the
last two years plus all our savings to
bring rocks to life now the development
is finished small heart and software are
ready and the manufacturer with whom we
work already for many years it's only
waiting to get the go-ahead to start
producing the only thing we still need
your help to get the first batch of
rocks produced would be support us and
help us to get rocks in the hands of as
many children as possible get one for
yourself your family your local school
or any little one the result we are
2016 video games are part of children's
life but too much is too much
