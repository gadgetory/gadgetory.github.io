me Gary wires best friend we get tired
of tangled air phones in our pockets so
we searched through a way to keep them
organized and we realized there is
nothing in the market that can fulfill
our needs we decided to make a winder
that is sleek compact and easy to use
Salter a few prototypes we came up with
a perfect solution we may very proactive
people just like us to not have a spare
minute to fight with his annoying wires
and want easy access on the go we'll get
everything set up for production and now
it's when you come in please help us
bring Gary to life and into pockets
say yes to your phone freedom and
melting it worse
Guerry your wait is over
we live on a planet that's 71% water yet
we've only explored 10% of it we're
about to change that the fathom one is
an easy-to-use underwater drone that you
control with your smartphone or tablet
we designed it to be the most affordable
most versatile underwater drone ever
made and after two full years of
prototyping and development we're
finally ready to bring underwater
exploration and education to the masses
I'm Jon I'm Matt and I'm Dani we're a
team of outdoor enthusiasts scuba divers
engineers and travelers that had an idea
for an underwater drone that we could
take anywhere and use in any environment
I grew up spending summers on Lake
Louise in northern Michigan where a lot
of large logging operations took place
in the 1800s jump forward 200 years and
now every cottage has artifacts and
pieces of history on their walls that
washed up on the beach but there are
still legends of horse-drawn sleds that
fell through the ice and got stuck at
the bottom just waiting to be explored I
thought if I could control an aerial
drone from a mobile app to explore from
above why couldn't I do the same thing
from underwater
that's when fathom was born
underwater remotely operated vehicles or
ROV s have been around for a while but
they're mainly large expensive
industrial devices tethered to big ships
and early consumer rvs inspired by their
big brothers cost well over $1000 with
no mobile app for piloting and you may
be a pretty good hacker to put them
together we knew we wanted an underwater
drone that anyone could drop into any
body of water and pilot easily using an
app on their smart device and it had to
be small and light enough to carry
around meaning a completely new compact
design it had to come fully assembled
out of the box including an onboard
1080p HD camera and built in high
intensity LED headlights for clear
viewing and it had to be as affordable
as lower cost flying drones with
comparable equipment so that every
modern day Explorer could have one we
built the fathom one with all of those
features and thanks to custom components
in a streamlined design now you can have
it for under $600 that's less than half
the price of the closest competition
above all we made the fathom one super
easy to use but that doesn't mean it's
limited this thing is fully modular our
patent-pending thruster attachment
system allows you to easily remove all
three thrusters for packing but it also
enables customization and upgrades to
specialized thrusters such as these ones
with larger fins for stabilization and
we're hoping our backer community will
create and share their own ideas for
customization feather one also features
an integrated rail system that makes
adding accessories like action cameras
and additional lights or other sensors a
breeze just slide it on click it in and
you're ready to go we put everything
that we have into making underwater
exploration and education more
accessible to the masses
we built the prototypes validated our
designs and now ready to go on a
full-scale manufacturing all that's left
is for you the Kickstarter community to
show us that you want an underwater
drone that's affordable portable modular
and completely easy to use right out of
the box fathom is your chance to go deep
and see the world in an entirely new way
the possibilities are truly endless
what can you fathom
we've entered the age of personal
manufacturing but when it comes to
making durable things in your own shop
there's still no easy way to cut hard
materials as makers and engineers we
need to work with all materials so we've
built a machine that could the first
desktop water jet laser works by
combining abrasive particles with a
high-pressure water stream the mixture
exits the nozzle and cuts through the
workpiece it's great for any workshop it
cuts every material it's compact and
contained and it's digital so you can
make precise cuts that are impossible to
make any other way
as an industrial designer I've used a
variety of desktop fabrication tools but
they tend to be very limited by the
durability of the materials you can use
on those machines with a desktop water
jet we can go from design to component
to fitting that component and testing
within a couple of hours that's an
incredibly powerful tool as a jeweler
and an artist with the work I make I
spend a lot of time hand cutting so
right now I'm selling pieces sort of as
almost limited edition because I can't
physically output them not because I
want to be making in a limited edition
waser would allow me to not only make a
lot more but also to lower the price
point so they'd be available to a
broader audience I think you know people
tend to have their ideas constrained by
their tools and the things they're
capable of working with and having a
water jet cutter which has the ability
to cut a broader range of materials hard
materials like steel and glass will be
enabling and make them think in
different ways and have them build
different things they couldn't build
before the future of manufacturing is in
custom local fabrication people will be
able to make things in our own workshop
that they can use every single day and
will last a lifetime as mechanical
electrical and manufacturing engineers
we design products manufactured
components and set up assembly lines in
the past now we're preparing for
production but we move enough orders to
produce the machines cost-effectively
we've created a unique desktop tool and
we're really looking forward to all the
amazing things that people create with
her
you
in a world where we are constantly on
the go fueled by the caffeine we drink
why are we still wasting time in line
and settling for substandard coffee we
asked why not make coffee portable where
you could brew a delicious cup in the
palm of your hand so we did just that
this is the jolt a portable coffee
brewer that can brew anytime anywhere we
have developed the most compact and
efficient design possible pushing the
limits of current battery and heating
element technologies in addition to
convenience taste is paramount we've
modeled our device after the traditional
French press brewing for a truly
delicious cup of coffee so how does it
work
simply fill with water and within
minutes it will reach the perfect
brewing temperature load the coffee pod
with your own coffee grounds or use our
biodegradable packets wait for the green
light and your coffee is ready to drink
as a mechanical engineer with a
background and electromechanical
packaging and heat transfer I've had the
opportunity to transform our concept
into a functioning prototype
incorporating feedback from friends
family and coffee lovers into every
iteration over the last three years
unlike other portable Brewers our
product utilizes the latest technology
to reach the proper correct temperature
of 200 degrees Fahrenheit so you can
brew anytime anywhere we pride ourselves
in not only our speed but also our
ability to deliver a quality great
tasting cup of coffee but the coffee pod
was equally important to us as the
device itself it's estimated that over
nine billion carry K cups end up in
landfills every year but the jolt is
different we've developed a
biodegradable coffee pot that brews
great coffee and leaves no impact on the
environment leveraging our team's
background in mechanical and electrical
engineering we've solved some immense
challenges and after three years of
development we're finally ready to share
our product
we've come to IndieGoGo after perfecting
our technology and partnering with a
great manufacturer our goal is to raise
enough funds to meet our manufacturer's
minimum order quantity and that's where
we need your help so please join us
today and help make portable brewing
Korea
tres is a action sports tracker it's a
small little device the size of a
Reese's Peanut Butter Cup and you mount
your snowboard your surfboard your
wakeboard whatever and tells you how
fast you're going how many waves you've
cut how many calories you burn for
skiing and snowboarding it'll tell you
things like air time how high you're
jumping which lips you are on a bunch of
other things but basically it measures
your activity
tres will also auto I the video footage
for you so if you're taking video with a
GoPro or a Sony or Canon you can
actually put the video into our auto
editor and it will edit out all the
highlights for you as well as color
correct and overlay your stats all
automatically
definitely some of the differences
between you know some of the other
gadgets that are out there would be that
it's physically amounted on your
surfboard sir there's nothing that's in
your arm or you know any kind of odd you
know stat that can be thrown in there
it's something that's going to be as
close to the water as possible until you
gonna get you know the closest results
and if so easy is kind of stick it on
your board and just like to trace it and
you're good to go
hi I'm dr. diva Tomei and this is Lucy
the flagship member of our Salonika
family say hi Lucy at Salonika we
believe that if the sun is shining we
should never have to turn the lights on
day lighting is the illumination of
indoor spaces with natural light and we
want to invite you to join the day
lighting revolution
Lucy lights up your home or office with
sunshine the first ever of her kind
she is solar powered portable and
italian-designed
this is how Lucy works place Lucy in a
sunny spot indoors or outdoors point her
towards the area you want to illuminate
and turn her on
Lucy will do the rest she will find and
track the Sun for you and redirect that
sunlight back inside turn off the lights
and turn on Lucy
Lucy is also earth conscious powered by
solar cells she never needs to be
plugged in and think of how much you can
save by turning off the lights for half
of your day last but not least Lucy has
been built to be beautiful Italian
designed through and through Lucy will
never look out of place in your home or
office
besides the magic of day lighting made
simple what else makes Lucy special in
one word
sunshine Wow whoa this is an entirely
different room right now I completely
changed the actual house itself I can
read you can actually see the color of
that wall which she couldn't do before
in contact with nature because it's the
light of the Sun Lucy is no longer just
an idea born from the dark corners of my
office at Cambridge our engineering team
has already gone through multiple
designs of Lucy and we have a fully
working prototype the one that you see
in this video
we have also started testing Lucy in the
field with our beta tester community and
Salonika head of manufacturing is
already hard at work with a top three
mass manufacturer to bring Lucy to
market that's why we've come to
IndieGoGo we're so excited about
bringing Lucy and all the benefits of
the sunshine she provides in indoor
spaces everywhere we really hope that
you will love Lucy as much as we do and
want to join the day lighting revolution
you can click over here to make a pledge
or scroll down to learn more thanks so
much for listening and let the Sun Shine
