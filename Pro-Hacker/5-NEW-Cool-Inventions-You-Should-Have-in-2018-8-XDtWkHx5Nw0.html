piece of furniture that automatically
stores your clothes think of it as your
personal assistant that puts away a
little clean laundry after your washer
and dryer are finished with thread robe
you have no more folding no more hanging
and best of all your clothes are always
put away and organized when washers and
dryers were invented in the 1950s they
were technology breakthroughs but we
have been stuck with folding and hanging
our clothes ever since thread robe makes
laundry simple when your dryer is
finished remove the entire pile of
clothing and place it directly into the
Wardrobe shut the door and your job is
done the Wardrobe uses simple automation
to separate and hang each item inside a
storage area specially designed hangers
safely grip the clothing place them in
cradles inside the unit and store the
items until you recall them when you
need something to wear select items in
the mobile app then choose to dispense
them now or schedule them to be
dispensed at a future date and time the
app notifies the Wardrobe to retrieve
the selected items place them in the
same bin used for loading and steam them
to your specifications your clothes are
returned fresh wrinkle free and ready to
wear
the thought of never having to fold
laundry again is amazing but the thread
robe app is equally as innovative it
provides complete control of your
clothing and your wardrobe all at your
fingertips if we can access our digital
music from anywhere in the world we
should be able to better manage the
thousands of dollars of clothing that we
own even when we're not at home
imagine scheduling your outfits for the
week all from the back seat of an uber
thread robe is smart it knows what's
clean and what's dirty helps you pack
for trips ensuring you don't forget
anything it even shows you data about
how you wear your clothing and the
composition of your closet when you take
the app shopping with you they will
match items you're thinking of
purchasing with clothing you already own
I'm Matt Powell in a world with
driverless cars and drone delivery
systems we should be able to eliminate
one of the most time-consuming household
chores and modernize the way we manage
our clothes the engineers that built
thread robe have worked on everything
from laser defense systems to autonomous
lawn mowers our thread robe team is
working hard to ship our first units in
mid 2018 join us in making folding and
hanging laundry a thing of the past

overdue
