welcome to hover sitting reinvented my
name is John Godoy and became a personal
trainer because I wanted to help people
live healthier lives unfortunately many
of them fell short in terms of weight
loss and conditioning I needed help so I
contacted my friend dr. Ron Mochizuki I
told John that exercising three times a
week it's not enough to offset the
effects of sitting all day in addition
simply standing may not be the answer
research is showing that the real
culprit may be a lack of movement
whether you're sitting or whether you're
standing so Ron my young friend John and
I set out to find a way to bring
movement to sitting in a way that would
not be distracting and that would
increase productivity 36 months of
rigorous prototype testing and
development have finally allowed us to
achieve our goal to create cover
after extensive testing conducted at the
Mayo Clinic hover was neat certified by
the Mayo neat stands for non-exercise
activity thermogenesis or calorie
burning
hover comes in two models and is easy to
set up and use research has found that
low intensity meat type activities are
more effective for successful and
sustainable weight loss and short
periods of intense exercise and are
important for overall health an optional
activity tracker allows you to measure
your daily activity no matter how you
choose to use hover hover provides
natural unconscious movement for a wide
range of people who spend for a long
time sitting whether at a desk or at
home when you go sideways it just feels
very normal
like if you're carving or maybe in a
like snowboarding as well to get in
better shape the obliques and the legs
and be productive so jagged always been
my personal trainer for seven years and
and I must admit he's a terrific trainer
but I had no idea that he would invent
something as useful and as helpful to my
conditioning as the hover I found hover
to be different in a couple different
ways one was it's something I can easily
jump in and use it required no act of
thought I just I mean been able to use
it on an ongoing basis every day and
it's now habit we're now ready to fund
the moulds for our first large injection
breath so we're asking for your help to
purchase those balls so together we can
bring hover to life thank you for your
help
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
