play takes your smartphone and turns it
into a fun kids camera and you
immediately it was a hit so as soon as
my son sought in the package he couldn't
wait to get it out try it you know
exactly what to do it was easy to use
and was ready to take pictures over 50%
of families have an old smartphone
sitting somewhere unused in the home I
love the idea that my kids would be into
photography more and to use some of that
equipment we already have something out
other moms and I talk a lot about is
screen time and how much we try to limit
our children from being in front of the
TV or the couch or the iPad and so I
love that this brings a device outside
the pixel play app will encourage active
play while kids learn photography kids
will have fun taking photos adding
picture frames and making silly faces
and the included activities will spark
creativity I love the look I love that
it looks like a camera I enjoy the fact
that it's less vulnerable than them you
know holding a phone several feet above
concrete it's protective that you can
put a strap on it and I think now we
know what to do
pixel play works with both Apple and
Android products it's got a durable
design with rubber handles a touch
sensitive screen so you can still access
your phone a working shutter button so
you can take photos while your phone is
protected as well as working knobs and
buttons just like the real thing I've
worked in the toy business for over 15
years I left my job at a big toy company
to develop pixel play I've done a number
of prototypes parents love it
I've even got orders from a few
retailers but I need your help to help
fulfill the minimum order quantity from
factory so please back this project
check out our rewards we've got a bunch
of great stuff let's help get all those
unused smartphones out of your old junk
drawers and into the hands of kids so
they can be active creative and have fun
with pixel play pixel play turn your
smartphone into a fun kid's camera
well my grandfather not founded the
Tiffin company his philosophy was simple
find out what the customer wants and
give it to them two years ago we asked
our engineers at steadicam headquarters
in Burbank to create the best electronic
handheld stabilizer with no limitations
we took our study camp technology that's
been used in Hollywood for the last 40
years and coupled it with Steve Wagner's
genius software design and by partnering
with aerial drone manufacturer unique it
allowed us to create this Steadicam
vault the best electronic handheld
stabilizer with no limitations the study
can volt like all its predecessors is a
expanded system with the center of
gravity right at a gimbal it accepts any
phone any case that allows you to walk
around precisely frame the things that
you want to see and move the camera in
the way that we're used to seeing on a
feature film
it's an electronically gyro augmented
study cam for smartphones that weighs 1
pound with the inertia and the feel of a
big 40-pound rig
three axis gimbal they're not terrific
at following action one two three one
two three there's a little lag there the
study Campbell gives you stability and
agility and that's the key the Volt
