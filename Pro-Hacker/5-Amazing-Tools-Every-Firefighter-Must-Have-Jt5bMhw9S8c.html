the event was January 23rd 2005 a fire
in the Bronx
conditions got so impossible they were
forced to jump out the window on the 4th
floor two firefighters were killed for
them were injured seriously as a
professional firefighter we're charged
to risk our lives in many situations to
save savable lives during that time you
have to place yourself at risk on
occasion you place yourself at a greater
risk than you assume and become trapped
inside of a structure on fire
conducting a search conditions change
rapidly it's a high-risk situation
fire conditions as such they cannot get
back to the means they came in
back in February 2005 the FDNY contacted
Petzl to see if her gris-gris belay
device used on the sports side could be
used with 7.5 million rope and become
the descent control device for their
personal safety system Tim Kelly and his
committee worked with our product
engineers at that's all
to create a new device that met their
specification now called the XO
the extra personal escape system is made
up of an anchor hook with a hitching
slot a 50 foot seven point five
millimeter and tech-noir rope an XO a
personal escape a descent control device
as well as a Nomex carry bag that is
fastened to the firefighters harness
today there are 40,000 firefighters who
carry the system from 300 different fire
departments from around the world and we
have been informed that the system has
been deployed in several fire ground
situations the XO is the most tested and
carried personal escape system in the
world
the benefits of the excel or the payout
which was a firefighter crawling from a
remote anchor to the point of exit of
the room getting out over the edge and
then rappelling on it just releasing the
handle the firefighter was able to stop
at a given point if they had to aid in
their own rescue they could certainly do
that when you're under duress when your
life is on the line you default your
lowest level of common and consistent
training so the key with the XO is it
gives you the ability to perform skills
when you're fine motor functions have
deteriorated under duress or because of
the environment it's easy to use it's
quick to use and allows a smooth and
rapid horizontal movement as well as
egress when you're outside the window
from day one that's all understood that
training had to be an important part of
this bailout solution for those fire
departments who want to offer their own
training Petzl and authorized trainers
offer a three day training training
class which allow you to train your own
firefighters several fire departments
that we have worked with in the past
have been successful in obtaining grants
from local state and federal sources
Petzval can help identify these grant
agencies and sources we have 12,000
firefighters we needed to see that every
firefighter with a high degree of
confidence could deploy and execute the
PSS and perform a successful bailout
under high stress conditions it is a
part of my turnout gear and it's
invaluable I don't go anywhere within a
structure on fire without the exo
attached to my side
just knowing that you have something in
the event it goes very bad having that
PSS for me personally gives a high
degree of confidence that have given
that I could get out the window and and
live another day

the falcon line of harnesses is designed
specifically for rescue professionals
developed for Rapid Intervention choose
one of three models based on the type of
terrain the harness features a semi
rigid and narrow waist belt and leg
loops to strike the ideal balance
between comfort and lightweight the
lateral attachment points also serve to
reduce weight and bulkiness all falcon
harnesses are easy to adjust by using
the double back self locking buckles the
foam line leg loops can also be
fine-tuned for a perfect fit the gear
loops and carry tool slots allow rescue
professionals to efficiently rack and
organize gear on the waist belt the
falcon line of harnesses includes three
models the falcon is designed for rescue
operations that require remaining
suspended for long periods of time the
metal ventral attachment point
distributes weight effectively between
the waist belt and leg loops the falcon
descent increases efficiency when is
sending a rope the dual ventral
attachment loops allow for a much lower
positioning of the crawl ascender as for
the Falcon mountain this harness is
designed for mountain rescues the
textile tie-in points facilitate
climbing technique and overall mobility
falcon lightweight harnesses for greater
efficiency
hi Jeff Evans here with Streamlight I'm
here today to introduce to you the
updated survivor right angle light the
first thing you'll notice about the
improvement on the light is that we
reduced the profile so you'll have less
interference with your gear we've also
changed the clip on this light we've
made the clip so it'll lay flatter when
you put when you pin it to your exterior
of your coat or your coveralls the
survivor of course features a large push
button switch that's easy to operate
with a gloved hand it also features a
quick change battery we need you to make
a battery change on the fly either
rechargeable or alkaline batteries power
this light give you ultimate flexibility
the light features four modes high mode
which is for optimum light intensity low
mode for battery conservation a beacon
mode which will allow you to send a
distress signal or mark an entry and
exit point or a hole in the floor
in moonlight mode moon light mode will
run for 20 days in the event of some of
a catastrophe where you can't reach
batteries or recharge the battery also
there are interchangeable smoke cutter
plugs available the black plug reduces
perfer light for a tighter beam the
amber plug reduces peripheral light and
eye fatigue caused by glare the survivor
is class 1 division 1 rated for
hazardous atmospheres it's also
waterproof stream lights survivor series
the most trusted right angle light just
got better
