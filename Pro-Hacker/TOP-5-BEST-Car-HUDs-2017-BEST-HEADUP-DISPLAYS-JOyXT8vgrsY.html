hello again empty master surround sound
- early bird cafe you and me we're busy
people and being busy means checking
your phone even when you're not supposed
to even when you're on the road but now
there's Navi hold on we gotta get this
cake talk to me hey Adam quick reminder
first thing today is that coffee with
Connie and Greg everybody party on my
way
he was brilliant about navdy is this
after route fell automatically rerouting
to save ten minute perfect never been
this way before
that's what you can have you - see
what's so brilliant about Navi is its
display is focused in the distance so
your eyes are never off the road it's
also 40 times brighter than your
smartphone it dims automatically so it's
you'd be the few day or night in fact it
was very good to take cooking to Greg
and I actually want to do North Cafe a
done 60 - smiley face Oh awesome
luckily roids is one of my favorites
Navi uses Google Maps and built-in
offline maps you'll never get lost like
out here in the desert and it's
connected to your car which means
there's no ungass rerouting - nearest
gas station tech Ronnie be there in two
feet
you have around thanks Evie too soon
you
I thought it's probably the most
advanced his of display units how in the
market in the moment I thought it's a
portable head-up display unit which
connects to your phone and vehicle it
projects all the necessary information
you need as a transparent image hovering
in front of you it has a wide area of
unique features that allow you to remain
connected without taking your eyes off
the road setting up I scout is quick and
simple you place I scout on your
dashboard and connect to your car wire
OVD to port and to your forum wire
bluetooth it will talk to your phone and
relay incoming calls which you can
accept or reject using simple hand
gestures you could swipe left to accept
a call or swipe right to reject one eye
scope would support a wide range of apps
like whatsapp Facebook and almost all
the social media apps that are in the
marketplace
because they're able to communicate with
the vehicle you're able to gain access
to all the warning signs from the
vehicle itself and displayed on the
device imagine you are driving and you
are low on fuel so what I sell does is
that it wants you and it immediately
searches for a gas station nearby
hi Scott has a number of very
interesting features feature such as a
bipod camera the blackboard camera is
the first of its kind for a head-up
display unit when you turn on your right
indicator for example the right
blackboard camera gets activated showing
you a light piece of what's happening on
your right leg foot view so you don't
have to look over your shoulders again
there are two components to the iscope
one is the base the second is a combiner
or the piece of glass that attached to
the base the screen of eyebrows is photo
compass which means you will never have
to worry about image quality even on a
bright sunny day the screen dims
according to light intensity allowing
you to view your content effortlessly so
the base has been designed in such a way
that it can be in flames to accommodate
person of any height so that even if you
are a big shot or a big tall we could
make slight adjustment to the base
inclination to give you a good deal
I felt as a built-in GPS for navigation
because it can pinpoint your exact
location
it displays the speed limit of the road
you are on the dial goes red when you
are stealing to capture your attention
immediately
I started integrating all these unique
features onto one platform to allow you
to remain connected safety and this is
what I thought that then it helps you
multitask
without the risk of multitasking believe
that head-up display in the future of
automotive display the idea of having to
take your eyes of the road to get access
to any information you require while
driving is extremely dangerous and I
skulk is our solution to this problem we
need your support to bring I Scout to
your course to make driving smarter
you
never wonder what you notice most people
driving a luxury car around town what
people notice the most is the head-up
display inside of these high-end cars
you know those futuristic little screen
that show your speed and navigation in
your field of vision not only are they
super cool but they actually make your
rice safer and more comfortable the
problem is you have to shell out
thousands if not tens of thousands of
dollars for car and salty but what if
there is a way to get that science
experience without the high-end prices
introducing uh dafuq it's a simple
automotive accessories and you put on
your dashboard that uses a smartphone
you already own to turn it into
affordable heads-up display utter
fireworks with literally any car just
place it on your dashboard download our
sister out not me
place it on the cradle and start driving
having a special coating means you can
use it in any like any kind of day you
can keep your eyes on the road at all
times
thanks to that me how to fly presents a
beautiful UI with full voice guided
turn-by-turn navigation and up to the
second route recalculations to pay
speeding ticket
so do we have your current speed and
speed limit of the road your current
driving on rejected from your high
making it way easier to avoid those
contentions and your how to by
automatically reversing when the red
light camera is coming up unlike maps on
your phone you can even download a whole
country map ahead of time and navigate a
hundred percent offline using satellite
to no internet signal required you can
always count on no matter where you go
and if you want to use another
navigation app you can modify supports
any HUD designed app we think everyone
should have the opportunity have a safer
dress
that's why we are making it available to
the Kickstarter community by getting
everyone to the pledging bulk up front
we can get a volume discount and invest
in better production which means a
better product for everyone this
ultimate means is that we can offer it
for less than $50 to our Kickstarter
backers and you can have a safe and
futuristic navigation experience so what
are you waiting for let's how to fly one
fun we love to dream and we wished our
