you
if you're like us you love your new
MacBook but missed that MagSafe
connector sure there's a couple USBC
magnetic adapters out there but those
are designed for charging only while
limit this powerful port to just
charging introducing magneto the world's
only magnetic connector capable of super
speed data 4k video and up to 100 watts
charging and it's not just for the
MacBook magneto works with all US PC
devices including phones tablets and
notebooks just like the Apple watch it's
machined from a solid block of aluminum
using ultra high quality components
designed for the wear and tear of daily
life we designed an engineered magneto
right here in Silicon Valley and
delivered our previous Kickstarter to 30
countries worldwide
order yours today and expect it in
February
hello Kickstarter we're proud to
announce our redesigned Magneto that are
awesome backers helped shape magneto is
now sleeker and smaller with new custom
form boot magnets beat
this new shape still features all the
functionality of the original our
schedule remains unaffected warriors now
and expected in February
no one expects a parent or a loved one
to fall down or have a near-death
experience but it really happens every
day in fact one out of every three
seniors fall each year families spend
thirty four billion dollars annually on
fall related hospitalization and seniors
can die within six hours of becoming a
mobile in March my father Allen became
one of those statistics he fell and was
on the floor for 24 hours before he was
found
his muscles broke down rapidly and he
almost died if only we would have had a
monitoring device that could have
alerted us to his condition we could
have avoided a hospitalization and had
peace of mind
the problem is monitoring systems for
seniors charge upwards of forty two
dollars a month for a response from a
nameless faceless call center in a
recent focus group hundreds of seniors
expressed an interest in a monitoring
device including my father but they
found they couldn't afford the monthly
monitoring fees what if you could get
the technology of a fitness tracker
paired with a monitoring system all
without the monthly monitoring fee the
Allen band is a revolutionary device
that solves this problem offering free
Wi-Fi or Bluetooth monitoring by an
automated cloud server seniors can call
for help manually when they need it and
if they can't call the Allen band will
do it for them sending a text or push
notification directly to those who know
them best their family and friends the
Allen band can save lives with fall
detection GPS location heart rate body
temperature and inactivity monitoring
seniors can use the benefits of a
fitness tracker with the safety of a
monitoring device our small business
lenders wanted to see a monthly
monitoring fee before they would fund
our project we think the monitoring
should remain free with your help we can
raise the twenty two thousand five
hundred needed to complete and test the
Allen band prototype and keep the
monthly monitoring free my dad went home
again at the end of May but not everyone
is so lucky helped us bring this
life-saving device into the homes of
seniors around the world please back the
Allen band so we can keep him and
countless other seniors safe at home
together with your support we can save
lives
you

my name is viktoria who I just graduated
from UC Berkeley and I am the co-founder
of accent accent where is a company that
makes innovative headphones that you
haven't seen before I came up with idea
wild goat but I was never able to turn
it into a reality
fortunately I met my best friend
Victoria and she was able to help me
with a lot of the things that I could
accomplish by myself so we came up with
the idea for the name for accent wear
when we were actually just on Facebook
and we were chatting with a bunch of our
friends and we were like hey guys let's
think of a good name that would be
fitting for this new company and we're
just throwing ideas back and forth and
finally someone said oh you know what
what about accent wear and we're like
you know what sounds pretty good first I
came up with a few sketches I drew them
on people's head to get idea of how they
were look I tried all different colors
different designs there's a great lab at
UC Berkeley and we just got a fellowship
at the Innovation Lab and we would go in
every week and we would take her around
and we just put things online finally
got a design that I'm happy with I
started doing a 3d model of it I have a
physical model to try on people one of
the things that we ended up changing
through feedback from our our fans on
Facebook was that they wanted bigger
cans they wanted it over the year
instead of on the year so we changed
that because a lot of people were
requesting that each new prototype the
headphones get closer and closer to what
we envisioned so these are the
headphones accent or accent and the
headband and all the plastic parts are
made of ABS which is a recyclable
material so it is environmentally
friendly that way these are the LED
lights that are that show up to be the
color that you choose we're going to
have a couple of options these are the
external speakers so you can share music
with your friends we're really excited
to make these a reality and to take
these from the prototyping stage to the
final product we really hope that you'll
support us and our endeavor please back
us up on our campaign and help us turn
this into a reality thank you
you
