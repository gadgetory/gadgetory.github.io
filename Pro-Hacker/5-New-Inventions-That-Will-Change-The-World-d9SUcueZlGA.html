mundane as air and water we throw things
we can't live without in them and told
them about everywhere we go every day we
never even bothered us stop and think
about what they can and should do so
what if backpacks can charge your
devices what if we turned them into our
alternative persona meet backpacks a
beautifully designed to urban backpack
and perfect for a connected and the goal
lifestyle of today backpacks is fully
weatherproof it is constructed entirely
using material made from recycled
bottles the bag houses 30 liters worth
of your everyday items like a 15-inch
laptop one 10 inch tablet and a number
of other needed gadgets and gears
backpacks features a side access for
your laptop a u-lock hook belt a yoga
mat loop and a shoe pocket
backpacks is the sleek all-around
backpack for today's urban commuters I'm
a frequent traveler and it always
bothers me how my backpacks can't keep
up with me
it can't charge my dead cell phone and
they all look pretty embarrassing in the
office I need a bag that's gonna keep up
with my day to day lifestyle I need a
bag with unlimited possibilities and I'm
just not going to be satisfied until I
get one we need a solution for the
problems we've had and for the problems
we will have a smart docking system is
that answer but we need your support the
bag now has a finished design and a
prototype but we need your support in
order to make the smart badge system
we really appreciate the wus and whoa is
on Facebook and Instagram and so please
pledge today and let's build a better
bag for tomorrow
PFF is a company started in order to put
together difference and people we want
to understand which are the new needs of
young generations because we come from
piaggio we see cities in a different way
than an automobile company we think
about people moving in a granular way
granular mobility is a concept that we
have elaborated within piaggio fast
forward to call attention to those
spaces that we navigate as pedestrians
as citizens of the 21st Century City we
thought let's try to make a product
which engages all those different cities
and the way people move in all those
cities
Chito is designed to leverage the power
of human navigators of urban spaces to
make sense of them we imagine it as a
kind of Vespa for the 21st century
cheetah is thought to help the human in
our vision humans and droids must walk
together it's a fusion of the two it's a
land drone it's a cargo boat it's a
Sherpa and it's a smart device that
learns the environments and maps them as
it travels them with
guns it moves us slowly and can maneuver
the same as a human and it can move as
fast as a human can run and everything
in between
it can also comfortably carry about what
a human can carry GTS two main purposes
it is thought for goods transportation
for people transportation and to mix
them to health people and we see a
future where city streets are not full
of autonomous cars but people walking
jogging riding skateboards and bicycles
we believe that the 21st century will be
the century of robotic movability
hi my name is Enzo I know you love
simple life focus on a variable matters
how awesome is it mochi is simple and
also just like you
we found the keyboard and mouse are
never used simultaneously our Kissin was
why not share the space the simplest T
can be acquired simply but finally we
found the best solution mochi provides
you with the best typing experience by a
slim pantograph keyboard thin and safe
laser sensors generate a large optical
touchpad at the exact moment you want to
use it
bluetooth low energy technology assures
an extended battery life the gorgeous
aluminum body makes mochi more slim and
durable the cover of mochi not only
protects the keyboard from damage but
also it turns into a portable device
staff
of course mochi never compromises its
style for great performance
place the book mocking to the simple and
also not allowed you
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
