lost enough we defined I want to be a
great point and shoot camera but for
photographers and artists they want more

working within limitation but the more
control you have within these
limitations the more freedom you get to
be creative you can put the camera with

you all these control that allows you to
go in and change the shutter speed and
aperture with the a1 we are able to
create instant photography that we're
