revolutionary cameras ever made but how
do you turn amateur footage into a
cinematic masterpiece
the answer is movement introducing
emotion it's a fully automatic slider
that lets you do hollywood-style camera
moves at the push of a button it has
custom modes for any situation and it
works with all smartphones GoPros and
mirrorless cameras
it comes with 15-inch rails that can be
extended to double the size yet it
easily breaks down to fit in your bed
using an integrated panning mechanism it
automatically creates a parallax
movement as it slides it's great for
products on interviews or anytime you
want a cinematic look reverse the camera
and the parallax becomes a panning slide
giving you a 36 degree wider viewing
angle than regular sliders for vloggers
in motion lets you forget about the
camera and focus on your content using
our motion tracking algorithms face
following intelligently keeps you in
frame as you move around and with the
live-streaming inside the app building a
following is easier than ever before for
photographers in motion lets you create
motion time-lapses right on your phone
just customize your settings in the app
and hit start
the motion unit can also be removed for
flawless panoramic shots or panning
time-lapses for night shots time lapses
captured more light and maximize your
video quality after this you select one
of the many presentence then via cloud
computing your files will be color
graded automatically for action sports
there's motion trigger using two
Bluetooth sensors you can set up a
trigger for subjects that are up to 30
feet away when activated and motion can
start recording immediately or give you
some lead time for a smoother transition
in motion was built five filmmakers for
filmmakers you can build a full rig
thanks to its three-quarter inch
mounting points and it even has a
built-in USB flash charging port in the
