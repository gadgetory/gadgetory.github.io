forward to our anniversary of this
weekend Katie let's order champagne for
delivery tomorrow okay
hello Kickstarter here's the fact nearly
one-third of all us drivers read and
send text messages while behind the
wheel
even we look down to just check our
speed we drive blind for over 300 feet
at 60 miles an hour even worse we take 3
to 6 seconds to read and interpret maps
on a regular navigation system well
according to the government-sponsored
research taking your eyes of the road
for more than two seconds is unsafe in
dangerous in a significantly increasing
your chances of getting into a car
accident we are have a belief but very
best safe way to use smartphone behind
the wheel and we hope to change
everyone's driving habits of a better
in 2015 we ran our first ixora campaign
for Hardwicke was a simple vehicle
accessory but reflects a smartphone
screen and a special glass this summer
we are launching a new product
hardwick us it's a portable heads-up
display that sits on your dashboard and
works as an external display for a
smartphone wirelessly
together with our app it will let you
control it basic smartphone functions
while driving navigation calls messages
and music in a safer less distracting
way it's like Android auto or car play
but with a virtual heads-up display
image floating above the hood eight feet
away easy to use easy to install and all
you need is a smartphone
they have this in like in like high-end
cars right like W is here whatever they
did the projection so you're not looking
away from the road to actually see the
directions and it like moves with here
too that is really cool
I've seen people on their phone all the
time and they're always looking down so
this is definitely plus in terms of
trying to keep up P and drivers away
from being distracted that's actually
really awesome
that's very cool I guess somewhere comes
to maps that makes it a lot easier I get
it I love the technology and I think it
would be much safer than looking down at
my phone every two minutes you know I
always have my kid in the car and I'm
always really worried and I use like
maps all the time wherever I'm going and
I have feels so bad because I have to
hold it here is it just works with any
app like is it just showing literally
your phone screen okay awesome it's
pretty sweet seems super safe so
definitely something that I would try
out
yes it works with Waze Google Maps Apple
maps you name it but there is more our
Hardware cast app works as a control
panel for your basic smartphone
functions less distracting and driving
friendly way
navigation in places that where you want
to go out to follow directions using
your navigation face make and receive
phone calls using a car media your
favorite contacts are always here reply
to incoming messages with preset
templates or send a voice message no
need to type manage your music library
you will quick swipes and taps in our
driving friendly UI in all these cases
you will still see your directions and
navigation information on how to wake up
screen and use your phone as a control
panel if you want to use any other apps
no problem hardwick has will mirror what
every is only a phone screen like
chromecast now fancy and complicated
integrations with a car and media it
just works
since our last Kickstarter campaign we
learn how to handle things in hardware
projects we dealt with quality issues
production delays shipment slows by
Canadian post copycats Taiwanese
typhoons Chinese national holidays and
customs but it was all worth it support
in experience we've gained is priceless
helped us deliver this product the best
price possible and make our roles a
little bit safer join us to do this
together
hardwick us see you soon thank you
we believe if they were improved
communication between drivers and the
road can become a better place this idea
led to our creation of car week your
faithful little driving companion car
wink reinvents the way drivers
communicate with each other car wayne
pedestrian crossing the hands-free voice
control function allows for a safe and
convenient communication between drivers
fueled by the power of the sun car wink
solar charging means you will never have
to worry about running out of shoes
built on the foundation of driver
interaction car wink is here to relay
your message and enhance driver
relationships harrowing
thank you we aim to minimize road rage
and stress for drivers let CARWINGS
smile open up your horizons and show you
a brand new adventure
but amazing journeys will you create
with you the air bubble is the first
proven technology that effectively
removes more than 95% of both nitrogen
dioxide and particles from inside a car
it's now well known that air pollution
affects our health especially those
living in cities however what most
people aren't aware of is just how bad
the air in your car can be nitrogen
dioxide levels primarily from diesel
emissions inside your car cabin can be
10 times over the WHL limit sitting in a
vehicle with your windows up in traffic
is not the safe haven you might think
that it is that's why we've created the
air bubble the first proven technology
of its kind that removes all elements of
air pollution including nitrogen dioxide
from inside a car cabin the air bubble
is optimized to protect drivers and
their families in polluted cities and
professional drivers who spend hours on
the road designed to fit on the back of
the car headrest the air bubble works by
drawing polluted air circulating inside
the car into the unit before our
proprietary filtration technology
removes gaseous particles bacteria dust
and odors clean air is then released
back to the driver and passengers in the
most efficient way possible using
advanced air flow dynamics what we
breathe matters and iLabs some mission
to reduce people's exposure to air
pollution like noise parents are always
conscious to avoid the high levels of
air pollution found on busy roads what I
hadn't realized is the levels of harmful
nitrogen dioxide can be even higher
inside our cars
our research is a real wake-up call as I
realize the impact this could have on
the house of my son and of other
children at our labs knowing we had the
only proven technology to effectively
remove nitrogen dioxide I knew it was
our duty so that the air bubble giving
people the power to protect themselves
and their families the air bubble has
been designed by our team of atmospheric
chemists and airflow engineers at air
labs in our research laboratory here in
Copenhagen it uses our proprietary
filtration technology developed over the
past decade at air labs we specialize in
creating clean air zones for people the
technology inside the air bubble has
proven itself inside of clean air bus
shelters and in a clean air bench
commissioned by Transport for London
during the past year we have focused on
creating a clean air zone inside of a
car and on making the air bubble a
reality we have manufacturers lined up
and with your help we can start
protecting people with the air bubble
early next week we're really excited to
be launching the air bubble and today
we're asking for your support so we can
start making a real difference to
people's lives</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
