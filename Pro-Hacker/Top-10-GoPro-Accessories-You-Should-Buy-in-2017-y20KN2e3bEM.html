thousand of gopro cameras have
revolutionized how we see the world with
a nice wide angle lens from the building
to mount anywhere we can capture the
point of view from truly epic moment or
simply glimpse a radical new perspective
on something familiar the problem is
that they just don't work well in
low-light conditions and any footage at
night underwater or even in shadows
comes out poorly exposed that's why we
want to build a light that can go
wherever your action camera does and
provide the extra light it needs to
capture amazing imagery introducing the
sidekick sidekick is the perfect
companion light for your GoPro it
provides the light the gyro sensor needs
in any condition including deep
underwater the Plus model has two beams
a wide 600 lumens flood which is perfect
for capturing the action and a narrow
400 women spot which is great for
navigation the two button control is
simple and intuitive to use
and speaking of simple and intuitive to
design the light could be factory sealed
no messing with batteries or doors just
slip on the external charger plug into
USB and full charge can be accomplished
in just over four hours great lights not
enough
that's the mount securely with your
GoPro which is why we designed a very
simple mount you place the standard nut
with the extender nut mount your GoPro
as always use our longer finger screw
add friction washer and screw directly
into your sidekick
tighten
adjust and turn on your ready to go it
secure on helmet like bar or grip
additional mounting option include a
lock line system which allows you to
mount the light directly over to camera

piece of aluminum the two button and
single button designs are complete
currently the rear cover is machines in

to a thermal plate which transfers the
heat away from the LEDs and into the
