meets canary the world's first smart
home security device for everyone canary
is truly the world's first consumer
security products it's designed to
completely simplify their connection to
your home most of us either have no
security in our homes or if we do have
security we never turn it on its to get
security today is either way too
complicated too expensive for most cases
both our team came together with one
clear mission change the way we think
about security and connectivity in our
home and makes something that's
affordable and intuitive for anyone what
kind of experience can we create for
people so the experience is driving the
product the technology enables it
what we created is canary it's an
impressive little device that contains
the perfect combination of sensors to
make your home smarter and safer an HD
camera high quality microphone
temperature night vision motion
detection and more we design canary to
be as simple as possible literally you
just plug it in and it work the device
intelligently analyzes sensor data and
sends you alerts when something doesn't
seem right empowering you to take action
when you're traveling canary makes it
easy for you to check in and ensure that
your family and your pets and your
belongings are safe canary turns your
home into a quantified home because the
more you measure the more you learn the
better you can improve and respond
whether you put canary in a nursery in
your home or to watch over your pet or
in your office being there now is a
luxury we can't always afford until now
we've been working on our prototypes for
over a year I need your support to cover
cooling and manufacturing costs so we
can bring canary to market we want to
help everyone be connected to their home
and protect the people pets and things
they care about the most so join us a
router a device that lies forgotten
somewhere in a tangle of cables on the
floor or in a cupboard working hard 24-7
you the user
wait a moment that's not you this is you
you are no stranger to technology the
internet is your bread and butter you
pay attention to security you download
all the operating system updates
regularly scan your drives with an
anti-virus program and even clean up the
icons on your desktop but do you do the
same with your router a typical home
router run software that is often out of
date the moment you first turn it on do
you realize how incredibly long it takes
for a router to get to your home it may
be a full year this is an attacker he
can control the outdated router and
redirect you to a completely different
address so when you login to your
internet banking you may not be on your
bank's website at all data your
credentials and real money you can lose
it all because of your router but we
said enough and developed a tourist
omnia router a router different from all
the others it's actually much more than
just a router ok we only have two
prototypes for now
our router is different first of all
it's safe it's supplied with the Torres
OS operating system custom-designed open
source software based on the open wrt
project the software continuously
developed and improved its supplied with
an automatic update system when a
security threat has identified the
tourist development team creates an
update that the router immediately
downloads second it's high performance
it can handle up to 1 gigabit per second
traffic without any trouble and high
performance is not just about throughput
file-sharing VPN etc will be much faster
than with a conventional router third
it's an open system the entire device is
open hardware and the operating system
is open source with full documentation
available on the project website and
because it is based on open wrt there
are hundreds of additional programs that
can be installed
you can connect an external drive to
omnia and use the router as a quick
backup server DLNA server shared
repository or interim data storage you
can also add a TV BTW tuner or a sound
card the router even includes a built-in
virtual server for your own project if
you are a hardcore internet addicts you
can also get an LTE modem and set up a
backup connection that Torres omnia will
automatically fall back on whenever the
main connection fails and if you care
about internet security our servers run
honeypot simulating a vulnerable system
you can lure attackers with honey and
watch as the tables are turned and they
start drowning in it thanks to the
extension connector you can with some
efforts also check on your boiler
monitor electricity consumption in your
home or control the watering of your
garden the only limit is your
imagination here at seasoning we are no
newcomers to IT after all we administer
an Internet top-level domain we do
several other great projects for example
or routing demon self as a router server
in more than two-thirds of internet
exchange point worldwide a few years ago
we launched the non-profit research
project tourists and we created a pearl
generation of a rancher because the
diamond was an AMA and the number of
rows is limited we decided to July our
new hardware experience to make
something for everyone to take home
manufacturing hardware is expensive and
can be done without your support but we
don't want anything for sweet your
reward will be breaking in to resume
near relative
once we finish them of course Taurus
omnia more than just a router an open
source center for your home fear is
pretty awesome and we all know that beer
tastes best freshen this hat with the
perfect amount of carbonation and
texture but in order to reach the masses
fear is sold in cans and bottles
worldwide and unfortunately for us beer
lovers it just doesn't taste as good as
it does freshen the text until now
introducing wait time wait tab has been
developed to deliver that fresh from the
tap experience no matter where you are
whether you're at the barbecue dinner
party sporting event or camping trip or
whatever you enjoy here wave caps
delivers the best possible beer drinking
experience with our patented vision
technology when you pull the cap handle
towards the beer is poured under
pressure to maintain the carbonation the
bodies of you and when you push the
handle backwards the beer passes through
our sonic oscillator which creates an
ideal density film that provides the
rich smooth full-body texture of an
authentic draft beer we don't use any
gas chemicals are added it just awful
science and a passion for making beer
taste the way the brewmasters intended
last year we introduced our first
generation products to the market
through crowdfunding and the response
was overwhelming not only we found an
audience for our product but we also
found a community of people who are
really passionate about beer the same
way we are since then we built a small
team and have been all over the country
reading which factors customers and
brewers hearing directly from them about
how much and why they love physics with
our new ways have staff your system we
set out to build a more affordable and
affordable design so beer lovers and
beer novices alike can enjoy the flavor
and space of all central draft beer at
home or anywhere we're coming back to
the crowdfunding community with
new product because we want to put it in
the hands of beer lovers who are the
