barriers where things get lost in
translation those tangled cables the
flexibility poor audio quality
introducing click the smartest truly
wireless earbuds with live voice

different languages with the translation

language will no longer stand in the way
of efficient interaction

with your earphone it's amazing quite a
view here the motivations that are
important to you remember to pick up
Charlotte when syncing your smartphone

studio sound through your ears it's
quite incredible
explore the world with no limit yet a
revolution for your ears this thermostat

in millions of homes around the world it
saved billions of kilowatt hours of
energy so far and that's just the
beginning
meet the third generation Nest Learning
Thermostat it has a bigger sharper
screen and it's even better at learning
what you like just turn it up or down it
will catch on after a few days and
create a personalized schedule for you
that's how the nest thermostat saves
energy in real homes with real families
it saved so much energy it's paid for
itself to save even more
just follow the leaf nest even turns
itself down when you leave the house and
you can control it from anywhere
you can see how much energy you use
every day and how to use less energy
companies all over the world are giving

the most beautiful part the Nest
Learning Thermostat programs itself then
pays for itself
keeping our home safe is important to
all of us getting your house broken into
sucks it's not just the stuff that you
lose but because your home feels
violated what you want is to keep it
from happening in the first place
that's why we created Cunha help you
prevent break-ins
this is Cunha Cunha is a smart Wi-Fi
camera built into an elegant outdoor
light fixture it detects people and
alerts you so you can see and talk to
them on your smartphone hey could you
leave the package out front we're a
little busy it's the best way to
actively prevent break-ins most
burglaries are crimes of opportunity the
burglars were actually knock on your
door to see if you're home and when they
realize you're not home they'll attempt
to enter your house keeping them outside
is the most important thing you can do
and koona allows you to do that you can
deter burglars by talking to them or
setting off Kona's alarm yeah no thanks
they'll leave and all this happens when
they're still outside before they even
try to break it making your home safer
it shouldn't be a chore for one of these
you have to climb in the Attic run wires
drill holes it's a pain and it's not
cheap that's why we built Cunha into an
outdoor light just replace your old
light fixture it and use your existing
wiring connect Kona to Wi-Fi and you're
done it'll take 15 minutes
and we want Kona to look good no matter
where it is so we're making it in three
different styles to match your house you
can put kuna anywhere front door back
door even the garage to watch your car
oh and your light gets smarter too you
can control it with the Cunha app turn
it on turn it off set a schedule or just
let it turn on automatically when it
gets dark when there's a person you only
want to get alerts that matter Cunha
ignores trees and small animals and it
recognizes people's behaviors so if you
don't want to know every time your
spouse goes out jogging
you can tell Cunha to alert you only for
visitors waiting at the door and it'll
learn and get smarter over time
there's a peace of mind that comes from
knowing what's happening at your home
whether it's your loved ones or the
delivery guy Clini will always let you
know and if it's someone bad now you can
do something about it kuna stop
break-ins before they happen

air you find in a busy street that is a
huge problem but don't worry we can fix

Voris we have found some really nice
guys for you and a water tank with a
really cute water level indicator

guarantee for success so what are you
waiting for
the world is repotting what about you
then the rose-garden
play the beast he looked as if he was
dying
don't die beast she cried I love you I
will marry you
we all have a bedtime ritual for most of
us it's an effort for clear healthier
skin but then we thought about what
happens afterwards why are we laying our
fresh faces onto a pillowcase that
hasn't been washed in days it turns out
the average pillowcase is a breeding
ground for bacteria in fact studies have
shown that the bacteria found on
pillowcases is no different from that on
a toilet
this bacteria builds up over time and
can be harmful to your skin and overall
well-being
dermatologists recommend washing your
pillowcase every two or three days who
has time for that we sure don't and we
don't know anyone who does introducing
the Silvan pillowcase Silvan provides
you with a clean sleeping surface each
and every night here's how it works
Silvan uses pure natural silver to
prevent bacterial growth on our
pillowcase advanced technology now
allows us to weave silver coated thread
into our fabric these silver threads are
up to 99% effective in controlling
bacteria on your entire pillow case the
average pillowcase continues to
accumulate bacteria over time Silvan
shows a 99% reduction pathogens within
the first hour and continue to prevent
bacterial growth night after night let's
take it back to high school chemistry
silver carries a positive charge and
bacteria is negative the solar is
attracted the bacteria breaks its cell
wall and the bacteria is destroyed
before it has a chance to reproduce
silver occurs naturally in the earth and
it's been used for centuries as a
purifying agent today this technology is
used by healthcare facilities and even
NASA for its antibacterial properties no
harsh chemicals no nanotechnology those
were our guidelines we've partnered with
an american-based antimicrobial
technology company that uses natural
silver to prevent bacterial growth
context
their proprietary process completely
covers advanced fibers and silver while
allowing them to remain extremely soft
flexible and comfortable similar
products use harsh chemical treatments
in their antibacterial effects weakened
over time but because the silver is
woven right into our fabric you will not
wash out or degrade and strain even
after 200 washes or pillowcase will be
just as effective as day one at a
pillowcase isn't much good if it's not
comfortable that's why we combine our
technology with long staples - pima
cotton 100% of this cotton is grown in
the US and it's among the softest most
durable cotton in the world with
holistic skin care and overall
well-being in mind we've created a
pillowcase that's part of the solution
not the problem we wanted to bring
textile innovations to the bedroom and
believe that Silvan is a product that
everyone can benefit from the average
pillowcase is swarming with bacteria and
Silvan keeps bacteria in check no more
sleeping on a dirty pillow case we're a
team of engineers and designers we
believe the fabric you rust on should be
more than just an afterthought we know
from experience what goes into
manufacturing this product we just need
your support to make it happen
our couples trying to conceive women's
basal body temperature is a key
indicator fertility basal temperature is
the lowest temperature your body reaches
while resting and the differences over
the course of the ovarian cycle reveal
when you're most fertile in the past
tracking your basal temperature has been
a challenge many women find it
frustrating and tiring we wanted to make
the process of tracking BBT data
seamless so we created Yo no Yo no is a
revolutionary patent-pending wearable
thermometer it measures and records your
core body temperature while you sleep
giving your true basal temperature
meaning that the data is more accurate
than any other method
unlike underarm sensors which can easily
be affected by ambient temperature and
other external factors
Yano creates an enclosed and controlled
environment in the ear canal preventing
external factors from affecting the
measurement it's designed by top human
factor designers with comfort in mind
soft silicone surrounds the exterior so
the device will fit snugly in your ear
without feeling invasive Yano doesn't
transmit data during your sleep to
protect you from emissions in the
morning the data will conveniently sync
with your phone with a user-friendly yo
no app will keep a running log of your
ovulation calendar you don't even need
to think about it the app and algorithm
interprets your ovulation cycle and
predicts when you're most likely to
conceive with Yo no tracking your
fertility is as natural as your desire
to be a mother
women find it very challenging to
measure their basal body temperature
they have to measure it exactly the same
time every day you know is a very
convenient device you simply place the
device in your ear you go to sleep you
wake up and you take it out all the data
is automatically
did in the cloud for you the euro
product has many benefits you can not
only use it to detect your basal body
temperature and predict your ovulation
but you can also use it to understand
your hormonal health and use it for
family planning
Yano is a company that is founded by
female entrepreneurs these women know
and really care about female health when
I was trying to get pregnant a couple of
years ago I found the process very
stressful and I found collecting basal
temperature data is very difficult and
frustrating so I thought about
leveraging the latest most innovative
wearable technology to make the process
easier and more convenient take the next
step towards building your family and
have Yano start tracking your fertility

inspired by the concept of travel is
transition and transformation the floaty
suitcase
is both beautiful and extremely
functional by combining spear materials
innovative features and the unix time I
don't care if it's for business or
vacation I usually put my handbag on top
of the suitcase and try to hold it
together with the suitcase handle but it
always sticks down the floaty handbag
docking is designed to carry bags and
coats of any size and shape the
retractable strap and recess top surface
help to hold your items securely no
matter how you move the toughest
suitcase and this release it from the
stress of all the multiple items at the
same time I was using a four wheeled
suitcase that sometimes got pretty drag
in the road and the noise embarrass me a
lot but with the new floaty wheels
things got a lot better
floaty is the world's first suitcase
with innovative suspension system
features a smooth maneuverability for
both pushing and pulling motion impacts
and vibrations are absorbed and
neutralized a custom-designed humble
offering a great handling even on bumpy
surface
I used my phone when I'm walking with my
suitcase but it can be a bit annoying
the smart handle is immediate as some
free access to your faith may cause
large maps and send messages just by
tapping just as happens it is designed
to help you focus oh we're going I
travel with my laptop tablet and of

wallet in the hotel but luckily they
called me back to pick it up you will
never lose your belongings with floaty

and sometimes we let you pass sometimes
now how cool and understated the
buildings can choose the weight of your
luggage oh I know how much I have a
skill I'm sure I can fasten those
pouches onto the lining so that
everything in my suitcase stays clean
tidy and well organized the concept of
transition is in the variety of
materials the outer shell made by Cote
polycarbonate with recess aluminum
insert make the floaty suitcase
extremely durable and lightweight

standout a suitcase for me is more than
just a case that carries stuff from
place to place it's pretty like a big
handbag it's very important for me how
it feels how it looks how it smells it's
part of my look and the most important
part of the suitcase
the handle because that's the part that
I touched the most
