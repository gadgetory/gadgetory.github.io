down
you
your kids on the one hand you know they
have tremendous potential and you're
confident they'll have an incredible job
in a developing market on the other hand
they can enjoy eating an entire tube of
toothpaste when getting them a new toy
you want it to be fun because they're
just kids but you also want to develop
their more intellectual side because
they can't really eat paste for a living
meat algal bricks smart coating blocks
that teach your kids actual coding it's
a simple concept choose and build a
robot code it to do nearly anything then
press play and watch it go here's what's
special about algal bricks while there
are many stem products the teacher kid
to think analytically algebra does more
than that it teaches your kids how to
actually code to code a robot your kid
uses two types of bricks functions and
parameters just like in code their
function box for sound movement and
lights stacking parameters on top of
functions creates the different actions
big parameters for small children and
small ones for more complex commands
here's a line of code that will make the
Algol cannon play music moves straight
then spin right while blinking its eyes
and blue and red lights then shoot balls
for six seconds here's how that line
will look in real code Algol breaks even
helps your kids debug the record by
lighting up what's currently running
want to make it even more interesting
add sensors to the bots to respond to
sound touch distance and life and it all
connects to an Arduino array with all
these options the possibilities are
endless here's an algo bot that takes a
bite every time you clap your hands and
this Ferris wheel starts spinning when
you open its door
you don't have to invent your own
activities algal bricks comes with
various activity boards and activity
cards that will leave your kids step by
step on the path to becoming a coder
once your kid masters algal bricks the
transition to real code is a cinch
all you need to do is sit back watch
your kids expand their minds and then
clean up the carpet because after all
they're still kids
now that sounds great but you've heard
about stuff like this before and you
know what happens you buy a new toy your
kids get excited then five minutes later
they're back on their tablet not with
alkyl breaks algal breaks is compatible
with Lego bricks
remember when you were kid and couldn't
stop playing with them now imagine if
you could make anything you created make
sounds light up and come to life algal
bricks was created by two people Amir
and Dan both obsessed with education
through games danny has a PhD in
robotics and the mir is an education
tech entrepreneur and founder of young
engineers an educational network that
teaches stem in over 40 countries
worldwide together they want to take
coding education to a whole new level so
if you want to bring out your kids full
potential and teach them how to actually
code get out go rigs your kids will have
an incredible time and a bright future
