breathalyzer that fits your lifestyle
simply remove the cap plug drink made
into your Android phone and follow the
instructions on the free app drink mate
is powered entirely by your phone so you
never need to worry about replacing
batteries after a few seconds to warm up
and stabilize drink mate is ready to use
whoa for around 4 seconds and seat your
blood alcohol content BAC immediately
displayed on your phone
looks like I'm sober well see there's a
problem with breathalyzers right now
they're getting more accurate but people
are making just as many poor decisions
like driving ordering one drink too many
or calling that X they said they'd never
speak to again we believe in the concept
of social safety what's the most
powerful motivator in existence peer
pressure why not turn peer pressure into
a positive outcome drink mate is perfect
- this using drink mate is fun but at
the same time would you really let your
friend make a bad decision after blowing
a high number we don't think so
we focused our hardware design on
decreasing the cost and size of German
we wanted to create a breathalyzer that
was truly inexpensive convenient and
encourage sharing be gone the stigma of
bulky breathalyzers that require
frequent battery swaps
recalibrations and gross mouthpieces
size was a priority and drink nice
design nobody wants to add more bulk to
what they take with them on the gun you
have a chapstick on your desk drink made
is smaller have a double a battery lying
around drink made is smaller join us in
having fun while being safe drink me
it's always got your back
so we're all born with the pristine skin
maybe bottom skin but as we go through
life being in the Sun exposed to
different chemicals and pollution things
we eat toxins our body's ability to
repair itself isn't quite to the job
that often can develop into skin
malignancies given that the skin is one
of the most exposed organs it's the
biggest organ in our body each year more
people get skin cancer from the Sun and
then get lung cancer from smoking
cigarettes one American dies every hour
from melanoma and is one of the only
cancers the United States that still has
an increasing incidence but there's good
news unlike most cancers it is possible
to detect and treat skin cancer up to
95% of skin cancer deaths are
preventable by early action our mission
is to end all preventable skin cancer
deaths and it is possible that's why
we've created
so the hood is a polarized magnifying
lens that attaches to any smartphone
camera once attached it allows you to
take medical-grade images of your molds
together with our app you can track your
moles your skin cancer warning signs and
even share the images with the
dermatologists it's now instead of
waiting weeks having an uncertainty and
concern about your own health
you can answer back within hours it
gives you not only peace of mind but you
get a prioritized dermatologist
appointment instead of waiting on three
weeks where you go through a family
doctor and then two dermatologists the
dermatologist will tell you hey come
straight into my office and I'll get
removed for you right away so for the
past 15 years we've worked hard at
developing the most capable medical
grade devices for dermatologists now
with houd we have created a device
specifically for consumers that has been
designed to be friendly accessible
intuitive we really want to eradicate
skin cancer and I believe this is our
best shot with your help our vision is
to add the dramatic scope to the family
of medical tools we keep in the home
with hood skin cancer could become a
thing of the past and we can spend less
time worrying and more time enjoying the
things we love
from the beginning the challenge was to
make a simple elegant protective case
for your phone that encapsulates
mounting capabilities without
sacrificing any thickness or way mag
back case accomplishes we also design
maxtv an ultra-thin minimalist magnetic
stick that can be adhered to any surface
to mount your phone because the case and
mastic are aligned perfectly with each
other mounting your phone feels magical
the small profile and beautiful finish
allow mexic to blend into the background
when you bring the phone close the
magnets pull and secure the phone in
place and it's just as easy to take off
but what we really love about it is that
is so simple and the complex layers are
invisible madman is the world's thinnest
mounting solution for your iPhone
so how do we accomplish this to make mac
vac extremely thin we design custom
shaped magnets we placed them so that
they do not interfere with any other
functions of the phone
LTE compass GPS and Wi-Fi work with no
issues the case itself is made out of
three layers that deliver great
protection in case of a drop yet it is
just over one millimeter thin and of
course it comes in a variety of
beautiful colors the mastic has an
elegant metallic finish that will look
great on any surface it has three rare
earth magnets that are super strong and
allow your phone to mount portrait or
landscape I've been using a perfect for
several months now
and it works great our previous project
knock-back for ipad was a great success
and our backers loved it
we also learned a lot or working on it
we took all those learnings and apply
them here we've finalized our designs
and have vendors ready to gets very good
production here's where you come in your
pledge will help us take the last step
and bringing that back to market we will
love to share this product with you
be one of the first to experiences

exciting and interesting thing now I've
put a lot of thought and research into
ways of seeing small and delicate things
with the naked eye as you can see

heavy and they can only be used in
certain places but now the perfect
microscope has been invented let me

can enlarge the target by up to 400
times its original size the nurugo
microscope not only can it be use for
research and education but it can also
be utilized in fields that require a
microscope such as work and everyday
lives the two key factors for producing
the high-resolution image are the lens

enlarging the target by up to 400 times
its original size and this lighting
