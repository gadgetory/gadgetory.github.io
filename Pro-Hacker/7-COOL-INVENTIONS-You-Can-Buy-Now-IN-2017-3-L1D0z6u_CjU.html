modules will always work with you from
the first idea it took us about two
years to arrive where we are now

brainstorming cases that allowed you to
add one new feature to your phone and we
thought why not make one case that
allows for many features that you can
customize your life now we have an
experienced team with members spread
across the world all bonded together
through our passion for next pack we've
been working around the clock to
collaborate on each other's timezone and
get our advice to where it is today
we are currently working on additional
modules for the near future but even
more importantly we are building a
community for developers to thrive and
meet the needs and wants of next paga
users think about an app store for
modules that can enhance your phone
whenever we show it to someone we get
some crazy ideas for future modules what
about a tiny lip gloss or a little blush
