history of the kitchen if you reach for
the faucet to turn it on with your dirty
hand you're going to end up with a dirty
hand when you turn it off after washing
so why bother washing hands at all
introducing Auto water pro a smart
touchless device that operates the
faucet hands-free with simple swiping
hand gestures you may turn the faucet on
or off and control the flow of water
ants free eliminates the possibility of
contamination meaning auto water pro can
ensure a truly healthy germ free hand
washing experience but that's not all
the activated carbon fiber composite
filter purifies 100% of the contaminants
at a molecular level ensuring the purity
and potability of every single drop of
water it offers the highest level of
chlorine absorption while making zero
compromise in water flow Auto water pro
comes in two different setups one for
the kitchen and one for the bathroom
with six different connectors available
and a simple clicking installation auto
water pro works with just about any
faucet in the world it's not just a
powerful gadget that provides
convenience it represents a way of life
simpler safer smarter auto water pro I
think we can all agree that we're living
in the future right now Jennifer Haines
has a smartphone that enables her to
auto ride home control the temperature
turn on the lights - face it we're
living in a technological Wonderland and
yet here we find fill pools forgotten
the combination of his travel lock is
the current solution to that problem
we live in an era filled with
technological marvels and yet this is
what happens when Phil forgets a lock
combination is that the best we can do
no because we live in an era where the
air baltics is the air bolts as a travel
lock you control with your smartphone
it's a lot the future deserves a lock
with customizable security settings this
airball opens whenever my phone is
within Bluetooth range well maybe you
don't trust anyone in your life that's
fine the settings on this airball
require me to went to a password into
the app or maybe your air bolts been
stolen that's fine too because you can
set your air ball to activate an alarm
when it moves too far away from your
phone or you can activate the alarm
manually stop that man
it's the justice the future deserves hi
Bill hi tell them what happened bill I
lost my back you lost your we live in a
world where I can use my smartphone to
model my sleeping patterns but bill here
can't find his bag if bill have been
using the air bolt instead of some
antique you could have located it using
the air box crowd-sourced GPS networks
what if you lose your phone well you can
still unlock your home quite logging in
for another device well you can enter a
backup button code using your hand like
some kind of prehistoric man
the air vault has a rechargeable battery
which only needs to be charged once a
year via a standard microUSB connector
it's TSA approved so Epple security is
not an issue the app will record a
history of every time you've locked and
unlocked your airport you can even share
access to your a vault with your friends
so you'll be able to unlock it from the
other side of the world thanks pal
you're welcome buddy
and look how small it is seriously look
at it it's really small a volt it's the
travel of we all deserve my name is
McKenzie I run Mendocino magic it's a
600-acre campground where we host a lot
of outdoor weddings the one to 360 has
been a really valuable resource for us
because it helps us to create virtual
tours of our property with a street view
style approach and it makes it a lot
easier for potential guests to see what
they're getting into before they get
here being able to click through the
property was huge you know looking at
the 360 video tour just set this place
apart so much using virtual tours in
advance helps set us apart from our
competition in this industry I've been
playing Minecraft a lot for the last
several years and recently I got one of
the new Wonder 360 cameras to help me
with the in-game world design I built
myself a rig where I can just strap it
onto an old bike helmet pairs really
easily to my phone once I'm connected I
can just like take it outside into any
of the environments that I'm finding
interesting by the time I get back the
3d point cloud is waiting for me on my
computer and I can turn that file into a
Minecraft world right away the 103 16
has been really helpful as a tool when
we move into new builds and construction
putting the helmet on I was able to walk
around and make sure I knew exactly what
the designer and the architect were
going to see as well as far as the space
and what we were going to be working
with it was really great about this
project was the property owner handing
at 360 capture where I could see how my
design will fit into the pre-existing
landscape I think that it'll help a lot
with other landowners in the future for
their builds and how they can more
sustainably interact with their spaces
and it'll make a huge difference for us
as we develop more of this property
my name is Trevor I have a travel vlog
and the product that is enabling me to
do what I love the most recently is the
Wonder 360 hey I'm Jack and I've been
riding with a helmet camera for a couple
of years now
and I recently switched from a one
directional camera to a 360 camera and
with this I can see in all directions
everywhere I go in such a Luddite when
it comes to technology especially
cameras this thing's amazing it's super
easy I just pop it down because it's 360
I can make it follow her movements my
name is Zack I think acrobatics in
parkour and I really like the Wonder 360
because it makes it really easy to bring
the camera into class set it down and it
captures the whole room no matter which
way our practice goes and that way I
don't need a whole camera crew in order
to get every part of my run as I go up
and down back and forth I love that I
can live shooting to Facebook and it
stitches the 360 for me automatically it
works with all my old attachments and
it's waterproof love the cool filters
artificial bouquet tilt chip
classic I'm Creek I've been drifting for
nine years and I just started using the
Wonder 360 the fact that the image comes
out of this camera is stabilized and I
don't have to modify the footage when
the computer is outstanding
I've been strapping the Wonder 360 to my
dog Shiloh she's got a huge following on
Instagram her followers really love the
perspective that this camera gives
and in the city where it's a little more
dangerous I've got a record of what
happens if I'm involved in a close call
I can prove it I also love the Phantom
flipper it allows me to capture every
part of emotion and easily analyze
individual aspects of that motion and
really show the students where they need
to improve in practice I love that I can
view and edit that cooks on my phone so
if I'm on a nice ride in the countryside
I can come home and recreate it and show
it to all my friends and the 3d mode is
pretty cool it's really easy to edit on
my phone directly from the app a video
that I actually want to share I love it
how to be twice as smart focus is
something that every one of our stars
most of us don't do as well as we could
we spend a third of our lives focusing
work how well we do depends on it
yeah we neglect it knowing that we
focused is good but it's not enough we
need to begin to understand how our mind
can work better nobody is even thinking
of using the most powerful part of our
mind our subconscious with foci we want
to change that for guys our biometric
wearable for traction subconscious and
helps you tune into deep focus clipped
your waist
the biometry captures your polluted
state it's a stream of colored orbs
inspired by pixels inside out to help
you visualize your mind understand yours
are better this biometrics powers the
ally Mike
the closest thing to a real coach it
picks out mistakes you made and provides
real time advice to optimize your mental
performance you will not only know
exactly when you lose focus but also
access techniques with easy-to-follow
steps to make focus your second nature
we want foci to help you get into what
psychologists call flow a state of deep
focus where your subconscious empowers
you to process information better focus
based on to Bagas you are a spirit of
research which establish how breathing
passes mirrors of quanta States who have
pupils move device that you can clip to
the ways to track your breathing while
you work with machine learning vocalist
your breathing characteristics and the
right personal insight
wrong time to lose your focus
over the last few months we work with
Cambridge enterprises project we are
protested with student s with leukemic
universe
the results are very positive now we
want to share this powerful technology
with everyone we want the Kickstarter
community to help us shape what we are
building as we build it with your
support we can together help people
better understand themselves and tap
into their potential
would you like to improve your race
cycling or mountain biking performance
then let us introduce you to the new and
affordable power meter by IQ square a
power meter tells you exactly when and
where your legs are producing a certain
amount of force it helps you dose during
your write or workout so you can start
outperforming yourself and others power
meters exists in all shapes and sizes at
varying locations on a bike but every
power meter presents a disadvantage and
they're also quite expensive so we
challenged ourselves to decrease the
price while increasing functionality
well since we are attracted ourselves we
wanted to buy a power meter because the
power meter was the thing to have and we
did some research on the different kinds
of parameters and the price point the
high price point would suggest that they
would be perfect and they aren't there
are lots of restrictions and drawbacks
and we didn't buy one but since we are
priority Vella purse we started out with
the question why are they so expensive
and is it possible to make a power meter
that stands out and well it started off
with this question and we had lots of
talks about it and drawings and we ended
up with a parameter which we think meets
all those requirements to design the
perfect power meter we went through
rigorous development we theorized
designed and redesigned to secure the
best tack and product components for
each part of the power meter
so now we are proud to introduce the
first high-tech power meter everyone can
afford it runs on a standard battery and
connects through bluetooth and a and t
plus the adapter is made of light and
strong titanium with a nano structure
strain gauge deposited on the surface
our advanced low pressure molding
technique produces a waterproof casing
and a total product that is very light
here's how it works on the inside when
your leg puts power on the pedal it
causes a miniature banding of the metal
a strain gauge captures this pressure as
a change in electrical resistance which
is measured and simply Center your app
or by computer most power meters measure
the power of one leg IQ square can
measure both so you can see if they're
performing the way you want them to
you can then adapt your training
accordingly of course we've tested our
prototype repeatedly like here on the
direct trainer where we optimized the
power meter to reach consistent and
accurate results we've done everything
we could to create a great turnkey
product so you can instantly start using
it upon delivery installation on your
racer mountain bike is easy you simply
place the adapt in the crank arm and
fasten it with the screw it's connected
to our support app where you can enter
customized bike measurements for a
smooth fit when you've successfully
completed the installation steps the app
pass with the power meter and you're
good to go it's compatible with all apps
software and bicycle computers like
Garmin and Strava so you can use your
trusted devices to immediately begin
training with our products and start
pushing your boundaries
this is an opportunity you can't miss
it's easy to use has great features and
is now ready to be ordered so we are at
this point that we have to go into
production we have some very good
production partners who can make up for
it in a very highly automated production
process which is very important for the
price point of course and we need your
help so please support us so you can
have your own parameter as well
radically improve your performance with
IQ square thank you for backing us
