forgive me let nobody test me I can't
hold my temper I've been cold shoulders
frozen over know my soul December open
up that window
we love cycling it's the best way to get
around town and it keeps you fit and
it's great for the environment but all
too often we hear the sad news of
cyclists getting injured every year over
19,000 cyclists are injured in the UK
alone with 75% of these accidents
occurring at junctions as traffic has
increased Road vehicles have developed
signalling systems to keep them safe and
prevent accidents this is not the case
for bicycles that still use hand signals
not the best way to be safe and secure
unsatisfied by current market offers we
came up with our solution wing lights
wing lights are directional indicators
for bicycles the flash amber at the ends
of your handlebars just like any motor
vehicle they are designed to make sure
that you are seen and stay notice when
it's most needed when turning or
changing lanes in all light and weather
conditions with a single tap they admit
a bright LED amber signal visible by day
and night they are easy to fit once the
mounts are positioned the wing lights
snap on in seconds and when you secure
your bike they snap off and you leave
with them once attached they transform
into a neat keyring with a carabiner to
hang anywhere with multiple usages even
as a hazard light the lightweight
aluminium design makes for a robust
water resistant and durable product that
is both elegant and functional
with agreed-upon o2 we're introducing
the revolutionary new way for digital
artists to interact with our machines
the osu allows artists to free their
left hand from endless numbers have
cumbersome unintuitive keyboard
shortcuts and replaces them with a
single easy-to-use device the strength
of the o2 is in its simplicity its
upright Chronicle design eliminates
complex keys and switches allowing the
user to execute a period of tasks with
small deliberate actions
what makes this possible as the tutored
ring design of the ojou these two rings
move both radially and laterally
allowing them to function simultaneously
as dials joysticks and switches by
linking these three functions with
on-screen functions it allows users to
take full control of and switch
seamlessly between all of their digital
tools this way o 2 allows for users to
individualize imports for different
applications with the ability to save
each cell switching input configurations
across applications is quick

designing the creative world of tomorrow
