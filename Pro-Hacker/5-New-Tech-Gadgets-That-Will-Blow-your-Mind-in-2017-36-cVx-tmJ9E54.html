a world of disposable digital imagery a
cost has been incurred we've lost an
opportunity to physically cherish the
moments we capture what if a digital
image can be given a physical platform
that could return to it all of the
emotion and intention spent during its
creation when I was a kid
I remember being really inspired by
imagery of all kinds at home my parents
had a large-format coffee table books
and I remember cutting out the images
making my own collages and really
participating in you know graphic
content that I found to be very very
inspiring and you know as I got older
and obviously participated in the
digital revolution I wanted to come up
with some kind of physical platform some
kind of product that could be flexible
enough in its design to incorporate
multiple images but display them in a
way that you know is still meaningful
intentional and very artistic so what I
came up with was the lytx lightbox the
lipsticks lightbox is a physical
platform that allows people perhaps even
for the first time to experience the
beauty of their own imagery each one of
your digital images will be converted to
a high-quality print slide which itself
lives in an 8 by 8 by 6 photo box we
provide you with an easy-to-use website
where you can upload your photos choose
a wood finish and ship the lamp directly

out the lit takes photo tile and replace
it with different images whenever you
like

visit our website or use our app you can
purchase new slides and have them sent
directly to your door the lip takes
lightbox is designed to be a subtle yet
artistic addition to any room a
countertop a bedside table even an
office the lid takes lightbox
complements its environment it projects
your life literally develop your photos
develop your ideas develop your life the
green is a completely new generation of
US air meter measures continuously the
body temperature and gives give your old
fever curves and not only one spot
measurement my name is jeiza i'm your
100 here founder of coordinates and
parents of free very cute children
as parents we know how difficult it is
to know what the right thing is to do
when children have the temperature for
example so I try to keep my child warm
but try to cool it down in this very
moment and how effective was my
treatment as skilled engineers and as
parents we put our passion for
perfection to the test and trace it this
revolutionary innovative device which
brings demo methods to the highest
degree it's quite small I think it's not
very heavy it's it's light and very
flexible I think it doesn't disturb the
babies or the children I would recommend
the degree for parents because it's very
minimal in business possibility to check
the temperature so you don't have to
wake up the baby for temperature control
for specially during the night the
advantage of degree is that you can have
a curve of the temperature so that you
can see if the temperature is fallen or
if the temperature is increasing degrees
measuring continuously
the body temperature and sense this
curve to receiving you life like a
smartphone so that for example in the
night you don't have to wake up every
hour and also wake up the child to take
the temperature because the Cree is
simply doing it continuously you can
define thresholds at which you want to
get a warning you also get a warning if
the temperature is too high or right
into that the app also shows you
physicians and pharmacy near to you and
how to contact them yeah we did a lot of
research of the size of the year with
small children with all the children so
we found a solution where we have a
adaption of the device inside and also a
very flexible design so it can be
adapted to nearly every year it's very
comfortable and convenient so to
don't feel the device degree is the
biggest invention in the history of
coordinates we developed this device
because our daughter and I had a
preprocessor these stages are due to
very fast rise in temperature so you
just can't see it's coming when you take
the body temperature once in a while you
need a continuous temperature curve to
see such a seizure coming so we decided
or we starts thinking about developing
career ever continuously fever
centimeter and now here's degree the
next generation thermometer continues
convenient and accurate
hi I'm Krista and I'm Lisa and neither
are kids Declan Cooper Nana like many
parents our kids provide us with
inspiration every day and like all
parents we want to keep them safe we
develop deck for the toddler monitor
after a few shared experiences some
funny but I'm actually really scary
we both had all of a baby here including
audio and video baby monitors but we
found that once our kids were mobile
they were no longer meeting our needs
Declan is an active kid and when I put
him down for a nap I would sometimes
come back to him outside his room gain
up to all sorts of trouble I knew I had
a serious problem when I found the
sprinkler in his bed one morning and
realized he'd gone out into our yard
sometime during the night I'm not a
heavy sleeper yet he'd still flipped
over a house without us knowing this
really scared me I want to always know
that he was where I wanted him to be
safe in his bed oops a little monkey and
started climbing out of his crib around
18 months he was constantly getting into
trouble and still is to this day I worry
when we're traveling it's difficult to
make sure he's safe at his grandma's
house the lake and hotels Kristen I
talked and talked about this challenge
and after some research we realized we
weren't alone this is a problem that
other parents are faced with too there
are hundreds of cases in the news every
year about kids who aren't where their
parents thought they were supposed to be
some of these stories have tragic ends
and we couldn't believe how frequently
this is happening so we decided to solve
the problem ourself by creating dekho
the table monitor a cute and friendly
motion sensor device that is easily set
up and can travel with you and your
family if you will by the inspiration to
keep our kids safe we're very excited to
share him with you and your families
Decco is a motion sensor you hang on the
door hang dekho on your toddler's
bedroom door and set it from the
smartphone using the toddler monitor app
if your toddler tries to leave their
bedroom the device will sense the motion
of the door and send a go to acquittal
to your smartphone you will be notified
by of a toddler monitor app if there is
movement the door and you will know that
your toddler is on the move
Decco hangs on any style of doorknob
it's durable and water-resistant made
from food grade bpa-free material
lightweight and travels well it's
controlled by an iPhone or Android
out the app manages up to three toddler
monitors at once from a single
smartphone the app can also be
controlled by up to three users at once
it uses reliable Bluetooth technology
and has an easily replaceable coin cell
battery we're not saying this will solve
all your time so far from it but it will
give you the peace of mind that comes
with knowing that your child is safe and
sound and where they're supposed to be
Declan towards yes we're almost there
