hi I'm Jason D :
Derr neuroscientist and co-founder of
more es I love helping people improve
their lives and I'm super passionate
about weight loss
I've been over we in the past and I know
how difficult it is to lose weight I
also know how difficult it is to keep
that we at loss going and Laureus we
believe this is much more than just diet
and exercise the source of your weight
loss problem lies deep within your brain
my co-founder is doctor Paul McGill and
a few years ago he made an amazing
discovery our brains have what's called
a set point that controls how much body
fat we have this varies from person to
person which is why two people can eat
the same and one will gain weight while
velor one and the implications of this
are profound a few years ago I realized
that there is a connection between
stimulation of the vestibular nerve just
behind your ear and weight loss I was
working in neurosurgery with Jason at
the time and knew of his interest in
electronics as a hobby from the very
beginning I've been using and developing
the mauryas prototypes on myself within
just one year my body fat had almost
halved and now almost one year later I
still haven't regained any fat this
technology has amazing potential and
we're inviting you to join us at the
Moore Diaz community we want you to be
the first group of people who take part
in the next generation of weight loss mo
Dias is really simple to use just place
it on your head attach the sticky pads
behind your ears turn the headset on and
then control it using the app simple
use mo Deus for just 45 minutes per
session and that's it
and the results well the technology was
tested in overweight volunteers they
didn't change their diet or lifestyle
and received up to three hours of
stimulation a week after four months we
found that all of the volunteers lost
body fat in one case as much as 16%
statistically these results were very
significant we're delighted by these
initial results and actually can't wait
to see how effective moodiest will be
when combined with some lifestyle
changes after five years of clinical
research and many shed pounds we are
finally ready to release modest we are
very excited to see your results and to
help you get there we are offering our
early backers great discounts a complete
12-week package and up to $100 in cash
back in fact we are so confident of
amazing results we are offering a 100%
money-back guarantee at Laureus we
believe this is the next generation of
weight loss technology so join the
moodiest community today and let's get
started in that journey to a happier
healthier you
all great achievements have one small
thing in common a measure because to
measure is to understand and to improve
it's the starting point to human
ingenuity a dimension that drives
progress so enact this precious deserves
respect it deserves accuracy it deserves
the same obsession and love that we
bestow upon the things that result from
it this is the progress that measuring
deserves this is dimensioning hi
we're instrument and we are craftsmen of
product team here has built some really
cool products over the years but today
we're launching something really close
to our heart natural reaction to
modernizing measurements would be to
just add technology to a tape or ruler
but we don't have the same mechanical
constraints and we certainly don't use
them in the same way we can do a heck of
a lot better we build zero one into an
elegant writing instrument 3 to be exact
10 pencil stylus these are things you
likely have in your bag or purse we
built it for designers for architects
for engineers or craftsman makers and
even though simply putting up pictures
we wanted to do want to be honest insert
a measuring instrument but also to
writing instrument to that new one is
balanced and feels natural it's a notion
of Studio City
Tim's path once a month sweating
hundreds of small parts to their feet
finish building tools fixtures or to
enable an experience that's natural you
just go over any one say and that you
can search and share results person
receiving Canadian life change units on
the other end you can actually read
scale drawings and roll it over complex
surfaces and get the length of materials
you can set up a grid or even just get a
rough measure without checking your
phone I really love measuring my niece
addy and seeing the way she's growing
throughout the months you can share it
directly on Facebook it's kind of like
doorframe measurement but for the 21st
century
isn't it we've designed the zero one
engineered it tested it and set up
manufacturing we're days away from being
able to ship but what's more we've
hidden a few gems inside you see zero
one is a dynamically evolving instrument
this is where we need your help over the
next few months the team here will be
creating functionality that will enrich
how we think about dimensioning if you
back us now not only will we ship zero
one in pen pencil and stylus form it
will give us fuel to keep releasing
features that redefine how we capture
and use dimensions and bring them right
to the devices we've shipped back us
today and we'll start shipments December
first it's got your name on it
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
