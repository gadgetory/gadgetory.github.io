really special
he's very close to me even though he's
from far away like the difference from
here to the sky boat on drive in faraway
galaxies but he's amazing today she
collided with the Nashville and ended up
broken into pieces
luckily he managed to survive we're
trying to put it together somehow for
the time being
photon is staying on earth and I've
become his friend I'm showing him what
what how we live here that will handle
at all at first couldn't even move now
he's running around like an adult
and each sheeps developing look an
obstacle we've got that covered already
photon quickly figured out that we
little people love playing the most
sometimes we like to make mess we don't
necessarily like cleaning up as much and
that there are other beings living on
them and by the way he's really happy
what he's able to help how do we
communicate programming control commands
through photonic language photon break
panicking then replace a single
vegetable because thanks to him I know
that there are no black light bulbs
I keep wealthy on me and we gettin
better photon is amazed by the amount of
technology in our lab now we're learning
about it together all of us because you
have to know that my friends got to
befriend photon as well so she loves the
light of his eyes and keep stressing him
up
Ethan keeps on wanting to take me
everywhere and Oliver to teach your new
stuff even our kindergarten teacher says
that photon absorbs everything like a
sponge nah he's a smarty it would be
great if there were more of them feel
more open to going to learn on our

calm
[Laughter]
oh hi Joe
good how are you what are some of the
ways okay so it's a lot of ways it
depends on what's going on I mess with
my hands a lot I do that's a little
snapping just kind of like like that
even though I don't need to fix my hair
it's like one of those things like you
know I'm not trying to be stylish I'm
just kidding I'll catch myself doing it
and I'm like whoa what's going on I was
told it's because my mind is just always
racing I think everybody could do even
if they don't know they yeah no I have
not a fidget spinner
like a salad spinner a few people in my
class loves the fidget cubes the
Frederic is really cool because you just
don't even octal if you just look just
keep squeezing in like polling thing
okay so the goal that's always nice
looks different than their other fidgets
manners I've seen it's hard to describe
a heavier bottle opener maybe oh it's
kind of like a thinner and a cube or
something ones are definitely really
cool it's easier to balance just like a
Center and then it's got some things
that was digit cubes I wonder what these
pads are for I don't know this is very
strange
okay it makes a nice out the clicking
help if that would they like get some
tension out kind of like a stress ball
all I could do it like that there we go
Oh like this ah that rings like so much
simple I didn't think I needed
something like this but now that I've
been using it I could see this being
really useful
we're years old definitely in class
everywhere you know somebody has trouble
paying attention and would fidget in
another way if I'm visiting otherwise
people would really see here is the
secret I feel secure with the weight
just something to hold on to and kind of
play with them something to do with my
hands
kind of comfy no I sit I don't want to
give it up
