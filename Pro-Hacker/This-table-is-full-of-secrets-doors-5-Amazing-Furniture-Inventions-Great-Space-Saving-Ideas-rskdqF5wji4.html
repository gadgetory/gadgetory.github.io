roboticist and founder of rock paper
robot the design and engineering firm
out of Brooklyn we make kinetic
furniture
what's kinetic furniture well it's
basically decor that moves like these
levitating tables or this bouncing one
or our latest ally chair inspired by our
experience living and working in New
York see this is our office but this is
our office the city inspires us informs
us and acts as a constant reminder of
the diversity of people and problems
that we have to consider when we design
plus the responsibilities we feel to not
create Morris come see what we mean
the Olli chair retracts to two inches so
it's ideal for small spaces
at flat packs for transport and we all
know how important that is it's
lightweight so it's easy to move around
valley chair has a built-in lumbar
support so it's super dummy after a long
day on your feet
and because the chair body is made out
of aluminum and the default amber is
made out of teeth it's great for outdoor
environments and because we're fans of
personal expression oli is customizable
the Tambor the flexible slanted seat
part is interchangeable so you can swap
it out to suit your style and just for
our Kickstarter backers we're offering
some limited edition finishes for your
chairs including an awesome silkscreen
by our talented friend Wiz be no extra
space no problem
store your holly chair on the wall like
a work of art and of course the chair is
perfect for home to Holly can be your
primary seating or accommodate your
space for extra guests so storing the
chair might seem like sleight of hand
manufacturing it doesn't take magic it
takes money that's where you come in by
supporting our Kickstarter campaign
you'll be the first to get your butts on
the Ahly chairs but far lower than the
expected retail price and you'll be
supporting a female run manufacturing
company that's wool manufacturing so
thank you from all of us at rock paper
robot support holly and let always
support you and don't forget to share
the chair get yourself the Kickstarter
the size of music in our lives has
changed kind of a weird statement to
think about music used to take up space
a lot of space the players were big
you'd love the round your library in
your trunk you display it in your living
room music is still a huge part of our
lives but it's not as easy to see
anymore until now introducing the
original cassette tape coffee table
modern design with the retro feel
remember your old 70-74 with the in - or
that mixtape that got to your first kiss
how about planning out your whole day
just so you could record Rick Dees
weekly top 40 things like this that
inspired us to save it ace
with the help of my brother five years
ago we started hand building custom
cassette tape tables out of my parents
barn in South Dakota today our tables
have been featured in commercials
red-carpet events TV shows numerous
blogs and on concert stages we sold
tables to customers in 10 different
countries across four continents and you
can pick one up today off of our website
for only $1,700 hold on alright okay so
our $1,700 tables are worth every penny
but the one piece of feedback that we've
gotten over and over is that we need to
make a more affordable model which is
why we're flipping the tape over
so we went back to the drawing board and
figured out a way to make a more
affordable table we built relationships
with top furniture manufacturers and we
lined up suppliers and logistics all
with the goal of being able to provide
everybody that digs a table an
opportunity to buy one at an affordable
price
with the nod to jeff koons our design is
an oversized replica of a classic
mixtape it features a wooden body with
extreme attention to detail everything
is made to scale all the way down to the
tabs on the side stainless steel
cupholders give the table depth the 9
inch deep hidden shelf is perfect for
books remotes magazines or a Bluetooth
speaker steel hairpin legs complement
the retro look and a dry-erase top gives
you the opportunity for unlimited mixes
so our new designs finalized and we've
lined up all the details but to be able
to offer this new low price we need to
order a large quantity of tables this is
where we need your help help us raise
the capital for our first run of tables
by backing our Kickstarter campaign
you're gonna get a really cool piece of
furniture at the lowest price that we've
ever offered that and you're preserving
a little piece of history actually it's
like that oversized piece of history
yeah so make the cassette-tape coffee
table your next coffee table and help us
to get it into as many homes and offices
and studios and dorm rooms as many as it
takes until cassettes are safe in the
memories of humanity forever
save the tapes
they make pencils too small now it
doesn't work this isn't big enough
pencil
this is the sobre coffee table
the sobre is a feature of furniture
designed for your connected lifestyle
with a refrigerator draw Bluetooth
speakers and charging ports the sober it
keeps you powered up and in the moment
the technology has changed over the past
20 years these days were looking for
quick solutions to solve our problems
and ways to simplify our lives this got
us thinking while everything around us
is advanced why hasn't furniture this is
why we designed a soberer coffee table
Furniture reinvented for your modern
lifestyle so burro uses a bluetooth
pairing with its built-in speakers to
provide excellent sound quality
that's cord free you can also set the
mood with the ambient LED lighting
designed with a large refrigerator draw

food chill and always within reach

outlets on the side of the table when
you're done roll up your cords and stash
them in the drawers

have our manufacturing partners in place
