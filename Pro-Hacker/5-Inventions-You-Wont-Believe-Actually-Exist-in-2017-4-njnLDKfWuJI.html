your smartphone but there's so much more
than just wake you up for starters but
he comes with multiple smart buttons
that allow you to control many devices
around your home like the lighting in
your bedroom Betty also includes two USB
ports so you can charge multiple devices
at night the betty has a fully off
feature that totally dented the clock
face so your room is completely dark at
night and since loud noises keep people
up to we also included a white noise
maker that helps peacefully drown out
the loud sounds of your city choose from
settings like rainy night for humming
fan to help you fall asleep but Betty
doesn't just help you go to sleep at
night our sunrise simulator feature
gradually brightens your room in the
morning with soft light gently stirring
you awake five minutes before your alarm
goes and since Betty is connected to
your home we can talk to your Wemo
switch to prepare your coffee 10 minutes
before your alarm goes up or site you're
next so your place is warm and your
coffee is hot and ready for you when you
wake up and more than that rather than a
jarring buzzer alarm sound that he comes
with Spotify integration so you can make
your alarm sound your favorite morning
playroom that he also gives you a quick
glimpse at your local weather so you can
dress appropriately for the day today's
weather is rainy and temperature is 68
degrees and even better Betty integrates
with the maps feature on your phone and
knows your morning commute so that he
will periodically update you in the
morning
to exactly when you need to leave the
work based on your local current traffic
condition you need to leave in 15
minutes and if you're a lover of the
sharing economy like we are we've also
integrated a one-touch uber button into
betty so you can call your google
straight from bed and Betty will inform
you when it arrived Yoga has arrived

product designed to give you and your
elderly family members reassurance and
peace of mind do your elderly parents
live alone but want their own
independence do you want to keep in
touch more regularly and know that
they're okay and more importantly when
they need help my brother i live in
china and my sister lives in manchester
well my mum was in the north of Scotland
and one day my mom had a fall and she
dislocated her shoulder and fractured
her elbow and we were looking around to
find something that could help us
communicate with her or she could
communicate with us in times of need and
we couldn't find anything nothing we
came up with the cow families now lived
further apart than they ever did while
younger people have embraced smart
technology older people can often feel
left on the sidelines so to join bridge
that gap we made the care of the
simplest possible team so we decided to
put as many different types sense than
the care of as possible the care map
contains camera a temperature sensor
motion sensor light sensor microphone
and speaker call button night light and
ambient light LED the installation is
simple basically put the care of down
and plug it in
you'll be able to monitor your home
through the cattle out either on tablet
or smartphone and you'll be able to set
alerts and notifications for many
different types of situations many older
people find great reassurance in regular
contact with loved ones with the care
hub it couldn't be easier mom can push
the button on the top of the unit and
calls go straight through to the end you
pick up and can start to chat so we're
all creatures of habit I'm also when you
get older you like to get up at seven
thirty in the morning we have our
breakfast at eight o'clock with the
newspapers and if that doesn't happen
that could be assignment of something
wrong the care hub will let you know if
there's a break in the routine and
they'll send you love notification on
let you know maybe it's time to call
them in many countries older people run
a serious risk of illness or worse
because their homes reach a critical
temperature the care hub can be sent to
alert you if your parents home has
reached a critical temperature so you
can act quickly some elderly people can
be a little forgetful remind them of
important things by setting an audio
reminder record a message and then set
the x and the frequency for playback to
minimize the risk of nighttime accidents
the care hub has a nightlight built-in
that is activated from the motion sensor
we've been working for the past 12
months on the kalman we've been working
with some of the best engineer we've now
got frozen sighs we're really excited
because I think it's something very
unique and really special we're
confident now that we've got product
that will reach out to the largest
possibly
so what will develop with the cab is
simple 24-7 peace of mind
so please connect with this campaign so
we can all keep connected we spend about
ninety percent of our time indoors and
the air we breathe in here is two to
five times more polluted than outdoors
imagine all the chemicals dust and toxic
gases trapped in a room nowhere to go
and the worst part is we do nothing
about it simply because you don't know
you who is a smart indoor air quality
sensor that detects and alerts you of
allergens and toxins in the air you
breathe think of the place of you and
your loved ones spend the most time in
do you know the quality of the air in
your office at work in your hotel room
when you travel how about in your own
living room or your child's bedroom
these are important because VOCs are
found in paint and household cleaning
products dust can accumulate unseen and
fabric around us and humidity encourages
the growth of bacteria and mold all
these cause respiratory problems skin
irritations and overall poor health in
the long you who let you know when
something's not right and what you can
do the simplest and easiest things to do
make the biggest difference cut down on
chemical cleaners wash your child's
favorite toy air out your living area
and check on possible gas leak don't
leave it to chance or guesswork you who
keeps track of the air you breathe
round-the-clock so that you and your
loved ones get to live work and play in
the best and safest possible environment
it is the most comprehensive indoor air
quality detector on the market today
with eight dedicated sensors that detect
volatile organic compounds does carbon
monoxide carbon dioxide ozone air
pressure temperature and humidity hi I'm
busted co-founder of using there's a
very simple reason why we created using
is there's a real need for the air we
breathe that's Oliver why do you spend
so much energy and money on nutrients
and supplements and yet ignore the air
that you breathe we spoke to lemurs
professionals who are otherwise healthy
for almost 15 encouraged from asthma
sufferers we have persistent symptoms
and travellers fall ill because the air
quality in their hotel rooms are not an
optimal level we also heard from parents
who always worried about what their kids
are supposed to work at home and in
school and the thing is we can fix what
we don't know and there has never been
an easy and affordable way to find out
until now with you who your role just
got a little safer and you and your
family just got held
