getting the shots you're looking for can
be a real challenge in and of itself
keeping those videos stable layer you
can really make a breakout to create an
excellent film we have to keep the
camera steady and smooth and snow but we
hope to help videographer realize their
visions regardless whether or not they
have a huge improvement all the
equipment for just a one-man operation
we want to give creators freedom of
movement without losing quality or
stability so we created the kyln app the
kyln
M is an innovative and portable 3-axis
stabilized gimbal with it you can take
mirrorless cameras action cameras or
your cell phone virtually anywhere and
capture smoothly the video at nearly any
the kyln M was designed for
videographers to help them catch the
perfect moment without the need for
commercial equipment the kyln M Ellis
Nova's multi axis stabilization system
he can easily eliminate all camera shake
making your videos look professional and
clear it is all about filming freedom we
wanted the kind of em to me an extension
of the camera itself new algorithm was
paired with the brand's new closed-loop
control structure that she was a quick
response time of 16 milliseconds
this results in high accuracy
stabilization and smooth controls we
know that Gumbo's can be heavy and
recording on them for extended amounts
of time and get tiresome so we designed
the handle to rotate the whole setup we
held at a low angle Canary position
switching modes is easy and the
innovative design allows you to get your
shot in the matter the situation
Cullinan is requite with 83 one-hour
replaceable battery and has at least 12
hours runtime the kyln end has a
universal mount which can perfectly fit
a variety of lightweight cameras
including mirrorless cameras smartphones
and action cameras we both west into the
mounting plate and handle allowing from
multiple attachments and with this
aluminum body you can take it anywhere
without worrying zoom angle shutter
controls or recording can be controlled
right from the handle
the kyln M was designed to handle a
range of camera accessories on a handle
from gimbal is a port that can work with
anything from a transmitter for a remote
monitor of different types who are
absolute ilene hamann controlled
wirelessly and even charge your camera
