locating device it's tiny so you can
stick it on your kids your pets your
bike your luggage or anything important
you don't want to lose it can be found
miles away and lasts up to five months
on a single charge there are a lot of
tracking devices out there that are
supposed to make it easy to find things
so most of us aren't using them why
because Bluetooth devices only work
within 35 feet of your phone you can't
find your kids if they're playing
outside or your luggage if it's lost
halfway across the country and these GPS
devices which have a much larger range
are big clunky need to be constantly
recharged and have large monthly fees
ping is reinventing the locating device
Bluetooth cellular and GPS for maximum
range extremely long battery life
waterproof and durable all together in a
tiny affordable versatile solution one
more thing ping is the only device with
a little check-in button that lets your
kids send their locations to friends or
family with a simple push and if they're
in trouble they can hold that button
down to send you a distress signal so
that health can be contacted ping is the
first truly useful affordable and simple
personal GPS locator
we believe the technology should be
seamless and it should give you more
from the experience if you will our
technology fundamentally enhances
also down turn left in 20 miles
that's the new evolution of the stores
yet
I think it's a hot that feels like
tomorrow it really really does it feels
like some more you've taken all the
collect Ronix out of dudes they're
high-tech cars and just put it right
here honestly it changed everything when
you put on the Scully helmet you get an
essentially an ecosystem the tuition
charity association with much work we
then suddenly get a level of innovation
and she had been photographed being a
professional motorcycle racer takes a
lot of fun away from right from riding
on the students but this could make a
pun again it will make your writing
safer with its high speed microprocessor
and operating system it's the smartest
motorcycle helmet ever imagined Scully
is the teacher
join the revolution
you
one of the problems with the current
medical system is that you only connect
with the system every now and then we
are in the biggest tsunami of
personalisation in the world but for
medicine we are still waiting in line in
an emergency room with your smartphone
you can find out about anything anywhere
but what you can't find is information
about your own body in 2005 I spent
almost a year in hospital with one of my
children I started to look at all the
machines and all the leaders after a
couple of weeks I understood it and it
was liberating to have that knowledge I
want to make a company that you know
gives people these numbers the Scout
will allow people to see the fingerprint
of their health in very minut detail
when you have a visit with a physician
or you go to an ER the first thing they
do is check the vital signs to see where
you're at right now
this is hold it here forehead in a
second you have all of it the Scout
gives you your heart rate blood pressure
your temperature your respiratory rate
and your oxygen levels in your blood
it's kind of the Scout works everywhere
it analyzes all your readings and then
sort of seen when people have a scout
they can connect with their physician
and ways it was never possible before we
are competing in the XPrize this is
important because what we aim to do with
Canada scalp is to bring the five senses
into a single recording device we will
have essentially a doctor in the family
and this is the ultimate consumer device
or medicine we put a lot of thought into
giving you medical grade data that's
easy to understand recorded and enables
you to communicate with your physician
and make smart decisions together
we have a relationship with NASA
although their medicine was never
actually destined to be for consumers it
was listened to be for astronauts in
space station this is exactly the kind
of responsive platform that we need this
allows us to go further and enhance our
performance right now when you buy a cup
of coffee you can see that transaction
on your smartphone even before you leave
the store with the Scout you can see the
impact on your health before you
story super parent you can find out
early in the day if your child is going
to be sick later there it's something
that's good for all of us this is one of
those exciting times from the history of
medicine and the history of health we
can finally understand our bodies and
adjust them in ways that it's never been
possible before but that takes all of us
working together so join us in making
this reality I used to love biking as a
kid but as a kid you have lots of energy
you're eating a lot of sugar as you get
older people tend to ride their bikes
less and less often one of the reasons
being that they have to go to work they
have to do things where they don't want
to be arriving to their destination
sweaty with electric bikes you not only
have the advantage of being able to
arrive to your destination in a more
composed manner but you're also able to
extend the range of where you want to
travel so instead of maybe having to
take your vehicle somewhere now you can
easily take your electric bike there my
name is Oscar stark I'm an engineer and
I've been working with in the renewable
energy field for the last several years
once the inception of electric bikes
came around I got really interested in
having electric bike myself one of the
things that was holding me back from
owning one was the fact that they were
so expensive so I started investigating
why do they cost thousands of dollars
and we actually couldn't find anything
that made electric bikes really
expensive except for the battery packs
that were available at the time this is
why we came upon to build an electric
bike for the masses that was affordable
and with my team we were able to find a
factory that was willing to produce the
electric bikes for us at a price that
was almost unbelievable one of the
things that I've noticed in the electric
bike market is these bikes look really
electric they have these big ugly
batteries attached to them we wanted to
make it look like a normal bicycle plus
we wanted to have an electric bike where
you are able to secure it in such a way
that it would be impossible for someone
to steal your electric bike
what we've done here with the electric
bike is you have your options you can
either go with the throttle meaning that
you don't have to pedal whatsoever and
you can get to your destination without
having to worry about being sweaty or
being warm but if you're looking to
exercise you can adjust the assist mode
that comes with the bicycle so the
lowest one providing you very little
assist that you can still get a bit of a
workout and would be highest one you're
almost making no effort as long as
you're pedaling another thing that we
discovered is by the time that you do
get an electric bike to your door that
electric bike has actually gone through
several different middlemen so something
that you know might have costs 20 or 30
dollars for example ends up costing you
200 or 300 dollars when it gets your
door our goal with this campaign is to
really launch electric bikes into the
mainstream so that anyone that was
interested in getting electric bike
really the cost should no longer be a
factor for them it's the same thing with
the cell phone revolution anyone with a
flip phone nowadays they would have that
more as a retro fashion accessory
everyone else has a smartphone and if
you don't have a smartphone the question
is why this is the same kind of thing
that we're looking to achieve with our
Stark Drive electric bikes everyone
should have an electric bike and if you
don't have an electric bike that's fine
you want to be retro and you want to
live in the past that's really cool but
ultimately you're probably going to have
that retro bike for the weekends and
then when you're out going to work
you're going to be using an electric
bike
price class started in early 2015 with
the idea of making cyclists safer on the
road and more noticeable basically the
bright spots to removable handlebar
grips have lights and indicators on the
eureka moment came one night when I was
sitting with a friend having dinner and
I think that day I'd been gladdens
working nearly had a collision with a
cyclist to jump a light and I was just
like why didn't he indicate from saying
why didn't indicate I said why don't we
have indicators on his bicycle and from
there it all lid on why didn t ever
depends on this bicycle at night you
can't even see them why don't you pull
lights on his bike why are they either
side and then I can tell the width of
the bicycle and gradually I knew I was
onto something so two years down the
line here we are we've had a lot of
prototypes a lot of designing but we've
got what we finally one life spark has
many useful elements first one being the
colobus on the end of the grip this
locks onto your bike and plays there
quite simply it's there so that when you
park up your bike you can remove the
bright spark stick it in your bag and
it's secure no one's going to steal it
when your bikes plug we also have the
indicator which is operated with your
thumb it's a button that you simply hold
down upon are four seconds your
indicators will shine front and back as
well as the laser indicating onto the
ground so that people 360 degrees around
uses seeds that you're indicating rather
than just the people directing while
you're indicating your handlebar will
vibrate to remind you that be indicated
on there's nothing worse than a fact
cycling down a straight road indicating
when the Millhouse returning anywhere
where the cyclist index finger is is a
button for the light it has four
settings which is 75 limb in 150 300 and
300 stroke and it's a simple push to go
through the cycle at the back of the
bike sparkle is a bun and inside there's
a microUSB port which is suspend for
charging up most things then the battery
life if you use it on the highest it
will last about find out so the
summarized using device class could only
be a good thing to have indicators day
and night where you don't have to take
your hand off the handlebars it's don't
want to you can keep them on there and
certainly at night when likely the
harder to be seen having to headlights
will always be a benefit to having one
and hopefully it will create more
harmony on the road for all road users
we need to raise 85,000 pounds to create
bright spark we need to manufacture our
first batch and pay for tooling we want
you to become a part of the cycling
revolution that makes bright sparks as
common as cycling helmets on traction

hi I'm John and I invented my phone
the grab-and-go booster see this is a
regular car booster seat and this is my
phone my fault is the most advanced
compact and portable booster seat in the
world it's more than ten times smaller
than a regular booster and it's just as
safe
how's that possible well a regular
booster seat lifts a child to be in the
position of an adult my soul does the
exact opposite instead of lifting the
child up it holds the seat belt down
it's that simple
my fold is engineered to protect
children from the age of four all the
way up to 12 the patented design takes
the seat belt off the stomach and the
neck making it comfortable safe and easy
to use
car loads of kids and parents already
tried and they love it when it comes to
car seats for children safety is the
number one priority it's crucial for us
to meet the highest regulatory standards
and we've crash tested prototypes
successfully in testing facilities all
around the world now people often ask me
John where did the idea come from so let
me tell you some stories about when my
four kids were little
guys come on when you were little thank
you carpooling with a big part of our
lives we always had boosted for our own
kids so not for the extras that came
along Michael is so small that kids can
keep one with them
all the time when my parents visited we
always have to juggle pokey booster
seats from castor car my fold is so
compact you can store one almost
anywhere and my fold is narrow so you
can easily put three in a row even in
the smallest car do you live in a big
city how often do you jump in a taxi
they never have a booster seat and
that's not safe and hey by the way that
is not a taxi
thank you last time you rented a car you
probably paid an additional $40 to rent
the booster that's more than my fault
cost and ours isn't covered in another
kid's dinner or were my fault easy to
keep clean you can even put it in the
dishwasher so I saw if I could make a
booster that's mighty small and mighty
strong when you could take with you
everywhere then children could always be
safe no matter whose car they're in
using super tough plastic polymers an
aircraft grade aluminium top designers
engineers and industry experts together
we've created my fold the most advanced
compact and portable safety seat
ever invented and we can't wait to start
getting my fold into the hands and the
bags of children all over the world
pre-order your might fold now at my fold
calm soon we'll all be ready to grab and
go thank you
you
