SmartWatch
for gamers game band atari edition which
the action right on your wrist with
watch optimized version of classic Atari
game but game band hardware is far from
retro a methide game band we put
unelected to play critical care we put
the Qualcomm Snapdragon 2100 processes
Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.2 the Snapdragon
wear 2100 takes on everything that you
need to have in a wearable processor
it's 30% smaller than its predecessor
it's 25% more power efficient extending

our team pioneered this concept back in
2015 when we helped create a hugely
popular minecraft wearable we know what
it takes to build a great SmartWatch
that you'll want to wear every day I've
been designing wearable over a decade
where will is a very difficult space to
design within it needs to fit on the
person and be comfortable to wear
waterproof
shockproof so we designed this product
using the best thing cost construction
approaches from the watchmaking industry
really what we were trying to do was to
create a physical device something that
exists in the real world that feels like
it could exist in any number of these
sort of magical and mysterious
Wonderland that we see an experience in
every kind of game well I'm really
excited about gameband in part because
I'm a game and this is a product made
for me of course it's a full-featured
SmartWatch but it's more than that as a
storage medium that allows people to
take their games to their friend's home
or take it to another PC it's not a
generic SmartWatch it's something that
speaks to a gamer for me it's kind of a
no-brainer

that's me I don't want to get out of the
shower
why because I hate myself these ones
don't really dry me anymore I like doing
water around with moist and paper and
these one luckier happier one bean
because of a little more water first but
then they stay wet you can smell musty
which means there's bacteria going and
maybe even fungus forth you can avoid
this the washing and drying your towels
every day and it was kinda like my third
feel better till I found a staggering
number of options mostly in variations
of the name hotel so cut through the
confusion I take a different approach on
that redefined for the cal/osha people
this is beyond things are perfectly
designed good course a waffle even when
a student living a multi-layer field as
Washington thought is an exfoliating
patient and tries like job depended on
it
having maximum surface area those
enables the child tries malpractice
which was important because the dry
towel is the clean pass the palate is
great and has proceeded by me in him
none worth and even him
shower time is a daily ritual for me
it's the frigid yeah even before coffee
why do I care so much about a towel
Oh for the sake of must've health it
don't work properly and I know if you
compose a chairman frustration so this
is my solution you get what drying off
never felt this
