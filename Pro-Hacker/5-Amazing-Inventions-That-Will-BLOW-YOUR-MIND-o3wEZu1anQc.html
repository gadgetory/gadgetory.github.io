for everybody's household I thought it
was the coolest thing there was hey
everybody my name is James Amburgey I'm
marketing director at bio bidet at bio
bidet we're really focused on offering
products that enhance the beauty and
function of your home after the success
of our first Kickstarter campaign
America proved that it was ready to move
towards a cleaner healthier lifestyle

latest bio the day project introducing
the slim zero you get a lot of great
features with this product you get a
