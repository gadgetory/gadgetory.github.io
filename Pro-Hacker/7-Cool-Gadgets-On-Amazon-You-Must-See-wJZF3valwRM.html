Oh
so the also also have to do is it allows
me to use another product from unique
which is brand new to the breeze also
which is the gamepad so rather than
flying the breeze on the iPhone on the
Android device iPad or whatever you've
been using you now have the option to
fly it using the game control pad this
gives a whole different experience is
fantastic
okay enough that the breeze up in a
brand new mode is in fpv mode as you can
see I've got some goals on which is
allowing me to see through the camera of
the drone so it's like I'm sitting on
board the drone flying it it's a really
really weird experience but it's called
fpv fpv stands for first-person view
where allows me to do like I said is
look through the camera of the drone and
fly it like I'm sitting in the cockpit
it's a really really cool experience if
it's the go so the hold down start I get
my countdown three two one go and the
breeze lifts off okay so I'm going to
fly over the fly over the ditch so first
thing to point out is if I select r2 or
my gamepad what I get an overlay of what
all my buttons are doing so if I ever
forget what my buttons are going to do
okay I get a little bit confused I
select that button r2 and it gives me
what everything does a really nice
feature so another thing what I could do
on my gamepad is that the switch between
videos and photos you can see I get a
little bit of an error or a field of
view and I can just change back to
videos okay on the gamepad as well I
select another button and I can start
recording and that's also my shutter
button in what I'm we've got photos so
that's quite a little bit forward for
you
what I can do on my gameplay as I can
tilt my gimbal down so I can face my
gimbal down you can see if I select it
so I can look down you can see in my
little map there that sometimes take off
from okay and I can get my gimbal facing
directly forwards
like so just all on the gamepad really
really nice and easy okay well let's get
some altitude it's what these drones are
for its get nice and high and see what
we can see from above we can get the
breeze up to over a hundred feet so you
can see I can have a little bit of a pad
a little bit of a look around so the
link will come down to my phone exactly
a 720p that's a hate speed link that
comes down to my iPhone what I can
record on the curve of the actual
internal memory of the brief is I can
record 720p on record 1080 or I can
record in 4k so one of them mouth and
stop recording and then now change the
photo mode again I see a knife shot in
front of me okay and I'm gonna hit my
shutter button as you can see I'm gonna
take some really nice stills on wire on
my screen I might be then goggles I get
my battery percentage I get all my
recording status or get wire satellite
to get my optical fiber so get all my
information while looking through screen
the screen I also get the distance from
my transmitter and I also get my
altitude displayed at the bottom
another great feature is I have a on the
top left-hand corner of my game control
pad I can select that button
and it flips between the camera on the
drone and I'm now looking through the
camera of my iPhone so if I think I want
to get line-of-sight back of the drone
if I still want to let you see where I
am
I just have to press one button and I
look through the camera on my iPhone so
really really cool function and then
under pressing the button again I can
look through the camera of the drone
again this has really been well thought
out now you can really experience fly in
the breeze like an fpv racer
like any other drone and you know what
it makes it super fun makes it
absolutely amazing I love this thing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
