companies were constantly pushing the
boundaries of innovation and design
putting out products or where sometimes
even considered wacky needed to design a
device that was not only an incredible
phone but also an amazing wearable it
used to repair a lot of phones I had
cracked screens or water damage and did
it quite frequently and when I took
apart a lot of these phones I noticed
that a lot of the brand's shared similar
construction and design techniques and
oftentimes used materials that were
obsolete like screws and using rigid and
fragile materials like glass and being
steel and thought to myself there had to
be a better way we first started with a
lot of different types of concepts and
designs and after a lot of iterations
and testing and bedding we really kind
of narrowed it down to two designs which
is a large and a small before you knew
it the portable board
we needed to ensure that it was not only
waterproof but also flexible
shatterproof and where we needed to
build a team of incredible people with a
wide range of skill sets who are all
unified to pursue our mission and break
the mold of the mobile market the
problem with the mobile market right now
is that the phones are all the same and
what little differentiation they have is
that some are less user-friendly and
some are less durable things like this
still happen so we're here to change
that with the vibrant pallets clean
typography and easy to understand icon
set the call for UI is experience it
cannot be missed
why be stuck with the same old design
when you've got a new refreshing
interface to play with an interface that
has to interact that knows what you want
and works with you in the way that you
want it to work the portal not only has
all the features you would expect such
as Wi-Fi Bluetooth and NFC but also has
a waterproof kevlar infused polyurethane
body a six inch flexible display
wireless charging an unblocked network
and so much more
me
one of the biggest challenges of
starting a smartphone company are all
the licensing and government
certification involved which you can
probably imagine it enormously expensive
all of us here the Rubik's truly believe
that we can change the world with our
innovation even if you can't help back
us please help spread the word so we can
revolutionize the mobile industry we use
our smartphones for everything but it
seems like the battery can never keep up
before long it's at 1% and on the verge
of dying
now you might carry a charging table
with you but sometimes there are no
power outlets nearby and even if there
were the chief cable that comes with
your phone isn't always reliable but
think about the power sources that are
all around us all the time everywhere
you look there are people with
smartphones and tablets each with their
own battery what if there was a way for
our devices to connect with each other
and share their battery well now there
is with anyway the only charging table
you'll ever need
on one end there's a microUSB connector
for Android phone for iPhone just slide
on the attached lightning adapter the
other end has a standard USB connector
for wall chargers and computers the
cable itself is protected with tangle
free nylon for extra durability but what
really makes any links so unique is this
ability to share battery life between
devices here's how it works
hidden within the USB connector is a
pop-out micro USB I just plug this end
into my phone
she plugs beyond the rendon to hers and
just like at her phone is charging
pretty amazing right no wall outlets no
batteries just one amazing table any
link works with more than just both if I
have my tablet on me I can use its large
battery as a power source to keep my
phone charged I just connect the two
using my any link cable throw them in my
bag and I can charge my phone on the go
with any link I can stop worrying about
my battery life and enjoy my social life
if my battery's running low I know I can
count on a friend to lend a charge but
any link goes beyond just passing on
battery light connected devices can
transfer files to with any link you can
quickly transfer your media to another
device without using up your data plan
so I can transfer files cards from a
friend or plug into an outlet all for
the same price as a standard Apple
charging cable our friends are all
different and so are their devices
Android iPhone tablets smart watches
even Kindle it doesn't matter
any links lets us connect our device so
we can stay connected with our friends
I keep data I'm will product designer
and founder of Ruby's we created
automatics we were tired of voltage
battery cases many cables large powered
Hank we wanted a solution that is
versatile is our lifestyle that could be
there when we need it without slowing us
down when we know at the same time
results of charging should be seamless
and integrated and so the times we do
need to charge our iPhone we don't have
to use it was being heathered to another
external device what we came up with is
augmented the birth of its kind charging
solution that we believe has changed the
ways you can charge on the code creating
the charge module one undoubtedly the
most challenging part of this project
working directly with our
industry-leading
an apple approve manufacturer from day
one we prototype several iterations of
the design to affect the balance between
charge capacity and overall side the
result is amazing and we've been able to
fit 12 hundred million or 60% extra
charge into a form factor that succeeds
in your coin toss another great feature
is that the charge module only takes 60
minutes to charge your iPhone so you
plug it in power up and put it away once
you finish
Othman not just convenient when you're
out and about once you've used the
charge module simply connected to your
phone's plug in the microUSB cable and
charge both the iPhone and charge
Michael simultaneously the Ottoman case
itself you need a number of ways
primarily designed to protect your
iPhone case offers 360-degree jeweler's
protection the visually impressive and
iPhone transforming squares design
driven by the inclusion of the mounting
system in the base which allows for
secure and seamless attachment of the
charge module but we've also added some
personality of the time and applied a
combination of strong visual elements to
create what we think is one is the most
beautiful and unique cases on the market
for demand charge modules communities
risk without the augment case but for
the best experience we recommend using
close together experience the making
products the world's leading tech brands
small team of designers and
manufacturing experts have come together
for this project together Kickstarter
because we need your help all money
raised through our directly Ward's
paying for the molds materials and
product certifications such as apples
and thereby programs all men take and
Orban charge at the beginning interiors
of products designed to augment your
iPhone but please back up
share us and tell everyone you know
about augment we can't wait to start
this journey with you

in 2007 Steve Jobs said that this with
the best input device that was 2007 this
is 2015 in 2015 we love our touchscreens
we take them everywhere we go and why
wouldn't we they're light they're
powerful and they're gorgeous but
they're not a perfect input device to
fully express ourselves we need better
precision and more space this is free
and it takes you way beyond the screen

nearly any surface and your words or
pictures will appear on your screen
instantly free brings us back to a more
direct interaction with the world around
us in part by freeing us to use one of
our most personal skills handwriting's
Risa fistic ated optical tracking engine
can trace any one handwriting on nearly
any surface to an incredible level of
accuracy
there is never be anything like it give
us a minute Mitch our audience entered
into the miniature laser we tend to
collimated beam to the surface
reflection from the surface combined
with internal reflections to give us the
motion things in fact we invented the
world's smallest 3-dimensional laser
interferometer that is truly amazing but
let me take it from here
free is all about minimizing whatever
stands in the way of your creative
energy it's got a mini touch display for
notifications that you reply instantly
and even doubles as a headset to take
phone calls only write yourself a note

sophisticated forms of biometric
identification making it much harder for
someone to steal your identity free of
the minimal and classic design with the
unique ergonomic shape so that the touch
display naturally faces you you can
simply select different functions we
also have an open platform so developers
can create exciting your applications
together we can change the way we
interact with the digital world for
everyone
we put thousands of hours developing our
motion tracking engine and now we need
your support to build the coolest mobile
into device
it's quick it's convenient familiar and
person it's free
well
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
