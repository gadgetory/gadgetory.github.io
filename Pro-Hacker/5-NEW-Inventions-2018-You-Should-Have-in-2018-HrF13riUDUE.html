hey what's going on everybody welcome
back to another video as always I'm Joe
and this is a product I've got in my
hand is the in-charge keyring a USB
charger cable and charge was kind enough
to send some of these out to me for
review and I was happy to get my hands
on such a neat and convenient product
coming in at 12 bucks and I've heard
some people say that this may be a
little bit on the expensive side and
some may very well feel that way but I
have a totally different opinion for me
this is all about convenience and it
doesn't get more convenient to me than
being able to carry something around
like this on my keyring a folded up and
stowed on the keyring provided this
charging cable is just one and a half
inches long and locks into place via two
pretty strong magnets and they hold the
cable together when not in use now you
do have a ton of color options to choose
from thin or thick version which just
pertains to the cable size and then it
comes in two different styles you've got
your lightning and your micro USB
configuration to me only one of these is
a no-brainer carrying this with your
keys something by the way that you
always have with you ensures that you
will always have a means to charge your
device pair this up with a portable
power bank and you can kiss the wall
hugger lifestyle goodbye so in short and
no pun intended there twelve dollars can
be perceived as a little bit pricey but
when it comes to the convenience of
keeping your device charged you could
say this cable is an absolute steal not
only that but you're getting a quality
product and a little bit of peace of
mind to boot alright well that wraps up
another one for me
hope you enjoyed this video as much as I
did making it and if you did don't
