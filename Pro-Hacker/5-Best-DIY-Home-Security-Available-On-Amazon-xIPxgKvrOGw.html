you to answer your door from the
smartphone whether you're at home at
work or on the go it looks like a
solicitor when a visitor presses the
button skybell sends a live video feed
to your smartphone so you can see hear
and speak to the person at your door
skybell is more than just the doorbell
with a video camera it's a smart device
with exclusive features that give you
even more convenience and control over
answering your door
Skye Billa delivers additional security
through a motion sensor that alerts you
when someone is at the door with a 1080p
camera and full color night vision
you'll see your visitor in crystal-clear
high-definition video day or night sky
bells Wi-Fi is always on allowing you to
start a live video feed directly from
the app so you can monitor your front
door at any time skybell gives you more
safety convenience and control while
answering your door the idea was born
from everyday situations I mean don't
you wish you can know who's at the door
before you stop what you're doing answer
it want to see who's there when you're
not home but the kids are and what about
when it started but we're making all
that possible and we're doing it with
minimal design and cutting-edge
technology so how does it work
hold on someone's at my door
hey John hey Andrea want to go the beach
yeah I'm already down here why don't you
come down to our usual spot okay I'd be
there soon
well thanks for stopping by we're
excited about skybell and connecting
your world starting with the front door
on sale now at skybell calm
keeping our home safe is important to
all of us getting your house broken into
sucks it's not just the stuff that you
lose but because your home feels
violated what you want is to keep it
from happening in the first place
that's why we created Cunha help you
prevent break-ins
this is Cunha Cunha is a smart Wi-Fi
camera built into an elegant outdoor
light fixture it detects people and
alerts you so you can see and talk to
them on your smartphone hey could you
leave the package out front we're a
little busy this is the best way to
actively prevent break-ins most
burglaries are crimes of opportunity the
burglars were actually knocking on your
door to see if you're home and when they
realize you're not home they'll attempt
to enter your house keeping them outside
is the most important thing you can do
and koona allows you to do that you can
deter burglars by talking to them or
setting off kunas alarm yeah no thanks
they'll leave and all this happens when
they're still outside before they even
try to break it making your home safer
it shouldn't be a chore for one of these
you have to climb in the Attic run wires
drill holes it's a pain and it's not
cheap that's why we built Cunha into an
outdoor light just replace your old
light fixture it and use your existing
wiring connect to no two Wi-Fi and
you're done it'll take 15 minutes do we
want Cunha to look good no matter where
it is so we're making it in three
different styles to match your house you
can put Cunha anywhere front door back
door even the garage to watch your car
oh and your light get smarter too you
can control it with the kikuna app turn
it on turn it off set a schedule or just
let it turn on automatically when it
gets dark or when there's a person you
only want to get alerts that matter
Cunha ignores trees and small animals
and it recognizes people's behaviors so
if you don't want to know every time
your spouse goes out jogging
you can tell Co nerd alert you only for
visitors waiting at the door and it'll
learn and get smarter over time
there's a peace of mind that comes from
knowing what's happening at your home
whether it's your loved ones or the
delivery guy Kona will always let you
know and if it's someone bad now you can
do something about it
kuna stop break-ins or they happen
Bobby that dad don't do that
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
