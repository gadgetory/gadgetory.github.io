and created something new and exciting
introducing the awarded Naruto smart UV
for your phone the smart UV camera lets
you see into the UV light spectrum and
reveals amazing discoveries people all
over the world are reacting to this
incredible innovation from total shock
and excitement to being in awe or even a
little grossed out the smart UV captures
what lies beneath the skin so you can
see what it really looks like we've all
heard numerous times how important
skincare is but until it becomes real
for each of us we rarely do anything
about it
if you could see your own skin and UV
light maybe you'd start making better
decisions for us this is what we call
seeing smart so we can be smart so how
does seeing smart actually work there's
more to life than what the human eye can
see when you look at the light spectrum
you see the visible light measures from
about 400 to 700 nanometer in wavelength
we call this visible light because this
is the only light humans can see UV
lights it's next to it in the spectrum
between 200 and 400 nanometers invisible
to humans but interestingly cats can see
from the 300 nanometer band up which
means they have UV vision when observing
your skin visible light bounces off the
outer layer which is what we see every
day but because UV light has a smaller
wavelength it passes through the outer
layer and only bounces off the second
denser layer showing us what lies
beneath that's what makes a smart UV so
great it not only lets you see in UV but
also lets you take a UV selfie the first
of its kind in the world now we're going
to look at how smart this device really
is
it fits in your pocket connect via a
reversible USB connector has a photo and
video camera work by an app is iOS and
Android compatible and has the same lens
technology as professional UV cameras
we've made it really easy to use you
download the app on your smartphone and
attach the device to your phone check
that you have natural light or UV light
source then take a picture or video and
be amazed at what's been right in front
of your eyes this entire time what makes
us different than other UV cameras it
works with your smartphone giving you
access to a bigger screen it's much more
affordable than professional equipment
the camera orientation allows you to see
yourself you don't have to charge it
ever it makes your smartphone even
smarter and it uses your phone sharing
capabilities letting you share in real
time
seem smart to be smart so smart UV will
help you keep track of your skin like a
skin diary so you can be aware of your
skin's aging process it also helps you
take proactive measures to prevent
further skin damage and it helps you
find uncovered spots when applying
sunscreen while we're talking sunscreen
did you know that high UV a factor
sunscreens and UV coated glasses block
UV light completely the result is that
it looks black when seen with a smart UV
how fascinating is that and now for the
best news we've already made and tested
our prototypes and the results have
blown us away in fact all the UV footage
in this video was shot with an actual
smart UD prototype we've gathered people
to reactions from all over the world and
now we want to make it accessible to
everyone
that's where you come in we need your
help
your pledge will help pay the
manufacturing costs needed to
mass-produced and get the smart UV in
the hands of as many people as possible
we've completed the 3d designs of the
final production version doesn't it look
incredible and we've even added a robust
phone connector to the slick design now

TV can show you about your skin just
imagine what it can reveal about the
rest of the world more about that in our
stretch goals select now and help the
