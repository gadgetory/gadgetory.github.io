imaging a brilliant camera and aircraft
you can trust and the intelligence to
make every shot cinematic the new
phantom 4 Pro has all this and much more
The Phantom 4 pro camera has an F 2.8
aperture mechanical shutter and large
one-inch sensor coming together to make
brighter more detailed imagery record
cinematic 4k video at higher bitrate
with more advanced compression and a
wider dynamic range the 4k 60 frames per
second recording gives you stunning
detailed slow-motion aerial video the
phantom 4 pro is as adept at stills as
it is with video capturing every detail
at 20 megapixels its mechanical shutter
eliminates rolling shutter bending grab
the perfect moment using first mode all
of this makes the phantom 4 pro the most
advanced aerial camera ever found in the
phantom series the Phantom 4 pro is now
a huge step forward I'm taking photos of
the lava when it's darker out and the
glow of the lavas coming off of it the
image sensor that's in this camera now
is 1 inch sensor 20 megapixels that
extra dynamic range allows me to really
get everything into one shot and
landscape that's extremely important be
your shot clearly even in direct
sunlight through the new ultra bright
5.5 inch monitor that's more than twice
as bright as most tablets inside is DJI
light bridge technology it automatically
detects interference and switches from
two point four to five point eight
gigahertz transmission and take off
cutting through the noise for more
reliability
the built-in monitor on the Phantom 4
Pro is so bright I'm actually able to
see in direct sunlight and that's really
allowing me to compose my shot and get
what I really want to capture active
track has now been expanded with three
new intelligent flight modes profile
tracks your subject horizontally from
any side spotlight locks the camera on a
subject while you fly in almost any
direction circle swing 360 degrees
around the subject tap fly has also been
improved adding reverse tap fly making
it perfect for aerial selfies flying the
Phantom 4 pro is even more worryfree a
set of rear visual sensors has been
added to existing forward and downward
sensors combined with new infrared
obstacle sensors on its sides the
Phantom 4 Pro has five directions of
sensing if image signal is lost a
returns home while dynamically avoiding
obstacles and even flies back along its
original flight path until signal is
regained every minute in the air counts
the new high-capacity battery flight
time has been increased to 30 minutes
when it comes to speed the Phantom 4 pro
is ten miles per hour faster with full
support of an obstacle sensing systems
with this stunning camera one-inch
sensor ultra bright monitor obstacle
sensing and intelligence the phantom 4
pro brings professional quality aerial
imaging and flight capabilities to more
pilots around the world
you
you
at its launch the inspire one was a
revolution it turned tens of thousands
of people into aerial filmmakers and now
appears on professional film sets around
the world the inspire tube builds on
this foundation empowering filmmakers to
be more creative than ever
whether flying as a team or operating as
a single pilot a dedicated to access
stabilized fpv camera with independently
adjustable pitch gives the piloting
personal live beat bring the camera up
to move any way they need to to get the
shot top speeds has boosted to 58 miles
per hour
94 km/h and ascent and descent is also
accelerating the speed doesn't come
without protection DJ is unmatched
flight autonomy system comes to inspire
to bringing with it an extended range
close to 100 feet meaning faster flight
with protection from what it can see it
also adds an infrared sensor placed on
top we inspire extending obstacle
avoidance to obstructions overhead
the new dual battery design increases
flight times hitting a maximum of 27
minutes when using the x 4's camera and
also provides battery redundancy Celt
heating systems mean inspire to can be
flown in extreme cold the zenmuse x5 s
Micro Four Thirds camera now has a
twenty point eight megapixel sensors
with better pixel perfects it is capable
of capturing 5.2 K at 30 frames per
second as well as 4k at 60 frames per
second it also supports cinema dmg and
pro res recording you just kind of look
at you go like that's really small but
how can this little small thing give
these big results normally I wouldn't
think of it using a drone for normal
shots but kind of made this really
simple shot easily and look great and
I'm really I'm just I'm tell you I'm
really taking the inspire to is DJ focus
compatible for precision focus control a
broad range of Micro Four Thirds lenses
are also supported including zooms from
nine millimeter to forty five million
the 45 is beautiful on this camera we
use done a lot for close-ups and has a
great depth of field and just make me
feel like you know that's kind of
cinematic for me
the inspire 2 Image Processor known as
cynic or 2.0 offers cinema DNG pro res
h.264 and h.265 recording onto a
detachable PCIe SSD drive with a maximum
read and write speed of 6 gigabits per
second or a micro SD Floyd Perez is a
widely used delivery method for
post-production offering flexibility for
editing while not compromising image
quality but to get the absolute most out
of what you shoot be inspired to also
captures rock acquiring content on raw
just gives you more information to work
with in your post process the raw native
cinema DNG format gives you the most
dynamic range possible of that camera it
basically takes full advantage of the
sensor and everything that it can see
there isn't one shot that we compromised
for detail for color purity for
separation of images for black for
low-light detail a highlight detail but
I never could have told you that this
particular footage came from a drum it's
just too good new intelligent modes
including spotlight Pro and profile make
cinematic shots easier for production
teams and even for single operators
spotlight probe keeps the camera locked
on the subject rotating beyond 360
degrees fix a target in frame as inspire
flies while profile mode turns a camera
to capture the subjects profile as the
inspire flies forward by maintaining
forward flight obstacle sensing systems
are able to protect the aircraft the
onboard fpv camera separates the flight
view from the main camera view
effectively giving the inspire to a
dedicated tap flight hammer just tap on
the screen to fly in that direction and
focus on camera control
during return to home the primary camera
with a maximum sensing range 200 meters
is used to effectively avoid
obstructions live TV broadcasting has
also been enabled natively through an
optimized broadcast mode that strings
smooth video at the 1080i50 and 720p 60
live broadcast standard the inspire 2
brings better quality images more power
and more intelligence professional
aerial filmmaking setting the stage for
more filmmakers to take the disguise
you
Oh
Oh
ah
yeah
yeah
here's a list of stuff from kind of
magical to unbelievably magical body
wash that's also shampoo Mentos and cola
things that fly with your help the
magical is about to get magical her meet
shy a pilot an industrial designer and
an inventor he loves things to fly he
wants try to turn his car into an
airplane no success shy Olli said that
his dream was to bring the joy of flight
to everyone a few years ago he made a
breakthrough in the field of cool stuff
that flies he invented the power of the
first electric paper airplane but then a
friend of shai's told him nice gadget
really but you can't make a
remote-controlled paper airplane so I
took a moment to think and said
challenge accepted two years of research
and 57 prototypes later he made it
happen
Meech eyes unbelievably magical
invention power up three the first ever
smartphone controlled paper airplane
using state-of-the-art technology power
up three turns your embarrassing paper
plane into a lean mean flying machine
just fold a piece of copy paper to a
plane attach power of three and install
the app now call your mom and tell your
pilot because it works out of the box in
the back of the module are a propeller
and a rudder that are in charge of
controlling the plane in the front
there's an advanced ship with powerful
Bluetooth smart technology for an
amazing 60 yards of controlled flight
and a tiny rechargeable battery to power
this amazing beast out of juice charge
the battery with any microUSB cable as I
learned in his career as a pilot planes
should be building or flying
and for crashing that's why all
components of the powerup 3 are super
durable and crash proof but here's where
Cheyne made it really cool powerup
threes smart shape is program to
optimize user happiness you don't need a
PhD in aeronautics to be able to fly it
the prototype is fully functional and
the supercooled from magical power up 3
is ready for production this is where
Shai need your magic beings if you help
Shai get to 1,400 backers he will help
him bring the joy of flight to everyone
and obtain the privilege to look down on
regular paper planes for the rest of
your life
so back power of three and help make the
magical magical
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
