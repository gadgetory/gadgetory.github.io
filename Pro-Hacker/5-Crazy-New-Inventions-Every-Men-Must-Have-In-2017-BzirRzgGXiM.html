people try to lose fat in different ways
some exercise some diet and some do
nothing
but are they happy with the results yeah
except for these thunder thighs
well this mommy told me is impossible
these handles don't get much love let's
face it we all have those stubborn areas
of fat we just can't get rid of meat
silicon lipo the first targeted fat
reduction device for home use that
really works no diet no exercise simply
use Silk'n lipo for just 15 minutes a
day and get results no diet no exercise
only 15 minutes a day that's right just
eight weeks targeting stubborn areas
will reduce fat and strengthen
underlying muscles so you can give your
body the shape you've always wanted
I don't know Silk'n lipo really works
Silk'n lipo uses the same proven
technology found in a large professional
light therapy machines found in the
world's most advanced and expensive
beauty clinics we've simply shrunk that
same technology into the first-ever
affordable easy-to-use home device to
make it even better we've combined the
low-level light therapy with electrical
muscle stimulation technology EMS to
optimize the fat reduction and
strengthen underlying muscles
low level light therapy is a proven
technology for the permanent reduction
of fat with years of clinical experience
in my own clinic low level light therapy
is one of the most popular it can
permanently slim firm and shape areas
without downtime without pain without
discomfort without the side effects
associated with traditional surgical
treatments when I first heard that
they've been able to compact lower light
therapy into a simple little home device
I was understandably skeptical but when
I reviewed the basic science and the
results I've come to realize a Silk'n
lipo is as effective as some of my large
body contouring logo light therapy
systems I use in the office that the
patient can use 15 minutes a day and
deliver the same kind of permanent fat
contouring and body slimming results
I've been able to achieve within office
treatments
how does it work that is accumulated by
your body and stored in fat cells under
your skin Silk'n lipo uses specifically
calibrated frequencies of light to
perforate fat cell walls releasing their
fatty contents and harmlessly causing
shrinkage in the region once outside the
cell your body's natural processes flush
the fatty acids out of your system in
the same natural way regular dietary
fibers expelled to accelerate this
process and to help build strength and
muscle tone so can added EMS technology
this stimulates muscle activity and
circulation in the treated area speeding
up the rate at which the excess fat is
flushed out of your system leaving your
body looking its best Silk'n the
pioneers of permanent hair removal
technology shrunk down for home use now
brings you clinically proven
non-invasive fat reduction technology to
let you target those stubborn areas and
give your body the shape you want one
last thing for the first time on
IndieGoGo we're promising to ship by
Christmas or your money back guaranteed

a smartphone sized device that uses
ultrasound technology to clean almost
