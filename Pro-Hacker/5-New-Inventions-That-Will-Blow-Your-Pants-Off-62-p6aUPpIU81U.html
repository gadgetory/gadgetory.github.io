shake me run chills up my back
make me remember the butterflies the
downs and the hives
let me hear and make me feel but do you
really know the feeling of sound we want
you to know to finally feel and that is
why we created flex sound Horace
partition my name is Mary and I'm the
CEO of flex up systems we've invented a
completely new way of experiencing sound
taking you beyond just hearing alone in
feeling it physically as well our flex
sound room will help you to feel sound
the music on your skin and body like
never before for Center we've only been
listening to sound the tools and devices
have evolved and sound has become
incredible but it is still just audio
but we know there's so much more to
sound see sound is not just a hearing
sensation it's full of brawn walls
rolls and vibrations it's a library or
human nuances that you could actually
physically feel it is why we love those
deep sensations
the power of the sound of nature or the
feeling of someone's voice against your
skin when you are close flex and humor
is a smart cushion that simultaneously
creates great sound reproduction and
physical distributed vibration from the
same source this means that as you hear
oreos room you'll feel it with your skin
and body unlike loved speakers that
radiate vibration into air almost
element radiates vibration through fall
providing a soft
near field listening experience such a
multi-sensory experience enhances
emotions created by the context you are

you
this is John he is an experienced
motorcycle rider John knows that safety
is important which is why he at least
wears this and this and of course this
but what if you could prevent an
accident altogether
well that's Jane hi Jane and this is
break free
just like John she too is an experienced
rider and she's all about safety
she knows that being visible at all
times is the key it's a smart LED light
that does sophisticated things unlike
your motorcycles taillight break free is
at eye level so all drivers can see
it'll grow brighter to alert drivers
around you when you're slowing down no
matter how breaking down shifting or
engine braking turn it on and it stays
on no need to connect it with wires or
use it out and that's what Jane and
riders really care about being seen to
prevent an accident in the first place
whether you're this this this or even
this kind of rider you'll still want
this this bridges the gap between safety
and style this is break free a smarter
way to be seen I've been riding for the
past ten years and I loved every second
of it
I also have a wife and two beautiful
daughters so my safety is always my top
priority
shortly after I graduated college I got
the opportunity to apprentice under a
successful Silicon Valley entrepreneur
while working on one of his new ideas
and autonomous brake lights of cars I
quickly realized that this is the
perfect product for motorcycle riders so
it break free we're trying to use
advanced manufacturing techniques from
companies like Audi MVNO U and bring
those to the consumer market to deliver
a safety product that is like no other
one of the biggest hurdles for the
design process was trying to make our
unit fit on as many helmets as possible
and the way we did this is we took as
many homes as we could get and we 3d
scan the back of them
and what we're trying to get at is a
shape that's gonna work or it's may help
us as possible and also maximize the
surface area of the lights because the
surface area of the lights is obviously
important and how much you can see them
products that have been on the market
already are all mounted fix on a vehicle
that works well and can detect
acceleration but as soon as then the
head of the rider starts moving a lot of
these devices give false readings what's
special about the break free device is
that we can detect deceleration in the
direction of travel even though the head
of the writer where the light is mounted
may move sideways and tilt forward the
end goal at break free is to increase
safety for riders we do that in two ways
first create a device that people will
want to wear and the second make
something that works one of the most
important aspects of our safety is our
visibility and it's also one of those
things that's most neglected currently
in the market there's some high vis gear
that's neither in the helmet or a vest
or in pants and to me I mean it's
definitely a step in the right direction
but they're a static piece they're not
going to really get the attention
they're not going to really capture kind
of a semi glazed driver if you will
what's nice about this product is it
illuminates and flashes so it's
something that is dynamic and it
definitely can make the difference
between saving a life break free is
something that's really unique I've
never seen anything like it before
cars have a triangle of lights these
days modern cars the two taillights the
light that's up in the back window
motorcyclists taillights are generally
small and they're designing them to look
even cooler and smaller and they become
even harder to see the BreakFree brings
a light that is going to be noticeable
by drivers up into their basic field of
vision this is why break frame needs to
exist BreakFree is bridging the gap
between style and safety I'd
they came in the last two years of my
life to get break free to where it is
today and this is where we need your
help now we need the toilet to
manufacture our first large order you
get break free into the hands of writers
everywhere thank you we present wolf
never again worry about watching out the
speed cameras or other measurement
devices wolf will do it for me
wolf has been carefully designed with
attention to biker clothing this made
from high-quality water-resistant
leather and is practical sim
uncomfortable even under clothes fatigue
lies hands-free and eyes on the road
wolf watches your back it'll keep you up
to date on when and where you need to be
extra careful it'll let you know when
you need to start slowing down

technology and global mapping and an
ability to measure speed and other data
to bring you the highest level of
accuracy and constant updates the closer
you come to a speed control zone the
more frequent the wristbands vibrations

right speed slow down at the right time
and wave goodbye to expensive finds
license suspensions and other harsh
penalties
