and various formats and vinyl takes us
to the core of great sounds but getting
into vinyl can be intimidating and
expensive there are complicated and
expensive audio systems or other
turntable models with small speakers
that may be easy to use but can't even
bring out good sound what if we can fix
all that and have everything we want all
at once meat seed the all-in-one
turntable system that integrates
outstanding sound quality a great output
and classic design equipped with
one-inch silk tweeters and 4 inch woofer
drivers the dynamic range of seed is
increased by 20% so from subtle gasps to
grand orchestra performances we take you
to the front row of a concert and
immerse you completely in the music the
exclusive suspension design filters out
vibrations and hold the platter and tone
arm steady to deliver consistent
high-quality sound it's like a smooth
ride through rocky terrain with the best
suspension system furthermore to
preserve the precious records and
produce the most authentic sounds we
applied eccentric counterweight Enki
skate to balance the tone arm and keep
the stylus riding in the center of the
groove without wearing out the record
unevenly
just like how we enjoy vinyl seed is
also about the aesthetics the steam vent
wood frame is a visualization of sound
waves it sounds good looks good and
feels good this is the final experience
built just for you

earth
