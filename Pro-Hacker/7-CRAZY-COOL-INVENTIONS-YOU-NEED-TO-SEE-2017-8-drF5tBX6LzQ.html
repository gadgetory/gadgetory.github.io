simulator for all your favorite PC games
videos and VR imagine feeling the heat
of a flamethrower when you're playing
battlefield one got it great since the
heat it's interesting because
immediately makes you sweat so it's
really quick to immerse you into it I
know what an explosion is gonna happen
I'm gonna feel the flame so I'm already
scared about it happening but it makes
the world more tangible whatever I'm
watching you're playing like it actually
makes me more fearful this is like the
flame that's gonna hurt me and it's
missing through our hardware and
software the vortex system is able to
respond to any kind of stimulus on
demand I would say the coolest thing is
how fast it can switch between
temperatures so like watching the shadow
mode or and that ice part of the scene
is switched to like the fire it kept
swishing else like okay this is actually
really cool so what's exciting about
vortexes we're taking a large amount of
input data in audio-visual format and we
get to turn that information into usable
feedback that creates an elevated level
of immersion for the users it kind of
caught me off guard after we started
putting some of this work into play
because the unit was a blast to use it
was genuinely fun and it is it makes
almost every piece of content that you
consume better it's just a whole lot of
fun oh my god you feel like you're in
the environment that you're watching the
flame the vortex enables you to
understand that mister you're at another
level it gives you more sense and more
attachment to what you're doing
seeing people having to face light up
when they have that experience for the
first time is like everything personal
satisfaction of that is just mmm
we know there's a huge void in
traditional gaming and video that's why
we started whirlwind FX we want to get
it into your hands the content creators
the gamers VR enthusiasts action lovers
now with your support we want to breathe
life into your entertainment experience
feeling is believing live the action
life puts us every day in stressful
situations no matter how hard we try to
relax taking a break from it all is
becoming increasingly difficult
unfortunately this Restless rhythm takes
a toll on our well-being that's why we
created ostrich pillow luma the ultimate
eye pillow it provides a cocoon to rest
where you want when you want it's smart

and catch some good recovering snooze in
total blackout isolation and absolute
comfort and once you're done you can
