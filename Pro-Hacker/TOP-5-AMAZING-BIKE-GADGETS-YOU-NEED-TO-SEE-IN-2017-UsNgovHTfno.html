achieve with a simple push of a button
technology brings endless possibilities
right to our fingertips making life more
comfortable in every aspect and helping
us prepare better for the future except
when it comes to a flat tire
right ere is the next generation of
effortless air pops and it works at a
push of a button just like you're used
to just as it should ride air is clean
simple and efficient it's designed to
help you in two common situations the
natural loss of air pressure that always
catches you off-guard and a flat tire
that stops you from getting on your bike
at all right air is the perfect quick
fix for bone it lets you inflate your
tires with a single push of a button
this way you can take care of a flat
after you get to where you need to be
ride air can be refilled with an air
compressor in literally a second and
it's built in safety prevents air from
leaking out we worked on a slick and
elegant design that would fit perfectly
on your bike so that you're never caught
without it just to be on the safe side
it has a built in lock to keep your ride
air where it belongs
and of course ride air isn't just for
riding you can also use it to inflate
lots of other things
you
hi my name is michael burton in 2014 I
invented the Geo orbital wheel and built
the first prototype the G over a wheel
is really a platform that lets you
convert any bike to an electric bike in
seconds gives mag called the radically
different design it has been featured in
time in Forbes and Popular Mechanics on
the Discovery Channel let me show you
how the wheel is made this is our
contract manufacturing facility in
Peabody Massachusetts it's about 10
miles north of Boston this is where
thousands of wheels are assembled tested
and shipped and I think it's funny that
until I built the first one engineering
experts told me it couldn't be done
and until we sold thousands of them
business experts told me that it
couldn't be sold it takes a community a
strong community to come together to
really bring a product to life a few
months ago we had a groundbreaking
Kickstarter campaign we raised over 1.2
six million dollars from a community of
over 1,600 people we have ship wheels
all over the world and people have put
them on to very very creative things
that are always inspiring and
motivational to us I want to show you
our game room this is an electric drift
trike if you've never been on one of
these definitely check one of these out
something a little more serious this
isn't an electric full-size wheelchair
which still folds up you can still
operate this manually to
it's so universally compatible we even
put it on a wheelbarrow I don't forget
about the mini penny this is the first
of our concept vehicles to make it into
production it wouldn't be possible
without the Geo orbital wheel you know
the nice thing about this platform is it
has all the components built in that
make it move so we're not limited by a
lot of the restrictions of traditional
vehicles we're even working on a car now
where the wheels will turn sideways to
drive and it can fold up when it's
parked we're a company
powered by a single simple idea that a
wheel can move itself the opportunities
are limitless and we think we can
redefine transportation but it takes a
community takes a community to make
change its products don't make
differences communities do so please
please join us in building a great
company together they can really make a
difference in transportation
hi Kickstarter I'm great news my team we
developed a group the small device we
put on your handlebar to affirm your
band secrets like us a simple and safe
way to access all the information we
need while riding speed time but also
directions and gentle notification of
your calls and messages we all have a
smartphone but it's so annoying to use
it by riding to use a iku just plug it
on its dock on your handlebar it's
magnetic turns on automatically and
connects with your smartphone without
you doing anything IQ is a new kind of
by computer that display the data come
in from the GPS of your smartphone if
you launched a navigational before
starting your ride you'll receive clear
subtitle indications you can also access
your write information just by waving
your hand Ike also notified us if
someone is trying to reach you if you
want you can access messages and call
notification but to stay safe you decide
when to do it just wave your hand
this is the experience we provide with
eggs you stay in control and receive
clear information no more smartphone
stuff when you write your way in the
city when you arrive just unplug a coupe
it's that easy and all your data are
saved in the cloud we've been working on
a coup for almost two years from Arduino
to our own PCBs from 3d printing to real
prototypes we've tried various design
and tested many docking systems
electronic has been tested improved and
integrated with mechanical parts iq is
ready for industrialization and we have
a pre-contract with reliable
manufacturers with years of bike
experience and the feedback of androids
of psychics we created a bike assistance
that improve the daily life of urban
bikers we need your help to make by
computer something of the past and give
birth to icons a next generation of bike
assistant that communicates with your
smartphone and yet respects your I join
the ride supporters and pre-order iku at
a great price please share this campaign
with your sickies friend and see you on
the road
