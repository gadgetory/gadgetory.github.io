reimagined intruders are unfortunate
fact in our lives and we do our best to
secure and protect their homes from some
dickheads breaking in now people have a
lot of possibilities when it comes to
protecting their homes you can buy home
alarm systems for a few hundred bucks or
even lease one for small fee every month
the company you lease it from might even
install it for you for little or no
costs and then you can also get yourself
wireless systems and to save some money
you can even install it yourself all you
need is pretty much a drill and some
guidelines introducing Finnerty the most
cost effective home personal and
neighborhood security solution on the
market when I say cost-effective
I mean it's cheaper than anything else
on the market with no hidden extra fees
and compared to this guy it's only a
fraction of the cost and the size for
that matter and you won't need any
drills or guidelines just put the
batteries in
download the fur nuria and finish the
installation takes no more than 30
seconds and this guy he could go back to
doing what he does best which is winning
strongman competitions and of course
best known for and last but not least go
back to being strong considerate
motherfucker now let's take a quick look
how it works I live in a small flat and
therefore 1/4 note is enough for me but
if you live in a big flat or a house
then no worries just buy more fur notice
and place them around the house then
connect them all together through the
app the finale is made to be simple
therefore there are no physical buttons
on it everything is built into the app
so when I come home I get a reminder to
turn the alarm off the system is even so
smart that it allows me to schedule the
time of day it should automatically be
turned on or off now if there would be
an intruder coming in and not me this is
what would happen I told you before that
fenoli was the most cost effective home
personal and neighborhood security
solution on the market and when I say
neighborhood I mean the whole
neighborhood can help each other out
dealing with unwanted intruders the
amazing Icelandic summer you can easily
connect with your neighbours via the app
so they get notified if some fucker is
breaking into your house why because if
you're chilling in the summer house far
away from home and you for nobody goes
blasting your neighbor can check your
home for you because your neighbor is
much faster reaching your house than any
security company or the police now let
me tell you how far nobody can help you
with your personal security you might
get into the circumstances where you
need immediate assistance you know that
kind of circumstances what you normally
scream for help
but what if nobody can hear you oh
you're not able to scream at all just
whip out your phone open up the phone or
the app and press panic and the people
in your network closest to your location
get notified that you need help and you
can rest assure that somebody will come
to the rescue
hi my name is Enzo I know you love
simple life focusing on a variable
matters how awesome is it mochi is
simple and awesome just like you
we found the keyboard and mouse are
never used simultaneously our Kissin was
why not share the space the simplicity
can be acquired simply but finally we
found the best solution mochi provides
you with the best typing experience by a
slim pantograph keyboard thin and safe
laser sensors generate a large optical
touchpad at the exact moment you want to
use it bluetooth low energy technology
assures an extended battery life the
gorgeous aluminium body makes mochi more
slim and durable the cover of mochi not
only protects the keyboard from damage
but also it turns into a portable device
staff
of course mochi never compromises its
style for great performance
we're proud to share with you today a
product we've been developing it's glow
the first smart headphones that glow
with laser light music inherently is a
very expressive medium and having light
synchronize with music makes that whole
experience much better now I think
that's where glow really stands out it's
a pair of headphones but it's also
something that builds up that musical
expression through the form of light the
first time we saw fibrian's fiber after
wire was really incredible that vibrance
is just super vibrant it looks like
something I've never seen before like
something magical the expression
actually went back to a childhood
when the movies we used to watch and
books we used to read it was portrayed
light and lasers as sort of the future
the first time we were actually able to
see laser wire in the form of fibroids
wire and we got the idea that maybe we
can use this to actually create a
product with it and that's where we
thought the idea of about the headphone
is that sort of a natural connection of
the glowing wire with a pair of
headphones and have the wire glow to the
music with glow we've actually provided
five buttons to be able to control your
music prior headphone designs don't give
you that flexibility they're a lot more
complicated because they only have a
single button glow has a tight
integration with the Android platform so
we're able to use and leverage that
platform to do very cool things for
example I can take a picture by hitting
the center button or I can even trigger
Google now and use voice actions to
control my phone it wasn't enough that
we built an expressive pair of
headphones we wanted the audio quality
to be absolutely amazing
we've come up with a lot of unique
designs such as the negative profile
which allows you to even take a nap with
your headphones we also chose a in-ear
design because it minimizes the external
interference of the sound which allows
the music to be a lot more crisp and
have deeper bass over the last few
months we've been building a fully
working prototype and we're there but
now we need your help to take glow from
a prototype to final manufacturing to be
able to bring this to market it's not
enough that we have a fully working
prototype we need the backing of the
community we need the Kickstarter
community thank you for taking the time
out to watch this video we're super
excited about this technology these
headphones and we hope you're as excited
as we are
do you have the same problem I do you
arrange the furniture in your home just
the way you like it but you can't move
the light switches so now you need to
call an electrician hey Kevin hey man
what's up
I need that light switch changed that
one that one I want a light switch right
here so I won't fall off the bed anymore
and I can turn on the light switch right
now whoa how did you do that I also have
a toddler and I would like to switch
lower so he can reach it and I can turn
on the switch like this you used to
think I need to tear out pieces of the
wall and run additional wires but now
this is no longer necessary you just
need to open the package no setting
replace the existing light switch with
this base switch then you can put the
gecko switch wherever you want
and it's done
you can place an icon lets you know what
the geckos switch controls here
there are many icons to select from the
LED behind the icon lets you know when
the light is on or off make the bedroom
light gradually brighten to wake you up
or make it to turn off with the time
delay 3 to 1 if you can't find the Gecko
switch use the search function and it
will beep oh here it is hey do it now
switch it up with the gecko switch and
make your home and life exactly the way
you like it
