and
Ryan Nicodemus and together we are the
minimalists and you know what we decided
to finally make a thing it's a bag it's
a really really awesome bag what it's
really cool
we were gonna wait to tell them we were
actually gonna tell them in the video Oh
perfect well let's start the video for
the better part of the last decade we've
traveled all over the world talking with
people about our simple living story and
we've learned a lot of lessons
throughout our years of travel one of
the biggest lessons we learned was this
our oversized suitcases were weighing us
down we tried just about every bag you
can imagine but they were either too
small or too large too awkward but then
our friend Colin introduced us to this
travel bag designed by a guy named
Malcolm Fon ta it was a duffle bag a
carry-on bag a messenger bag a laptop
bag and a suitcase all in one but
Malcolm made only 300 of these bags Josh
and I we were lucky enough to buy one
yeah but there was a problem because
everywhere we would travel we're on the
road people would come up to us and they
would say hey where do I get that bag
but there weren't any more left and then
we got an interesting phone call hey
guys it's Malcolm fun 2 yet after seeing
your documentary minimalism people keep
asking me about my bag I want to bring
it back but I need your help we knew how
much value that bag had added to our
lives and so we decided to what we
wanted to give mal con the hand and
bringing it back and making it even
better so many of us have traveled the
world with these bags that there's
certain things that we've learned that
can be implemented in the version 2 to
make it even that much better the good
news is that is already 98% there here's
the packed one a collaboration between
Malcolm Fon ta and the minimalists
the pact one has the same unique zip
around dual compartment design that
provides the versatility of a duffel
with a pack ability and organization of
a suitcase we reviewed every detail of
the bag and carefully added new features
to ensure all your belongings are easy
to pack and access after going through
hundreds of security checkpoints and
thinking about how our bag can help you
navigate them we added a TSA pocket use
it to securely stash all the things you
have to remove from your pockets instead
of using a bin the padded laptop pocket
is placed in the center of the bag so
your clothing adds additional protection
yet still allows quick access in keeping
with our ethos there are no logos on the
exterior of the bag as conscious
consumers we source modern durable
materials that are animal friendly and
have the lowest possible environmental
impact
we designed the original as the ultimate
travel bag that we wanted but couldn't
find you know this is truly the best bag
that we've ever used that's why it's the
one and only physical good that bears
the minimalists name so if you're ready
to purchase the only bag that you'll
ever want we think that this is the one
but truth be told I'm gonna tell you you
probably don't need a new bag and if you
don't please don't feel compelled to
purchase this one you will be just fine
without it
we love adventure and every time we head
out we bring our devices with us
smartphones action cameras radio
speakers we'd love and depend on these
devices but they need power constantly
and if you've ever worried about water
damaging your electronics or cracking
the screen of your phone then you know
how important protection is
dark energy proudly presents the
solution this is where the Poseidon was
born we created it so you can push your
limits
it's Reckitt and its water food so you
can do whatever you want whenever you
want you never know what's going to
happen on an adventure and that's why
when the port covers are closed this
device is fully protected from the
elements it has a rating of ip68 the
maximum in the IP standard the fully
dustproof fully waterproof but hey
sometimes life just happens and you
forget to close those port covers that's
why we waterproof the device
even on the pins
so you can rest easy
knowing that your device is safe even in
awareness and when you're out exploring
new heights and blazing new trails your
gear gets beat up you need power that
can take a beating the beside in
features ultra strength corners designed
specifically to take drops that would
annihilate
it also offers a built-in guard that
provides complete
our electronics are completely isolated
or vibration in chakra support this is
why the Poseidon passes the military
standard
we use a lightweight ultra durable
hybrid polymer blend which gives you the
highest performance with minimal weight
and size and maximum durability the
Poseidon features our patented diamond
tech grip pattern and a rubber like
material that sticks to your hand the
need for power and adventure type
situations is widespread and we tried
existing solutions on our own adventures
they promised a lot of power but never
quite delivered in a real-world setting
with that in mind the Poseidon was
designed with a true 8,000 milliamp hour
rated capacity with himself the Poseidon
delivers record performance and a
meticulously designed compact and
go venture into the unknown and see what
you're capable of the Poseidon is ready
for adventure I do into sports yeah I
really like inline it you know wind and
hair my favorite song the freedom
well except for those heavy shoes I've
got a hole in my backpack and what about
hiking sure I love hiking being out in
nature is where I can unwind and get new
ideas it's just really a drag lugging
around less heavy boots all day then why
don't we use Skinner's water Skinner's
Skinner's the most ultra portable
Footwear in the world also I mean
they're like super cool
Skinner's are light yet very durable
they fit into your pocket don't slip and
have a cooling effect and best of all
seriously yep you can throw them in the
washer
scanners were designed to be one
anywhere anytime like an hour wedding
okay well almost any time if you're
tired of carrying an extra pair of shoes
with you all the time
try Skinner's they're lightweight
portable comfort simply put its Footwear
tuned to perfection I get it so I can
have Skinner's with me all the time like
when we take a trip to Japan again
exactly the threat you can take them
pretty much anywhere hi Kickstarter I'm
Peter and here at Skinner's we spend the
last 18 months developing a better
alternative to your heavy clunky
Footwear many of us were learning travel
or exercise
well we found an easier way both for you
and your feet our patent-pending
technology says goodbye to glues and
themes that could fall apart over time
Skinner's are manufactured in Europe
using the finest Swedish materials with
a dual coding of extra durable anti
abrasive polymer and we tested them all
over the world in all kinds of
conditions to make sure they can keep up
with you wherever you go
we even have guys running marathons in
them long story short very excited with
how Skinner's turned out and the way
they feel and protect your feet and
people are surprised to see how
something so simple can be so durable
the next step is to give more people the
chance to experience Skinner's for
themselves and to do that we need your
help simply put Skinner's are designed
to be small to functional as you are
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
