speed at which heartbeat generated waves
move along the arteries stiff arteries

speeds with proper diet and exercise
anyone can decrease pulse wave velocity
and improve cardiovascular health body
cardio brings this unique medical metric
home each heartbeat causes a slight
weight variation and propagates a wave
to the feed the ability to detect both
events allows body cardio to compute
pulse wave velocity at every weigh-in
with its tempered glass and solid
aluminum base body cardio is the
thinnest most stable scale available and
it's highly accurate on any surface body
