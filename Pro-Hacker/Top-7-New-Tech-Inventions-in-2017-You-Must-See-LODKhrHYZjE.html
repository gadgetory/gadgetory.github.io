engineers and cyclists with a clear goal
make cycling safer it's amazing to see
how many people have joined us through
the beginning of our journey we are
doing one year working on our first
project
malinka we cyclists are the most
vulnerable users of the road to wheels
to balance no trash is to protect us and
we still need to use our hands to
communicate with cars blinkers is the
one thing that was missing for cycling
could be safer and to be a natural power
of control it starts with the regular
bike light that you know the blinkers
actually backed everything you need to
be seen on the street and respected by
everyone else in the world with blinkers
cars will always know when you are
turning and when you are braking
a laser projection makes it even more
visible and allows cars to understand
better what is your space and what is
their space blinkers were designed to
fit in your life has no button turns on
a semantic luckily blinkers also has a
powerful battery and it's very easy to
recharge
blinkers is the ultimate safety solution
for sight
tell me go go we have been a long
journey but it's thanks to all the
people that has join us that we made it
so far we just successful Kickstarter
last year in which we use the funds to
take the product to the level where we
are now within up with Sookie a top
Swiss engineering company for the
technical development of the product in
which we take linkers to a stage that
it's very for serial production and
that's not what we come to in the lower
within your support to be there as push
to blinkers and make it a reality
let's make cycling safer

put in fresh loft 300% a stylized all
young touch portable romantic
ready for the next revolution and 3d
storytelling
introducing Syd Syd delivers the most
stable 3d experience ever compared to
any other 3d video cameras today we have
researched and tested other 3d cameras
and most of them promise stability and
shooting but can't deliver Syd is
portable for photographers lightweight
for adventurers and convenient for
content creators that lack of stability
creates a lot of dizziness and is no fun
for VR headset Syd promises stability
making the experience that more
immersive whence it is combined with a
smartphone and a gimbal users can see
the real-time image and control the
camera through the app on their phone
making the experience convenient much
more stable and even more immersive than
ever before you can also edit and share
your stories easily on this did
application it can be used to livestream
by simply connecting to your PC tablet
or smartphones
it can also add a rfx to your video
livestream with Syd you don't have to
worry about carrying bulky 3d systems
it's ready to use in seconds and you can
take professional looking photos with
that wiggling background
it is a revolution
you
Oh
me
this is
the
Michelin a better way forward
you
oh my god girl would come to me in the
party you have to go go like oh no I
with all the UM I'll hit you later girls

what is this only the world's strongest
cable
unlike other phone cable companies we
won't speculate that you can lift weight
from our cable after all why don't you
want to do that
how are we for anger to the real test
come on let me show you what I mean go
wrong rib this should be library welcome
to a collab this device here we'll be
testing our cables by then you get 90
degrees both ways at a rate of 60 beds
per minute
see how the law school we could be
heroes but hey let's take it easy
so for the final thing let's see what
people can withstand the forces beyond a
snap as you can see our cables are
harder better faster
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
