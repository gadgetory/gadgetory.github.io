Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
the
Oh
you
Oh
you
you're careful about eating healthy food
and drinking clean water but what about
the air you breathe do you realize that
you actually ingest 12 times more air
than food and five times more than water
introducing the supremo personal air
monitor a key chain sized air monitor
that plugs into your iPhone and lets you
see what you smell the app gives you
real-time readings temperature humidity
and air quality based on precision
measurements of volatile organic
compounds a coloring number scale tells
you the quality of the air around you
opt in to our community and share your
results and contribute to a worldwide
real time air quality map we are
constantly surrounded by toxins in the
air around us from common products like
cleaners and dirty clothes to smog
pollution secondhand smoke paint and at
waste the most obvious results are the
one in 12 people who suffer from asthma
or the more than half of Americans who
live in areas with unhealthy air quality
but in reality almost everyone is
subjected to for air quality at some
point during the day stream L can
monitor your air wherever you are or
confirm your suspicions so you can do
something about it hello my name is dr.
TJ oswyn you know after 23 years in
practice one of the things that I have
found out that it separates sick people
from healthy people is that healthy
people know their numbers if you don't
know your blood pressure you're going to
have heart issues if you don't know is
the numbers about what's in the air that
you breathe you're going to have
breathing issues that's why I find that
a personal air monitor is absolutely
required for people to be healthy
supremo keeps you informed whether
you're at work home school
outside a bar salon restaurant where the
airport screamo was founded by ray combs
and Harold hon Ray has helped bring
about products like the palm pilot and
Amazon Kindle and is passionate about
improving indoor air quality to help his
son who has asthma Harold has been
studying chemistry for years at New York
University where he got his PhD and
hails from China where air pollution in
many cities makes it impossible to go
outside thus primo air monitor let's you
be fully aware of those deep breaths
you're taking me spree mo is helping
people breathe easy Wow the air quality
here so great today okay everyone let's
take a deep breath
president this is awesome childhood as a
Holy Grail about reality but what is
present if presents just feeling like
you're in another world well no I think
that's the bare minimum for me true
presence is about being a part of this
other world being aware of it as it
isn't here unwelcome Wilson CTO and
co-founder or foe and we are presenting
to you the world's first consumer I
tracking vote reality has not displayed
one of the keys to this is our eyes
communications for the first time
virtual characters will perceive your
game how about you lock eyes with a
monster stand down well how about share
a moment of eye contact with a fellow
hero a heroine before they dive into
peril gaze our natural human reaction
will become a trigger for modern
storytelling and expand possibility of
an interactive cinema tube even in the
field of healthcare we enabled a boy
with muscular dystrophy to play music
with his eyes and a 90 year old
grandmother used our systems remotely
attempt two grandsons wedding by a robot
when she could not control aim with your
eyes accurately and faster than with any
other controller this could give you a
killer edge in intense action game ally
tracking works as a speed of law
both can enable a magical you I
experience where the information you're
looking for in front of your eyes before
you even know it depth-of-field a key to
presence is the sense of immersion by
rendering realistic depth of field is a
phobia region and appropriately blurring
the periphery when Soviet of rendering
is properly adopted in the future it was
impossible to focus the GPU power where
the user is looking greatly reducing
your overall power required to render a
scene with no perceptible reduction in
quality we built a specialized
state-of-the-art I tracking solution
into a solid via hardware platform that
boasts forty-two percent more pixels the
current mainstream pc hudson we back all
this off with our own compositing sdk
and open the r and o sv our support to
leverage existing content and ensure
developers don't waste their time
developing for a closed ecosystem as a
firm developer you'll have access to
potentially up to 25 million users per
month at 7,000 internet cafes across
Japan and Korea but using our head not
display format I NPCs we have finally
finished something that everyone here at
focus product and we are getting ready
to ship our first love to Kickstarter
backers and then to you vr developers
around the world interested in creating
new experience
let's push the boundaries of what is
possible other realities of our knees
together oh the air falls it falls back
on
