we wanted to design something beautiful
of course but we also wanted something
useful we understand that some people
love their music so then it's very
important more important than taking the
medication often but what Ted's well
with music oh that's right headphone yes
what people decide to put into their own
air holes is a very personal choice and
it's a choice we should all get the
chance to make not one that should be
made for us that's why we made fuse it's
a case made specifically for the iphone
7 and 7 plus but it's not just a cake
it's also the first case with a 3.5
millimeter audio jack to lighting
adapter built in time to rock out with
you are set that's right with feud you
can use your favorite earbud or headset
that you already have with the iphone
senate adapters on rock and roll rubbish
having to wear the same ear but does
everybody else isn't rock'n'roll airport
God bloody rock and roll you know what
is being able to do whatever the hell
you want with your gear fuse is an
iphone case something Apple CEO Tim Cook
says every iphone 7 user should use but
it's so much more than that Apple is
trying to kill the headphone jack and
that's something that affects all of us
there are dozens of uses for the port
beyond music there are credit card
readers thermometers microphone adult
toys and even blood monitor some people
even use it to make sure they don't die
you don't want this grandma to die do
you of course you do and neither do we
now what we can't say that Apple remove
the audio jack because it wants to kill
people all these

scenario the fuses the device that can
quite literally save line and unlike the

one would have ever thought that life
would become a giant collection of
digital files this ever-increasing
amount of digital information is your
history your memories your life where do
you store it how do you keep it safe we
can't count on our hardware devices they
break they get stolen or we lose them
and our lifetime of photos and personal
information goes with them we all love
the cloud it makes sure our information
stays intact even when our devices don't
but we also fear the cloud our entire
digital life is somewhere else in
someone else's hand
what if they wanted to sell your data or
steal your identity or use your bank
information what if they could see or
duplicate your photos or find out where
you live it's important to remember that
what gets uploaded to the cloud stays in
the cloud even if you delete your copies
they're out there forever but what if
you had a small easy-to-use device that
encrypted all your cloud storage data at
the source so your files would appear
jumbled unreadable to everyone but you
there is such a device it's called Smith
and it's built for people like you who
love the clouds but need to make one
hundred percent sure that no one will
ever see your data Smith Pro is the only
cloud privacy device designed and priced
for personal use it automatically
encrypts your information before it
leaves your home or office or wherever
you are you get a light portable device
and a single startup scene all you need
to do is create an account and choose
your cloud providers that's it you're up
and encrypting all of your cloud stored
data even if someone did try to access
or view your information in the cloud
all they would see is encrypted data it
would be of absolutely no value or
interest to them at all one total
privacy in the cloud just plug in your
