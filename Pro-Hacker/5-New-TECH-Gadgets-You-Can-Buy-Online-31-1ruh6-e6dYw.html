users with weak cell signal issues
introducing the EM juice agree in one
case the case for better signal coverage
giving you stronger signal juice 100%
battery boost and an attractive case
that is drought proof our breakthrough
patented technology solves the weak
signal problem you'll see more bars and
more places by simply turning on the amp
and placing a call to see the bars go up
the industry's first cell signal
amplifying technology in a case with 100
times signal strength our case creates a
better handshake with the tower so you
get stronger signals for federal
reception and clearer calls where ever
your thread zones are I spent seven
years working as a mechanic so I saw
firsthand the kind of handheld lights
and area lights that were being used
they were cheap with dim underpowered
bulbs and flimsy construction I'd
constantly be buying new ones because
they always fell apart even with newer
LED lights the electronics often broke
creating an unreliable light I remember
thinking then that car shops deserved a
better life and so did truckers
electricians first responders anyone
else who works with their hands when I
started working at the gas solution I
knew this was a project that I wanted to
pursue I came up with a rough concept a
handheld area light that was bright
cordless portable durable a light that
was over engineered to stand up to years
of abuse and harsh condition I pitched
the idea to our CEO Carrie Smith and he
actually encouraged me to pursue this
project and see where it led and now
after two years and countless hours of
work we have the big-ass light bar
we wanted a life that was bright as hell
with 5,000 lumen at maximum output it's
everything you need up to 48 hours of
continuous light on battery power the
light bar itself is made of a chemically
resistant die tell glass filled nylon
that means that you can spray it off
with common chemicals the shape of the
light itself was actually designed to
prevent it from rolling away if you
dropped it or set it on the hood of a
car with this ip66 rating you can take
it outside and not worry if it gets
rained up we know that you were going to
toss around the life on so we over
molded it in key areas with the
technology called first deflect to be
shock absorbent
now we're closer than ever to making the
big-ass light bars or realities we need
your help for the final stage the
production if your assistance will be
able to begin manufacturing and start
shipping the light bars to all
contractors first responders soldiers
police officers and anyone else who
demands a product that they can take to
hell invest in return you'll be the
first customers to receive the
revolutionary big-ass light bar this has
been a passionate project to me it's
something that I've worked on for years
and I'm very proud of what we've come up
with it is absolutely the best handheld
area light in the world bar none
hello key service
what is Sylvia struggling gene it is
cause computers in your outside or do it
as a different program area we have
something to show you each a possibility
and each of us crazy tough it's the most
anonymous our convenient our daily life
it's not a directive makes a big report
operable they are many differently
impressed available space but they all
have the minis in are often not suitable
to be used in Scenario best press the
universe for where computer network
lands animating principle is easier
zucchini just been with the brush
which is the word like a bowl and put
perfectly onto all engine services it
doesn't matter if it is a small cool
vehicle owners authenticate items
there's attachment boxes the places were
small parts like toy swing needles or
food can be cleaned in no time at all it
used to be very time-consuming to clean
them in the future using duct approach
all kinds of boxes holding small parts
can be simply awakened out nothing will
be sucked away and no small part will
get lost
boxes and contents will be quickly and
easily clean with little apart in the
car also similar difficult areas to
clean colorless movies when you later
clear up keeps rags trays keep crashing
all these areas can be cleaned before
this new accessories dust brush back to
work on deep within grasp enriches and
fits perfectly between the seat cushions
the small area between the window and
the door prevents will be effectively
clean even the dirty area between the
seat cracks into the smallest knocks and
crannies can be easily cleaned some of
the biggest off collectors are electric
equipment especially computers that's
collects on them they overhead and do
not perform well in combination with the
anti-static collar
we can use that to brush to remove the
dust without compressed air or special
equipment difficult to reach areas will
be easily freed from the even cables and
sensitive electronics can be cleaned
this way with no problem at the same
time no doc gets out into the
surrounding area your PC will thank you
even our best friends are also glad to
the dust occurs over time lose hair and
vacuum self medica third doctor brush
can work in the hair and skin cells
simply out of the firm the cubes act
like a brush and comb buckler at the
same time after several usages the
surface not smoother there's enough
action when you spin the fur clothes and
direction to wake them up the best games
left without us to touch attaching a
star to the clear the cubes remove lows
hair on your pants support can squeeze
into the room
instead it gets sucked directly into the
vacuum cleaner
that is really great that's personal
you know they love me including every
area that immerses contractors - with
interface developed in Germany and
abusing director doesn't drop a
dashboard 100% brief enjoyment - fill me
with that restaurant areata - want new
ideas incandescent and at all paula has
to meet your health particularly these I
thought to be dust buster lightly has
asked make your home cleaner and
healthier thank you hi I'm ed Shemp and
I just sharpen this knife with the knife
robot
it's nice that it's very similar into
the methods that I use using belts to
sharpen blades
it is CNC machine so the repeatability
is wonderful
it's a great tool
in today's world we are surrounded by
the multiple electronic lights that we
need for everyday life we charge the
batteries at home and at work even when
we sleep the regular charger violently
continues to push the power into the
battery even when it is already full
keeping chargers plugged in when they're
not being used consumes unnecessary
energy and shortens battery life and
increases the risk of fire through
overheating luckily there's a solution
bright charger is a brand new invention
from Finland it's a beautifully designed
charger which saves energy and at the
same time it's most gentle for your
device's bright charger automatically
stops drawing power from the outlet when
the battery is charged after this it
functions as a soft LED light at current
rates the amount of mobile devices
worldwide will top 10 billion in 2017
what if we could just stop wasting all
this energy while we still can
besides wrecking nature it's wrecking
your own wallet as well batteries can
only be charged for a limited amount of
time before they become totally useless
why is this consider normal why spend
hundreds of dollars on your phone just
to buy a new one within a couple of
years we all know how unpredictable worn
out batteries indeed
especially at low temperatures when
you're just chilling out in the
wilderness bright charger makes it easy
to save energy and money since your
devices can finally be charged the way
they were designed to no more worrying
about forgetting to bug your charger
from night bright charger makes it easy
to increase the safety and quality of
your life and at the same time the life
of our planet with our normal charging
habits switching to the bright charger
it would save huge amounts of energy
worldwide and at the same time it would
give some safety to you and your device
after all the hope for a brighter future
is all we have
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
