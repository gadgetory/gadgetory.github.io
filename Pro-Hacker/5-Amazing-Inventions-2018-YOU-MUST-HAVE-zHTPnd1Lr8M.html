like I could never go back definitely
worth trying it's affordable for
everybody's household I thought it was
the coolest thing there was hey
everybody my name is James Amburgey I'm
marketing director at bio bidet
at bio bidet we're really focused on
offering products that enhance the
beauty and function of your home after
the success of our first Kickstarter
campaign America proved that it was
ready to move towards a cleaner
healthier lifestyle an alternative to
toilet paper we got a lot of feedback
during that time and we heard things
like what if I don't have an outlet in
my bathroom or what about a non electric
version it's been eight months and I'm
excited to announce the latest bio the
day project introducing the slim zero
you get a lot of great features with
this product you get a dual nozzle you
get adjustable water pressure soft
closing seat soft closing lid and best
of all something that we've newly
developed a battery-operated nightlight
this is a product that speaks for itself
we hear all the time from new customers
I didn't know a product like this exists
or why don't I try this sooner we wanted
to design a product that was for
everyone for every home simple easy to
use with plenty of features you don't
need to call a plumber you don't need to
call an electrician fifteen minutes
later with a quick easy DIY install
you're done so the great thing about the
slim zero and the dual nozzles is that
you get our effective posterior wash and
then you also have the option for a
softer front feminine wash one of the
things I'm most excited about with this
project is the high and low staged
nightlight you've got two different
brightnesses to choose from so it gives
you that additional flexibility for a
night time you don't have to worry about
you know having a bright light on or
keeping your partner up or keeping
yourself up it gives you options it
gives you flexibility it comes with
everything you need to get the product
installed we've got a user manual plus
we have resources like our service team
is happy to help if you call in or we
also have videos that you can watch the
complete installation buy of the day is
10 years old and we've been offering
these products the entire time so we're
really interested when we meet customers
and they say things like wow why didn't
I try this sooner or where have you been

got a great team here in Crystal Lake
Illinois completely dedicated to
bringing these products to people and

world why water does it better
technology has transformed our world
forever it's how we keep in touch with
friends and family I was sharing most
precious moments and now we explore the
world so we find answers and learn new
things invites us to wonder and ask
questions technologies allowed us to
overcome every obstacle in boundary
connecting people and ideas from around
the world uniting us and bringing us
closer together but what about our data
think about it more information about
our lives is being collected than any
other time in history every day we rely
on services that have failed us time and
time again from getting hacked to the
misuse and selling of private
information it seems almost impossible
to keep our data safe but what if we
didn't have to give it up at all last
year we came to you with an idea with
your support we were able to build
software and shipped thousands of
devices that has improved online
security for individuals and businesses
