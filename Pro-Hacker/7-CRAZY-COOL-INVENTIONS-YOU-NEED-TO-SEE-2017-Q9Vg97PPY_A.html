phone out for every little thing what if
there was a simpler way to interact with
your devices flick is a wireless button
that connects to your iOS or Android
device so instead of going through your
phone you simply press the button that's
better I use the flick app to set it up
and then I can stick flick wherever I
want
I can even share this flick with my
roommate so he can use it when I'm not
around the flick isn't just for your
house
you can stick your flicks anywhere like
in your car or on your bike
that's great
it's really cool
your destination is on the left
and you can clip your flakes it's great
for any situation where you need a quick
and discreet shortcut me me me
like now oh I'm so sorry I have to take
this but flight can be so much more than
just a shortcut to your phone it could
be integrated with lots of different
services beyond your devices check this
one out
take the old cabbie when I get home I
want everything to just take care of
itself
Shh movies starting
another great feature of flick is that
it can be used as a safety device with
just a push of a button you can send
live updates of your location or even a
distress signal to your family and
friends first me and the Flik team
alright you guys ready yeah one two
three
flick hi
we're Swedish team that's been working
for almost two years to create flick and
we're really excited to finally show it
to you we've gone through a hardware
incubator in San Francisco we traveled
all across Europe and China to finalize
design and to find the right partners we
have developed a flake app to be super
simple to set up
just open your app press the button and
select the function that you need we
also have an easy software development
kit that allows other apps to work with
flaky
we already have some amazing apps that
will work with flick already from the
start and now we need your help to make
this all happen in order to bring flick
to the market and into your hands we
need to fund the tooling and
certifications that are needed in return
for your contribution will send you the
very first flakes ever made thank you
for watching hope you enjoyed the video
this is air block a one-of-a-kind
programmable transformable drone and
hovercraft think you've seen a drone
like this
think again air block is unlike any
drone you've seen before
start with individual magnetic pieces
and 15 seconds later you have a drone
control the drone through the app via
bluetooth and take to the sky in no time
air block is amazing not just because
it's entertaining but also because it's
educational it teaches kids and big kids
about coding and aerodynamics use
pre-programmed maneuvers within the app
just drag and drop into action air block
caters to every type of drone pilot want
to try your own moves program your own
aerial stunts right in the app have some
cool ideas of your own air block allows
you to DIY so you can build your very
own creation from scratch with air block
you're not just constrained for the air
take to the land or sea by transforming
your drone into a hovercraft and hover
over smooth ground or even over water
rookie killing your vibe and your drone
totally fine air block is tough so you
can fly and bump into obstacles without
fear the engineered plastic foam makes
air block durable so it's safe to fly
indoors or out snap into action and keep
flying so who's behind this awesome
product we are and who are we make block
we've launched and shipped four products
on Kickstarter and have grown from just
three people to a team of 200 people
today we've got 400,000 users and still
growing in the past four years we've
established ourselves as the company
that encourages stem-based education
through our DIY robotics and products
we're passionate about bringing DIY
robotics and stem based programming and
education to folks like you we need your
help to get air block off the ground so
back to the point you want a
programmable transformable rational
drone will make it easy for you back our
Kickstarter campaign and the best part
it's affordable because let's face it
everyone should have air block support
the cause and get your
err block code to fly this is the print
pocket turn your phone essentially into
a Polaroid camera snapping a photo and
printing out a physical version of that
image instantaneously that's cool
it's a photo right it's a little
shareable photo it's a sticker on the
back the app itself allows you to look
at an image and it plays a video clip
that can trigger a video clip from the
moments surrounding that actual image
the magic happens in this moment here
and I'll just hold it over top like this
and watch this
you see that but here's the crazy part
if I pick this image up it goes with me
as I move this around the image
maintains the magic
Oh
honestly when you see it happen in real
time it has a really magical feeling to
it a little bit of old school in the
sense of having an instant photo but
then a ton of new school with the
augmented reality and the ability to
look around and move the object right
you can imagine like a fridge full of
these things with all your various
memories I could just stand it like this
with you app and all of the data is
encoded into the frame go ahead
experiment yourself old school meets new
it's all happening here
hey Kickstarter my name is a cheetah and
I'm ranchers and we are the creators of
a nerve react a nerve react is the
world's first intelligent stove safety
device that attaches directly to your
existing knobs and recognizes potential
threats turn your stove off before it's
too late
how many of you have ever left food
cooking on the stove for too long and
ended up with smoke everywhere or even a
fire or left your house then just
wondered whether you left the stove on
if you've never left your stove on
before you may wonder whether this is
even a problem that needs a solution the
kitchen is the center of our homes
it's where so much of life happens
spending time with loved ones preparing
food and sharing meals with so much
happening it's easy to forget something
as simple as turning off your stove if
we're not careful something terrible can
happen I know because it happened to me
in the United States alone there are
over 350 7,000 house fires each year
that's one house fire every 85 seconds
these house fires caused almost 13,000
injuries per year and seven deaths every
day and cooking equipment is the most
common cause how many of these can be
prevented with a nerve react a nerve
react uses a combination of sensors and
electronics within these units to turn
your stove off when a hazardous
situation is detected over for one even
arises attach your existing knobs to the
device or use them as your new knobs and
place the sensor unit on a ceiling above
this unit is the brains of the device
and houses a gas sensor and smoke
detector which when activated signaled
the knob unit to turn off the burner
this unit also contains a motion sensor
that's linked to a timer and the knob
unit you select the time interval you
want using the touch sensor or you can
use a default setting if no motion is
detected in the vicinity of your stove
during that time interval the knob will
activate and turn your stove off a nerve
reacts novel design allows it to work on
any gas or electric stove and attach two
knobs of all shapes and sizes and if
you're away from home the smart phone
app allows you to check whether your
stove is on and turn it off if needed
you can even adjust the temperature of
your stove to ensure your food doesn't
overcook hair at a nerve we're
passionate about creating innovative
solutions to problems that affect your
well-being and safety every day our team
has worked incredibly hard this past
year to bring a nerve react to life
designing it to be as efficient as
possible while creating it to look great
in any home but now we need your help to
take the final step and get this
revolutionary device into
every home and onto every stove so
please back us and help us reach
millions of people like you who want to
keep their home and loved one safe we
hope in their react we'll provide you
with the peace of mind you deserve
together we can help to prevent the
devastating effects caused by house
fires thank you
this is the cue ball it's a hard rubber
reaction ball with a moderately erratic
bounce that means if I bounce it to
waist height it will deflect up to 18
inches horizontally forces me to watch
and react to each and every bounce but
it's not too erratic I don't have to
chase it all over the room so I can
bounce the ball really quickly faster I
go the more challenging it is but it
also keeps me at the best of my ability
and keeps my brain fully focused my mind
wanders I'm going to drop this ball
there are two core elements are
exercises to be done using the cue ball
the first is called bouncing catch you
take one or two cue balls and you bounce
them to waist height alternating hands
as you go you try to go as fast as you
can you count how many bounces you can
do in 60 seconds to keep track of how
you're progressing it trains I hand
coordination vision and reaction time
the faster the better the next exercise
trains peripheral vision if you think
about it the center of our vision the
one we used to read with is really quite
small
everything else is peripheral vision so
we can train that we expand our visual
awareness there's very little on the
market that will do that but the cue
ball does it really fast and efficiently
and that this is how it works
you do the same exercise again but this
time instead of watching the balls as
you bounce them you fix your focus on a
point on the ground and you bounce the
cue balls around that fixed point
they're erratic and they're bouncing and
they're small you have to track it with
your peripheral vision and catch it with
your hands you know increase your
confidence in the ability to do that and
as you do it faster and more your brain
will automate that skill so you don't
have to think about it anymore you will
just react and you'll react quickly the
cue ball adapts to anyone's skill level
you can go slow or you can go fast it'll
work with children as young as five
years old all the way to the elderly
it'll make driving your car a better
experience you'll be able to see more of
what's going on around you if you're an
athlete you'll be able to see hit and
catch better if you're a student or an
adult you'll just simply get better at
eye hand coordination you'll see better
and your reaction times will become much
faster by some cue balls and try these
exercises you'll be amazed at the
results follow me on Facebook follow me
on Twitter there's lots more information
where this came from thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
