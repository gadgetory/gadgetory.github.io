the idea for sense reax was a long-term
dream to interact with the virtual world
in a natural way use your hands your
feet your whole body and a couple of
years ago I came across prosthesis
that's when we decided to come together
and found a company the system works by
combining multiple sensor types by
actually taking the best features of
each sensors and combine them fuse them
in a certain way that we actually have a
very precise system and which allows you
to fully immerse in the in virtual
content
the most important feature that we
wanted our system to have is the very
precise tracking of the hands not only
positioning but also finger movements we
think that our technology will
revolutionize virtual reality because it
really makes interaction natural so you
don't have to learn the buttons of
control but you really can use your
hands to interact with virtual reality
our system actually is the only one
right now that is mobile that allows you
to use your hands the hand might not
always be in the line of sight so it
might manipulate something which is out
of of your view basically we wanted to
have the possibility to incorporate
different movements as well so even
footsteps to actually move in the
virtual reality immersion is
particularly important because it
connects the user to the virtual reality
so you're not just playing you avatar
you really become Dan
augmented reality will certainly enrich
our lives by adding information in your
surrounding you're actually not changed
to any location or computer you can take
it everywhere and let virtual
information pop up you can then interact
with this information
my ambition for sensor X is that we get
this the system out in the in the field
and actually let people use it and to
immerse in into virtual reality the
dream for motion capture I think has
been out there for a long time and now
finally with the Ascension of head
mounted devices different types of
sensors and experts like Miko and roll I
think we have reached a level where you
can actually implement it it is really a
paradigm change it can really change the
way we interact with electronics and and
computers
what are the best earphones for your
game so many choices today we're gonna
try these this is gamma it's the world's
first earbuds using 3d recutting audio
technology we have four testers
they're gonna play fortnight on
Nintendo's switch what I feel like the
foot staff and explosion will sit large
it's almost like someone's behind me
it's just so clear and it just sounds
like it's coming from behind you all
around Jeremy how are the ear buds used
multiple headsets in the past and it
just doesn't even come close to this
I like the flu stabbed and exploded it
was and it's just I'm like right into it
it's just an immersive experience when
you have these on oh no what the hell
man sorry the director wants us to plug
the products and we only have a certain
amount of time left
what's that it's a 3d sound positioning
system that helps you locate the source
of a sound in a video game
that's not new my headset can do that
too actually they're not the same for
traditional 3d sound positioning they
just separate the master into three
separate frequencies gamma 3d recutting
audio can separate different types of
key sounds footsteps gun shops and other
surrounding sounds so you can pinpoint
every sound in a 3d space gamma has a
wider range additional earphones with
Gamow you're able to hear the locations
of your enemies locate the directions
where they come from and even identify
the changes in distance and with the
dual driver system you can receive a
much more accurate sound location
playback so you'll hear every single
detail about your enemies imagine you're
in a game surrounded by danger you can
easily locate those threats and fight
back or slip away from those threats and
fight another time oh yeah so that's why
it sounded clearer than my headset
and another good feature for gaming is
the HD microphone long gone are the days
of screaming into a busted mic that is
useful but can it work on my phone too
of course
gamo is compatible with all gaming
platforms cell phone and tablet ps4
switch PC and even VR that's useful what
else can it do gamo has high five high
quality audio that lets you switch
between three different modes 3d gaming
3d movies and music well that's good to
know
and it was designed to fit your ears
perfectly so you won't even feel
uncomfortable after hours of using gamo
damn off to get me some of those yo dude
where you going where can i buy gamma
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
