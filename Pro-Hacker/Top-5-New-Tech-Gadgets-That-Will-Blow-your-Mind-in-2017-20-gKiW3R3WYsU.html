it as the pinnacle of modern design and
technology but then we saw the iPhone
battery case it's bulky and it looks
ugly just like all the others
we asked ourselves could it be better
the answer was yes and so we invented
thin case thin case is the world's
thinnest all-in-one iPhone battery case
this incredibly thin protective case
that's just five millimeters of
thickness to your iPhone it's extremely
durable and offers maximum protection
every case has a raised front lip that
works as a shield to prevent the screen
from hitting the ground when
accidentally dropped on top of that it's
unique design folds out into a kickstand
allowing for hands-free usage anytime
thin case is super powerful with 3000
milliamp s-- you have more than double
your iPhone's battery life
that's 14 more hours of video games
movies are talktime and more than 40
hours of music listening and speaking of
listening to music with the introduction
of iPhone 7 you may be missing your
favorite pair of headphones so thin case
brings back the 3.5 millimeter audio
jack now you can charge your phone and
listen to music at the same time just
like the old days thin case is also
intelligent equipped with modern charge
through technology thin case enables
charge and sync functions while
connected to a computer your iPhone
recharges first and then the thin case
recharges itself the LED power indicator
lets you know at a glance how much juice
is left install thin case in a single
click and rest easy knowing your iPhone
will never let you down again

portable outlet available we reached
over twice our goal and managed to
deliver to all of our backers currently

thanks to the a3 you can soon power all
of these devices with one simple cable
wherever you are in order to make this
happen we need your support we need to
raise mineral amount to cover
development and fixed costs and a
minimum volume to enter production back
us and we vacuum but USBC in the new
life power a3
nowadays there is something wrong with
the market of climate equipment on the
one hand there are plenty of absolutely
inefficient small devices that don't
prevent suffering from heat on the other
hand there are overpriced bulky
solutions that consume tons of energy
they require complicated maintenance and
to be honest not always provide you with
desired level of comfort I don't know
about you but I would like to have a
device that combines portability of
desktop gadget with efficiency of modern
technology meet next generation of evil
polar smart personal air-conditioner
this multifunctional device cools
humidifies and purifies the air creating
a perfect microclimate around yourself
the report is easy to use as 1-2-3 fills
the water tank
adjust the fan speed enjoy it if a polar
walks on poverty evaporation it
literally creates these natural
refreshing breeze one can feel as the
Seacoast and I found their dry hair and
skin a report produced moist air taking
care of your health and beauty everybody
has their own temperature of comfort and
optimal humidity level this is
definitely not something that central
air conditioning systems respect also
cooling effect spreads and evenly and
those who are close to an air
conditioner always feel too hot and
others always feel too cold during the
summer season fully air-conditioned
spaces become unbearable and regular
heat waves make it much worse even best
climate systems often can cope and you
need some extra cooling power
Eva Poehler makes you feel comfortable
in any conditions improving your
productivity and helping you to achieve
more the core technology behind the
report is a breeze especially developed
an operative metamaterial based on minor
a lot of photos this allows a reporter
to be both compact and powerful unlike
traditional materials every breeze
doesn't contain any organic elements
this prevents bacteria and most read
we're always there is no free or know
any other toxic port
this makes have a power technology
absolutely safe to use and eco-friendly
thank you however polar is it truly
smart device it consumes less energy
than light saving bulbs significantly
reducing your bills with a variety of
tools for automation smart home
integrations and application control
ever polar will easily become a natural
part of your office a home ecosystem we
are founders of ever polar here you go
we came to you with the idea of personal
air conditioner we are grateful for
support of solvent bakers who help the
dream come true we didn't let you down
delivered product in a record time and
now we are ready for the next chapter of
our journey the most valuable thing for
us was your feedback it allowed us to
spread the boundaries of climate
technologies even wider in this new
advanced device we believe that climate
technologists are becoming personal and
we invite everybody to join this
revolution and once again thanks for
your support
