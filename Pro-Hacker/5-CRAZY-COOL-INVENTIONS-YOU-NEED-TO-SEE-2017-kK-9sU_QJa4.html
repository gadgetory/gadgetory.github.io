hey Hans what are you doing
fill in the technical video let's tackle
it's my invention so ultimately all one
man for your phone or camera six
you
hi my name is Enzo I know you love
simple life focus on a variable matters
how awesome is it mochi is simple and
also just like you
we found the keyboard and mouse are
never used simultaneously kissin was why
not share the space the simplicity can
be applied simply but finally we found
the best solution mochi provides you
with the best typing experience by a
slim pantograph keyboard thin and save
laser sensors generate a large optical
touchpad at the exact moment you want to
use it bluetooth low energy technology
assures an extended battery life the
gorgeous aluminum body makes mochi more
slim and durable the cover of mochi not
only protects the keyboard from damage
but also it turns into a portable device
staff of course mochi never compromises
its style for great performance
play the hood opening to the simple and
other not allowed you
I spent years searching for a tripod I
could anchor adjust and aim while
holding my breath in deep water couldn't
find it so I designed it brought it to
Kickstarter now I'm bringing it to you
you should be able to put your camera
where you want without fear and without
lugging a lot of gear with deployable
stakes and multiple rigging points you
can connect PAC pod in ways that let you
get great shots from almost any angle
it's quick to set up easy to stow
compact lightweight waterproof
built for adventure whether you shoot
time-lapse still photos or video pack
pod expands your creative possibilities
there's a lot to be said for traveling
light and there's lots of heavy tripods
out there but when you're out for the
whole day who wants to carry extra
weight when you can use what's around
you to steady the shot gear keeps
getting smaller and better
why weigh yourself down pack pod lets
you grab life's best moments fast while
you're having fun you don't have to
travel heavy to capture flight moment
you
hi folks Aaron Boyd here wanted to do a
quick video show in how the life card
operates there's a latch here on the
upper part in the frame this is the
barrel latch slide that back you can
tilt the barrel up I'm gonna just put a
snap cap in there slide the latch back
close the barrel and it will lock closed
there's a similar latch on the bottom on
the handle just slide that forward and
split the two halves go all the way till
it locks open from there it's gonna
operate like a normal gun you just
the bolt pull the trigger reset the bolt
to the half cocked flush with the rear
of the frame that's the position that
you're going to use to fold it closed
there you go
complexity in the natural world is
fascinating don't you think in the most
complex systems we can look deeper to
find a network of interacting elements
in Tobin's dancing and loving scientific
hopscotch using their tiny little brains
to make the most wonderful things happen
together hello French would you like to
see my latest invention it's really
sunflower Thunder come see cubelets this
is cubelets robot construction kits I
built with nature in mind now I want to
share them with you
cubelets are for you to play with there
a system of interlocking interacting
friends who help you create robotic good
times just like you and bumblebees do
each cubelet is a name and a function
it's important to know what they do
individually so that you can snap them
together into robots there are three
types of cubelets action cube let's do
things they are like outputs they like
your arms or your voice
since cubelets pay attention to things
they're like in peace they're like your
sense of sight hearing or touch think
qubits are smart they can do math or
logic functions they're like simple
little brains one detail with the
database
Oh cubits can be arranged in a variety
of ways to make all these robots I'll
show you some of my favorite ways to
field fun simple critter
this is a simple reactive robot the
drives in a line if it gets an input we
can make a simple critter out of only
three two bullets drive battery and
distance snap a distance drive and
battery together the hobo scoots away if
you put your hand behind it so at the
second drive for stability if you flip
the distance sensor the whole bottle
drive towards objects instead of the way
from each turn one of the drive rocks 90
degrees and it spins instead of driving
doubling the first robot makes steering
behavior the marsupial is like a simple
critter but we're using a temperature to
billet instead of a distance these fries
in warm environment
Bree vomits and it comes alive you see
there's a million ways for Cubans to
live together if you come back again
I'll show you more cubelets are now
