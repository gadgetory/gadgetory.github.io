and professional gamers is really
starting to gain some steam and we said
let's relook at a pro gaming headset
from the ground up we saw an opportunity
to really look at the details of what
makes a headset to start again with a
blank sheet of paper and say if we would
have build something from the ground up
what would we do what would we change
and did more than a year of scientific
research on everything fit size weight
thermodynamics temperature humidity
every aspect we pulled in the best of
show features engineering to invest of
our products and marketing team to make
sure that we're hitting every detail of
pro-gamer could make we took an exact
month trying out every single headset in
the marketplace one of the real standout
moments of the development of this
headset for me was showing this to optic
Jane and then all of a sudden
turtlebeach says hey we have a new
product coming out putting this in the
hands of a pro gamers hearing that they
love it they can't wait to play in it
that for me is the ultimate compliment
well first things I said is thus this
work for you are you comfortable wearing
this and now you're gonna be able to to
compete but then I look at Krim he
doesn't like something he's gonna tell
you set him aside
for real did you would you like to add
some music yes good let's make this
happen and we did
when the major features is the new
competitive system so this involves both
the standard fit system on the side of
the headset plus we've developed a
tension adjust system across the head
back to me number one is the comfort
because you don't even want to feel
these headsets when you play you have a
headset on for hours and hours and hours
of time and if it's not comfortable for
you then it's like you know you're not
gonna want to wear it like I've never
seen some of this before where you can
actually find the perfect adjustment
it's gonna be a huge help when we're
playing rest assure that your ears will
not hurt these foam pads are incredible
turtlebeach has always been ahead in the
audio so that game so finally having the
comfort abilities of what I was looking
for it's one of the really cool features
about the elite pro is the cooling gel
that we have in the memory foam this
actually actively cools your head so I
really like how the insides are cloth
the outsides are leather if the inside
was leather I would just be sweating all
day long I've wore headsets in the past
that I mean I took off the headset and
my ears have been red like I was in a
boxing match and yeah that's not fun at
all Audio is the biggest thing next to
the screen audio is probably one of the
top pillars that you associate with
competing because there's so many things
inside of the game that you can hear
that will give you an advantage over the
other player the sound helps you know
what's going on sometimes more than just
looking at the screen because you can
hear things that are going on the screen
might not be able to see you know you
got controllers but headsets and hearing
and be able to communicate will will
step you up to like the highest that we
can be
my favorite feature elee Pro is the pro
baseball system so this allows gamers
with glasses and to playing comfort from
ours so this was the first headset I had
ever seen that actually has grooves so
they're very comfortable I could see
myself you know putting in some long
gaming hours with these of all the teams
out there we chose to associate with
optic gaming because they're one of the
best there were a lot of things that we
asked for a lot of things that we were
looking for and they were very excited
about the headset we came up with so
thankfully turtlebeach listened to us
listen to the input with the elite Pro
and so it was really match made in
heaven
between the comfortability of the
headphones the durability and the actual
audio quality at the tournaments I think
the elite pro is going to allow optic
gaming to bring home a lot of G
initiatives this year the elite pro
represents for turtlebeach really the
the reinvention of a pro gaming headset
we're the innovator in the space we've
always been the innovator and Elite Pro
represents the pinnacle of the headsets
for the professional gamer
everyone likes doing it the dough the
frosting but what's better is sharing it
with something else and with the same
concept we designed the magics power
donut for you to share the power with a
slicer compact and light that you can
slide in your pocket logics Peres Jonas
simultaneously Paris of all five easy
sockets and two USB ports with fast
charge and the best thing is they won't
conflict with each other like they
always do we solve this problem with a
revolutionary
that allows the box to fit perfectly
next to each other
magic table stopper makes it easy for
you to adjust the length of the
integrative cord keeping your child's
face neat and organized
John Deakin grew and everyone who asked
for a logic charger within UK EU or an
au plug type last time we hear you
that's why we designed the logics power
Babel
similar to the magic Sparrow donut for
this time with universal sockets
when you have so many devices that need
charging it makes some sense to buy five
or six travel chapters when there's only
one wall socket what you want is
something that adapts all your devices
at the same time we have the perfect
solution
MAGIX adapter integrated with magic
spell bagel or donut and this is the
world's first universal power extension
become is after designed to fit in your
pocket we complain that there's not
enough electric socket and a USB
charging station at the airport in the
hotel the reality is we need power
strips while traveling but we don't
bring them reason is simple power strips
on the market are way too bulky and none
of them can keep the long messy cord
under control plus they're enabled adapt
to different socket types the idea of
merge experiment and Baker which is
thinking the versatile socket version of
donut is to create something elegant and
powerful with a personal touch and
paying attention to all the small
details
the people who brought you the world's
first CD slot mount have made an
evolutionary leap forward to bring you a
