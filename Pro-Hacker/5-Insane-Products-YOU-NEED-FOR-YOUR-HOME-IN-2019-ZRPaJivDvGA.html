goodbye to those worthless ceiling fans
which do nothing more than push down hot
air and the mini only uses about 25
percent of the water used by traditional
line miss systems be one of the first
people in the world to have a system
that cools your patio like resorts and
restaurants do but for a fraction of the
cost now that is truly cool
