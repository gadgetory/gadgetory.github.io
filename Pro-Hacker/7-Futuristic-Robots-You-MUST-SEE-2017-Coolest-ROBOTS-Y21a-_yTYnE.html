that's a good idea
only queue great Mary I'll be right here
when you get back great
this is Harrison he loves a good game of
ping pong but finding a competitive
partner is hard
Shane is unbeatable not fun
catherine is still learning also not fun
and Matthew now there's a great partner
but he's not always around introducing
trainer five it's your new ping-pong
partner that's always available and
always competitive you can shoot any
spin anywhere on a table on any table
it's got the accuracy of a machine
triple its size but it fits in your back
and it's the first of its kind they'll
let you control all of this from your
phone
trainer bot lets you pick a setting
that's perfect for you beginners can
practice the forehand for slow easy
shots just choose the locations spin
type and a slow interval as you improve
trainer buck rows with you you can
create a sequence that involves multiple
shots like forehand and backhand and for
advanced players trainer bot becomes
unpredictable you can make issues
randomly and maximum speed in close
games there's no feeling like hitting
that epic shot those moments are rare
but they don't have to be because
trainer block and recreate a me match
situation hit a hundred smashes slice a
thousand shots it never misses having
trouble beating your friends trainer
block and turn their toughest shots into
drills with enough practice we'll beat
them next time and never waste another

YouTube into hours of gameplay it's also
designed to help people connect
regardless of their experience level now
anyone can plays together without
holding back or feeling outmatched
it's your ultimate ping-pong partner it
was so much fun
especially that crazy setting where it
just shoots
I'm kind of sweating a little bit right
now within 20 seconds I was already
starting to make small adjustments to
how I was holding the paddle
it was very started out and it seemed
easy but then it got so much harder I
mean there's something for every skill
level I've actually played ping pong
robots before I actually blew my mind
hi Kickstarter I'm Alex and I'm Harrison
me and my brother always tried to kick
each other's ass while we play ping pong
so we start shooting first turnabout
with just a garbage can to just search
for us to smash but later on we find out
with app and software you can do a lot
more you can simulate games you can
create your own drills and the coolest
part is you can share those drills with
anyone in the world three months ago we
decide to join axe which is the world's
largest hardware accelerator we source a
lot of motors and we also designed all
the mechanism from the ground up to give
you the fun experience that we want you
to have we have talked to many
manufacturers now now the last part it's
just cooling and Kickstarter that's why
we need your help please back ensure
this campaign on Kickstarter so we can
bring Turner bot to you
you

Kubo revolutionizes the way we teach
coding with the introduction of the
tactile programming language two years
ago
Dana and I started a research-based
project to teach children in the age 4
to 10 about basic coding we did this
because we believe programming skills
are essential for kids to acquire to
succeed in the 21st century the result
of this project is Kubo robot in 2034
it's estimated that 47 percent of all
the jobs that we know today will no
longer exist they'll be taken over by
robotics and artificial intelligence
therefore kids need to learn basic
coding skills in order to work side by
side with technology the problem with
the way we teach coding today is that we
introduce it too late and we use too
complex tools you're taking coding out
of the screen down to the table so
coding becomes as easy as doing the
puzzle game the robot consists of two
parts a hit and the body it's so
intuitive that all you have to do is to
assemble the tool and kubu is ready for
action kuba revolutionizes the way we
teach coding with the introduction of
the tech time programming language when
you use the tactile coding package
children learn crucial 21st century
skills like collaboration communication
critical thinking and creativity you can
also add the language packets and
children will learn to spell their first
words for every Kubo subject packets we
provide learning material with
and therefore Google can both be used in
schools and in homes schools preschool
time our design philosophy is if you
design for children you should design
with children that's reason why we
involve children in every important
design decision it is our dream that
every child will have the opportunity to
learn coding from the very early age
when you support kuru you help us
achieve that dream if you want to
support or learn more about the kuba
robot project check out our IndieGoGo
campaign page for so long
technology has been held back by one
important thing emotion that's why we
created oli the first robot assistant
with an evolving personality and a deep
breath outwards let the stress fall away
Meghan I would suggest raising the
temperature by 10 degrees hot yoga can
increase weights loss and build muscle
tone let's do it
not a problem at all oli is proactive
meaning it anticipates your needs
just a thought Meghan shall I set the
mood with some jazz while you read yeah
music through only sounds amazing too
because it knows where you are in the
room it can best direct the audio to
your liking no matter the track and no
matter the mood our AI system and
character engine creates a unique
personality for every Ollie that means
each one will relate to you in a
distinctive way go go go one more Kevin
and you hit your target for the day
well done good morning Angela it's time
to wake up hey Ryan long day for which I
think a bit of a guitar therapy might do
the trick
the Ottawa started with mission to chant
human relationships with technology all
is the first robot a system with
evolving personality people are
different
how one is unique and so is our robot
our team is also made up of incredibly
diverse group of people we bring the
best talents from AI
Neron science engineering robotics
design and animation there are bridges
life into a robot we've also been
fortunate enough to work with some top
professors in their respective field
Ali's the first robotics product that
has won four Innovation Awards in CES we
do that in 2017 we've come a long way
and iterated quite a bit through our
journey now we are ready to manufacture
at a large scale and we need your help
to take all you to the next stage of
production okay now it's time to join us
and we're not</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
