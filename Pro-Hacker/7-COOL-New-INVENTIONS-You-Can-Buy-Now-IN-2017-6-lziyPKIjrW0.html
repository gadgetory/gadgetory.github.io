God can do
over the last four years I've been
searching for a way to travel over short
distances using electric power I thought
about the skateboard but I was concerned
it wouldn't be stable enough rollerblade
seemed too complicated to put on and
take off and the gyropod design would be
too heavy to be carried out easily easy
to write and accessible to everyone this
could have seemed like a good place to
start but one with 12-inch inflatable
wheels these brakes and integrated
charger but that would be too heavy
it had to be light and comfortable so I
thought let's invent a whole new type of
brushless motor and let's use an
advanced aluminium alloy for the frame
it will be lighter and still just as
strong designed by Eliam studio knives
now this could be the one

hi I'm Ken and I'm Davey we're the
creators of flashes thanks for making
our product a viral hit it feels like
you've spread it all over the Internet
and you really really want it flash it
started off as a Halloween project and
when I saw Davey working with a tiny
little LED and I thought how can I make
them into something fun so I asked Davey
can we make them into eyelashes we
should pray so we did it and the first
iteration was just simple on and off the
second iteration we thought why not make
it a little bit more fun so when it ends
more interactivity so we had a motion
controller and then you have these
individually addressable and so you've
seen some of the patterns that you we
have let's look at some of the
interactions you can fill your head like
this you can balance or down or you can
just simply turn your head with the fun
project and we're hoping that you guys
really really want it and like it so
please support a Kickstarter thank you
