hi I'm Carlo every day smartphones are
becoming smarter but the battery life
remains critical we'd like to use our
phones without the fear of running out
of battery of course there are solutions
such as fire cases and extra batteries
but are either not portable enough or
you forget we designed a product so
compact that will follow you everywhere
a cable the size of an inch we call it
in charge it's a very simple product yep
so useful that we're giving everybody
should own one that's why one of our
main goals was to keep it affordable
a tiny product at a tiny price
we spend an average 70% of our day next
to a USB port and every time it's a
chance to top-up for batteries there are
over five billion USB ports around the
world in charge will fit into your
pocket and you wanted to fight with
tangle cords ever again thanks to its
remarkably complex design you can snap
it onto your keyring and there's no
chance to forget it at all we spent the
last three months design the product and
testing the prototypes and now we are
finally ready to start the production in
charger will be available with both
lightning connector and micro USB so
it's compatible with most of the devices
out there we are really excited about
this and we hope you are too
now we need your help to bring in charge
into your pocket as a supporter you will
get your own in charge as a special
price so please consider backing our
project and share it with your friends
thanks for watching we really appreciate
your support thank you
you
Oh
in today's world people have access to
numerous digital services through the
use of various devices if you do the
math a person may easily have more than
15 different accounts security experts
agree that for a password to be truly
secure it must contain a random
combination of letters numbers and
symbols remembering such a secure
password is not a job meant for us
humans in the past few years hackers
have proven over and over again just how
vulnerable our computer systems can be
major companies like eBay Dropbox and
LinkedIn have reported cyber attacks
that have compromised users information
and passwords this is why we created
support it's a security device that
allows you to generate store and use
unique insecure passwords for all the
services apps and devices you use
passport is small enough that you can
comfortably carry it in your pocket or
purse along with your keys passport is
easy to set up and simple to use it can
connect to your devices via a USB or
Bluetooth and it's recognized
automatically on all major platforms
here's how you use your passport first
access your passport by entering your
master key
the only password you'll ever have to
remember then access the login screen of
the service you'd like to use on your
preferred device finally browse your
passport for the appropriate account and
selected passport will automatically log
in to your account
say goodbye to using unsecure passwords
and having to remember any of them ever
again should it fall into the wrong
hands
passport incorporates several security
mechanisms to protect your privacy it
encrypts your data using the same
encryption algorithm the US government
uses to protect top-secret information
our free synchronization app also allows
you to create and store an encrypted
copy of your account for easy recovery
in case of loss or theft
hello Kickstarter we are so latronnik a
team of creative engineers and experts
in electronic product design we have
taken our product passport the point
where it's really for certification and
mass manufacturing we have already
negotiated with several manufacturers to
guarantee a quality product and a
reasonable arrival time to the market
there's what we need your support with
your health who will be able to cover
the initial setup and certification come
and also for the minimum production
volumes necessary for passport to reach
3-1 and an affordable price please back
on today thank you
you
