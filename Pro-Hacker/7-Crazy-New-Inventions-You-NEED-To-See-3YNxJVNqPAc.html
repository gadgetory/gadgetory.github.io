videos are always shaky and stabilizers
out there are too complex heavy and too
big to be mounted anywhere at nuam mater
we wanted to create a solution that was
so convenient that it would become part
of your camera
so we developed pork the world's
smallest waterproof stabilizer for your
GoPro that stabilizes your camera to
keep it leveled and create amazing
cinematic shots no matter what Clarke is
so small that you don't need to remove
your camera anymore it becomes an
extension of it allowing you to mount it
on the camera mounts you already have
just turn it on with your camera and you
are ready to go
work is a lot more than a stabilizer
it's a real tool with built in moving
time-lapse feature it brings a new way
of creating content and empowering you
to be more creative
developed by engineers and athletes we
went through many iterations of
prototypes to develop a product
optimized for your camera

personal video making so we are now
ready to bring that product to market
