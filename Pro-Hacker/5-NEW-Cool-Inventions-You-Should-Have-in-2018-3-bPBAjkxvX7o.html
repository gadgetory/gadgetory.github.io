your specific needs you can adjust your
vantage point remotely by panning and
tilting within the app or set up to
three unique points of view presents 360
will automatically cycle through those
points of view providing you with a
convenient set of automatic view
settings for instance point the camera
towards the front door then set it as
your view point and name it you can
adjust for how long presents 360 should
hold on to that view point before it

hi this is Harry my name is Paul we are
the founders of Macbeth and we would
like to introduce you today our magnetic
pedal innovation
well it's a real new innovative panel
which was designed to give you solid
performance as you cyclop with
supporting force without fear
hassle-free pikey this is one of our
first prototypes we have to do a lot of
innovations to come to this product
exactly and what's really good on this
panel we can equip with different magnet
sizes so what you see here is our
standard paddle this gives you a pulling
force of about 15 kilograms
click on solidly and you pull up
straight but as soon as you start to
shift your foot a little bit even in
case of a critical situation you will
get up very easily in fact you will
almost not feel the magnet on the shoe
we have metallic plate it fits on every
SPD comfortable shoe one of the big
advantages of this setup is that it is
totally insensitive 2/3 you will not
scratch any floors because this is all
inside the sole without any elevations
it's a much lighter pedal and we have a
stronger neodymium magnet which is the
strongest magnet that is available in
the market we have a similar damper unit
on it which gives us the ability to
adjust the magnet height to fit the shoe
and also to give you that solid feel
when you connect onto your shoe and when
you write
all the best for a safe ride really hope
to see you out there
hopefully view from Macbeth on your bike
two years ago we did a Kickstarter with
Luke you and thank you for those who
backed us we start to be back on
Kickstarter bringing naval lifeline
