that there was a way to balance our
desire to be both ready and responsible

refined Guardian to be the best product
it can be but to manufacture a product
like this is expensive and in order to
bring Guardian to market we need your
help and we look to you responsible gun
owners and community members who are
willing to be a part of this journey

being a gun owner is not just buying a
gun you must always be prepared
have to be trained
you are your gun see when it's not on
you you want to know it's secure and
accessible safes are not always
accessible or easy to open especially in
the dark and locks are nuisance to
operate as for smart guns while smart
guns are a dangerous concept taking an
unreliable technology and embedding it
into your gun is not a smart decision
our mission is to bring you the perfect
solution introducing sorex
the new generation of gun stores or X's
caliber specific and has two modes the
first mode is awareness if someone tries
to tamper with your gun you're
immediately alerted and when you need
your gun
charging it will eject sorex and chamber
a fresh round the second mode is when
your gun is locked when Zoras locked
no one can charge your gun if someone
tries to charge your gun the locking
mechanism will immediately expand
preventing the gun from being loaded
special polymers in the locking
mechanism prevent any damage to the
barrel szura's developed a revolutionary
unlocking mechanism rapid dial rapid
dial is a simple mechanism which counts
clicks while you turn it you don't need
to start from a specific point even the
direction that you turn the lock doesn't
matter these two factors allow you to
unlock your weapon without looking at it
even in the dark you can choose a simple
code or any length code you wish you
won't believe how fast and simple it is
until you try it you can also open zorax
from your phone but you can only lock it
by physically pressing the lock button
zorax normally communicates with your
phone directly through bluetooth it also
comes with a zorb bridge a Bluetooth 2
Wi-Fi router when plugged into the wall
near your gun you'll be made aware from
anywhere in the world if your gun is
being tampered with now if your home is
your safe and you don't lock your gun
but you still want alerts we have a
solution the zuhr watchdog the zuhr
watchdog is not a lock but rather a
notification device its sole purpose is
to notify you if your weapon is tampered
with

IDF technological and in combat units we
worked on it for two years bringing it
to perfection door x allows you to be
ready and aware and safe more than ever

hi folks Aaron Boyd here wanted to do a
quick video show in how the life card
operates there's a latch here on the
upper part in the frame this is the
barrel latch slide that back you can
tilt the barrel up I'm gonna just put a
snap cap in there slide the latch back
close the barrel and it will lock closed
there's a similar latch on the bottom on
the handle just slide that forward and
split the two halves go all the way till
it locks open from there it's gonna
operate like a normal gun do you just
cock the bolt pull the trigger reset the
bolt to the half cocked flush with the
rear of the frame that's the position
that you're going to use to fold it
closed there you go
