to really make bike power meters
affordable and now we need you to be
part of our test team team SWAT the
first sales are made to leading brands
but to take the technology one step
further we need a lot of more diverse
test data to refine the algorithms
that's why we need people like you to
share raw data with us get your own bike
power meter and be part of the world's
largest test team dedicated to improve
power meter technology we want to get
more out of the data and bring down the
cost to the point where all your bikes
can have one so in other words by
crowdsourcing this collection of data we
will be able to take the technology to
the next level with our deal you can get
a bike power meter for a really low
price if you share just 30 minutes of
ride data per month on a trainer up a
mountain in a forest on the road you
decide we want it all to make the deal
even better we split the price into a
low hardware cost and a small monthly
maintenance fee and as long as you keep
riding for us we even give you a 50%
discount on the monthly fee we have
developed several different models based
on the same firmware and electronics
they all measure both power cadence and
other parameters the rechargeable
battery can be charged using your phone
charger and yes they are all waterproof
be part of team SWAT today cheer your
ride data collected with the app and
help us to take this technology one step
further
my name's Anthony and I'm a founding
partner of Mighty audio my tea was born
from personal frustration with the
current on-the-go music experience
several years ago I ditched music
downloading for music streaming
the only thing missing after I switched
was a seamless and integrative
experience during my workouts fast
forward to today and every option of
stream music still requires a smart
phone while exercising we all know how
annoying it is to work out with a bulky
smartphone your phones are only getting
bigger more expensive and consuming more
battery life and heaven forbid if you
drop your phone iPod shuffles are still
around but they don't have any streaming
capabilities and let's not forget the
painful syncing process that requires
cords and computers I was shocked that
there was no product out there that
solved my problem so I thought to myself
well if no one else is gonna create this
product then I'm gonna give it a shot my
tea is very easy to set up syncing music
never requires cords and computers just
Bluetooth and your smartphone after you
download the app onto your phone and
turn on the device that will
automatically detect your vices to pair
with via bluetooth once connected you'll
be asked to sign in to your account
after logging in you can sync all your
playlists on to the mighty device in the
same way that you would sing playlists
for offline play on your phone on here
you'll see all your current playlists as
well as how much memory you're using
after a quick sync your music is on your
Mighty and you're ready to go no more
phone required at this point we honestly
think a screen is unnecessary we are
proud to be the first ones to bring a
device like this to market or ultra
focus on this one problem and we want to
solve it elegantly and simply music is a
part of almost everyone's life and so we
want my tea to be the bridge between
your music and your fitness so if you've
been asking yourself why doesn't this
exist please help us make this product a
reality say goodbye to your smartphones
and iPod shuffles and be mighty
they say this is good luck but good luck
or not it's still a mess and a mess like
this can't be clean with just paper you
need water to get the job done right
whether you're cleaning your car or your
hands so why when it comes to that do we
use just toilet paper bathroom goers
meet your new best friend
what oh sorry Pete not you buddy
bathroom doors meet your new best friend
the swash 1400 it's a new seat for the
toilet you already have that will give
your butt the royal treatment it
deserves with a heated seat dual
positionable stainless steel nozzles

of a button and a warm air dryer your
butt will think you've died and gone
you get it so what's so great about
Braun Dells new swash bidet see it's
simple
wash don't wipe it uses water to clean
the messes that can't be clean with just
paper
he's always doing stuff like that and
with Braun Dells bidet CP can because it
has a citable lid you think that'd be
standard issue with bidet toilet seats
right wrong
unlike most bidet seat lids brondell
supports a person's weight meaning Pete
can use it however he wants
another great feature stainless steel
nozzles there positionable because they
got to hit you in just the right spot
and there's self-sterilizing I mean
there washing my butt the washing Pete's
butt move you got to make sure those
things are clean man it's upbeat
or
oh yeah that's another feature of
rondelle's new seat it has a nightlight
did I mention Braun Dells new swash
bidet seat has customizable memory
settings that means I press one button
and get the seat temperature nozzle
position and water temperature I want I
don't have to remember anything because
my swash does it for me
are you kidding me

everyone that when it comes to this
stuff wash don't wipe if you're ready to
change the way you clean click the green
back this project button and pre-order
your very own brondell swash 1400 today

brick so what is brick so it's an
awesome version of building blocks that
makes your designs come to life with
electricity sensors and Bluetooth

testing lab closing a circuit this is
Bluetooth sound sensor light sensor
proximity sensor how amazing is using
brick so this is Kate making her morning
coffee while discovering Roy used all
the milk for his cereal this is Kate
same situation with brick cell brick so
has three types of locks connectors
action blocks and trigger blocks use the
connectors to make a circuit then embed
the action box to give your design light
or movement now you can use trigger
blocks to control your design with sound
proximity and light brick so can also be
controlled remotely which means you can
connect your design to your phone and
even to the internet and automate stuff
if you're into that sort of thing but
who likes to automate stop right oh and
there's a battery block which will is
the battery here's Mike while his
coworker turns off the air conditioner
even though it is 90 degrees outside
this is Mike same situation with brick
so you can use brick so to upgrade
designs made with regular building
blocks which will make them like a
hundred times cooler no wires needed all
bricks or block components are built in
brick so is also an amazing educational
tool for your kids but know that they'll
forever mock regular building blocks
buzz and Amir have been working on brick
so for a long time they're both
physicists so they know a thing or two
about electricity so if you like
building stuff and don't mind getting
addicted support them and get your own
brick so it'll change your life
