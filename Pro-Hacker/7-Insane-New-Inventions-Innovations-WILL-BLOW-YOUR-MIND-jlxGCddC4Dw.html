all the equipment makers produced their
products as if we all have the exact
same hearing when in fact just that we
have to need fingerprints we all have
unique hearing friends are me on maps a
hearing Prince for each year and then
tailors the sound by filling in the
missing frequencies bringing a hearing
to the optional level and letting you
experience sound like never before
getting started is easy first you map
out the unique hearing prints through
the app then you simply connect audio
whatever you want to listen to and
that's it you can watch movies enjoy
swimming music and listen to all other
audio parts of your life joy that has
been tailored just for you there is a
range of frequencies that the human ear
is sensitive to and each ear has
different sensitivities across that
range and that is the reason why audio
should not be on the size fits all is
well known that listening to sound at
loud volumes damages one's hearing and
that loss can be permanent
not only can emil provide you with audio
like you've never heard it before
but because it customizes specifically
for you
it helps you to hear at lower volumes
this will spare your hearing and provide
you with clarity of sound for your
lifetime all will actually maps to
hearing print for each year and then
tailors to South Sudan here all the
audio has in head but don't take my word
for it listen to what others have to say
here we are going to try to find out
what you're hearing Prentiss so you
should hear Lu beeping sound each year
we try six tones and that's where we map
out the whole year this is what your
audio sounds like without enhancement
this is for you whoa it's really cool
you can really tell the difference in
trouble the bass it was all very clear
much clearer than before I like the idea
that it's also a bit about kind of take
about we're not a lot better
I love it yeah thank you
the product is made from solid piece of
aluminum to be extremely lightweight yet
doable we wanted to make a product that
really embodies simplicity functionality
portability people most immersive in a
show away today we hear a lot about
audio advancements such as glasses file
format a high profits heart these are
all great achievements but they're still
missing one important factor you're
unique here we have been working on this
technology since 2000 and we're now
ready for manufacturing with your
support and help now finally share audio
thank you and happy
