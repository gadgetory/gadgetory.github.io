your real world

and an understanding of your environment
Holograms look and sound like they're
actually part of the world around you

the holographic frame centered in the
middle of your view this preserves your
peripheral vision so you can move freely

content and tools alongside the objects
in your real world Holograms can be
world locked in a physical location so
you can walk around them or they can
travel with you you can even hear them
in 3d with spatial sound

okay you probably have a smart device a
handheld computer that can run apps
connect the Wi-Fi and other devices and
take pictures and video so what are
smart glasses well like many smart
devices they have a display audio output
built-in camera and microphone even GPS
and they can access the internet using
built in Wi-Fi or a Bluetooth connection
to your internet connected smartphone
they even have their own operating
system so you can download and run most
apps directly in your smart glasses so
how are smart glasses different well
they're not handheld you wear them the
display rests right in front of your
eyes so you don't have to look down
information is right in your field of
view
next not only can they record HD video
in photos they can also recognize
objects and gestures and with a
microphone they recognize an array of
voice commands the upshot the power of a
smart device hands-free and compatible
with your favorite apps get directions
scan barcodes and find the product
online stream video from remote cameras
smart glasses can even connect your
smartphone via bluetooth for hands-free
phone calls and notifications delivered
without needing to pick up your phone
your digital world hands-free
