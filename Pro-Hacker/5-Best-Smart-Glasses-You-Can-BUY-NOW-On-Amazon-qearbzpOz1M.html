your real world
using transparent lenses spatial sound
and an understanding of your environment
Holograms look and sound like they're
actually part of the world around you
that is mixed reality with microsoft
hololens holograms are viewed through
the holographic frame centered in the
middle of your view this preserves your
peripheral vision so you can move freely
and connect and collaborate with people
around you holograms and mixed reality
don't block out what you can see in here
this enables you to engage with digital
content and tools alongside the objects
in your real world Holograms can be
world locked in a physical location so
you can walk around them or they can
travel with you you can even hear them
in 3d with spatial sound
microsoft hololens is the world's first
fully untethered self-contained
holographic computer with the mixed
reality experience of hololens you can
stay in the real world and interact with
real people as you simultaneously
explore 3d in 3d
you have glass congratulations in the
next few minutes we'll show you how to
set it up you can turn on glass by
pressing the round power button for
about a second the white light behind
the button will turn on and remain lit
while glass starts up you'll know glass
is on when the display is lit and you
see the glass logo put glass on rotate
the display to see the entire image to
get the right fit adjust the no stems
these stems are designed to be
adjustable so don't worry about bending
them the nose pad sit on the bridge of
your nose right there the display should
be above your line of sight yep just
like that now it's time to launch the my
glass app on your phone hit continue to
move on with setup if you ever need more
help check the glass Help Center
okay you probably have a smart device a
handheld computer that can run apps
connect the Wi-Fi and other devices and
take pictures and video so what are
smart glasses well like many smart
devices they have a display audio output
built-in camera and microphone even GPS
and they can access the internet using
built in Wi-Fi or a Bluetooth connection
to your internet connected smartphone
they even have their own operating
system so you can download and run most
apps directly in your smart glasses so
how are smart glasses different well
they're not handheld you wear them the
display rests right in front of your
eyes so you don't have to look down
information is right in your field of
view
next not only can they record HD video
in photos they can also recognize
objects and gestures and with a
microphone they recognize an array of
voice commands the upshot the power of a
smart device hands-free and compatible
with your favorite apps get directions
scan barcodes and find the product
online stream video from remote cameras
smart glasses can even connect your
smartphone via bluetooth for hands-free
phone calls and notifications delivered
without needing to pick up your phone
your digital world hands-free
