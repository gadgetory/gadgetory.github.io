measure sizes and distances measuring by
yourself is always difficult you get all
sweaty it's hard to know how to do it
right
either way it can be a waste of time and
effort feeling frustrated and bothered

back lining control how long the effect
is cool people think I'm just moving
around and acting silly on stage but in
actuality I'm using my emotions to
control my vocal effects you get to play
with it and it's immediately more
natural
singing we all do it whether it's in the
shower or on a big stage it's one of the
greatest things to do and believe us
when we say we have something that will
take it to the next level
there are many professional singers
using sound effects on top of their
voice but why are more seniors doing so
well because effect controls are often
packed with sliders knobs and switches
at complex software into the mix and it
instantly becomes hard to understand a
singer needs to be free and expressive
they need to have an instrument that
follows their movement not the other way
around and that's why we created the way
to get an instrument that lets you add
effects to your voice by simply twisting
and moving in a rapid or rapid or run
this is not a revolutionary idea this is
a natural next step for singers and
vocalists it's an intuitive instrument
that does not interrupt your workflow I
will become an unmissable part of your
singing either on stage in the studio or
practicing at home so how does it work
the widow automatically connects to its
app in the app you select a style or
genre so you can get started straight
away singing through the built-in mic of
your phone or tablet or use it with an
external one hold the wiggle in your
hand or attach it to your microphone
twist and turn the wiggle and you'll
hear the effects straightaway
exporter ready-to-use effects in the app
or linked to your favorite studio
software over the last years we've been
developing the wiggle kit with a small
but very dedicated team in the
Netherlands you might know us from our
previous Kickstarter campaign two years
ago our project was successfully funded
and got picked up by many great artists
including some of the biggest lifx in
the world with the amazing supportive
feedback of musicians and singers we now
proudly present the wiggle kit a product
designed and tested by artists or
artists it's compact intuitive and can
be trusted on stage even the big ones

take singing to the next level
