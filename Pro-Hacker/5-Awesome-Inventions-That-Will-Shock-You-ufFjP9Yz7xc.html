have you seen our parents brush our
teeth can you imagine doing the same
with them it's a dreadful experience for
both us and for them it's inhumane max
I'm sorry now I'll focus only on dogs
this is a dad did you note that 84% of
us already have oral health issues by
the age of three it's like the number
one problem for us dogs that bites I
have two toys but they don't clean my
teeth and what's with these treats I
mean they taste good but do you really
expect food to clean food does beef
jerky brush your teeth because the my
bad breath I can't talk to friends
freely so I locked myself at home for
days man the dog's best friend and I'm
sure they'll find our way introducing
bristly the revolutionary brushing stick
for dogs
it has paw pads cleverly designed for
easy holding where the toothpaste
reservoir and bristle line grooves
bristly perfectly matches a dog's
behavior and Anatomy
hey I'm Petros the inventor of bristly
when I lost my childhood dog Mickey due
to oral disease it was devastating but
that inspired me to come up with a
solution to this crucial problem as
brushing remains the gold standard to
oral disease prevention i developed
bristly as a brushing stick to allow all
dogs to take care of their own oral
health the bristles help to clean teeth
down to the gum line preventing plaque
and tartar buildup in the last six
months over fifty thousand pet parents
have tried her first version and they
loved it their feedback has helped us
come up with a version that's best
suited to dogs needs please back our
campaign and help us empower all dogs to
brush soon Monica will have more
Instagram followers than Kim and LeBron
Harry spends more time on his hobbies
now everybody wants to hang out with
Pina and Max he became a real heartthrob
back our campaign to keep your dog
healthy
[Laughter]
my name is McKenzie I run Mendocino
magic it's a 600-acre campground where
we host a lot of outdoor weddings the
one two three sixty has been a really
valuable resource for us because it
helps us to create virtual tours of our
property with a Street View style
approach and it makes it a lot easier
for potential guests to see what they're
getting into before they get here
being able to click through the property
was huge you know looking at the 360
video tour just set this place apart so
much using virtual tours in advance
helps set us apart from our competition
in this industry I've been playing
Minecraft a lot for the last several
years and recently I got one of the new
Wonder 360 cameras to help me with the
in-game world design I built myself rig
where I can just strap it onto an old
bike helmet pairs really easily to my
phone once I'm connected I can just like
take it outside into any of the
environments that I'm finding
interesting by the time I get back the
3d point cloud is waiting for me on my
computer and I can turn that file into a
Minecraft world right away the Wonder
360 has been really helpful as a tool
when we move into new builds and
construction putting the helmet on I was
able to walk around and make sure I knew
exactly what the designer and the
architect were going to see as well as
far as the space and what we were gonna
be working with what was really great
about this project was the property
owner handing off a 360 capture where I
could see how my design will fit into
the pre-existing landscape I think that
it'll help a lot with other landowners
in the future for their builds and how
they can more sustainably interact with
their spaces and it'll make a huge
difference for us as we develop more of
this property my name is trevor i have a
travel blog and the product that is
enabling
to do what I love the most recently is
the Wonder 360 hey I'm Jack and I've
been riding with a helmet camera for a
couple of years now and I recently
switched from a one directional camera
to a 360 camera and with this I can see
in all directions everywhere I go I'm
such a Luddite when it comes to
technology especially cameras this
thing's amazing it's super easy I just
plop it down because it's 360 I can make
it follow her movements
my name is that I can acrobatics in
parkour and I really like the Wonder 360
because it makes it really easy to bring
the camera into class set it down and it
captures the whole room no matter which
way our practice goes and that way I
don't need a whole camera crew in order
to get every part of my run as I go up
and down back forth I love that I can
live shooting to Facebook and it
stitches the 360 for me automatically it
works with all my old attachments and
it's waterproof love the cool filters
artificial bouquet dill chip classic I'm
Creek
I've been drinking for nine years and I
just started using the Wonder 360 the
fact that the image comes out of this
camera is stabilized and I don't have to
modify the footage with the computer is
outstanding I've been strapped in the
Wonder 360 to my dog Shiloh she's got a
huge following on Instagram her
followers really love the perspective
that this camera gives and in the city
where it's a little more dangerous I've
got a record of what happens if I'm
involved in a close call I can prove it
I also love the Phantom flipper it
allows me to capture every part of
emotion and easily analyze individual
aspects of that motion and really show
the students where they need to improve
and practice I love that I can view and
edit that clips on my phone so if I'm on
a nice ride in the countryside I can
come home and recreate it and show it to
all my friends and the 3d mode is pretty
cool it's really easy to edit on my
phone directly from the app view that
actually want to share I love it
