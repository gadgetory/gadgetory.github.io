the second edition around a modular
architecture it support a unique range
of plug-and-play modules it received
rave reviews in technical journals
online blog and even TV shows little
drones that are like I think they're
awesome man have you seen the micro
drone 2.0 that's probably my favorite
one it's incredibly nimble perfect if
you're filming extreme sports it is very
rugged and if anything did break it's

everything either snaps or slides in the
structure is sleek aerodynamic and
beautiful so now it's possible using a
3d printer technology like the ultimate
you're too you can pronounce your own
custom frame delmar to the dragon or the
locks I was super excited when the when
the micro drone team reached out and
wanted to make a first-person view drone
technology using the dodocase vr viewers

view drone technology even a year ago
