co-founder at Joe box my name is Dan
Friedman I'm co-founder and chief
marketing officer of yachting the
concept started with building our phone
charger into the wall then we realized
wait why be tied to the outlet anymore
why not bring the outlet to you power
station is two part system featuring the
dock and the boost pack each component
has Universal chargers that allow you to
power any mobile device the dock
includes an additional USB port a secure
resting shell surge protected outlet and
nine minutes for attaching the boots
back this mobile life saver carries over
25 hours of battery life which is
indicated by LED lights it can also be
recharged from any USB port fuel box is
better simply because of the combination
of both stationary power and mobile
power on the go we've been developing
fuel blocks for most three years testing
and building model after model we
finally have something that's going to
make all of our lives a little bit
easier throughout each rendition we
focused on creating a sleek and
ergonomic product while constantly
testing the limits of durability we're
really excited about the team we've
assembled here at fuel box we're
innovative we're hard-working and the
backbone of every great company are the
people working hard playing hard to
bring new products to market well your
traditional everyday charging cords are
easy to lose they don't work for all
your devices big and bulky something you
have to add to your device if you like
what you see please share a few box with
your friends order a power station and
help us gets that next level you can
find products out there that offer you
one or the other convenience but we're
the first product to pair everything
together at home on the go and an
elegant sexy way
Oh
you
hi I'm Krista and I'm Lisa and neither
are kids Declan Cooper Nonya like many
parents our kids provide us with
inspiration every day and like all
parents we want to keep them safe we
developed death of a toddler monitor
after a few shared experiences some
funny but I'm actually really scary
we both had all of a baby here including
audio and video baby monitors but we
found that once our kids were mobile
they were no longer meeting our needs
Declan is an active kid and when I put
him down for a nap I would sometimes
come back to him outside his room gain
up to all sorts of trouble I knew I had
a serious problem when I found the
sprinkler in his bed one morning and
realized he'd gone out into our yard
sometime during the night I'm not a
heavy sleeper yet he still flipped over
house without us knowing this really
scared me I want to always know that he
was where I wanted him to be safe in his
bed
oops a little monkey and started
climbing out of his crib around 18
months he was constantly getting into
trouble and still is to this day I worry
when we're traveling it's difficult to
make sure he's safe at his grandma's
house the lake and hotel Kristin I
talked and talked about this challenge
and after some research we realized we
weren't alone this is a problem that
other parents are faced with - there are
hundreds of cases in the news every year
about kids who aren't where their
parents thought they were supposed to be
some of these stories have tragic ends
and we couldn't believe how frequently
this was happening so we decided to
solve the problem ourselves by creating
dekho the toddler monitor a cute and
friendly motion sensor device that is
easily set up and can travel with you
and your family fueled by the
inspiration to keep our kids safe we're
very excited to share him with you and
your family Decco is a motion sensor you
hang on the door hang dekho on your
toddler's bedroom door and set it from
the smartphone using the toddler monitor
app if your toddler tries to leave their
bedroom
the device will sense the motion of the
door and send a go to acquittal to your
smartphone you will be notified by the
table monitor app if there is movement
at the door and you will know that your
toddler is on the move Decco hangs on
any style of doorknob it's durable and
water-resistant made from food grade
bpa-free material lightweight and
travels well it's controlled by an
iPhone or Android
up the app manages up to three toddler
monitors at once from a single
smartphone the app can also be
controlled by up to three users at once
it uses reliable Bluetooth technology
and has an easily replaceable coin cell
battery we're not saying this will solve
all your time far from it
but it will give you the peace of mind
that comes with knowing that your child
is safe and sound and where they're
supposed to be Declan
yeah we're almost there sweetheart
Oh
wait what is this thing this is called I
spend hand spinners it is a substitute
for these habits that we get used to in
our daily life it helps stress relief
and makes you focus currently we find
these good-quality spinners are very
expensive in the market while the cheap
ones has very poor quality so we want to
make a high quality hand spinner that is
affordable by most of us the I spin
spinner is made of 18 colorful rings 10
CNC machined brass parts and one high
quality bearing the 6th green o-rings in
the middle is illuminated because of the
high quality bearing we use the spinner
is super quiet and the spending time can
be up to 3 to 5 minutes it also makes
the spinner well balanced at your hand
so that you can play the trick with the
I spin spinner easily it takes us three
months for the research and sampling now
we get everything ready and need your
help to reduce the mass production cost
and bring the fantastic hand spinner in

reusable container that you can take
everywhere with you it's super
convenient it's wonderful to have and
it's worth its weight when you carry

create is from food waste wax cardboard
styrofoam plastic things that get thrown
away it's all packaging I want to do
everything I can to prevent the natural
world from being stuffed with trash what
does it mean to live in a world where
we're conscious about the way we create
waste there are ways to reduce it we
developed a product that doesn't break
easily is dishwasher safe and food safe

foundations for food and it can clip
easily to your backpack that makes it
highly portable it holds 33 ounces
that's a big enough meal for any size
and shapes I look forward to how
convenient it can be to have home-cooked
food anywhere

instance Tupperware I constantly look
around for a container that won't leak
and none of them fit that bill they
always have some amount of liquid coming
out of them the green traveler allows
you to carry delicious healthy food with
you impact any food you want or non-food
items that won't leak it will keep water
out and you have four compartments to
choose from you get to experience

your backpack we see this as the most
convenient way to carry food with you
