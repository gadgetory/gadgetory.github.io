trains frightening bike lanes agonizing
delays meet spectrum the smartest safest
and smallest personal vehicles are made
like you we think commuting is a drag so
we went looking for the perfect personal
vehicle that is fast fun and safe to
ride an electric skateboard the fun ones
are huge the smaller ones were hard to
learn and none of them delivered the
intelligent stability and smoothness
that a spare time skater could
confidently ride we realize that the
ultimate everyman skateboard simply
didn't exist so we invented it backed by
the investors who innovated drone
technology powered by the same battery
type as a test line spectra is the
world's first and only board equipped
with an ever learning 3d posture control
algorithm that means you can escape
hands-free no app or remote require
what's more Inspectorate futuristic AI

adjust to give you the smoothest can
take this ride possible if you can walk

with your feet to go forward and to
break let's take a look at safety when
your child or significant other rides

your keyboard is holding you back there
is a better way we wanted a compact yet
comfortable keyboard that improved
efficiency that's how the ultimate
hacking keyboard was born our major
design principles are high quality and
durability high-end mechanical key
switches and stainless steel parts are
used to ensure an extended lifespan for
our product we engineered a keyboard
that is compact yet strong with the uhk
you increase your productivity by never
leaving the home row to make that
possible we programmed four different
function layers through these layers you
access all of the features of an
ordinary keyboard but so much more you
can even control the mouse pointer with
the keyboards Mouse layer the uhk can be
fully customized with our configurator
application you can create application
specific key maps or your favorite apps
and games to make shortcuts macros and
share them with others once they take
your configurations with you and use the
uhk as a standard USB keyboard without
installing special software the uhk is
compact easy to carry and fits snugly
into a small bag put it on your desk and
you can easily split the keyboard and
position the Habs organ Amelie you'll
quickly find it's a lot more comfortable
than an ordinary keyboard and it's far
more efficient

activity you never have to leave the
home row I'm super-stoked Lee open
hacking keyboard it comes apart you can
put it as far apart as you want
keys are programmable you can snap it
back together and it's - portable and
small the night to mechanical and clicky

have to
take your fingers off the keys and you
can program macros or and your layouts
