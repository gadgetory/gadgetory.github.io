trains frightening bike lanes agonizing
delays meet spectrum the smartest safest
and smallest personal vehicles are made
like you we think commuting is a drag so
we went looking for the perfect personal
vehicle that is fast fun and safe to
ride an electric skateboard the fun ones
are huge the smaller ones were hard to
learn and none of them delivered the
intelligent stability and smoothness
that a spare time skater could
confidently ride we realize that the
ultimate everyman skateboard simply
didn't exist so we invented it backed by
the investors who innovated drone
technology powered by the same battery
type as a test line spectra is the
world's first and only board equipped
with an ever learning 3d posture control
algorithm that means you can escape
hands-free no app or remote require
what's more Inspectorate futuristic AI
learns your movements over time and
adjust to give you the smoothest can
take this ride possible if you can walk
you can ride spectrum controlling it
with your feet to go forward and to
break let's take a look at safety when
your child or significant other rides
through traffic you want more than a
performance you want to promise
Spector's four-point security technology
covers
as for portability ride to work in style
and store it in the commuter backpack
that's already won the red dot design
award for compact sweetness though it's
the world's most portable personal
vehicle spectra deliver the solid 90
minutes of right time at fifteen point
five miles per hour what do we need to
make spectrum a reality we're back in
spectra because it's the most intuitive
and exhilarating personal vehicle we
have seen to date
now we need a little love from you so
the retailer's now that the climb is
right if you're ready to put spectra on
the market pre-order the mini advance
pro or silver out of factors only
difference as soon as we reach our goal
we'll begin shipping so you can have it
as early as August 2017 back our
campaign and let's ride into the future
your keyboard is holding you back there
is a better way we wanted a compact yet
comfortable keyboard that improved
efficiency that's how the ultimate
hacking keyboard was born our major
design principles are high quality and
durability high-end mechanical key
switches and stainless steel parts are
used to ensure an extended lifespan for
our product we engineered a keyboard
that is compact yet strong with the uhk
you increase your productivity by never
leaving the home row to make that
possible we programmed four different
function layers through these layers you
access all of the features of an
ordinary keyboard but so much more you
can even control the mouse pointer with
the keyboards Mouse layer the uhk can be
fully customized with our configurator
application you can create application
specific key maps or your favorite apps
and games to make shortcuts macros and
share them with others once they take
your configurations with you and use the
uhk as a standard USB keyboard without
installing special software the uhk is
compact easy to carry and fits snugly
into a small bag put it on your desk and
you can easily split the keyboard and
position the Habs organ Amelie you'll
quickly find it's a lot more comfortable
than an ordinary keyboard and it's far
more efficient
typing coding gaming or whatever your
activity you never have to leave the
home row I'm super-stoked Lee open
hacking keyboard it comes apart you can
put it as far apart as you want
keys are programmable you can snap it
back together and it's - portable and
small the night to mechanical and clicky
or quiet if you want you can program it
to control your mouse so you're going to
have to
take your fingers off the keys and you
can program macros or and your layouts
in there you want this is a prototype
that sent me it's been awesome so
Stephanie check out with your pledge
we'll be able to create molds for
plastic parts order electronic
components at scale
manufacture custom parts and tooling
help us fund the ultimate hacking
keyboard and be one of the first to
experience this one-of-a-kind product
you
you
in the beginning there was this it was
fun and it worked but with timing that
man so he created something different we
named it cobbled ice and it was really
cool at least that is what our 600-plus
Becker said what we wanted something
lighter so we redesigned the original d6
once again meet hallowed ice the
lightest metro dice ever total rate of
only 1.5 grams or 0.05 ounces making it
the first completely empty dice but
doesn't roll oh yes
see for yourself by backing this project
you will be joining the most exclusive
community of lightweight metal ice
owners to get your hollowed ice click on
the green button that says make this
project and claim your list on price now
and remember take advantage of this
limited time offer while still 10 make
from the beginning our goal was to
design first-class luggage that is
accessible to everyone we need your help
