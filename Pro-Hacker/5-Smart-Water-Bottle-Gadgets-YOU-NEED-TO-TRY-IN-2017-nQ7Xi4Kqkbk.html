hi I'm Jack Nam Davis we're two brothers
from Austin Texas who are passionate
about hydration as athletes we've often
needed to track our water consumption
but solving that problem led us to a
more important question how much water
should we be drinking drinking too much
or too little can be dangerous and the
reality is that everyone's optimal level
of hydration depends on a bunch of
different factors that are unique to you
your workout schedule age gender
location your sweat rate and even the
weather are all key to the equation in
the past only elite athletes had access
to the tools needed to dial in optimal
hydration that is until now introducing
Trago the world's first connected smart
water bottle
the Targo cap fits on any standard
widemouth water bottle and connects to
an app on your smartphone using
Bluetooth Low Energy
it runs on a commonly found replaceable
battery because the last thing you need
is another device to charge it uses
patent-pending
ultrasonic technology to measure how
much you drink with the Trago cap you
know exactly how much you should be
drinking each day more than that the app
automatically builds an adjust your
profile by seamlessly connecting to
other wearable devices so there's no
extra work for you imagine recording a
long workout on another app or device
and then immediately understanding how
to hydrate for proper recovery or using
the app to know just how much water to
drink leading up to a marathon or
football game the Tri go cap also allows
you to monitor teams groups and multiple
bottles coaches and trainers can keep an
eye on all their players because proper
hydration happens the long before the
game starts with our experienced team
we've already solved most of the
challenges and bringing the Tri go cap
to reality we're ready to take our
product into manufacturing but we need
your help please spread the word and
help us support our mission and changing
the way people think about hydration
