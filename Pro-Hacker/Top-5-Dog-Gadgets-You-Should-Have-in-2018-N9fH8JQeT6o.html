place pick a poo on your dog's tail
before you go out for a walk and when he
is ready to poop all the droppings fall
directly into the collection bag when
your dog is finished pooping you just
unclip the bag and throw it away with no
mess and no leakage we love our dogs but
don't love cleaning up after them
the hurricane 9 is the world's coolest
new fetch toy it's time to reinvent your
game of fetch with this 100-plus foot
gravity-defying flying ring launcher dog
owners already love the hurricane I'm
alright this is my dog Sharkey and these
are your average dog toys frisbee no
interest Chuckie gets blown as soon as I
come out look he goes crazy oh the ball
the hurricane 9 ring launcher built to
give your dog maximum exercise in just a
fraction of the time it's made from
durable EBA foam which is built to
withstand the sharpest teeth you don't
have to replace the Rings after just one
game of fetch forget about those
slobbery tennis balls
the hurricane 9 works indoors it floats
and yet you could take it to the dog
park all dogs love the hurricane 9 even
if your dogs not typically the type to
chase a tennis ball within months after
launch the hurricane 9 was already
featured on the news and it was selected
as a top 5 must-have toy at the San
Diego pet expo did I mention it was
invented by a rocket scientist hi I'm
John Hunter co-inventor of the hurricane
9 I work in high-speed airplanes solar
airplanes and now the world's most
bodacious dog to life and one day I was
working on a sporty good that would fly
a really long ways based on an airplane
wing like this we take an airplane the
rest into a circle and it flies the
country mile I took it to my daughter's
house and just for fun I tried it in
front of her dog Amos and he was went
crazy so I immediately realized after
about 20 more shots that Amos really
liked this thing we had a great dog toy
in our hands
here we go dogs aerodynamics 101
while we've been teaching dogs we've
been talking to dog trainers to
something really great about this toy is
that I also float so if you have an
active dog who likes the water would be
a great idea as well
like most of us Emma's owner is a busy
person and so she doesn't get that daily
exercise a study show is proven to make
a healthy happy pub and so she's left a
dream of that blissfully exhausting game
of fetch
after just two launches your dog has
already run the length of a whole
football field and it's easy to use you
just load the ring pull it back and
release and to use it inside just pull
it back part of the way and if you're
feeling old-fashioned just throw it
without the launcher you go tiger it
also doubles as a great training egg
the hurricane 9 comes with three rings
with six rings or with six rings sold
separately
the hurricane nine is now for sale at
hurricane 9.com so your dog could be
flying through the air with a better
workout a better toy and a lot more fun

Ridgid dog walking schedules introducing
brilliant pad the world's first indoor
self-cleaning potty pad system that
gives you freedom and flexibility with
better hygiene for you and your dog
here's how it works the dog goes potty
and the pad absorbs liquids and begins
to dry out solids then the system
replaces the soiled pad with a fresh
clean one a barrier lining wraps and
seals waste to lock away odor the system
is hands-off for weeks at a time then
disposal is fast easy and clean simply
replace the used roll with a new one
each roll equates to 27 traditional pads
brilliant pad is also better for the
environment the pads use 1/3 less
material than traditional pads and the
end caps and rods are biodegradable
brilliant pad gives your dog a healthy
option when they're sick or need to go
in the middle of the night and they
won't get uncomfortable from holding it
too long
brilliant pad is automatic clean and
convenient
waste and odor are sealed away it
provides freedom and flexibility and
improves health and hygiene for you and
your dog relax
