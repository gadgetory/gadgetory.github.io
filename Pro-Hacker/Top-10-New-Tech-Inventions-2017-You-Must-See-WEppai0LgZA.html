with any audio device imagine being
cocooned by a pure mist warm gentle and
luxurious Cirrus is like showering in
the clouds
wow that was a phenomenal experience I'm
totally blown away I'm really impressed
with an amazing shower they say that
it's like showering in a cloud it really
is Cirrus is a revolutionary showerhead
that elevates the bathing ritual into
the stratosphere our atomizing cloud
maker nozzle technology produces amidst
so fine that it totally envelops you and
by creating a myth so fine Cirrus
reduces water and energy consumption by
75 percent compared to conventional
showerheads meaning you'll see a rapid
return on your investment Cirrus also
purifies the water in which you'll bathe
our easy to replace nano filters contain
three layers of mineralized stones which
enhance water quality by filtering
impurities reducing chlorine adding
minerals and balancing pH levels each
nano filter lasts two to three months of
use for an average family you can also
choose from our range of organic
essential oil aromatherapy infusers
simply add an infuser each time you
shower for a completely invigorating
experience personally I'm not really one
for the aromatherapy but my girlfriend
is she says it's like having a spa home
our essential oils are both colorless
and soap free meaning they do not
perfume your hair or body or discolor
the water so how does spirits work
our eco-friendly cloud maker water
atomizing technology delivers the
consistent spray by splitting the
incoming water stream into myriad nano
droplets creating a mist that is both
all-embracing and highly efficient well
to be honest I was a little skeptical
about the water savings but I've been
using it for about a month now and I've
seen a significant drop in water
consumption I can see this thing paying
for itself in no time and Cirrus does
not compromise rinse ability in fact
foamy shampoo rinses out of your hair
easier with Cirrus thanks to its
optimized water distribution I'm really
surprised if anything the shower rinsed
off the shampoo on my hair faster than a
normal shower which really surprised me
because my hair is really thick Cirrus
is designed in France and uses Chrome
and flight polycarbonate to produce a
stylish unapologetically modern bathroom
showerheads
it's made with standard Universal
fittings and installs in seconds it is
adaptable to any bathroom and setup is
both tool lists and foolproof the
installation is the easiest thing in the
world I'm no handyman it took me seconds
to do it if I can do it anyone can do it
I have been managing the complex
logistics of production and distribution
for major retailers and businesses since
I arrived in Asia ten years ago we have
a team permanently based here in Hong
Kong so we can closely monitor the
development and production processes and
importantly to keep a keen eye on
quality control you can count on us to
deliver on our work so where's the catch
the catch
now I'll take even longer to get ready
now if you'll excuse me serious like
showering in the clouds
hi I'm Howard hominy unplug we are
direct human and savor excited to show
you a new product grow IQ a smart grow
light system that provides an easy and
effective way to grow plants the idea of
Gro IQ came for our interest in a smart
yet simple and affordable solution for
indoor growing whether you're a hobbyist
or a professional grower it shouldn't be
difficult or expensive to acquire a
smart grow light solution that makes it
easy to grow while still achieving high
yield
we have spent hundreds of hours to
design and develop a product that we can
be proud of we've gone through many
prototypes and revisions to come up with
a product that does not compromise
quality or ease of use while still
maintaining the most affordable and
practical solution on the market our
mobile app was made very simple and
straightforward to operate it offers an
intuitive interface to schedule the
lighting cycles with various setting
options to fit your needs with the grow
IQ mobile app you can simply connect it
to the light set the schedule and let it
run you'll be worryfree until the
cycling is done and the plant is ready
for the next cycle
the Gro IQ is designed to be highly
integrated into compact this eliminates
the hassle of using external timer
the girl like you system is also
equipped with other features to get the
user peace of mind it continuously
monitors the internal temperature of the
light box and will automatically shut
off the power if it senses an unusually
high temperature that can pose a threat
to the plants environment if scheduling
system is self-sustainable in case of a
power outage or a temporary power
disconnection it will continue the light
cycle as scheduled once the power
returned
besides being smart Gro IQ is also a
dynamic solution we design the product
with ability to pair with other lights
and synchronize them at once without the
hassle of managing them individually so
don't throw out your old light yet plug
the light in to grow IQ and it will
manage the scheduling for both we also
wanted to make our product a great
display in the house the light box is
made of exotic solid wood panel
hand-picked and crafted by our own
engineers with elegant contemporary
designs we want to make sure that grill
IQ not only functions well but it also
adds a nice modern touch to your decor
we spent countless hours to bring grow a
few to the finished product but we can't
continue to make available to the public
without your backing so we hope you'll
support us and making sure like two more
affordable and more accessible to anyone
who's interested and smarter indoor
growing

Oh
let's talk about taking the perfect
photo first compose the shot
check the histogram adjust the exposure
focus on your subject compute the
hyperfocal distance to keep everything
sharp enable bracketing to get more
dynamic range add a neutral density
filter update the exposure and then take
the shot
we built a better way
today's DSLR and mirrorless cameras have
amazing optics and sensor but they do
very little to actually help you take a
good photo
finding the right settings involves a
series of complex techniques and
formulas as an engineer with a
background in artificial intelligence I
knew I could build a tool to simplify
the process I wanted something that
would let me focus on the composition
but would handle the details for me so I
created Arsenal the world's first AI
photography assistant with one task
Arsenal find settings take the best
photo possible Arsenal's AI searches
thousands of images in its database to
suggest aesthetic next it fine Tunes the
suggestions by analyzing 18 different
factors Arsenal uses state-of-the-art
machine learning to help you take a
great photo in any condition
many of the memorable shots you see
today are captured by combining multiple
exposures through a labor-intensive
process called photo second with arsenal
you can do this in seconds
capture all the details and scenes with
high dynamic range get everything in
sharp focus and create long exposures
without buying expensive filters using
these advanced techniques arsenal lets
you go beyond the limitations of your
camera's sensor linton for times when
you want complete control you can
wirelessly adjust manual settings see a
live preview and trigger the shutter all
from up to 100 feet away
Arsenal also improves the experience of
reviewing photos in the field you can
flip through the photos on your camera
zoom in to check out details at full
resolution then share your favorite
photos right from your phone and finally
Arsenal makes it easy to capture
stunning time-lapse
it automatically adjusts the exposure in
changing lights giving you a smooth
day-to-night transition you can even
watch a high-def preview of your
time-lapse while it's being taken
whether you're a pro who is already
mastered manual shooting or you just
bought your first DSLR Arsenal can help
take your photography to the next level
so before you replace your gear try
upgrading your techniques with Arsenal
Arsenal is already being tested in the
field now I need your help to ramp up
production by supporting our campaign
stay you can be one of the first to get
Arsenal we've got exclusive rewards for
our early backers and some awesome
special award I'm really excited about
the photos I've been getting with us I
can't wait to share it with you and see
all the amazing photos you'll see
imagine an object with an intelligence
created to understand you and your needs
introducing mumble your home genius with
artificial intelligence
mama'll is integrated into a language

two years to create the moment it was
challenging but a fantastic experience
shared with some great people now mom is
ready to go into production and we need
your support which is this we can't wait
to share more with you so please back us
today thank you
the devices we carry help us enjoy our
lives that little bit more our cameras
smartphones tablets and maybe even our
drones the speaker for the party the
headphones for the Train or even the
bubble machine for the party often we
have to compromise how we use our
gadgets we take less photos Russian
email or dim our screens all to save
power before our device dies nukes power
plant was created to stop exactly that
power plant is a portable wall outlet
that is with you all the time
it's splash proof lightweight and
durable design allows you to carry it
anywhere its power on-demand power plant
includes a universal power outlet that
lets you charge your technology with US
UK and European plugs you can also fast
charge multiple devices and recharge
your power plant in under two hours when
power plants internal battery runs out
the internal battery can be swapped out
and replaced with another this gives you
an endless supply of power for your tech
power plant has enough to charge a
typical smartphone over ten times a
tablet four times and a macbook once it
will power anything up to 65 watt
including a 50-inch TV power plant is
ready never miss a moment never run out
of power again I really want people to
understand how the sound that's it okay
this is not just another device that is
going to count something for you this is
like changing and it's already been life
changing for thousands of people my
patients needed solutions outside of the
office to reduce their stress response
and what it came down to within people's
nervous system during fight or flight
nobody that their best fight or flight
kills all of our rational thinking it
inflames our body it creates 90
percent of chronic health problems and I
think we need a solution that's simple
effective and that anybody can use so
that everybody can be their best
touchpoints our neuroscience wearables
that decrease stress levels and as
little as 30 seconds the devices use
gentle vibration on either side of the
body to help you calm down focus
optimize your performance and even sleep
better touch points come in a set to be
worn on either side of the body and can
be purchased at any one of four colorful
options they can be worn as wearables on
your wrist clip to clothing hidden in
pockets or socks are held in each hand
making them useful at any time of day
just 30 seconds of using touch points
can reduce stress by up to 71% we're
currently using the touch points in the
preoperative evaluation so when a
patient comes in for surgery that day we
ask them to rate their level of anxiety
about having surgery and if it's at a
level of 5 or greater we give them the
touch points to hold during their pre-op
evaluation it's like the history and
physical process of getting their IV
started has been phenomenal we've had
really great success and the patients
are loving them and what to buy them to
use at home I purchase touch points you
know because I have a child in the
autism spectrum last year we went
through a very tough time where she
wouldn't even get out of the car for her
favorite activities so I saw the touch
points and I decided to try it so it was
very easy to use our third day with
touch points she just ended up coming
out of the car and we were back to our
routine so that was an amazing
experience for us I'm in grade five at
Santa and charter school in their gifted
program I use them right before tests
and sometimes in class
well they help me a lot with anxiety and
just help me relax
a lot my name is Justin white I work for
Arizona industries for the blind as the
touch point solution Account Manager my
specific responsibilities are I make
sure that orders get out on time I also
handle billing and then any other
customer service inquiries 70% of people
who are visually impaired or blind are
unemployed
I've been visually impaired all of my
life touchpoint Solutions has been
wonderful about choosing us as a partner
to help bridge the gap so we have
pre-existing scientific research then we
have something called archival clinical
data where I have years of clinical data
then we have the neuroscience
electroencephalogram data which shows a
reduction in the high frequency waves
that are associated with anxiety in less
than 30 seconds now that we know this
works and we've got user data that
confirms all of my prior scientific
findings we're listening to our
customers and they're really asking us
for a simpler solution that's more
affordable you know when you change one
hit from going into fight or flight
everyday in a classroom you're affecting
that whole classroom and when you're
expecting all those classrooms you're
affecting the whole school and when
you're affecting entire schools you're
affecting the entire community and it
just goes on from there
Lily used to climb the highest mountains
in search of the freshest air with wind
she doesn't have to anymore wind is the
world's first personal air quality
system that generates fresh and clean
air that's portable and is simple to use
its built-in sensor monitors the air
quality around Lily and adjusts its
power to filter more or less wind helps
Lily keep the air around her clean and
fresh even when she's traveling wind
works by creating a bubble of healthy
air around it dirty air is drawn in by
vents pulled through a medical-grade air
filter and clean air is propelled out of
the top wind can filter things like
allergens dust pet dander smoke pretty
much anything except that Lily can
adjust the amount of clean air wind
releases by simply twisting the wind app
allows Lily to check the quality of the
air around her gain insight about the
air she's filtered and check the air
quality of her friends and family Wynne
knows when Lily's filter is used up and
can automatically ship a replacement
filter to her home and the air quality
tracker can even detach to keep Lily
aware of the air she's breathing while
she's on the go wind blends seamlessly
into Lily's life allowing her to breathe
easy no matter where life takes her
what we breathe matters we all have
experiences or no loved ones who have
been affected by poor air quality
whether that's from allergens germs
smoke or industrial pollution I founded
win because I've watched for too many
years as my relatives and Beijing
suffered from poor air quality the air
problem goes way beyond China and we
want to enable everyone no matter where
they live or where life takes them to
enjoy a healthy air environment wind is
designed not just to clean the air but
also understand the environment so that
can proactively take care of any
problems and to do both wherever the
user goes past 18 months we've been
working hard with an amazing team of
engineers scientists and designers to
bring win to life today we're proud to
