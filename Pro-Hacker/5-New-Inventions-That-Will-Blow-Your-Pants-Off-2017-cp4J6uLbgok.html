Philips in 2007 I decided to pursue my
own dream and start my first company
alfonzo it's currently the fastest
growing art a company in Europe but I
started with absolutely nothing back
home in the living room local computers
was raised with the same spirit as a
phones app it's a new concept a new
venture a team with a vision about why
and how to do things different
everything we do at Akko is inspired by
what I think is the definition of
radical innovation we have created a
product with a unique form factor and a
new functionality being able to present

made me hand in my contract nine years

has a lot more ideas about doing things
differently if you do are passionate

Lily used to climb the highest mountains
in search of the freshest air with wind
she doesn't have to anymore wind is the
world's first personal air quality
system that generates fresh and clean
air that's portable and is simple to use
its built-in sensor monitors the air
quality around Lily and adjusts its
power to filter more or less wind helps
Lily keep the air around her clean and
fresh even when she's traveling wind
works by creating a bubble of healthy
air around it dirty air is drawn in by
vents pulled through a medical-grade air
filter and clean air is propelled out of
the top wind can filter things like
allergens dust pet dander smoke pretty
much anything except that Lily can
adjust the amount of clean air wind
releases by simply twisting the wind app
allows Lily to check the quality of the
air around her gain insight about the
air she's filtered and check the air
quality of her friends and family Wynne
knows when Lily's filter is used up and
can automatically ship a replacement
filter to her home and the air quality
tracker can even detach to keep Lily
aware of the air she's breathing while
she's on the go
wind blends seamlessly into Lily's life
allowing her to breathe easy no matter
where life takes her what we breathe
matters we all have experiences or no
loved ones who have been affected by
poor air quality whether that's from
allergens germs smoke or industrial
pollution I founded wind because I've
watched for too many years as my
relatives in Beijing suffered from poor
air quality the air problem goes way
beyond China and we want to enable
everyone no matter where they live or
where life takes them to enjoy a healthy
air environment wind is designed not
just to clean the air but also
understand the environment so that can
proactively take care of any problems
and to do both wherever the user goes
the past 18 months we've been working
hard with an amazing team of engineers
scientists and designers to bring win to
life today
we're proud to come to you to get your
support so we can launch the product
spread the word and grow the community
thank you
we are mouse and we've designed a phone
case that can do this this is quite
scary and it is my iPhone 7 ready it
goes and they look like this
we found that slim phone cases weren't
that protective and protective phone
cases are ugly so we designed a lot of
phone cases carbon-fibre ones metal ones
curved ones wooden ones leather ones you
name it we designed it and we tested
them on real iPhones some survived oh my
word hey doing this and some didn't he
go expensive but in the end we did it
introducing limitless by mouse a slim
phone case with serious engineering that
hasn't compromised on looks Walmart
bamboo black marble black leather matte
gray Kevlar carbon fiber
this is London's Waterloo Bridge higher
up here than I thought it was a 35 foot
drop
here we go not even a scratch how
because we've engineered an advanced
impact material arrow shock it's inside
all our phone cases this unique polymer
contains thousands of micro air pockets
that absorb the impacts a ball bearing
the drop some regular plastic bounces
but on arrow shock the energy is
absorbed the same thing happens in our
phone cases all our cases are seriously
protective so protective we've dropped
it from a crane onto concrete from 45
feet
all our cases have a steel plate built
into the back and they come with a free
magnetic wall mount for backers they fit
both the iPhone six and seven so you
don't have to upgrade your case the same
applies for the six plus and the sevens
loss here you can see our tools making
our cases using our own materials so
please head up the IndieGoGo right now
and get your case
what kind of a snorer are you
introducing the silent partner the
world's first smart batch to quiet
snoring noise silent partner is a smart
lightweight and compact device that
elegantly tackles what other products
don't the snoring noise the silent
partner creates a silent zone around the
person wearing it giving you and those
around a better night's sleep
how does it work silent partner uses
patented active noise cancellation that
detects the unwanted snoring sound and
generates a counter sound which
suppresses it the result well it's as
simple as a plus and minus they cancel
each other out many of us have probably
been there being around or creating a
symphony of snoring noises that create
frustrating nights for us and our
partners most learning products today
don't fully solve the snoring problem
they are often intrusive and disrupt the
quality of sleep so instead of tackling
the snoring we decided to simply find a
solution for the noise using vast
experience with a and C technology and
sleeping experts the silent partner was
designed and developed to be effective
from as close as 20 centimeters away
place silent partner over your nose and
gently adhere it to your face the
hypoallergenic adhesive will secure the
device in place comfortably while you
sleep be one of the first to experience
silent partner and finally give you in
your partner a real silent night
why don't many cyclists use locks
they're too heavy too cumbersome too
bulky and not designed for those people
who really want to ride their bikes Auto
lock is an all-new cinch line for both
cyclists and outdoor enthusiasts who

it's far more secure than a cable lock
and much lighter than a you lock in your
saddlebag in your pocket or anywhere on
your bike Auto lock is so lightweight

engineered design that uses multiple
layers of high temper eighteen

extremely cut resistant conventional
theft tools like wire or bolt cutters

auto lock auto lock also has more uses
beyond bicycles but for example ski and
snow tools and sheds camping gear water
sports and more the possibilities with
Auto lock are limitless
the auto lock weighs under 115 grams and
coils to under 3 inches in diameter
making it easy to pack and store on the
bike in pockets backpacks purses or
jerseys in comparison you locks or
chains are 10 to 20 times heavier than
auto lock and much more difficult to
carry the cinching function keeps your
gear locked tight we've designed auto
lock with three resettable combination
wheels and a durable aluminum head the
auto lock comes in multiple colors and
is available in different lengths
starting with the all-around 30 inch
version which offers the most
versatility auto lock also comes in a
super compact 18 inch Pro Rider
