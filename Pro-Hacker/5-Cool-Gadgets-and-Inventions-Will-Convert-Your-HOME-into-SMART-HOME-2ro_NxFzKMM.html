finally here and he's not just an
aluminum shell nor is he just a three
axis motor system she's not even adjust
the connected device he's one of the
family Chivo this little bod of mine
what if technology actually treated you
like a human being
what if technology helps you to feel
closer to the ones you love what if
technology helps you like a partner
rather than simply being a tool that's
what she was about that's why I created
this company and I got the right team to
do it people with a proven track record
of bringing innovative technologies and
exciting content to market but now we
need your help to build geebo to bring
it to the world and to grow the
community let's work together to make
Cibo truly great and together we can
humanize technology
we are surrounded by technology it's
entering our homes and helping us
automate daily tasks but I find myself
thinking there has to be a more natural
and accessible way to control the
devices around us it's the goal of
automation is to simplify our lives why
does it feel so complicated our goal as
a company is to solve this
say hello to knocky knocky is a small
elegant device that instantly transforms
ordinary surfaces in your environment
into remote controls using naki couldn't
be easier simply take it out of the box
pick a place to put it
select the surface to attach it to and
then define all the things you'd like
Nike to do naki can control a wide
variety of devices around us but the
true beauty of our technology is that
what it can do is only limited by your
imagination put one in your living room
for the kitchen or even your bedroom
I mean imagine rolling over in the
morning and tapping a simple pattern
anywhere on your nightstand to smooth
your alarm and start the coffeemaker
without even opening your eyes you just
bought ten more minutes in bed and
you'll definitely want to put one in
your kids bedroom it's exciting to think
of how naki will spark their imagination
if they figure out all kinds of ways to
use it using Wi-Fi which is proven to be
far more reliable and would better reach
them Bluetooth you can enjoy using naki
from anywhere the number of devices and
software that noxee interact with is
rapidly growing every day
it currently includes mess - look few
life acts smart sayings IFT pee pee and
more but even if you're new to the smart
technology world you can still use naki
for simple functions around your home
other technologies that rely on sound or
voice control can be unreliable and
confusing to you they can be triggered
accidentally and don't always work in
respective our patent-pending technology
uses non acoustic sensors it's able to
distinguish deliberate tap or knock
patterns from random vibrations in the
environment the beauty of our product is
that it makes any regular environment
into a user interface think about the
surfaces around you so many of them
serve one or two purposes add an oxy to
them and you instantly have a hub for
automation we carefully chose every
material and finish Funaki we've gone
through series of different tests and
prototypes to make sure that naki blends
in in your environment and also looks
beautiful on researchers we're doing our
first production runs here in the USA
because it's important for our entire
team to be there on the ground floor
ensuring that we're manufacturing the
best possible product it's not some
far-fetched idea we have finalized our
design we have beautiful working
prototypes and we need to raise funds to
actually get it into production and
immediately start shipping them to your
door we couldn't be more excited about
how this product is going to change
lives and bring joy to people everywhere
Nakia accomplishes what technology is
supposed to do instead of taking over
our life it enhances it allowing you to
put more thought and effort into the
really matter happen to the world around
you with the magic of naki
the mother I know how crazy life can get
there's always something going on and
never enough time to get it all done I
was constantly looking for ways to bring
efficiency to my home that's when I
found new bright new bright is an
all-in-one smart home solution that
replaces your existing lighting switches
but it's so much more than a light
switch with new bright we have built in
home security
smart lighting and other family
management tools that have brought
much-needed automation to our home
things like using the home intercom
system to call the kids when it's time
to eat or using a family calendar to
schedule our appointments have been a
lifesaver my kids were always leaving
the lights on so we love the advanced
lighting modes with new bright apps we
can schedule our lights to come on and
off at certain times activate motion
detection lighting and even have our
lights come on when we're gone to make
it look like someone's home plus we can
monitor how much energy our lighting is
using and it's been great to see how
much energy and money we've been saving
new right also has a built in home
security
with camera and motion detectors so I
know my kids are safe I've always been
one to worry about someone breaking in
but now that we have new rights I have
that extra peace of mind with new bright
we feel safe comfortable and more
organized and that is a good feeling
thanks to bright for making our life
easier for making it better
medicine if you didn't have to get your
phone out for every little thing what if
it was a simpler way to interact with
your devices slick is a wireless button
that connects to your iOS or Android
device so instead of going to your phone
you simply press the button that's
better
I use the slick app to set it up and the
1960 wherever I want I can even share
this lick with my roommate so he can use
it when I'm not around the flick isn't
just for your house you can stick your
clicks anywhere like in your car or on
your bike
and break
it's really cool
your emanation and on the left
and you can clip your flesh it's great
for any situation where you need a quick
and discreet shortcut me me me me me

but flight can be so much more than just
a shortcut to your phone it can be
integrated with lots of different
services beyond your devices check this
one out

everything to just take care of itself
Shh movie starting

be used as a safety device which is the
push of a button you can send live
updates with your location or even a
distress signal to your family and
friends finally I don't want to be tough
yeah hey blond guys let me cook I grab a
quick selfie first me and the flick team
are you guys ready down to three work hi
rich Swedish teams has been working for
almost two years to create slick and
we're really excited to finally show it
to you we've gone through a hardware
incubator in San Francisco to travel all
across Europe and China to finalize
design and define the right partners we
have developed a slick app to be super
simple to set up
just open your app press the button and
select the function that you need we
also have an ISA software development
kit that allows other apps to work with
slate we already have an amazing app
that will work with slick already from
the start and now we need your help to
make this all happen in order to bring
slick to the market and it's in your
hands we need to fund the tooling and
certifications that are needed in return
for your contribution will send you the
very first flakes ever made thank you

situation I mean don't you wish you can
know who's at the door before you stop
what you're doing answer it want to see
who's there when you're not home but the
kids are and what about what it starts
but we're making all that possible and
we're doing it with minimal design and
cutting-edge technology

sensor the cover is made from hardened
plastics with a UV coating that will not
rust or interfere with the Wi-Fi signal
it's rugged and it will survive harsh
