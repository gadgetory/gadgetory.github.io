technology trained to opposing muscle
groups with each movement helping me

technology to train its astronauts in
the International Space Station a NASA
study proved that Spira flex resistance
increased lean muscle as efficient as
free weights

hello my name is Mukesh Chhabra and I'm
the co-founder of three boob the most
stylish private sector seer sitting
right now in front of your webcam I hear
that you don't have no control who's
watching it as more and more reports are
being published or the dangerous webcam
heads the urgency of covering the webcam
is at an all-time high but that has to
be ugly as picking them posted or at
least bigger on your webcam we don't
think so our elegant and practical hot
resolution guarantees you with no one is
buying the fearsome text it's one of the
thinnest products on the market just one
millimetre thick it's even self within a
few seconds encourage the webcam of the
laptop or mobile devices at the
convenient the material doesn't a second
performance of your webcam and does not
leave any scratches on the device and
it's made in Germany after the birth of
our son we started to think about the
danger of all the webcams around or
saving them with stickers are posted not
me satisfy us we started thinking about
an elegant and terrorized American cover
soon we found a little manufacture in
our neighborhood who provided us with
the first prototype I'm working with
confidential customer documents since my
customers trust me I have to get sure
about one click to keep the document
information secure I'm very happy about
practical hardware solutions after
testing and redesigning our product over
the last month we are confident to offer
you an elegant and public surprise
product designed and made in our
hometown of unity
thank you for watching at this stage
we're ready for mass production and if
you support the cover style across this
legacy on IndieGoGo so we can provide
you the most elegant and practical
background color

Oh
baby
breathing is the most natural and
important thing we do and every day
almost 3000 gallons of air fill our
lungs an ER is everywhere where we live
where we work where we sleep but you
really know what's in the air you
breathe you might think that pollution
is only outside but it's the complete
opposite many studies have proved that
indoor air is up to five times more
polluted than outdoor air that is why we
created Theory
Cleary is the most amazing natural air
purifier powered by real thing that
helps people in reducing indoor air
pollution and it will be the best design
object you will ever have on the market
right now there are only traditional
electronic air purifiers made in plastic
very ugly big and bulky and in early
work thanks to filters this is why we
thought about something revolutionary
and we created the perfect synergy
between nature technology and design the
hottest Clery work we designed a smart
flower pot that amplifies the natural
properties of sin our idea started from
a research of measure they found out
this confluence of possibilities
eliminates off the gate the problem is
that a single plant isn't that effective
so we created a technology unit that
allows more air flow through the soil
and the roots this is where the
filtration happens we use plans that
biofilters roots and soil generate
colonies of microorganism that trap and
filter the toxic agents in year in a
natural way clearing sacks filters 93%
of toxic agents immediately
it's very silent and has a very low
energy consumption less than 50% other
LED bulb you can manage it with your
smartphone and the best thing is that
there are no filters so you don't have
to change them and waste money what
happens inside is not magic but a
scientific fact and we proved it we did
many researchers and prove the
effectiveness of Clery at limber one of
the most important research labs on
plants in Europe and peanuts a spin-off
of the University of Florence based in
Italy
Cleary is also probably an Italian
design product we work hard for years to
design it in every detail we developed
multiple sketches and prototypes to make
the design perfect we presented it at CA
2015 and had great success we have a
super team with two brilliant industrial
designers and a great advisor team that
helped Italy has a long tradition of
craftsmen especially in the ceramic
field this Italian culture is an
inspiration for us we use a ceramic
first for the physical quality but
mostly because it's eco-friendly and it
doesn't release any toxic agent in the
year obviously we also work really hard
on the technology part of our product we
came to the Silicon Valley to make
something really powerful with developed
our technology working close with
engineers and manufacturers in the
Silicon Valley to improve the
functionalities of Clery thanks to our
technology unit in our smartphone app
with health and air quality sensor clear
is able to track like toxic agents in
the air and give you real-time pollution
and led analysis of it and also
temperature and humidity monitor Clery
lives with you telling what's wrong
maybe allergies sleep problems
productivity asthma it learns about you
and cares about you
it works with Wi-Fi so wherever you are
clear it can give you healthy tips on
how to feel better and tell you
