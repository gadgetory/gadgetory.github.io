are the unpredicted ones the small
surprises or the everyday experiences
there are the happy accidents that
change our lives we won't always have
the time to take out our phone to record
these fleeting moments of happiness
wouldn't it be great to capture and keep
these memories instead of simply
watching them pass by this is what we
invented the mocha cam
snap-snap is the world's smallest 4k
camera and unlike any current action
camera snap is small enough to wear
comfortably and it's elegant design is a
fit with any fashion statement the
innovative 180 degree flip lens allows
you to shoot from the best angles and
enables so many creative possibilities
it may not always be easy to find the
button when you wear a camera but with
snap you can turn it on and start
filming with just a click of the remote
the snap battery life allows for one and
a half hours of continuous video
recording which is impressive for a
camera of its tiny size
what's more the video can be uploaded to
the cloud via the Wi-Fi connection so
you can share the story of your life
with friends and family anywhere
immediately with the magnet clip quarter
inch adapter or waterproof case you'll
have numerous ways to wear it and
explore
and with 4k image quality those precious
moments of life are yours to remember
forever
this is our fourth crowdfunding campaign
from the development and launch of our
mocha cam mocha 360 and alpha products
we've learned how to turn good design
into reliable and durable products
quickly and efficiently memory can be
blurry notes can be lost but recorded
images tell the true stories of our
lives capture the best moments of your
life with snap upload them to the cloud
and keep them forever

available now on Kickstarter made by
video Kickstarter the Hydra shredders
are for that upper level athlete she's
very strong and fit and really needs
that extra resistance in the water to
give them that high level workout you
don't get that 0 to 400 pounds of
pressure from any other workout thing it
doesn't exist so the Hydra shredders
they come in pairs you can use them like
anything else that you're used to in a
dryland environment you can do the same
thing in the water we did actually open
up and really amplify that inner cavity
to allow you to use it one in each hand
or use both hands on one of the products
if I pull it really slowly through the
water I'm only gonna put 10 pounds at
most of pressure on my body if I'm more
physically able the faster I pull it the
more it pushes back
so it's an accessible object and then
you can get into just a full hardcore
crazy workout anyone who thinks that
aquatic fitness isn't challenging enough
I would give them the Hydra shredders
and say try these cuz they'll work you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
