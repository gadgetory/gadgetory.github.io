meet Scribus the world's first write and
erase robot that creates a different
image whenever you want to nails and a
plug is all you need to install scribble
and thanks to the app it's always
connected create an image or source it
from the web then upload it to the app
and scribble will reproduce it on your
wall within minutes and if you get tired
of the design no worries
scribble will just erase it and you can
start over again you can connect script
to your favorite apps and show you the
latest news and weather forecasts or
even your Twitter updates any surfaces
game whiteboard glass or standard
plaster
and with four color options the
possibilities are endless the only limit
is your imagination
turn your wall into a wonder wha with
scribble today we need information but
we spend too much time in from the
screens for our smartphones computers
TVs so the question is how can we get
information and data but without adding
more screens to our lives
what I love about scribble is that it
can literally turn every surface you
have around you into something dynamic
surfaces that can show data art or
murals that remind you of the good times
and it's an amazing way not just to help
you work leave but also to interact with
other people and to interact remotely as
well with other people of your life
really what you can do is limitless
think about having a super gifted hand
it's a robotic hand and do whatever you
want to the wall you can think about
basic information as you know the
weather forecast or the things need to
buy it's like having an infant library
of apps allow you to turn anything in
life into something on your world where
the light most about scribble is that
the enhances everyone's fertility and
let you transform your house in a more
beautiful place to live
scribble Pines in the wall with just two
tiny wires and it moves thanks to its
two motors also we identified a new end
which is completely
repeat a fundamental part of scribbles
user experience is the platform that
allows people to upload share and the
world contents to display on their walls
the whole concept behind script is to
create a community and everyone is
already excited about it I can't wait to
see where our system people will do with
the platform imagine drawing sherry with
straight the possibilities are endless
crowdfunding is amazing because it's a
way for us to understand what you think
about our idea and for you to get your
script before than anyone else so please
support us in any way you can because it
will help us to bring scrip it into your
hands as soon as possible
