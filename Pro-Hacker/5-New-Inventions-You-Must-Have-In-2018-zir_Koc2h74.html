clothes out of storage other voice
assistants can use your conversations to
sell your data and send you ads Mycroft

hello I'm Joshua Montgomery the CEO of
Mycroft AI in 2015 we launched the
world's first open-source voice
assistant right here on Kickstarter in
July we delivered the mark 1 to backers
in 56 countries and 38 states the
software that we built for the mark 1
now runs anywhere you can download and
run it on the linux desktop or the
Raspberry Pi this is the first step
towards our larger goal an artificial
intelligence that runs anywhere and
interacts exactly like a person an AI
that understands context can communicate
naturally and hold a complete
conversation with our second Kickstarter
we're looking to expand the community
and work with them to build software
that allows you to voice enable anything
software that's customizable and lets
you rename the assistant and change its
personality and appearance to fit you
the mark 2 uses an advanced microphone
array so it can hear at long distances
even when music is playing we've also
added a screen so you can see things
like calendar entries timers even
security camera feeds to bring the mark
2 to life we need your help we need to
invest in tooling optimize our design
for manufacturing and continue to
improve the software that's why we're
asking for your support we need you to
