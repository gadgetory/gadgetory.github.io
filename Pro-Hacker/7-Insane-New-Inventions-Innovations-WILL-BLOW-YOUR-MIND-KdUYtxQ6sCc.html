we were in the business of electronics
but then we found out we were actually
in the business of people and the
business of adventuring and the business
of experience
and we have a responsibility to build
products that can do all of it and not
just do it but thrive
you did hear us on the same
I mean you could call it overkill but
they told us to make the packaging in a
cardboard and we said no because that's
not what Rome proof does that would be
compromising on the level of quality
that we've now learned to love said
that's what makes our product so special
is that we absolutely do not
this is
you know that frustrating moment when
your Bluetooth connection doesn't work
we decided to get rid of it
meet trippy a wireless speaker with
place and play technology trippy
automatically plays music from your
phone when it's placed on the speaker
changing streaming devices has never
been easier is it magic
no it's called place and play trippy has
for electromagnetic conductors that
catch the magnetic fields created by
your phone speaker
the design is Scandinavian and the
materials are environmentally friendly
we utilize the natural acoustic
properties of bamboo trippy is designed
to be brought everywhere now you can
seamlessly interact around the music
choose your favorite color and go trippy
hey Kickstarter's my name is Alex and
one of the founders are tripping at
Stockholm and shanghai-based start
working on redefining the wireless
figure so me and Eric have known each
other since a long time back I'm working
in management consulting in Shanghai and
Eric is working in a law firm in
Stockholm as you understand we needed a
fun project to work on we wanted to
create a social speaker allowing more
interaction around the speaker and we
wanted to improve this and package it in
a very sleek Scandinavian design ok guys
let's take this dream and make it real
we got great ambition and we want to
take this global as you can see people
already talks about us online but now we
need your help
all right guys now it's up to you we
want to bring this awesome speaker to
life you don't have to marry us but
please clenches
we're gonna make a trippy grade again
let's see that's there all thanks um I
think actually for come I wallet okay
leaving your wallet behind is the worst
that's why we invented leaf the world's
thinnest most advanced wallet tracking
technology to date leat this super thin
and slides easily into your wallet
without adding annoying bulk and it
works with your smartphone to instantly
remind you if you've left your wallet
behind you forgot your wallet I forgot
my wallet
see and the leaf is smart so when this
happens this happens we will notify you
and even drop a pin in your google maps
where your wallet was last within range
and provide you their contact info so
you can call the place and tell them to
hold it for you what if you just
misplaced your wallet at home before
Leif this is what happened but with Leif
things are much easier almost fun
and you can program leaf to notify you
when your wallet is a certain distance
away that way it isn't constantly going
off at home but might be more sensitive
when you're out and about that dude's
hat was dope right you didn't even know
he was a handsy 14e
beep you won't have to charge the leaf
often but when you do it's super easy
leaf charges wirelessly and you don't
even have to take it out of your wallet
lost wallets at up to trillions of
dollars a year and lost money stolen
identities maybe but even if not there's
nothing more annoying than having to
reorder new cards and update your
Netflix card info and whatever leaf
fixes all that stop leaving start
leasing get it
you
CEL from your boy this year we're
bringing you the latest innovation
personal transport the fully
carbon-fiber electric skateboard

right board is that we have at removable
bedrooms there are two of these that can
be removed taken on the airplane they

used as a portable power bank you can
also charge from the integrated USB

options single motor or jewel motor with
a speeds up to 20 miles an hour with the
10 mile range their remotes their own
custom design shockproof so if you drop
it it's not going to break an LED screen
to show current status of battery on the
board and on the remote and with
regenerative braking every time you
break you're putting power back into
your board we hear about design and
innovation so we're delivering you
beautifully finished carbon fiber deep

integrated hangers this gives you great
high speed stability in crisp and a city
corner you've got a Bluetooth wall
accessory mounts to GoPro and designed
for simple servicing we've got
integrated LED lights in the front of
the board the rear of the board and also
brake lights these work a charm any time
of the day or night and if you need to
leave the board it's as simple as
locking it with the remote our team is
passionate about last mile transport we
brought you the award winning yacht by
making the front page of Time magazine
and used in over 50 countries around the
world yoke board is a first of three
brand new last mile transport products
