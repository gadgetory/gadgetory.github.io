so I'm Robert lady I'm the VP of
technology with Cujo I was part of a
team that protected the world's oldest
banks government agencies etc so Cujo is
essentially a simple sophisticated smart
firewall how this works is you plug it
into your router with one ethernet cable
and you power it on that is it there is
literally nothing to configure and
nothing to set up how this is different
from everything else is that instead of
having rules on our router or Leo a
firewall system where you either have to
be an enthusiast or an expert we do all
the hard work for you your devices are
communicating you know within your
network to the internet we sample you
know header level data we hash it we
encrypt it and we send it to the cloud
that's what we do the heavy lifting we
are making sure you're not talking to
virus planet control systems we're
making sure you're not sausage and
phishing sites for things like SSL were
making sure there's no man in the middle
attacks where people are trying to
downgrade the security so we clean it
when the device gets a signal to block a
specific device to a rogue server you
get a notification on your app and
that's how you're informed of the user
ideally something like this shouldn't
exist in a world where things are secure
by default but sister or not something
like this is necessary because it's
plug-and-play there's literally nothing
to configure so in that context you
really just plug in one cable to your
router that's it like that's not how
easy this
you
