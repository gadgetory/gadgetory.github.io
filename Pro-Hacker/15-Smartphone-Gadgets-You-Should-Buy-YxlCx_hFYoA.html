two phones with sim pro too bulky phones

our lives are defined by special moments
these moments shape who we are how
others remember us we want these moments
to live forever a camera only captures
small glimpses of these moments but it
doesn't really tell the full story until
now
introducing life ie capture the world's
first spherical 360-degree camera for
your Android device and phone it's small
its light and it's powerful just plug in
shoot and instantly share now each
special moment you capture tells your

for extreme creativity especially when
it comes to dogs take it on your travels
to concerts while watching your favorite
teams it will be there for celebrations
and life smiles sounds like I will allow
you to revisit moments in time that you
never thought possible to relive can you
imagine what it would be like if
history's most important moments
captured with life I life II I share
your world so this started about a year
ago where we had to measure the contours
of an organic surface turns out that's a
very hard problem the only available
solution cost twenty thousand dollars
and that that's ridiculous so we set out
to build our own we looked at what was
available out there at the intersection
of computer vision and surface
measurement and we couldn't find a
single solution that was compelling the
3d scanners ever precise gosh tens of
thousands of dollars
when the ones are affordable one precise
level today that changes
we're only just beginning to explore the
possibilities of capturing the world in
3d 3d printing is an amazing tool it
converts a digital file into a physical
object some call it an industrial
revolution the eora 3d scanner does the
exact opposite of 3d printing it lets
artists makers and designers capture
objects and surfaces and turn them into
high quality 3d models and use them as
part of the creative process
we knew we had to use a smart phone
model phones are simply amazing we use
them to take pictures edit videos update
social media even for gaming the eora 3d
scanner is powered entirely by your
smartphone using it as easy just open
the app and press scan it'll
automatically adjust focus and exposure
and drive a green laser to scan your
object as it sweeps we take over 1,000
photos and analyze them in real time to
give you a 3d model a typical scan takes
three to five minutes and gives you a
full-color mesh with up to eight million
points with a range of one meter you can
capture objects big as one accurate to
less than 100 microns that's the
thickness of a single sheet of paper
when engineering the scanner we had one
objective in mind
precision all that's possible thanks to
a design that's both beautiful and
machined from a solid block of aluminium
with over 35 million operations we've
designed it to be both robust and
precise the light ring gives you quick
visual feedback and the adjustable knob
just to secure any module smart bug the
green laser let's just scan in any
lighting conditions as most cameras are
twice as sensitive to green than any
other color for water type models we
also design a Bluetooth turntable it
will sync to your scanner and rotate
your object to make sure you get every
angle we meticulously design every
aspect of the hardware and we've tested
seven different prototypes we've put
together a great team and we've lined up
several manufacturers now we need you in
the Kickstarter community to help us put
this together while creating I blazer -
we've optimized the physical design and
made significant improvements to the
electronic components and now our flash
became more functional and easy to use
at the same time there are new photo
opportunities appearing with a new eye
blazer - now it can be paired via
Bluetooth and work with a native iOS and
Android photo application we've added a
sensory panel into a blazer - you can
now adjust the light temperature with
itself this will allow you to make your
photos more professional and it's become
even more easy to use just double tap
and your picture is ready we made a new
mounting system for id laser -
smartphones and tablets clip with a
silicon coating that will work with
devices from 0.23 inches to 0.3 7 inches
with a cold shoe for digital cameras we
have also enlarged eye plays are two
possibilities in our new application
with its help you will be able to
synchronize several devices at once and
set individual adjustments for each of
them now your photos will be
beautiful and brighter I blazer too can
also be used in constant light mode it
will help you shoot videos in the dark
and catch lovely moments making them
more brilliant we believe that only
together we can make this product even
better the eye blazer team has already
been working on product enhancements for
two years we are a small team of young
aspiring people who build products
solely by our enthusiasm and love for
photography now we are looking for funds
to start I blazer to mass production and
need your help
we have never raised investments and
this is actually what we are very proud
of that is why we've come back again to
Kickstarter join us and support the I
blazer to project
