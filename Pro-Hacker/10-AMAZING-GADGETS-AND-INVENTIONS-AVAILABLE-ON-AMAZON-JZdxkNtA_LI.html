my name is Eugene Sabol Otsuki I'm one
of the founders of maximun group company
that developed byte helper I want to
take any journey back to Africa to 2014
where byte helper project started during
my trip to Tanzania I was able to meet
with Minister of Health and Tanzanian
Food and Drug Administration director
both of them expressed tremendous
problem that they're having with insect
borne diseases especially malaria dengue
and Zika once I realize how much of an
issue this is I wanted to do something
about it and I wanted to come up with a
product that helps people deal with the
itch associate with inside bites when a
mosquito bites us it injects its toxic
saliva under our skin and that's what
causes the itch through my studies I
learned that our body increases
temperature in order to fight pathogens
bacteria and viruses we wanted to use
mimic our body's response in a product
that will help to elevate temperature
neutralizing itch and irritation by
increasing localized circulation and
blood flow during the Consumer
Electronics Show in Las Vegas we were
able to identify heat tech company that
produces medical devices and heating
elements heat tag became our
manufacturing partners in this project
and helped us throughout the design and
implementation phase of this project we
established the first prototype of bite
helper using thermal post technology
used it on an insect bite and got great
results it managed h and irritation
immediately this was a big milestone for
us and established proof-of-concept my
helper is very simple to use
all you need to do is place that over
affected area activate thermal post
technology that will create heat and
vibration and you will be h free in less
than 45 seconds my helper uses two
double-a batteries it's a reusable
device and it's simple to use bite
helper is classified as a class to
medical device and available for sale in
the United States thank you for your
support and watching this bye helper
video I want to make sure the bite
helper becomes a household name and
helps people all over the world to deal
with itch and irritation associate with
insect bite
