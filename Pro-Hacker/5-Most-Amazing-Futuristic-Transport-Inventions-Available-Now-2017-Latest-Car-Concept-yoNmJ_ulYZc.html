embrace the flow of your body's natural
movement allowing you to spend more time
with your child outdoors the smooth
motion of the arms automatically adjusts
to your natural arm movement you can run
or walk at any speed there are no
stroller adjustments to make it follows
your lead the jog along is your outdoor
partner when you and your child are on
the move with the arms locked and caster
wheels on the front it's very mobile for
a casual stroll and for a low-impact
workout it's a true complement to you
walking or power walking and when
running you will celebrate your
performance it also easily converts to a
bicycle trailer the jog along stroller
supports an active families lifestyle by
sharing the experience you set a
foundation for a lifelong love of being
outside and physical activity using the
jog along will help you sustain your
fitness activity time as it works with
your body's natural motion your child is
secured in a five-point safety harness
and safely surrounded by a high-strength
lightweight aluminum frame the jog along
folds compactly for easy storage or
transport there are many features
already built into the jog along
stroller like adjustable suspension a
peekaboo window and water bottle holders
to name a few as runners ourselves we
agree that restrictions on your
freerunning form can reduce your desire
to use a traditional jogging stroller
the jog along works with your body's
natural arm swing making it easier for
you to be active with your child we've
spent years working on the design
ergonomics and safety of the jog along
stroller currently we are preparing for
a Kickstarter launch and would love to
keep you posted on the progress of
bringing the jog along to active
families thank you for your support

along with me you by my side everybody
they know
myself I won't see in the
you
you
greetings my name is Dean Kaman I'm
happy to tell you that our goal is to
bring back the iBot we'd like to take
everything great about the original I
bought and then enhance it with 15 years
of improvements in technology we've
watched people interactive and I buy and
we've seen them stand up and be at eye
level with their peers or their husband
or their wife when we've watched them go
up and down stairs and access public
buildings and go across rough terrain as
we've seen people enjoy the flexibility
and the freedom and the independence
that anti-bot brings that no wheelchair
can bring we've known that we have to
bring this technology to more people
that need it around the world got to me
Toyota as a company they share the same
vision as we deca have and because we
share a vision about how mobility should
be available to people with every kind
of need we're proud to say that we are
now getting the full support of the
Toyota company and we thank Toyota for
helping us turn that dream into reality
