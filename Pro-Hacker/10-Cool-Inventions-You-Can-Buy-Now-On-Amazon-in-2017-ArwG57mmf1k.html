almost 100 years who doesn't have a lock
that's completely useless because of a
forgotten combination or lost key at
best we waste time searching for the
right key or fumbling through the
combination we thought it was time for
the padlock to enter the 21st century so
we created the no key
by using your smartphone and the no key

belongings and go whether you're
protecting your bike your locker or
anything else all you need is your
smartphone and your no key and you're
good to go
the nil key uses wireless Bluetooth

remove your phone from your pocket or
purse the nokia Liao's you to easily
share your belongings safely and
securely while maintaining total control

been easier or safer with the Nokia you
can quickly give access without the
hassle or risk of giving up your key our
iOS and Android apps allow sharing to be
done on a one-time basis multi use basis
or any other customized schedule you
need giving access to your pool it's
just a click away giving access to your
storage unit is just a click away
products design is our passion
form and function complement each other
in an attractive and simple design we
made the Nokia with a water-resistant
shell devoid of any external buttons and
built with is user replaceable battery
that lasts over a year when it's time to
replace the batteries simply unlock the
no key and replace it no tools required
what if your phone dies or is not with
you we thought of that too by
incorporating our quick click technology
you can create your own access code to
use when your smart phone is unavailable

want to use your no key on your bike so
we created a custom cable and bike mount

life makes it a great investment for you
