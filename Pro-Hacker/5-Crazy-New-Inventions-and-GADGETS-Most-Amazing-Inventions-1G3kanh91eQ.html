world are now controlling paper planes
from their smartphones with power of
three I proudly came back to his friend

paper fold it into a plane and attach
the module put your phone in the
cardboard viewer and you're ready to fly

app on your very own smartphone sitting
in the head mounted goggles to control
your plane just tilt your headlights and
there's also a gamepad mode or when you
feel like handheld control powerup FTB's
camera can swivel around that's how you
also get winged view and back view so
you can see this defining moment in your
life look it's you flying a powerup fpv

experience really smooth power up FTD
