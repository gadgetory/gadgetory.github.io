you
no one likes to see their child struggle
imagine if your child's juggled with the
most common way of learning if letters
on a page looked foreign if it took them
three times longer to finish a simple
homework assignment imagine if your
child had dyslexia what would you do
well the 45 million people across
America struggle with dyslexia every day
that's why we've created the reading
style pen a patent-pending
electronic reading pen they'll instantly
convert text to audio with a simple path
of a hand by reading text aloud the
reading style pin will help your son or
daughter learn to overcome obstacles on
their own boosting their self-confidence
and making them more independent
the reason style pen was built with the
classroom in mind because it stores no
information it can be used on tests with
no risk of cheating this means never
again will your child experience the
pain and embarrassment of being pulled
from the classroom at home your child
will be more efficient knocking their
homework out in a fraction of the time
leaving them free to be a kid we serve
this project three years ago with the
mission to support the education and
empowerment of people through technology
getting to this point has taken a lot of
hard work patience and personal growth
we're finally in a position to bring
this product into the world with the
support of the University of Kansas our
family and our friends we have made a
great deal of progress our prototype is
complete our manufacturer is ready to go
now we need your help
to make your reading style pen a reality
our goal is $40,000 which will cover the
equipment tooling and inventory
necessary for a first production run by
backing at one of our three table
dyslexic peers you will be one of the
first to get your hands on the reading
style pen for those who don't have
dyslexia and still want to show support
we have custom design apparel so you too
can help spread awareness of this common
condition click the button that says
back it right now to support our project
and be sure to share it on all your
social media the more support we receive
the faster we'll be able to ship your
reward
we are all curious
each child peeking through a gap in the
fence every scientist hunting for an
answer and all the lovers staring it
with the sky while dreaming while
searching we have always turned to the
night sky filled with the wonder of a
billion stars infinite space around us
all of us look up but how many of us can
capture it finding it
bring it home and share it now you can
capture space in the palm of your hand
that's why we make tiny ones it was
smaller smartest and most social
astronomy camera is a tiny one you can
capture the nice guy never before you no
longer have to worry about expensive
equipment my advanced photography
knowledge II just point and shoot
we developed proprietary noise reduction
technology that allows you to
effectively improve image quality over
various environmental conditions without
sacrificing on image fidelity this
couple with a powerful sensor fit in
this little compact contractor that
means that the tiny one is better in
life and fits perfectly in the cockpit
reprogrammed and augmented reality star
map to help you locate planets and
constellations easily the tiny one is
also compatible with all the lenses out
there and even telescopes
to be mentioned it takes selfies - it
connects seamlessly to your smartphone
and allows direct sharing to your
favorite social media so the tiny one is
not just about the night sky it's about
you like Neil deGrasse Tyson said when I
look up at the night sky I know that we
are part of the universe we are in this
universe but more importantly the
universe is within
one you not only be able to see the
infinite expanse of the universe I could
be able to capture it in a way you
rarely get a chance to we've been
working on a tiny one for the past two
years you may access that RV
easy and accessible to all now we need
your help to bring anyone into
production and into the hands of every
curious Explorer we live in a world
where the greatest contributions of
humanity have also caused this terrible
problem pollution when it comes to air
pollution it's easy to downplay its
impact on our lives the scary thing is
whether you see it or not it's there not
just in developing countries but in all
of our homes neighborhoods and cities an
MIT study salma air pollution
contributes to 10% of deaths in America
and it isn't just an outdoor problem in
fact indoors where we spend 80 percent
of our time can be up to five times
worse than outdoors
do you experience headaches fatigue or
high blood pressure
studies show these may be symptoms of
poor air quality either from air
pollution or a lack of ventilation and
the impact on children can be huge
from weakened immune systems and
difficulty concentrating to the early
development of asthma that's why we came
together to develop the world's smartest
air quality monitor to provide you all
of the air quality information you need
optimize health and well-being
every day we take 20,000 breaths of air
and yet we don't even know what we are
bringing into our body so we sat down
with some of the brightest people from
various field such as laser technology
cloud computing Big Data artificial
intelligence to create the world matters
air quality monitor that gives you both
the indoor and outdoor air quality
information that you need to protect
yourself and your loved ones we use a
high precision laser to analyze every
single air pollution particle in the air
in order to provide you with an air
quality visual that's matching the very
strict US EPA standards we then connect
this to our existing platform that
processes 100 million data points a day
the result is an incredibly powerful
tool that delivers historical real-time
and forecast air quality information the
information provided by the monitor
allows you to take the proper actions to
get clean and fresh air use the device
to find sources and pollution here
indoor air pollution
the historical data graph will tell you
is the air purifying method you put into
place is working the monitor uses both
particulate and co2 sensors to help you
achieve the perfect balance between
cures and recycled air plan ahead with
the monitors three days air quality
forecasts but not only is the air visual
monitors perfect for monitoring indoor
environment it's great for monitoring
outdoor environments as well when you
identify your monitor as a public out
storage station you become a
contributing member the air visual
global air conditioning network this
information can be downloaded and
manipulated by community members to
track air pollution sources trends and
movements we have a solution to the air
pollution problem the key is in
developing a self-learning
network currently we report 8000
stations worldwide but it's not enough
your contribution grows the network and
provide the information needed to effect
change after year of development a
prototype is ready for production now we
need you to become part of the solution
whether you use your device outdoors or
indoors your support makes the world a
better and healthier place here is the
lava - camp and this is what happens
when you don't use it
lady what is doing what did I do
your youness pectin to mean hoping
anybody see that my be upon me on dia
let me go did anybody get that no one
was recorded I saw you are on the phone
oh how I cannot fast I saw it with my
own eyes
okay well when I say
Oh
what do you mean witnesses know there
there was no whip it's my my car is all
pressed up and ice
I expect my insurance to cover what do
you mean you can't help me is this the
life people really leave to go that car
accident happens every three minutes
every day which is why we built a Volvo
- Larry what is through it you just
backed up into me the Baba - is smart
with a built-in G sensor that
automatically detects when collisions
happen so you'll always have the footage
you need no I wasn't on the phone can
you prove it
whether your cars on or off so blah blah
- is there to protect when paired with a
Volvo charger the gas can automatically
record any unexpected activity when you
are away from the car how do you feel
leaving a car alone what if you could
see what's going on in your car while
you're not fixed the Baba - knows what
happened and now so will you videos can
be captured on a Baba - mobile app and
upload it to Facebook or sent via email
that's amazing
hi my name is why I am on the designer
behind a Volvo - we want to go beyond
the boxiness of traditional dash cams
and design a video camera that is easily
installed has great theater quality and
has features that we thought were
missing we thought that it was important
to show the 360 capability of the camera
and which is why it's in a circular form
our culture driven design process
delivers experiences that are simple to
use beautiful to the eye and meaningful
to the user on a daily basis we spent
the past year taking this from an idea
to building our first prototypes now we
need your help to bring it to life if
you care about a safer and better
driving experience back our project on
Kickstarter now thank you for your
support and together we can make safer
and better driving experience for
everyone thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
