start
Rango was probably the coolest cat on
the face of the planet he used to ride
up to work with me on my motorcycle
he used to go to a cafe to get out
there's a pretty cool relationship and
eventually I came across a note stuck to
a tree saying that they had found this
really beautiful tabby cat dead on the
side of the road I decided if nobody
else had found a way of tracking cats
and dogs then I was certainly going to
so this is pod life it's the smallest
lightest GPS tracker in market has an
interchangeable battery it's waterproof
it has bluetooth but the most important
thing is that this device can be
attached to your animals collar and sync
to your phone allowing you to always
know where your animal is you never have
to worry about losing your pet again
we've spent a lot of time getting the
product is on absolutely bang-on the
ergonomic design is really cool with no
sharp edges so it's as comfortable as
possible for the animal the app is a
really sleek user experience that's both
fun and functional for you and we've
squeezed as much as we can out of the
battery life getting up to a week's
usage I don't know you be inconsolable
if you love your dog not knowing where
they are or what they're doing or
they're alive or well it's that type
that tends to tear just wandered off and
then we rely on other people to bring in
back but we're always worried that
there'll be a time when we lose them
forever they're one of the most amazing
features that we've developed is a pet
League which is like a social network
for your animal this is going to allow
you to compare your animals results
across the world so you'll be able to
determine whether you've got the fastest
dog in the park or the most adventurous
cat in the country the app also allows
you to set safe zone alerts so you can
actually see when your animal breaches
the set perimeter through an alert on
your phone you know he just he
disappeared he goes on adventures it's
cool like that just to be able to see
what he's done
how far each dog ran and then we can
compare them to see which one Maggie's
past so we're really excited because we
have confirmed orders from some of the
largest pet retailers in the world we've
finalized the design and we're just
about to go into the final stages of
production we really need some help in
production and that's why we'd like you
to support us in this campaign and make
sure that nobody ever has to go through
the pain of losing their animal again
like I did
tell you
it
Oh
to me
Oh
Oh
so
Oh</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
