uncomfortable it's always too hot or too
cold it's too warm when the sun is
shining it's freezing when I wake up air
conditioners only allow you to set a
temperature but many other factors
affect your comfort humidity weather
sunlight and even your daily metabolic
cycle
Emme climate solves these problems by
revolutionising the usage paradigm of
air conditioners just tell us if your
hots
cold or comfortable in our award-winning
AI solution will automatically adjust
your air condition to improve your
comfort and help you save energy
you've been there and so have we
this is dream on dream on is a natural
drug-free way to calm your mind fall
asleep and stay asleep first you simply
put it on and get into bed next dream on
emits a soothing ultra-low frequency
pulse focusing on this pulse cues
relaxation clearing your mind and easing
you into a more relaxed state then as
your brain frequency continues to lower
you'll gently fall into a deep natural
sleep a full night's rest is
invigorating it'll give you the natural
energy boost and clear-headedness you
need for the rest of the day dream on is
safe and non-invasive so there are no
side effects like drowsiness or brain
fog well it sounds like magic our
technology is based on decades of
research on the neuroscience and brain
rhythms and sleep we've tested it on
real people and results speak for
themselves
one amazing thing just happened which is
that I had the opportunity to take a nap
in the morning while my baby slept it
took me two cycles but I just woke up
from a crazy nap like a two-hour daytime
nap it does help go to sleep it just
helps you focus on something else beside
your thoughts I didn't even really have
to focus on the sensation it just kind
of was I think something my mind focused
on I would honestly say I fell asleep
much faster than usual like makes me
feel safe it makes me feel secure and it
just relaxes my whole body if I wake up
in the middle of the night I just reach
for it right away and I've been falling
back asleep pretty quickly I would love
to buy this for other people in my life
that I know have the same issue as me
that just can't fall asleep at night
dream on is small and discreet not only
does that make it comfortable to wear in
the bedroom but you could take it
anywhere
it can track your sleep data and
generate personalized insights to
improve your sleep it can also work as a
powerful meditation aid our guided
meditations can specifically help with
night wakings common insomnia and other
aspects of sleep the science behind it
is simple and Trainmen is when our
internal frequencies copy or in train
themselves to the pattern of an external
signal so if the goal is to induce sleep
all we need is a low frequency signal
for your brain to lock onto and copy
I've watched family members suffer from
sleep issues firsthand and I've seen how
dream on can help them we're very close
and we just need your support to help us
get through full production please back
and share this project thank you
there are two verbs that describe what a
plane does there's flying and there's
flying meet powerup darts a paper
airplane that's not just flying it's
flying
this is shy a pilot industrial designer
and inventor shy loves everything
airborne four years ago he was
challenged by a friend to create a
smartphone controlled paper airplane
which I accepted the challenge and
created powerup 3 the first ever
smartphone controlled paper airplane
then 2 years ago that same friend
challenged him to put a camera on the
plane so shy created powerup fpv the
first-ever smartphone controlled paper
airplane with a streaming camera shy
friend looked at those creations and
said cool but you can't make a paper
plane that can do a loop and a barrel
roll and then stall turn then just I
stopped his friend before he
hyperventilated and said challenge
accepted
now after a year of prototyping and
testing it's here powerup Dart
the first ever smartphone control paper
airplane that can do aerobatics
yes other planes can fly but they can't
loop or barrel roll or fly vertically
dart can it is incredible and it is
small just take a piece of paper fold it
into a plane that's the module download
the app and tell your friends Jeep Wars
got nothing on you you're an aerobatic
pilot now powerup dark gets its
incredible aerobatic capability from the
high thrust-to-weight ratio and unique
shape of the plane despite being so
incredible flying the dart is easy and
intuitive move the phone to any
direction and the wings will follow when
you start the plane goes to 70% of its
throttle so you can fly it like a
regular player but press the boost
button and you give the plane that extra
kick that transforms it into a flying
monster a small flying monster power-ups
Bluetooth module easily charges routes
microUSB port and the entire thing is
made of carbon fiber an island so it's
nearly indestructible
dart invite you to make many planes in
many shapes because every plane brings
with it new tricks and with them new
gasps for air try 5 10 50 planes then
fly them all together make a real show
arrange dogfights break every barrier
previously set by less incredible planes
and this little bugger is so cool it can
even fly around the office yeah you just
sent a love note through a smart phone
control paper airplane you have lived
powerup dart is ready for production so
if you want to fly aerobatics with the
most incredible all incredible planes
back power up dart and start flying
