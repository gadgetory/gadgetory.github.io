the Rockford first of its kind hybrid
smart launch that preserves the styling
class of an analogue timepiece by
placing the fitness tracker discreetly
in the strap under the wrist no one will
even know you're wearing fake expected
as an Aerosmith engineer I was intrigued
by SmartWatch design but I wanted to
watch that not only have fitness
tracking capabilities but was also
stylish and adaptable to my everyday
life so I took my experience and with an
incredible team of engineers and
designers spent a year creating a truly
remarkable device from the hand all the

designed the wraparound silicone strap
that removes the watch face altogether
