we love our smartphones we take them
everywhere we go they help us plan our
day keep in touch with friends and
family and for most of us they even
support our work day but all these fun
functions come at a cost
battery don't you just hate it when your
phone runs out of battery
our current solution includes carrying
around our power bank plugs cables and
everything else we need to ensure we
don't run out of juice imagine if there
was a smarter way to save your precious
phone battery from running out all the
time something lightweight and easy to
use
say hello to cube it's the world's first
revolutionary power bank that combines
three features in the one compact device
power bank memory card reader sync and
quick charging cable you don't even need
your USB flash drive anymore cube turns
into a memory storage device and it's
compatible with any laptop via the USB
port there's no need to carry around any
other accessories ever cables are often
messy but not Hugh simply wrap it into
this tuck away slot and you're good to
go
how really does the cube work well it's
a simple concept just plug your cube
into your phone and into the power
source it detects when your smart phone
is fully charged and redirects the
charge to its internal battery unlike
your power bank that must be charged
separately cube automatically charges
itself while charging your phone so you
always know that cube is there for you
and will never let you down hi my name
is question as every busy person I was
often on the road and almost every day
my form was running out of the battery
in the opportunity instead of messy
wires and power bank I wanted to have
only one small device that can replace
the number of
home accessories I have to carry
everything when we started to think
about the cube we look at the existing
technology on the map and we quickly
noticed that most of the available
devices were not complete and not
user-friendly together with fear our
head designer we developed the cube we
went through several prototypes to find
the best design community a designer
this elegant compact and practical it
was so challenging with all those
functionalities together into a small
and cool design this is significant
battery capacity it was something that
had never been done but we made it and
we're so proud and excited to bring it
to you cube is the world's first compact
and lightweight device that combines the
functions of a power bank a memory
storage and a sinking quick charging
cable you'll also agree it's one of the
coolest looking power banks around
simply put it's an amazing piece of
technology that we can no longer live
without let's bring it to the world so
get yours now and be one of the first
cube over
you
every day millions struggle moving heavy
or bulky items up and down stairs or
over rough terrain whether you are
moving into a dorm room getting
groceries up to your apartment or just
striving the state independent our
mission and up cart has always been to
help improve mobility we are proudly
launching this Kickstarter campaign to
introduce the world's most compact stair
climber
the up cart city one of the things we've
learned over the years and value greatly
is the feedback they receive from our
customers although we've had a great
response on our up cut line of products
customers were asking for a smaller
lighter less expensive version of the up
cart for lighter duty daily use the up
cart stays true to its older siblings
and that it's a multi-purpose folding
cart with wheels designed for both
versatility and convenience it can go
just about anywhere with all your gear
but folds completely flat in seconds for
easy storage with up cart you don't need
to strain your back going up and down
stairs or worry about leaving marks on
your floors while designing up cart city
we took into consideration its many
practical uses up cart city simplifies
daily tasks by reducing the effort of
carrying items on stairs over curbs and
irregular terrain patented technology
allows the up cart city to fold
completely flat for easy storage it
weighs less than eight pounds and the
14-inch platform is strong enough to
carry up to 77 pounds plus the wheels
are a hundred percent behind the frame
allowing for better balancing of your
cargo for wide objects
wider than the platform to be placed
safely on the up cart city
the initial Kickstarter campaign wasn't
funded for a number of reasons mostly
because we were a young startup and
didn't really know what we were doing
fortunately it did generate enough
interest and helped us land an angel
investor but we are still a small family
company striving to meet the needs of
her customers who have repeatedly asked
for a smaller lighter more compact and
less expensive cart so we developed up
cart city to meet that need we sincerely
believe in our mission to improve
mobility for our customers and we see
the up cart city is an important step

start shipping this fall and help save
people's backs one stair at a time make

imagine how we interact with the world
but today we just mostly poke at the
screen fingers and hands are incredible
why are we so limited introducing vela
an innovative device that instantly
turns any surface into a smart interface
the world at your fingertips once
connected you will be able to control
different hardware devices or software
applications by using simple gestures
vela will make your life more convenient
use it to control music light
temperature or any other application you
have in your mind you are only limited
by your imagination
and you only need one valid device to
control multiple devices or applications
you can use our presets like letter
Surat your own gestures according to
your preference simply assign gestures
through different scenarios and switch
between them just by moving your hands
our human hand is fantastic they can not
only feel but also manipulate things in
a versatile way the current smartphone
technologies are just putting everything
into small tiny screen which highly
limits and constraint the interactive
areas of our hands Vela works on any
surface so you can clip it anywhere you
like or even design your own control pad
unlike other devices Vela gives you
tracking and multiple text to action
features so you are not limited to just
one action but if different patterns to
assign for different actions it is super
easy to use and really works for
everyone
if you are a developer you can try new
ideas and figure out different
customized applications with our
well-designed API to track the human
gestures Vela uses a special sonar
technology that is nowadays widely used
in military cars and drones it transmits
signal pulses collects the reflective
energy from your finger and then
translates it into the performed action
our team has been focused on sensing
techniques for couple of years
we are passionate about making tours
which are just human needs by amplifying
human capabilities turning any surface
around you into a remote control enables
many potential possibilities in our
daily lives we have been seeing lots of
products in the market but we have not
found any of them capable to track and
to recognize with high probability with
Wella attracts your finger with the
finest precision and transform it into
customized
action Weller brings magic to your daily
life
you
