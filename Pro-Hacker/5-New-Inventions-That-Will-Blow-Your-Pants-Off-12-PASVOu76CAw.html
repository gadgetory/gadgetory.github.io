wirelessly also called RFID is
everywhere nowadays
it offers contactless data transmission
with rfid enabled credit and debit cards
passport driving license store cards and
more providing amazing convenience and
time-saving for both consumers and
businesses alike but there is also a big
problem with RFID technology your data
can be stolen contact lists - right from
your wallet so how is this possible
fraudsters and thieves can easily
acquire equipment that can access the
data stored on your cards from up to
several meters away so they can clone
your credit card take money from your
bank or use your identity for a host of
criminal activities and it's getting
worse in 2014 alone 31 million US
consumers had their credit cards hacked
over three times the number affected in
2013 so there has not been an RFID
security system that can truly keep your
card data safe until now hi my name is
tamas and i would like to present you
the most advanced data protection for
your contactless credit cards and rfid
enabled documents vault card combining
cutting-edge technology with massive R&amp;amp;D
and developed on the same principles as
military jamming systems vault card is
the most advanced rfid protection
solution ever designed it virtually
ensures absolute safety of your cards
other products have tried to protect
your cards by covering them in metal
foil unfortunately it doesn't work with
high-powered scanning devices and so how
does this work
adjust over one millimeter thick you
simply place a single world card in the
middle of your wallet like so now all
your RFID enabled cards are protected
within one and a half inches on either
side your wallet can be up to three
inches thick which as you can see is
more than adequate vault card switches
on automatically when it senses the
electromagnetic signal emitted by
hackers RFID scanner the stronger the
signal from the thick scanner the
stronger jamming pod card will generate
so your RFID enabled cards will remain
protected even against the most powerful
scanning devices and RFID skimming
systems when you use your cards as usual
just make sure to hold them at least
eight inches away from vult card
what's more volt cart harnesses energy
extremely efficiently and doesn't
require a battery for its operation well
it doesn't mean that wall cart actually
lasts and protects forever that's right
join our community so everyone can enjoy
a future of unmatched
advisee security with a wool card in
your wallet
when you see a problem my brain just
immediately starts thinking about how I
could put these things together these
these materials are these processes
together to really solve that problem
there's a personal satisfaction I get in
being able to take technology and do
something very meaningful and important
and valuable with it my name is Stefan
Marsh I'm the inventor of the ear ring
technology and the president of the
company my name's Tom Cotton's I'm
living south rural Massachusetts with my
wife I'm a farmer
it's what I like to do I found I had
sleep apnea through a test
sleep apnea is an inability to maintain
normal ventilation during sleep
oftentimes there's very dramatic snoring
gasping and choking in the night why
it's important to treat sleep apnea is
the longer-term consequences and that's
where the associations with heart
disease metabolic disease higher risk of
stroke coronary disease heart attack
when you stop breathing and there's no
oxygen going to your brain that's going
to do some damage over time the most
common treatment is delivery of airway
pressure through a mask it wasn't
working for me
it was extremely cumbersome I didn't
want to take the mask off I wanted to
rip the mask off it's a minority of
patients we were able to tolerate the
treatment at home so I've got to find
some way to deal with this and keep a
smile on my face man starts out usually
doing things in a way that's brute force
but sometimes you can figure out a way
to do it that's a little bit more
elegant a little bit easier simpler but
that usually requires an invention
this is amazing I think that if this
works this will be the answer for 99%
they'll never go back to using that Star
Wars piece on their head again when I
see this I say how can that possibly get
the air in me when I first talked to
people about this and I say well you
know we have these little micro pumps
and and it turns out that they're very
powerful they can they can pump the
right amount of air at the right amount
of pressure their first response is no
way get out of here and you know I go
well yes I think we can because our
micro pumps our micro blowers are very
very small it's based on two membranes
that are electrostatically attracted or
repelled from each other opposite
charges attract and that's the bellows
closing and blowing the air out and like
charges repel
that's the bellows opening and sucking
air in and if hundreds and hundreds of
these little fellows are plus or minus
plus and minus going together you get a
large amount of air to flow through
zinc-air batteries is a battery
technology that has a lot of stored
energy in it it's very dense which means
it can be very small and have the right
amount of energy the nose buds they're
easy to insert really it's one hand grab
it stick it in you knows you've done the
molded silicone rubber is extremely
pliable everybody that we test it with
has found it very comfortable really for
the first time in this disease we have a
treatment that patients will be willing
to use long term consequences of sleep
apnea
reduced it's comfortable it's well
tolerated patients can sleep in a
variety of positions just a perfect
treatment it's almost like you can't
wait to try I I don't know
it's important to get this technology to
get this device to get the airing into
people's hands as quickly as possible
the fastest way that I know how to do
that is to raise sufficient amount of
money so we can manufacture it produce
it and get it out there so we're here to
ask you to give us a hand if you can
take this simple technology and treat
this sleeping disorder in this condition
it just that's what technology is for
you've got to go do something that's
important and I can't think of anything
more important for these blowers to do
then that save somebody's life hi I'm

air jack
step into the wireless future Jerry oh
oh this is crazy
that's so cool oh wow oh wow that's in
lar you know I told you I used to be the
military and stuff and I got a lot of
hearing loss from my job and so this is
like a new level of here and I'm super
hero right now a couple my friends have
like some hearing issues but nothing
like this this is this is kind of this
is nice so plus the VA usually pretty
good about covering stuff but if their
hearing isn't covered it's really
expensive for them to have to you know
buy one of these things I'm sure this is
expensive one in five Americans are
disabled what comes to mind when you
hear the word disability why is hearing
impairment so accepted then we don't fix
the source of the problem a decent
hearing aid today cost around two
thousand dollars or more people don't
wear hearing aids as a fashion statement
like they do glasses only Union was
founded to combat the two impairments
price and social perception and
eliminate hearing impairment how the
first barrier price here is how much a
decent hearing aid cost today
$4,400 and here's the breakdown cutting
down significantly on the materials and
research expenses we don't use expensive
machines for testing and diagnostics we
kept our margins as low as possible and
after cutting out as many costs as we
could we were still at $500 the second
barrier is social perception we've
approached hearing aids from a totally
different design perspective
if not as a medical device but as an
accessory we've designed the Oliv
benchmarking the ladies earbuds and
Bluetooth earpieces over the past year
we develop the next generation hearing
aid using a smart sound algorithm and
Bluetooth technology we will also
revolutionize the hearing test and
feeding process to make it quick easy
and accessible with a few taps on the
only app you can set up a customized
hearing profile with sound frequencies
optimized for your ears you don't need a
funky looking medical device or
amplifier to hear better
you just need on olive but in order for
this to be truly accessible $500 is
still too high
our goal is to bring the olive to you at
$100 flap this isn't just a crowdfunding
campaign is crowd R&amp;amp;D campaign in order
to reduce R&amp;amp;D costs I need all of you to
help us paratis the only and providers
with a proper feedback so that we can
create the best hearing experience for
everyone let's hear the word together
