revisionist forever
and since then it hasn't stopped her
acceptance this April we're returning to
Kickstarter to drive it another step
forward
imagine total control over your iPhone's
camera like never before with no less
than five external buttons just like a
real DSLR imagine a more comfortable and
safer grip particulars one-handed even
with gloves imagine connecting it to
real camera accessories unleash the
power of your iPhone's camera for better
pictures time after time pic daughter
DSLR your iPhone so let's take a closer
look at some of Pixar's more exciting
features the first and most important is
letting the iPhones camera live up to
its full potential
Victor offers no less than five external
buttons for controlling the iPhones
camera the multi-state electronic
shutter button it calibrated from
maximum sensitivity just like high-end
cameras a half press on the shutter
button locks the focus and exposure to
loud smacking of a moving object or to
compose the perfect shot pressing all
the way will result in an immediate shot
want to take control to the next level
just press on the center of the screen
and live the circle anywhere you want to
measure lighting at the front of the
grip is the zoom ring turn it to zoom
into the subject or out pressing this
ring will let you toggle between the
front and back camera for the coolest
selfies ever and what's most cool about
picked R is that it lets you take
pictures with one hand leaving your
other hand for other important things
now let's move up to the exposure
compensation wheel which gives complete
control over the exposure simply by
turning it right or left
increments are by f-stop values just
like in any DSLR this button can truly
open up a whole new world of playing
with light the last button is the smart
wheel same as all other controls it's
also fully programmable with the Pixar
app that comes with a device
you decide which parameters you want to
control in default mode the smart wheel
controls the photo modes such as sport
portrait snow and more but this can
easily be changed to manual mode and
many other options picked our app is the
turbo engine driving be fair forward
develop it we teamed up with a great app
company which gave it maximum ease of
use the app is operated by a patented
ultrasonic frequency system which offers
low power consumption of both picked our
and the iPhone compared the standard
Bluetooth connection picked our design
is inspired by classic DSLR cameras when
you hold it you'll feel right at home
thanks to the ergonomic body coated with
non-slip material Viktor is designed for
a steady one-handed grip without
compromising on the contact feel of
taking pictures with a smartphone and it
even works with gloves Viktor comes with
a comfy wristbands to keep it secure and
also have hadded case to keep it safe in
your bag a standard quarter-inch
connector on the bottom or to connect
any tripod for extra creative shots and
a cold shoe connector on top is useful
for any flash device or microphone
guitar is compatible with iPhone models
from 4 to 6 s and is designed to suit
future models too when it's time to
upgrade it also makes sharing a single
picked R to be super easy and fun
oh yeah and there's US team Mego and
this is our third time we're on
Kickstarter after we brought to market
thanks to you more than ten products
that makes typography a lot more fun and
simple to develop big car we put
together a winning team that includes
product designers app developers and
techies who worked together for a year
to make this dream come true
dear backers returning to you again and
asking viewers of force to bring picked
R to market join us pics on DSLR your
iPhone chronic pain stress diet hot
flashes night sweats insomnia the list
that keeps us awake seems endless
whatever the reason most people look
over their alarm clock each morning and
wish for more sleep temperature is a key
element in sleep in fact it's
temperature change that triggers sleep
cycles on Todd Youngblood co-founder of
cryo our smart cooling sleep solution is
designed to help you sleep better by
sleeping cooler the recommended sleep
temperature this is cool as sixty
degrees Fahrenheit this isn't a question
of comfort this is how we can
dramatically improve sleep by sculpting
sleep cycles athletes no use a fan
recover they use an ice bath or cryo
chamber this is why we've designed the
cryo smart sleep system with a thermo
regulator that actively cools water then
circulates it in a thin single sized
mattress pad the quiet control unit is
small enough to fit under the bed out of
sight our cryo system allows you to set
the temperature to the schedule you
choose hour by hour and day by day
controlled by a proprietary smartphone
app either manually or automatically the
temperature is adjusted to help you fall
asleep faster and lengthen deep sleep
the warm awake setting maximizes your
life sleep cycle by gently warm you
awake at just the right time
by connecting your cryo smart sleep
system to your Wi-Fi network we can
access the information on your favorite
sleep trackers our fitness pant sleep
improvement is shown on our app by
compiling sleep tracking data into chart
progress and optimize sleep efficiency
your core body temperature is at its
lowest during sleep but if you can't
maintain that cooler body temperature
you'll wake up before you can truly
recover cryo offers a significant drop
in temperature that hacked into the
sleep cycle maintaining a cooler core
body temperature throughout the night
testing by professional Olympic and
other elite athletes has demonstrated
phenomenal and groundbreaking results
several professional athletes have
mentioned they now sleep through the
night for the first time in their adult
lives through that testing we're able to
show lower heart rates better recover
times and deeper sleep cycles resulting
in an increased sleep efficiency by as
much as 20% it's like an extra hour of
sleep each night for free cryo combines
three elements track control and change
track using your favorite sleep tracker
or fitness band control using the
smartphone app and change change the
temperature to sleep cooler and enjoy
recuperative deep sleep sleep is
essential at krile
we make great sleep easy automatic
but we need your help to spread the word
share how great sleep is now possible
