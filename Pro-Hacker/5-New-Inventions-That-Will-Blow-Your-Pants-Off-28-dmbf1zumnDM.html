I have been interested in wearable
technology for a long time now and in
2000 after I just bought every smart
girl there is and the smart glass effort
has been so unfocused overpriced
impractical and over complicated I
wanted to create something that is
simple useful and affordable the works
with the technology you already have
I'm Goro Kusaka CEO and founder of youth
wine and this this is beautiful with
view fine we want to do something
different
we know smart glasses have some
fundamental issues from privacy to basic
functionality and really it seemed to us
that people already had the function
eyes they're looking for with their
current technology people don't need
another smartphone on their face we
carry so much technology with us every
day and it's only getting more powerful
why not place that utility somewhere
where you really want it if you find is
a high-definition clip on display that
can connect to anything with an HDMI
output your smartphone tablet laptop
GoPro drone and much more we've gone to
great lengths keep you fine as simple as
possible it has one button and two ports
it has no internal operating system
requiring proprietary applications it
can attach to a wide variety of user
glasses using an incredibly stable
magnetic docking station thought I was
refined to be both easily adjustable and
easy to put on and take off and those
are only consumer applications you find
utility in the workplace is equally
diverse with potential across countless
fields and because view fine is so
streamlined the possibilities for its
use are virtually endless with view
flying product value is user generated
because instead of dictating use it
facilitates it what do you find users
can easily interface with crucial
information while stained handspring use
it as a viewfinder for your GoPro to
make sure you're capturing exactly what
want to capture using those convenient
at-a-glance GPS or a way to watch videos
privately on a crowded train youth you
fine as a rear-view camera for your
motorcycle or bicycle or simply to
display fitness goals best of all
because of its incredible simplicity you
find is affordable and will retail for
around 149 whether for consumer or
business applications you find is a
low-cost low-risk opportunity to
experience a wearable display but to
take a bit further to help get it out of
the office into the real log we need
your help and relieved that the wearable
technology that is simple useful and
affordable is the future and we need
your help to get there thanks for your
support
my name is Shawn O'Hara and I am a
business traveler and like millions of
people out there I can't move on
Travel villas are simply too big to fit
mine small carry-on and to be honest
they look kind of ridiculous like having
a life preserver right right
so we set out to design nothing better
introducing the Bora the travel pillow
reinvent
if 80 percent smaller than traditional
gelatin so easily systems and altering
it works by using an ergonomic design
that lost your head into place keeping
it straighter is to fear your comfort
and rest that is designed to fit both
men and women he remembers how to hold
each chain excitation
and with four colors to choose from
there's a style for everyone
with the Boulder travel pillow you can
finally get the rest
do you have the same problem I do you
arrange the furniture in your home just
the way you like it but you can't move
the light switches so now you need to
call an electrician hey Kevin hey man
what's up
I need that light switch changed hold
that wand up I want to light switch
right here so I won't fall off the bed
anymore and I can turn on the light with
right now whoa how did you do that I
also have a toddler and I would like a
switch lower so he can reach it and I
can turn on the switch like this you
used to think I need to tear out pieces
of the wall and run additional wires but
now this is no longer necessary
you just need to open the package no
settings replace the existing light
switch with this base which then you can
put the gecko switch wherever you want
and it's done you can place an icon lets
you know what the geckos switch controls
here there are many icons to select from
the LED behind the icon lets you know
when the light is on or off make the
bedroom light gradually brighten to wake
you up or make it to turn off with a
time delay 3 2 1
if you can't find the Gecko switch use
the search function and it will beep oh
here it is hmm yeah do it now
switch it up with a gecko switch and
make your home in life exactly the way
you like it
hey no need for a hammer Kevin you just
need a gecko switch
meet the nomadic travel bagg the most
functional travel bag ever don't think
so keep watching
our company was born and raised on
Kickstarter first with the basics wallet
then the basics notebook thanks to our
incredible factors and supporters now
over 100,000 people are enjoying our
products of worldwide as our company has
evolved we have changed our name to
nomadic and we are excited to introduce
our most innovative product yet the
nomadic travel bag I want to share a
journey with you but with 20-plus
noteworthy features and more than a year
of development and relentless
prototyping I'm going to have to talk to
that here it goes
first we study the market current travel
bags were good but not great so we said
let's create the most functional travel
bag ever
we met with local industrial designers
and then traveled halfway around the
world to talk with material and bag
manufacturing experts after testing
hundreds of materials reviewing tons of
hardware and learning to drive a
three-wheeled car yep that's me the
first prototype was made and we said
it's not good enough yet many long days
late nights and 20-plus prototypes later
we have finally created the most
functional travel bag ever the nomadic
travel bags let's dive in and see what
makes this bag so functional the bag is
made of strong waterproof tarpaulin
material that will last forever and at
21 by 14 by 9 inches this bag meets
international carry-on standards
easily switch between backpack and
duffel bag and never have dangling
straps again we added a separate
compartment to keep your shoes separated
and rejected a similar pocket can be
found on the top of the bag designed to
easily store socks underwear a light
jacket and other items you like to keep
organized or accessible we designed the
bag with a full perimeter zipper to give
you the widest opening possible
for optimal packing and easy access to
the interior of the back once the top
and bottom pockets are packed there is
still plenty of room inside the bag for
all your clothing and toiletries by
adding a laptop and tablet pocket you
can now choose if you want to leave your
briefcase or laptop bag behind to fit
everything in one bag the right side of
the bag also has a full perimeter zipper
with multiple features societies
first an RFID safe pocket designed to be
durable and lined with RFID blocking
material to protect your credit cards
passports and other scannable
information second there is a
combination of mesh fleece line and
zipper pockets to keep your cords
Powerbank earphones and other
miscellaneous items untangled and right
where you want them back to the top of
the back our easy access pocket on the
top of the bag is also lined with the
soft fleece to protect your everyday
valuable phone glasses etc we've also
added a water bottle pocket lined with
waterproof materials to keep your other
items safe in case it's still moving to
the left side of the bag we added two
top entry pockets perfect size for a
book and other small items
in case you need to pack extra the
vacuum bag allows you to save room and
bring even more last but not least to
keep your dirty clothes organized while
traveling we have included a laundry bag
this bag easily expands and hangs on a
doorknob so that you have somewhere to
put your dirty clothes and when your
trip is over and your laundry bag is
full just zip it up and put it back in
your bag to wash when you get home we
have also developed some travel
accessories that fit perfectly inside
and match the bag for the ideal travel
kit however in order to make the
ordering process easier on kickstarter

sweat and tears put into this bag we
