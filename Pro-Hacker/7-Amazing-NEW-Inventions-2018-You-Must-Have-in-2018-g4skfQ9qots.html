tackle any surface wood floors carpet
grass Riley can conquer it all well
almost
and with swappable belts of different
colors he's always in style - uh-oh

recharge but that doesn't mean he's off
duty even from the docking station he
can monitor your home overnight
well time to power down tomorrow's
another busy day
good night Riley
my name is Arturo I was born with an eye
problem one of the greatest fears that I
hear about during my support groups with
blind people is that they're not gonna
be able to do the normal things like get
on Facebook do texting and get messages
and make phone calls there are 285
million visually impaired people
worldwide while we enjoying all the
technological advance that we have right
now for the communications blind people
get even more Calif for 20 years there
was almost no innovation existing
Braille devices are pokey and expensive
two years ago we set out to change this
with dot the first small watch for
division of your people dot is an active
Braille device
it is connected to the smartphone via
bluetooth and can receive any text
information from any app or service
for input there's a crown in two buttons
it comes with full watch functionality
that is made from super light durable
aluminium and the battery lasts for
seven days but most importantly it's
affordable at just 290 dollars I have
this Braille SmartWatch which is a huge
light changing technology for me it
behaves as a navigation notification and
a remote system if you get a call it
vibrates then you can check who is
calling to you you can get on Google
Maps and find the nearest Starbucks boom
there it is literally at your fingertips
young children who are blind and
visually impaired can learn at an
earlier age how to read Braille dot is
an open system anyone can write programs
for all kinds of apps are already in
development
I can read in the dark can you with go
touch you can turn the TV or projector
you already have into an interactive
whiteboard so you can share your
brilliant ideas learn a new language and
use your computer like never before work
more quickly as a group whether you're
all in the same room or thousands of
miles away connected by the internet and
of course you can keep and share what
you create setup is easy download the
app in pair go touch with your
smartphone or Windows PC connected to
your TV or projector and start creating
our team has been working on cutouts for
more than a year that's already working
properly and Octus and schools across
Korea but we want to bring photos to the
rest of the world to do that we need
your help to scale of our production
beyond what you can make in our small
office please support us on Kickstarter
and you can make any TV or projector
interactive
the keyboard layout that we use everyday
was designed over 100 years ago without
comfort in mind but now people type far
more than ever before coders writers
everyone we all deserve a keyboard
designed for the demands of today meet
expose the mechanical aergon ama
keyboard for more comfortable typing
experience expose cross linear design
angles the key columns inward allowing
for your wrists to sit at their natural
angle this allows you to type for longer
without feeling discomfort by moving the
modifier keys into the middle of the
keyboard we reduce the workload on the
pinkie now a weakest finger and transfer
it to our underutilized thumb mechanical
keyboard switches add to the experience
by providing a more satisfying typing
experience at last a keyboard that
combines comfort and productivity all a
sleek package
no this is a device it's called the
stinger if you're ever in an accident
your seatbelt you can't take it off for
whatever reason come undone if you not
cut it quickly he goes right across
that's pretty much around right your
cars off the road you're in water your
car is sinking or whatnot or you need to
bust a window it's hard to break car
glass yeah unless you have one of these
super easy and BAM Wow that quickly this
is what I love about this device you've
got USB ports waiting there for you to
charge your foot back so this will
always stay within your reach and in the
