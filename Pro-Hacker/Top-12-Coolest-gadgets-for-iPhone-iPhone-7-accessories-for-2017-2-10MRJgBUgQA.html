you
these Devils into George's class right
so you're not only stabilizing with that
set of charges in LA with your opponent
never have to go on the charge charging
life
okay so all of us own a few phone
accessories right and some of them can
actually use some really impressive
thing right now if I asked you to get
one you probably say carnival with me so
most of the time you end up leaning your
phone against some random object instead
of actually using that expensive tripod
that you left at home so because there
weren't any real solutions we made our
own and back in 2013 we launched our
first Kickstarter campaign for the
pocket tripod a fully adjustable stand
for your iPhone and holter device in
both portrait and landscape now covering
the screen best part is that it
transforms and precise a couple of
credit cards and hides away in any
wallet or purse until we meet again
people plus we raised more than our
funding goal by almost double and even
Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak who was
that why didn't someone do this before
what a great idea that I wish I thought
I put one of them in my backpack which
is always with but then a few of our
very clever backers realized something
that we missed told us I've got a case
on my phone I'm not going to take it off
every time that's just too much work and
someone else said so what you guys some
kind of Apple fanboys you know some
people Rock Angela Wright backed out us
think it can't make a pocket tripod for
every phone case model out there there's
at least a million different
combinations who know so as soon as we
shift all reward to our two and a half
thousand backers we started working on a
universal pocket tripod instead of
limiting it to only bear Eiffel
for months we studied cases of got
feedback from our backers and tested
idea and once we had a universal opening
shape we made it in a range of sizes so
that it fit as many case and phone
combinations this is the new universal
pocket tripod does it work with the
Apple silicone case perfectly how about
the Galaxy Note yep works fantastic and
landscape and Apple and portrait doesn't
work with every case almost lessons
gigantic we've also created this guide
that lets you know exactly what pocket
tripod you need just by knowing what
case and device combination you have
okay but what if I like it fair but also
sometimes with protection
do I need to pocket tripod nope because
whenever you swap your case or your
phone you can also get the adapters to
match their needs I'm good to go
the pocket tripods been used and tested
for the past 10 years like thousands of
people know why they use it as the
primary tripod every day to take amazing
time lapses for making video calls
and even to create light danger we've
made the pocket tripod with the highest
standards of engineering materials and
manufacturing they say the best camera
is the one that's with you and the same
is true when it comes to tripod the
pocket tripod is now a proven clock and
with your help
we want to make it one of the most
practical smartphone accessories for as
many people as you can we hope you join
us thank you

I need just 20 seconds of your time this
is the eye pockit dress what does it do
I'll tell ya so usually people use cable
or the internet or the cloud to transfer
their files I don't trust the cloud with
my personal information so I use the eye
pockit Drive and this is why I can plug
this directly into my iPhone iPad and
computer and transfer the files from
that device to whatever device I want to
the streaming for this is immediate
I can watch video files they play right
off of that I pocket drive and it works
completely from there okay so I may have
lied about that 20 seconds but hey
you're interested now so let's continue
using the eye socket drive you can
stream all your music right off the
drive you can even export your own
contacts onto the drive and have them
accessible on any device you use all
right now that's pretty amazing but the
coolest thing about the eye pockit drive
is it's completely portable you can take
this anywhere you go planes trains buses
and even the middle of the desert the
eye pockit drive small useful and
portable hi I'm Jean with the power
company since January I've run two
successful campaigns on IndieGoGo and
now I'm releasing my third one for the
eye pockit drive I developed this with a
partner company over in China currently
the only way to move files from an iPad
or an iPhone to a PC or a Mac is through
the cloud or the internet I don't
believe in the security of the cloud
that's why we created this product you
can transfer files directly onto this as
a hard drive and even backup files from
your PC and Mac and keep them on you
that way they're safe and secure it's
two reasons we're running this campaign
one for inventory and to prefer the
development of the app apparently the
app is done but there are many more
functions that we can add
to the device
you
hi guys I'm Lorenzo hi I'm Carlo
everyday smartphones are becoming
smarter but the battery life remains
critical we'd like to use our phones
without the fear of running out of
battery of course there are solutions
such as fire cases and extra batteries
but they are not portable enough or you
forget we designed a product so compact
that will follow you everywhere a cable
the size of an inch we call it in charge
it's a very simple product yes so useful
that we believe everybody should own one
that's why one of our main goals was to
keep it affordable
a tiny product at the tiny price
we spent an average 70% of our day next
to USB port and every time it's a chance
to top out for batteries there are over
five billion USB ports around the world
in charge will fit into your pocket and
you wanted to fight with tangle cords
ever again
thanks to its remarkably complex design
you can snap it onto your keyring and
there's no chance to forget it at all we
spent the last three months to design
the product and testing the prototypes
and now we are finally ready to start
the production in charger will be
available with both lightning connector
and micro USB so it's compatible with
most of the devices out there we are
really excited about this and we hope
you are too
now we need your help to bring in charge
into your pocket as a supporter you will
get your own in charge at a special
price so please consider backing our
project and share it with your friends
thanks for watching we really appreciate
your support thank you
you
you
stop
you
the cyclists sharing becomes simple
they'll let anything hold you back
I could always assume while creating I'd
laser - we've optimized the physical
design and made significant improvements
to the electronic component and now our
flash became more functional and easy to
use at the same time there are new photo
opportunities appearing with a new ID
laser - now it can be paired via
bluetooth it works with the native iOS
and Android photo application we've
added a sensory panel into a blazer -
you can now adjust the light temperature
with itself this will allow you to miss
your photos more professional and it's
become even more easy to use just double
tap and your picture is ready we made a
new mounting system for a blazer -
smartphones and tablets clip with the
silicon coating that will work with
devices from 0.23 engines to 0.37 inches
width and cold shoe for digital cameras
we have also enlarged I play through two
possibilities in our new application
with it sound you will be able to
synchronize several devices at one and
set individual adjustments for each of
them now your photos will be even more
beautiful and brighter I blazer field
can also be used in constant light mode
it
help me shoot videos in the dark and
catch lovely moment making them more
brilliant we believe that only together
we can make this product even better the
eye blazer team has already been working
on product enhancement for two years we
are a small team of young aspiring
people who build products solely by our
enthusiasm and love for photography now
we are looking for find to start I
blazer to mass production and need your
help
we have never raised investment and this
is actually what we are very proud of
that is why we've come back again to
Kickstarter join us and support the eyes

want to focus on what to wear but I also
have to carry around a lot of devices
that I don't want to think about but I
can't live without or when I am on an
important business trip abroad and I
want less luggage but I need my smart
gadget all these devices require many
chargers that take up half of my face
and don't forget a countless number of
adapters around the world yeah I always
get those confused and there are never
enough outlets in hotel rooms to charge
all my devices at once that never
happens anymore because we have charges
charges conforms to plug standards in
the USA UK Europe Australia and 150

force to make it the most convenient
universal travel adapter and you still
have the outlet ready to use in addition
we created the charges Bank it's a power
bank that charges my phone up to three
times and has a USB port for any other
device it's been a great journey so far
we've made attested our ideas and pack
them into an awesome compact design we
built the PCB and models the design then
we 3d printed and tested some more this
led to the final working prototype that
we sent out to ten people to test for
two weeks we got their feedback and now
we are ready to go into mass production
I love travel worlds I always find
difficulty to the outlet standards of
each new country and I visit yeah I
found charges and solved that problem
forever I mean it's so compact and handy

still charging station and we don't
argue anymore forget the old chargers no

things cool I mean it's so stable for
