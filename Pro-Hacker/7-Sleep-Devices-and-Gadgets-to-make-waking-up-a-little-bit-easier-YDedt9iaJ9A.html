you're losing it first you lose your
focus and then your good spirit but also
it will go to severe healthy Sue's at
the end but upside here is that we can
also affect positively your health by
improving your sleep so we started
making studies to find the solution for
it I am proud to introduce why don't
sleep
this device is one-of-a-kind there is no
other active noise-cancelling earplugs
but you could use for sleeping there are
the devices for the sleeping purposes
like a foam earplugs the problem with
that is that they can't really cut the
snoring sound there are some devices
which are creating more noise meaning of
this kind of masking noise that you can
hide the snoring but then you need to
listening the noise what that device
creates so we are making silence the
first product was already massive hit it
went all around the world and got a
really really positive feedback from
different segments especially for the
frequent travelers
but also the people who are working in
the noisy environments but still we
found some room for the improvements
especially for the sleeping
our new device is more it is soft it is
optimized for the snoring sounds it's
also have two modes there's hearing mode
and sleeping it the great feature of
this device even though we went really
small that they're still enough battery
life so there's 20 hours in a single
charge

thinking stop thinking stop crap I
thought or trying to relax
oh it's not that these techniques are
useless in fact they're actually pretty
good
unfortunately you probably had more
important things to learn at school
this here is history relaxing fast is
his thing just look he focuses on his
breathing and he progressively slows it
down and by slowing his breathing all
the way down to about six breaths a
minute
he stimulates the barrel flicks a
physiological mechanism that allows him
to become completely calm in just a few
minutes and when it comes to not
thinking he's pretty good at that too he
can concentrate on his breathing for a
really long time and remain undistracted
by buzzing thoughts but you are not his
room even in bed you struggle to focus
on your breath for more than twenty
seconds at a time
actually your attention span is probably
more like balls than his runs that's why
we've designed dota it helps you fall
asleep by making you almost as chill as
his room I'll have one of those
you synchronize your breathing with the
light projected on the ceiling by
focusing on something outside your own
head you'll pay less attention to the
thoughts that are keeping you awake at
the same time just like a metronome doto
helps slow down your breathing from
eleven to six breaths a minute which
helps relieve your anxiety and so in
