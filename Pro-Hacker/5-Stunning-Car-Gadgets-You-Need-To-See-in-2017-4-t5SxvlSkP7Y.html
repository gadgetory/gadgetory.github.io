never had an accident but I have come
really close

way or find our car well bluejay uses a
hybrid of bluetooth smart and gps so it
will always guide you back to your car

lost your phone no problem bluejay will
find in Bannon

even he knows it's too dangerous to
plagiarize oh when I'm driving my
smartphone can get me into some cereal
hudley is a heads-up display which
projects the information that I need to
an optical blast and my clear line
applies this allows me to quickly view
information without having to adjust my
focus even in bright light the display
is visible hudley will automatically
adjust the conditions for optimal view
public is compatible on iOS or Android
and works with all my ass I love using
Waze I'm sorry
navigate to work using my phone's
built-in hands-free functions I can
simply use all the applications I need
reply I'm going to be laid off my
favorite use of hudley is running apps
that are designed for our heads-up
display using the Navi or app I can see
it really looks like my directions are
floating on the road making it so much
easier for me to follow instruction
public connects and is powered by my
car's diagnostic port this gives me a
gold jet pilot style view which allows
me to view vital information like speed
fuel rpm temperatures be a safer driver
