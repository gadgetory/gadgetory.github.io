move
we want to be prepared for the
unexpected and that's not always easy so
we came up with a solution a way to
always be ready
we call it the cash bail by Wazzu and
it's designed to be the ultimate
adventure accessories it's a money belt
a travel tool a utility belt a survival
kit whatever you make it our mindset is
this and you're prepared for the
unexpected you can have the confidence
to step into the unknown and you open up
your life to any cat to choose so we
designed the belt with two goals or nine
one that's a fit with all aspects of our
lives we made a belt milk speck webbing
rated at 1500 pounds perfect fish cam
and adjustable buckle and we're making
it in America because we want to but
also and this is the best part we needed
something highly functional so the cash
belt was designed with a velcro
enclosure that's over 2 feet long for
carrying the essentials and it's fully
customized we've come up with a lot of
ways to use it but first you're probably
wondering we got our we wear wazoo
survival gear no for engineers
travelers designers all around
adventures we've been designing wearable
survival kits for over five years
like 4-h lots of dozens of different
tools and hats secret pockets our goals
that maximum functionality to everyday
items when you buy cash belt the Hang
tag doubles as a coaster and our
business cards are burnable double-edged
fire starters we consider the cash belt
the culmination of our experience in the
next step in our evolution starting with
the concept of EDC everyday carry
you probably don't leave the houses on
the belt and with the cash house you can
leave fully prepared without feeling
encumbered by extra items we've been
attested is based in our own life taking
it all around the world and it passed
the test so we're proud to offer you in
three different options first the
minimalist felt that you customize we
find it works great as an easy to access
money belt making this a perfect travel
accessory and great for when you need
access to mony and other items on the go
plus it looks good so it's a great
alternative to the goofy-looking money
belts currently on the market when we
travel we use it for a copy of our
passport and other travel Docs
- in multiple currencies there being
beef tea and memory cards the second
option is a cash belt onto the
essentials kit it's a TSA friendly
everyday carry kids that provide you
with strong foundations unexpected
situations while still living room for
you to customize it with your own items
the third option is a cash about stock
with the adventure kit we think the best
survival kit is the one you have with
you so we used all our experiences any
survival gear build our most extensive
kit yet it includes get ready for this
paracord gear loop a wire saw gift size
Kevlar cord ceramic knife and striker
flashlight a Ferro rod trail markers
first-aid tender whistle safety pins and
a fishing kit with fishing line that
doubles as sewing thread with a needle
Plus brass wire duct tape Ranger bands a
compass a signaling mirror bandages a
water pre-filter and water bag cost
purification tablets or you can just
boil the water in the bag for real plus
aluminum foil and it's all in the belt

end we don't know what we're going to
get into what's a mixes game so excited

hey Kickstarter last year we brought you
the indestructible Kevlar bill this year
our belt is not only indestructible but
has two more super features for
unparalleled comfort and tailor-made
sizes we call it the smart belt take a
look our patented Kevlar core makes the
whole belt indestructible coupled with
beautiful italian top grain leather this
belt will not tear stretch or fail you
in any way
it's five times stronger than anything
we have tested as well as light and more
flexible
a major switch for this year is the
elimination of the classic holes on the
belt our new racket and track system
works like a zip type it has micro steps
that really lets you adjust to the exact
fit you need in each moment of the day
and each activity you will be blown away
by how comfortable our belt is let's be
honest holes are not really practical
for adjustment when you want to loosen
your belt and you go one hole up it's
too loose go wonderful down and it's too
tight not comfortable at all going from
five holes one inch apart to 32 steps
1/5 of an inch apart is a huge leap it's
a whole new level and a completely
different feel our ambition is to make a
product that is the utmost quality and
beauty no detail has been overlooked
we have also done away with belt sizes
because they're not really precise
especially if you're in between no need
to worry about ordering the wrong size
or giving it as a present you'll get the
maximum size and you'll cut it and
attach it to the buckle for a perfect
do-it-yourself kill inside in two colors
in multiple budget finishes this bolt is
covered in top grain italian leather for
universal elegance we are kickstarter
veterans with an experienced production
and fulfillment team our campaigns all
start shipping on time and we'll have
our first belts out in no more than a
month shift with dragging we're proud to
have put together the most advanced belt
ever made our very own smart belt back
our project so we can make it a reality
thank you for being a part of the
Kickstarter community
hey there my name is Mike sternum use my
friends Devin O'Neal Kyle Johnston our
Kickstarter project is the mag belt and
magnetic belt that fits perfectly to
your waistline here's how the belt works
there's a floating magnet in a fixed
magnet you put the belt around your
waist
attach the floaty magnet to the fixed
magnet that's about it you slide the
floating magnet and adjust it to your
waistline so if you get super skinny or
chunky monkey still fits great the mad
bout eliminates the problem of belt
overhang frame if you have to trim or
the need to poke a new hole starting now
we're offering four different color
belts and buckles you could swap them
out to mix and match so 16 combinations
in total also if you want a more simple
look you can lose the buck oh and go
I'll nacho rally devon originally had
the idea for the society magnet system
and his grandma taught him how to sew on
our antique 19:51 finger sewing machine
a year and several prototypes later
devon created the mag belt since devon
can't hand so every belt himself we
partnered with us-based manufacturers it
really is the best belt I've ever worn
it's simple
holds and just works as we like to say
it goes from meetings to mountains
please back our Kickstarter in exchange
we'll send you a belt back a little more
we'll send you some more belts thank you
this campaign is going to introduce my
product to the world I'm a firefighter
and I'm a photographer I responded to a
building class and there were reports of
people trapped in the building at the
time I was wearing another photography
belt and I got quite something caught on
my belt and the idea had company
literally while I was on my hands and
knees just about pulling out of this and
well what if I had some sort of system
on my belt where the pouches to just
things easily and that's how I came up
with track bell 360
before I knew it I had confidence
electricians your contractor anyone who
wears a bell give it a spin and I
started realizing that all trade
professionals had similar common
problems I think you're on to something
I think you might be on to somethin you
got something in the back come on throw
it in the bag move around most of the
gear because there's no flexibility on
the belt
it's stuck where it is all right I'll
take this one this is my old belt this
is just really heavy and bulky and it
pulls down on all sides you can't adjust
it at all our system will work with any
one of those pouches you'll find on the
market this is a perfect example
there's wonderful if the Shelf I'm just
going to connect it on 12 system there
it goes 360 degrees the comfort violence
without is really key for us sometimes I
do have to be on my side and this digs
right into the side of you so that's why
I move it around the back and then when
you reach the top safely you could bring
the pouch around and work with it you
know safety is everything stuff so they
don't want to get caught on anything it
helps me because I be my belt to be
versatile like I am when I go from a
roof to a scalpel to a lot of I can't
have the belt in the same place at all
times because I'm in different positions
so I need myself in different positions
all right Mike thanks so much for
letting us come in great good luck there
yes so after years of really doing some
due diligence we've selected a
manufacturer because we have a strong
solid team and we have great networks
cross-burning is perfect for us and the
money that we're going to raise from
that is going to go towards tooling to
make the parts it's going to go towards
production comfortable lightweight
grants or anything you're building a
community of people that want to support
your product and it emits a lot of
calmness of bringing any kind of
products look to the industry I'm
excited to say yeah we're ready to go
