Oh
motorcyclists represent about 2% of
vehicles on the road so we created the
first connected brake light to keep
these millions of people as safe as
possible
it's called Cosmo connected it's a
detectable and autonomous smart hub an
accessory that combines a rear brake
light and a mobile application
our objective a lot of motorcycle
drivers to feel more pleasure and
freedom on the road by increasing the
level of safety we developed a product
range that brings many brand new safety
features to writing first Cosmo shines
bright red when writers decelerate where
the braking or not providing a visual
warning to other drivers next if there's
an accident the Cosmo app ensures that
rescue arrived at the scene in timely
manner it detects that the driver fell
and automatically alerts emergency
services and notifies the friends and
family it includes GPS coordinates so
they can be found even if they are low
at night or out in the middle of nowhere
with the app writers can choose who gets
notified at any time Cosmo is
responsible for protecting users and
reassuring the loved one we worked with
the best designers and engineers to
create an efficient easy-to-use reliable
product that works in all weather
conditions

security limit our logic unit
Cosmo is removable so that battery
charging is easy and it doesn't get in
the way of storing your helmet it uses a
magnetic base glued to the back of the
helmet and this ensures that the brake
light stays on the helmet in normal
driving conditions but falls off in case
of an accident
Cosmo has 8 hours of battery life in
standby mode and 3 hours of battery life
fully lit it's designed to fit the curve
of every helmet type
at our plant don't end with motorcycle
because mechanic is Wilson and value
implications of its technology on our
vehicles outdoor activities such as
bicycling all bike riding
snowboarding and overwhelming because
mechanics it is creating technology
suitable for all terms of mobility and
it builds user communities around the
theme of personal safety and patented
smart devices customer connected
promoting social interaction among
passionate users
ride with confidence and don't forget
had this ever happen to you you're
traveling with friends and birth
subscribers and everyone has a different
adventure plan for the day mean what's
the common mountain and take pictures
David and I don't want to find a river
and enjoy the Sun and you you just want
to play - Ryan - fine because you don't
go to birches garden without trying the
right height spots the problem is my
phone has no service approaches
Scotland's and I feel one and all my
friends are gone that's why in this
adventure we each brought a goat in a
mesh once paired with your phone go to
the mess generates its own radio signal
so you can send text and GPS locations
using a simple act no towers routers and
satellites requires sense and receive I
could send a direct message to David a
group chat to my friends or broadcast to
any Goten in the area go tena has great
point-to-point communication range but
with this groundbreaking mesh networking
technology it's possible to double or
triple your range for having two other
go 10ms units in the area you don't even
need to know the other users or do
anything it's automatic and private so
I'm able to receive a message for Ming
who's on top of the mountain because our
friends and other Goten dementia users
act as relay points between us imagine
using this at a music festival or on the
slopes the possibilities are endless
unlike traditional communication
networks goats Animesh actually get
stronger the more users join we call
this people-powered connectivity
