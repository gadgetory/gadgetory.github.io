basically the uniform of successful men
and you wear to work when you have a
important interview even at the own
wedding left press is using smart
textiles to make your life easier our
research shows that men basically prefer
to have three properties in a dresser no
stains no snow and as little irony as
possible we found a way to offer that in
a fabric that's also soft and breathable
we get a lot of questions about how it's
possible for sure to have such metric
properties and still be natural well it
implies working on every aspect of the
separate from becoming related to the
way the yarns are spun and then ruin our
cotton is also treated so that the
fibers are transformed that they're very
cold this allows the ship to block out
all sewers and bacteria to fold into the
fabric which is unlike other existing
technologies where it's only added to
the surface and can be washed off so
together with our designer we created a
great fit we did it in a minimalistic
design so it will never go out of style
left which is more about this making
life easier for busy men we also care
about changing irresponsible consumption
patterns true sustainability is when you
wear the same term for years instead of
buying new stuff all the time
the biggest hassle of wearing a shirt is
not buying it but keeping it fresh when
that communities like slower so you
don't sweat maybe even do laundry on the
Tuesday a leopard shirt can be worn for
many days in a row and you still don't
have to wonder if your date can smell

go all in on bringing this technology to
