it's Monday are you going to the office
yes
great this will take 24 minutes please
turn on the radio playing kiss FM
welcome Chris you digital co-driver
let's be honest my phone is constantly
on just like yours emailing texting
messaging navigation music Chris is a
smart mobile device that connects you
with your digital life while driving
Chris is listening Chris is talking and
Chris provides you a complete new
experience at the wheel
I'm harder from drama now tulips and we
have one clear mission making driving
smart and safe in every color you have a
new whatsapp message from Sarah Rocca
would you like to hear it yes please the
message is meet for lunch today do you
want to reply yes send cool hot fastball
that's all I got
cool half past 12:00 at civil house
should I send this message yes please
done we are living in a world of
constant connectivity information over
information we believe that proactive
artificial intelligence will allow us to
focusing on the things that really count
like driving there is a traffic jam
causing a 10-minute delay you can save
five minutes with an alternative route
okay please take the alternative route
okay please take the next left turn
driving requires our full attention
we believe that gesture and boys are the
best interfaces for as little
distraction as possible in the company
Chris I'm running late please call Peter
you have three contacts with the name
Peter which Peter would you like to call
Peter
Abraham Peter Maer Peter Wolf okay
calling Peter Wolf Chris is designed for
plug and play you just get in the car
and you plug and unplug it like this the
first time you install it it takes less
than three minutes and it's connected to
your smart phone and to your car audio
and you're good to go Chris works with
any car and with any modern smartphone
both iPhones and Android traces and
intelligence hands-free device designed
from the ground up to be operated safely
in the car through a combination of
voice hand gestures and display it is
very intuitive and easy to use and
reliably does what he wanted to do and
that is a big difference to all those
voice-only assistants out there who
often let you down because they simply
don't understand what you want to do
Chris comes with lifelong updates and
continues to get better
for many people their car is an
extension of their home it's a private
space in which they spend a lot of time
and sometimes other people come and
drive with them so we designed Chris to
be a beautiful object that integrates
well with the interior of your car it
has a timeless human design an iconic
round shape and a metal ring around the
display which gives it a very solid and
valuable finish Chris makes your drive
smarter and safer by keeping your hands
on the wheel and the eyes on the road
join the drive of your life Chris keeps
you connected
why are you enjoying the open road with
the UA hub we can bring Chris to life so
pledge now Chris please play the Spotify
top 50 Brian we need to talk about your
musical tastes
everybody's heard it driving while
looking down at your phone is not safe
so what if we put our phone on our
windshield that's not any better if you
can't see me than I obviously can't see
you we're here to provide a safer way to
access the calls text and navigation you
need without taking your eyes off the
road
since 2015 we had highly app and
developing products to help people drive
safer after launching our first head-up
display
we took customer feedback from the audio
enthusiasts to the everyday driver to
help develop our second-generation
product the hudley Wireless
our new head-up display is now wireless
and posts a larger sharper display just
like before you can customize your
driving experience by casting any app
directly in your line of sight and it
works at virtually any car public
Wireless decreases the likelihood of an
accent by letting you see both the road
and vital driving information at the
same time why not just mount your phone
to the windshield not only does this
block your view but it also forces your
eyes to refocus every time you look away
from the road and down at your phone for
directions hudley cast your directions
into the distance eliminating this need
to refocus and increasing your awareness
of what's happening on the road hudley
also adapts your environment
automatically adjusting brightness based
on the lighting conditions outside best
part setup is easy and there is no
technical knowledge required
what really sets Hundley apart from the
competition is our 6.2 inch
high-resolution display that uses a flat
panel to achieve a one-to-one reflection
unlike the curved displays on the market
while curved displays magnified images
they also degrade image quality our
product has been engineered to have the
widest viewing angle allowing both
driver and passenger to be able to see
the information casted we've made no
compromises to color clarity or image
quality and believe that we have the
best head-up display around what's
really exciting about hudley is that it
is a seamless experience just like
everything else in my household so from
Apple Play to Sonos to my nest hudley
fits right in
I really appreciate just the quality in
terms of clarity
especially with mounts like this like
you want something to be dead simple
super clear and giant text I hope that
makes the driving experience really safe
it's it's one of those things you know
if you're paying attention to the road I
think it's pretty easy to be a safe
driver but nowadays with like technology
and stuff I'm I'm constantly looking at
my phone and I think that's caused more
issues for me than anything else so
having what I need kind of right in
front of me without really obstructing
my view or causing me to look away from
the road has made a big difference while
there are many great apps for hudley we
weren't completely satisfied so we
designed our own app we designed it to
take full advantage of all these
Hardware advancements your phone now
acts as a secondary control panel with
quick access to programs optimized for a
head-up display
oddly Wireless is more than just a
head-up display it's a completely new
experience designed around smarter
driving we have a new immersive tab and
hardware created in partnership with a
leading hub display manufacturer with
over eight years of experience we're
back again to help raise funds to help
lower the cost of manufacturing hudley
help us bring an affordable device to
the market the economy of scale we can
get from a large p order is important to
make our project a reality like our last
campaign we're confident that we'll be
able to deliver on time
