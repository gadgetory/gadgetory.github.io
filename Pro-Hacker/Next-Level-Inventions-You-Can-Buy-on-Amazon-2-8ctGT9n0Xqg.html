York is now boarding at gate 3 please
hurry so you can find a place to stow
your carry-on luggage assuming you were
even able to carry it on and the airline
didn't make you check it because you
pack too much hopefully you all have a
blue smart the world's first smart
carry-on suitcase introducing blue smart
the first carry-on that connects to your
smartphone with revolutionary features
including a digital lock proximity
sensors location tracking trip tracking
information a built-in digital scale and
if that wasn't enough a built-in battery
that can charge your phone six times
over designed for today's sophisticated
traveler
and even guys like this
pull the handle and the app will tell
you the exact weight of your carry-on so
that you never have to check it because
you pack too much god knows what a
suitcase has to go through forget about
keys or combinations control the lock
from the app and if for any reason you
need to part ways with your blue smart
or not it will automatically lock itself
life's too short to fight for an outlet
blue smart will recharge your electronic
devices with our super powerful built-in
battery so relax boost smart will alert
you if you ever leave it behind or if it
finds a new friend and if it's ever lost
you'll be able to track its location you
will breeze through airport security
thanks to easy access to your electronic
devices with Blu smart anyone can travel
smart
even this guy wait a minute is this even
possible who invented this
developing new technology behind smart
was a really fun challenge we have to
create new devices combining sensors
electromechanical devices
I never seen connected to a
microcomputer we needed to come with the
software also to control form your phone
beyond the physical carry on we're super
excited about the features we're
building into that imagine blue smart
sync into your calendar and to travel
services that you use so that you know
when and what to pack imagine also being
able to track all your trips and see
trends about your travel habits all in
one place the suitcase becomes your
personal travel assistant and we think
that's pretty cool if you think about it
suitcases haven't seen much innovation
for several decades so we set out to
reimagine how a suitcase for this
century should be blue smart is the
quantum leap for today's travel we
created a product that is beautiful and
powerful and yet remarkably simple to
use
I am personally super excited about blue
smart because it's a product that I
would love to have myself I traveled in
the past and because of problems with my
language my trips got ruined and I know
that we put smart they're gonna be able
to travel with peace of mind so I'm
super excited on top of that my phone is
never gonna run out of battery anymore
and that's pretty cool thank you for
watching and thank you for a support
let's make this company
bigger and stronger than the original
gear tie the gear time mega twist ties
are ready to wrap tie and organize even
the largest and heaviest items with a
simple twist no knots required the 32
and 64 inch gear time Megas have nearly
doubled the diameter and more than
double the strength of the original gear
tie thanks to the heavier gauge wire
inside the tough rubber coating exterior
is molecularly bonded to the low carbon
steel core and won't mark or scratch
your gear as you lock down your load
this patented design ensures that the
rubber won't pull away from the wire
even under high tension and after
hundreds of uses the gear time mega
twist ties are waterproof and tough
enough to withstand all the elements and
when the job is done the gear time mega
is easily removed put thousands of uses
around the house out in the field in the
garage and at the worksite you'll want
to keep geared time mega twist ties at
the ready
