perfection but when we designed the
macbook charger we really royally
screwed that up I bet you thought that
was a real Apple commercial didn't you
no that was us
the way it should be though Apple's
known for creating high quality products
people loved the MacBook
however the MacBook charger has a whole
whopping one star on Apple comm and we
didn't make that up the reviews speak
for themselves over and over people are
having the same problems Bob s says the
Achilles heel of Apple well Bob s you'd
be right the whole point of a laptop is
to be taken wherever the heck you want
so why isn't the charger designed the
same way it's bulky clunky hard to store
and is damaged extremely easily and the
only solution is an $80 replacement at
the Apple Store introducing the
Sidewinder by fuse the Sidewinders
patent-pending design eliminates cable
fray ensuring your charger lasts as long
as your laptop its revolving shell
allows you to wind the cables in under
six seconds its adjustable length
control allows you to stay organized
whether you're six inches or 12 feet
from an outlet the Apple esque design
allows for sleek portability making the
Sidewinder the ultimate MacBook
accessory
a router a device that lies forgotten
somewhere in a tangle of cables on the
floor or in a cupboard working hard 24/7
we at c-- zednik are no newcomers to IT
we can make an awesome router like no
other and I mean it when I say awesome a
while ago we managed to raise 1.2
million u.s. dollars through IndieGoGo
and to deliver powerful secure open
source router called Taurus omnia more
than just a router after our journey
with omnia which you can buy in retail
now we realized not everyone needs its
full performance or functionality
yeah we could take omnia and chop it
down to its bare bones but you can't
please everyone that's why we said
enough you will be able to choose the
paths you actually want it is so easy
but do you like em or cheese hate mail
ok do it because wait a second because
our a must it's great to build your
sandwich the way you like it wouldn't it
be great to do the same thing with a
router absolutely that's why we
developed MUX
mock's is the first model smore outer
you can put together according to your
expectations
plus it's powered by a secure self
updating operating system from omnia
your perfect router can consist of these
modules basic extension Ethernet and SFP
the basic module is powered by a passive
cooled Marvell armada processor has a
micro SD card slot USB 3 and a gigabit
WAN port with the Wi-Fi card alone it
can serve as a pocket ready router or
you can connect it to your router for
example omnia as an access point if you
need faster wireless speed just connect
the extension module with a 5 gigahertz
Wi-Fi card connected to the M PCI
Express slot or you can switch the Wi-Fi
card with an SSD to make an ass or you
can insert a SIM card to the slot
connect an LTE modem and use this module
as a backup connectivity solution
you can also connect the ethernet module
with four gigabit ports
maybe you are lucky enough to have fiber
connectivity so you will find use for
the SFP module we are constantly
developing so you can look forward to
other modules that will be available in
the future I would like one more so with
ethernet and 5 gigahertz Wi-Fi please do
one bonus no thank you ok here we go
thank you very much hi welcome to
tourists what can I get for you hi I am
in hurry I'll have just one MUX please
okay they're out the primary goal of C's
ethnic is maintaining the Caesar domain
and programming open-source software we
are not able to compete with big
hardware brands and that's why we are
asking for your participation
together we can manufacture an
outstanding product we don't want
anything for free though thanks to
IndieGoGo you can order the exact
configuration you desire welcome to
Tori's what can I offer you one marks no
pickles
choose what you like sure s mocks
modular and open-source router always a
headache messing around with all sorts
of cables and floods as designers we
keep trying to find better solutions
that make things simpler tidier and
smarter introducing mousepad plus the
revolutionary new mousepad with wireless
charging just plug the mousepad plus and
put your phone on charge as easily as it
is it can release your phone lightning
or type-c connector to other devices
such as earphones while charging when
you are going out unplug and fold the
mousepad + and take it with you anywhere
you need for your mouse and mobile
devices the mousepad plus has a really
compact design with nice curves and
details mousepad plus is also designed
to charge for almost all the wireless
devices compatible with Qi standard we
selected special wool fiber from
Australia to stick with the felt base so
the pad has a very comfortable hand
feeling with 21 production procedures we
made the mousepad plus even more
delicate now we design three color
options for the mousepad plus later we
will launch more with your support we
hope to bring this exciting project to
life soon
you want to know why I'm walking with my
bike because of this you know the deal
your bike dies in the city flat tires
rusty chains stolen wheels stolen lights
stolen seats stolen bikes that's why we
can't invest in good bikes instead we
get cheap bikes we don't care about and
even then we're still afraid to leave
them outside overnight we've been riding
with fear and that ends now with a bike
that's invincible
single speed with caliper brakes for
eight speed with disc brakes both have
an aluminum frame which means they'll
never rust and are incredibly light and
they each come equipped with puncture
resistant tires a rust resistant chain
and an ergonomic water repellency and as
for safety retro reflective decals
ensure that car headlights make you
shine everything is locked down with
custom security books and it comes with
a best-in-class
fortified EULA but that wasn't enough a
fortified bike must be that true so
we've got a plan for that too
introducing fortified protector for the
first time ever your bike is guaranteed
against theft to do this we built a team
dedicated to protecting your button
tracking ownership monitoring secondary
markets and working with local police
but none of that matters to you because
if somehow a thief manages to steal your
bike or any of its components we ship
you a new one in 24 hours yeah we do
that but this is more than a theft proof
plan we're building a massive community
of cyclists and together we will
eliminate the market
because every new invincible in the city
means one less bike that needs consent
and when enough cyclists take a stand we
can all bike with confident confidence
that we will always be visible our
commute will be effortless and our bikes
will be protected but we can't do this
without we need your help
every bike counts make this pledge to us
and we'll make one to you
we're fortified and we always have your
back there are items that you shouldn't
lose while traveling items that are
annoying to pack but needing and items
that are precious man you want to keep
safe
