jeff lenosky I'm going to show you how
to install as Victoria airliner the
first step is sizing the air liner to
the tire wrap it around the rim mark the
intersection next using a sharp blade
cut the insert perpendicular at the mark
the next step is to join both ends using
the zip tie carefully trim off any sharp
ends from the end of the zip tie now
it's time to set one side of the tire
onto the rim once I have one side of the
bead on the tire it's time to put in the
air liner in order to make this air
liner go on the tire a little bit easier
I'm gonna wet it with some water and
that will act as lubrication the next
step is gonna be to place this thing
inside the tire just like I would seat a
regular tire I'm going to start at the
valve stem and work my way around in
order to get this last bit of the tire
on you're gonna want to use a tire lever
and be careful not to damage the rim
strip now the tire seated I want to
remove the valve core and inflate it
just like I would any other tubeless
tire make sure you hear all of your
beads snapping into place and then I'm
gonna let all the air out so I could add
my tire sealant you're going to want to
put your tire sealant in through the
valve stem once the sealing is inside
the tire I'm gonna put the valve stem
back on and then play it back to full
pressure once the sealant is inside the
tire and you're all inflated give the
wheel a spin and a couple of bounces to
swish around that sealant that is the
entire vit√≥ria air liner installation
process this was my first time ever
trying and it went super smoothly
hopefully you find this video useful and
now if you'll excuse me it's time to go
shred some trails
