almost half your tooth surfaces most of
it is between your teeth Zerelda floss
but who likes flossing anyone that's
what I thought and I don't blame you
it's awkward it's time-consuming and
here's the real kicker it's not even the
most effective way to clean between your
teeth according to a recent Associated
Press report there has to be a better
way until now water flossers have been
one of the only players in the game
their tedious messy and more often than
not end up stuffed under a cabinet
somewhere toothed shower is next level
water flossing and so much more it's a
complete oral hygiene experience from
the comfort of your shower
simply attach it to your shower wall and
hook it up to the water source tooth
shower uses water pressure so no
annoying plugs or batteries are needed
it's got three different attachments for
a triple threat approach to all care
first there's the dual headed toothbrush
which hits the front back and chewing
sides of your teeth for comprehensive
surface coverage then there's the
irrigating tip it reaches where the
toothbrush can't it's like a water
flosser only it's in the shower so it's
no mess no fuss because it's in the
shower you'll never run out of water and
you won't have to sacrifice any precious
counterspace and let's not forget about
the revolutionary gut massager ear
gating and stimulating blood flow and
your gums this is
huge part of Cub disease prevention and
in less than 10 seconds you can flush
out everything between all your teeth
while massaging your gums for the first
time ever you'll actually enjoy cleaning
with each attachment you can adjust the
water pressure and temperature to your
comfort level and use with your choice
of water mouthwash or tooth whitener
when you're ready to switch attachments
just remove the swab worried about
getting water everywhere well you're in
the shower so it doesn't matter and with
multiple attachments the whole family
can use to each other which means better
oral hygiene for everyone that means a
lot fewer expensive and painful dental
procedures and fewer instances of gum
disease you probably won't be surprised
to learn it was created by a dental
hygienist
lisa has been deep in the tooth world
for over 25 years and she realized there
wasn't a single easy convenient way for
her patients to effectively clean them
to you so she decided to design one
herself no power source no mess and
because it's in the shower to shower is
easy to integrate into your routine
becoming as second-nature as washing
your hair face lisa and her team have
been hard at work perfecting 2 showers
design and prototype

historically we've made speakers and
headphones and made a very big business
out of making products that delight
customers we're gonna now help people
live more fulfilling lives with audio
products that are focused on wellness
rather than just entertainment so there
are three pillars of general health and
wellness some nutrition exercise and
sleep and most people go through life
thinking they can cheat sleep but they
can burn the candle at both ends there
are significant health implications for
not sleeping enough and not sleeping
well things like cardiovascular disease
type 2 diabetes obesity cancer
Alzheimer's are all medically
statistically linked to poor and
insufficient sleep this product is
designed to protect people sleep from
unwanted disruptive noises if the
honking of taxicabs people talking loud
neighbors a dog barking in a hotel
environment that you're just not
accustomed to the snoring person right
next to your head I mean we've been
learning about years at Bose for a very
long time and we've been able to
leverage a lot of that knowledge become
buying boses noise-isolating stay here
plus tips with soothing sounds that are
optimally tuned for masking noises so
sound masking works on this basic
principle that if you have this
disturbing sound that's going on let's
say like a low rumble of a snore and you
play another sound that's close to it in
frequency so let's say a low like
thunderstorm that thunderstorm is
actually going to help to cover the
original snoring sound what makes it
special is our ability to do that in a
form factor that is tiny comfortable and
stable so many people sleep with the ear
pressing into a pillow so the stay here
plus tips are incredibly soft and you'll
see when you touch them and feel them
how comfortable they really are and how
you'll like having them in your ear Bose
has never made a product that's this
small before we sort of debated and
fought over every millimeter that we
could gain to make the products smaller
it's actually very easy to use so you
download
the Bose sleep app insert the sleep buds
into your ears select which noise
masking sound you prefer schedule a wake
up alarm and you're good to go the
charging case is actually very cool you
get two nights of sleep on a single
charge to the sleep buds themselves and
then the charge in case will provide one
additional full charge while you're on
the go we want to bring customers in
earlier than we have traditionally done
it both to help us validate the product
vision I think one of the elements that
I'm most interested in hearing feedback
on is just the idea of the product
becoming part of your nightly routine
for me I want to know everything with
this solution to this really massive
problem that matters tremendously to
people we're going to change millions of
people's lives it's that simple
technology has transformed our world
forever it's how we keep in touch with
friends and family I was sharing most
precious moments and how we explored the
world so we find answers and learn new
things invites us to wonder and ask
questions technology's allowed us to
overcome every obstacle in boundary
connecting people and ideas from around
the world uniting us and bringing us
closer together but what about our data
think about it
more information about our lives is
being collected than any other time in
history every day we rely on services
that have failed us time and time again
from getting hacked to the misuse and
selling of private information it seems
almost impossible to keep our data safe
but what if we didn't have to give it up
at all last year we came to you with an
idea with your support we were able to
build software and ship thousands of
devices that has improved online
security for individuals and businesses
worldwide but filter is just the
beginning
this is being
it's a router that encrypts all your
information at breathtaking speeds so
your internet provider can't see what
you're doing and services can't track
it'll protect all the devices in your
homes and threats online keeps your
physical location hidden so you can
access any part of the internet from
anywhere in the world it's the world's
most advanced router we created being
because we believe technology should
empower humanity not exploit our nature
to connect and learn their privacy
matters and it's worth protecting now
