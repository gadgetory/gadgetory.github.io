want to meet up later on yeah I can
treat your text all right
cycling for the city is an amazing
experience but there's one problem that
all cyclists share and that is
navigation we are very active cyclists
ourselves and we've often experienced
how using your phone while cycling is
both awkward and sometimes even
dangerous and having headphones in your
ears telling you where to go just makes
you lose some of the sense of freedom
that cycling normally gives that is how
the idea of Heisei was born we wanted to
create their simple affordable and easy
to use product that will help find your
way through the city paisa pours like a
magic compass but instead of pointing
north it points to your final
destination in that way you are free to
choose your own route through the city
just open the app set your location and
attach Heiser to your bike the leds of
the outer circle show you the direction
and the central LED indicates the
distance to your goal so now you can
find your own way through the city
without being in danger of getting lost
and who knows what amazing places and
experiences you can find by not choosing
the route most travel
Heisey is made out of machined aluminum
making it sturdy and waterproof and when
you're not using the device you can
simply hide the rubber band within the
device and put it in your pocket that
way you can always bring it with you be
it to find the new restaurant after work
or to discover when cycling abroad
if you have a day where you feel more
like sticking to the Main Roads highs of
course also offers turn-by-turn
navigation we haven't spent the last
year developing the simplest possible
product to find your way through the
city and now we're very happy to have a
working prototype and we need your help
to develop the first production run so
please support our campaign and make
sure you will be one of the first owners
of this magical compass that will change
the way you navigate the city forever
[Laughter]
you
this is a switch bike and so is this and
this and this one this one to switch is
an affordable state-of-the-art the
electric bike system that converts any
bike into an e bike and I mean any bike
with switch you can go faster and
further without breaking a sweat
turn the power up when you need it turn
it down when you don't or switch it back
into a regular bike simply put it's a
bike and an e bike within one my name is
Oliver I'm proud to be a British
engineer I studied at Oxford University
and I'm dedicated to inventing
low-carbon technologies that are good
for the planet the way we usually get
around is not environmentally friendly
or fun astonishingly most of the
journeys we make are less than 10 miles
a switch bike has a range of up to 50
miles so why not make some of those
journeys with one of these it's fast
convenient and way more fun than getting
on a bus here's how it works we send you
a brand new wheel with our lightweight
hub motor built in a pedal sensor break
sensors and the bracket that connects
everything together simply attach the
switch bag to go further and faster it
really couldn't be easier
please support us by placing an order
now and we'll start putting together
your custom switch package right away
thank you
you
if you're one of millions of cyclists
you know every time you saddle up
anything can happen you do your best to
ride safely but those around you that
can be another story but the number one
threat to every cyclist is the one you
never saw coming
because it's not on the road ahead it's
right behind you
and the threat is real according to a
recent study 40% of cycling fatalities
occur when riders are struck from behind
but with Varia rearview radar the
world's first cycling radar you know
traffic is back there 140 meters out and
you're told that sends them a wake-up
call to
the difference
very real team right up right on
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
