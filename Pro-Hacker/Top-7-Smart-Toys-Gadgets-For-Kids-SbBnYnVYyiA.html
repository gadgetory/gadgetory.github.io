stealth drone or urban assault vehicle

advanced tech unlike anything else the
AI knows we do offer there's nowhere to
hide nowhere to run your only option is
to fight back rather elevate your game
from while we eat sold separately one
breaks including introducing an fuh a
$59 robot anyone can adopt an PO is an
affordable educational and easy to
assemble robot it takes less than an
hour to assemble and we'll teach you
about robotics anta bow has six legs and
walks just like an ant plus it is also a
robot aunt plus robot equals ant both
designed for anyone with an inquisitive
mind ant Bo is a great starting point
for young inventors and for people
interested in steam education even if
you are not a maker it is still a cool
robot companion and you will have fun
with once assembled you can control ant
Bo by remote by your own voice or even
by drawing lines with more than one ant
Bo you can even make them fight each
other n po enhances problem-solving
abilities when you are familiar with how
it works
tweak its code and make it do different
things
you can also upgrade your robot with
dozens of different sensor modules and
program it via Arduino scratch or when
do ANFO is connected it collects user
data and uploads it to the cloud users
will be able to check metrics like
distance skill levels and
accomplishments and share with friends n
PO is intelligent it has 30 neurons that
enable it to learn to adapt just like a
real creature as time goes it becomes
smarter faster and more capable am po
also has emotional reactions to
different scenarios for example glancing
left and right when it feels inquisitive
trembling when it feels threatened and
showing affection and loyalty we are an
experienced team in the design and
manufacture of innovative robot products
and we believe aunt beau is a perfect
start help support our project and give
aunt Beau a home thank you get ready for
a virtual reality experience and enter a
new world with other VR real feel games
and enter the action in the game with VR
real field racing each sold separately
batteries not included are scattered sky
blue hi I'm Sarah and this is my little
one Ethan he's always curious about
everything and asked hundreds of
questions each day we want to encourage
his curiosity so we can explore and
learn more about the world so we invited
this cuddly little fuzzball into our
lives
meet Robo an incredibly smart robot
powered by the most advanced interactive
technology Ruvo is both playful and
goofy and pinks Ethan laughs all the
time a small team of graduates from MIT
and Harvard curates exciting things
about the world and shares them with Lu
Bo so Lou boys like a knowledgeable and
kid-friendly search engine who not only
answers questions it also inspires Ethan
to explore more lugo creates an
imaginary space to experience different
possibilities so Ethan can be anyone and
work on anything
no wonder Ethan asked me so much about
being a dragon trainer lately Lubo
always knows how to
then an independent and creative
afternoon so Ethan never runs out of fun
activities to choose from
sometimes Weibo helps take Ethan's fun
ideas one step further and brings his
imagination to life Bubo is always a
patient friend who helps even to make
and create new things
sometimes when Ethan's friends come over
will Bogut's playful and invites
everyone to get up and move around
whether it's a whole afternoon playing
charades or a completely new idea Lubow
always keeps up like a fluffy partner in
creativity
that's only the beginning of what whoa
Bo has under all that fur like a launch
pad for learning Weibo has more than 40
different skill sets and since we bow is
connected to the Internet
his skills are always fresh and always
growing I can also set up daily routine
reminders so in an encouraging way
whoo bo turns routines like brushing
teeth and cleaning up into engaging
challenges and as Ethan starts
practicing these routines on his own he
always had someone sharing him on with
Weibo every morning is a blast and every
bedtime is a breeze and the stars were
blinking hey rube oh all right good
night you two
you
I think it's cool I think it's really
cool I think it's um it's not like just
a single toy it's a whole bunch of toys
all kind of everyone the fact that they
were able to interact with Muzo on their
own and figure out the games and it does
make them feel like more independent
like this is something I can do on my
own and I can play with this toy the way
that I want to seems to have a quite a
good range of age-appropriate games so
like things that would entertain a six
year old and a three year old you can
ask a question about something you're
learning at school and then get a
response from whoa boat I think because
it interacts with them they could they
feel like it's like a friend of course I
mean I think they would fight over it
and we would have to get two of them
probably they would play with them a lot
and I wouldn't mind playing with it
there are so many options it's not just
like a video game anymore you know 20
minutes on the iPad and some exercises
ask a million questions
who's America's top robots and the maple
streaming video keeps us in on the
action goes on the approach and in
position did that just come from
people's mouths by would spot is on the
move um ok
 account enables on control it's
safe to say we have a clear winner
