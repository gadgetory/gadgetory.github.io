to leave for work like right now oh hey

I love old fashioned design on an
average today the smart homes have at
least seven to ten connected devices in
next three years there's a prediction
that it could go all the way up to fifty
connected devices what we have done with
Google's we have combined everything
into one so you get all those features
that you would have otherwise spent
thousands of dollars into one single
device and a much more affordable cost
rather than having 10 or 15 even 20
different devices in your home you can
now have a single device with an end to
end platform that connects you
continually to your home well for me
with who's a bunch of things exciting
and one of the things that I really have
a passion about is the audio system the
audio system is a new patented pending
digital spatial sound system that really
makes a 360 environmental sound coming
from the user device itself it
incorporates both facial recognition and
voice recognition so now whoohoo doesn't
just have a command or a trigger based
on your voice it asking those who you
are so when you say turn on the lights
or play my favorite soundtrack it knows
it's you that's requesting that now what
happens is if someone enters the room it
doesn't recognize it it does alert to
the smart home app we believe security
and safety should not be a privilege we
think it is your right and it should be
affordable yes or video conferencing
with whoohoo is really exciting because
of our 360-degree high definition camera
that actually in motion sensors we can
actually detect movement in the room and
keep an eye on anything from your
children to your pets even alert your
kids when they come home to make sure
they do the homework that they go out in
place then we started making whoohoo we
really knew it's going to be
groundbreaking it's really going to be
revolutionary the whole idea of Google
is to give a sense of excitement and
happy
of being there at home Albert Einstein
said that he had one hour to solve a
problem he would spend 55 minutes trying
to understand the nature of the problem
and five minutes trying to solve the
problem we knew that there is a better
way of making smart phone or efficient
who who is sadaqat for making your phone
smarter but woohoo the future smartness
the possible is are endless
from working out to making phone calls I
just enjoyed life's simple pleasures
