more than 40% of our lives are spent in
habit for most of us that time is wasted
the secret to transformation is not to
try harder it's to replace bad habits
with the habits of excellence if you
wanted to transform yourself how would
you start first identify the habits that
hold you back
paired them with a negative stimulus
like electric shock each surge of
voltage trains your brain and weakens
the neural connection until the bad
habit is severed next replace the bad
habit with a positive one reward
yourself when you complete your daily
goal commit to a penalty if you fail the
fear of loss stimulates your basal
ganglia while the chance of reward
motivates your prefrontal cortex in
fewer than 30 days the action becomes a
habit pavlok is the first system
designed to help you build good habits
and break bad ones earn rewards when you
succeed pay the price when you fail and
experience the electric shock that keeps
you on track

walking teacher sketch a lighter by not
only ten or twenty or twenty percent we
used to strong but like titanium we then
call it the skate with reimpose too fast
for extra protection Becca the sketch

the skid should be used to wear a nice
to take off the Vino extra happy with
any pair of shoes with any pair of shoes

hold your feet in place
we also made riding usual with the
innovation of a brake assist function
allowing a strong outer skate easily the
falling down another advantage is that
we added the braking system of post
