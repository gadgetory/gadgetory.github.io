our mission is always to create
something different something unique and
something for thinking the magic room is
a place where the children while they're
staying at wrong with the old house can
go into and have an experience and and
the concept was actually threefold it
would be an experiential room that they
would be able to go in and be wowed and
then also there would be some form of a
healing process that was helping them at
their health and then also a
connectivity back to their home or their
friends when you walk in and you see the
kids in the magic room and you see them
engaging with woody and the other
creatures and they're they're following
the story they're not sick for that
period of time and so whether their
siblings are there and their parents are
whether there are the other kids what's
really happening is that they're
engaging 100% in the activity of the
experience and that takes them out of
that sick environment and just makes
them have a natural time and that's
really key
it's magical in that way the idea of you
know of bringing those characters off of
this or a flat-screen in the wall I'm
reading it into this space giving them
ways and presence I think it's just
incredibly powerful and it was really a
variety of different people that
collectively created a concept and
Vincent and H+ was able to take all
those ideas and and create what we have
in our phase one every single elements
was create a house in two months from
scratch from the concept for the
character for the environment and which
is a customizable really depending on
the place means
the three potential technology is one of
them is interactive touch wall they can
play games on the wall actually have
some reaction the second one is magical
brush they'll have this electronic
gadget they'll be able to draw on the
wall in any particular direction they
can even you know for example collect
something on the wall and feed it to the
beaver so these are the things that are
possible with this kind of technology in
the third one that we really specialize
in is gesture recognition so beaver can
understand now how many people are
standing around the hologram hound and
how many people are running in what
direction
after face Walla fun a lot of kids is
chasing the content chasing the Unicorn
on the wall and they tapping the bubbles
that generated by the octopus and our
face - one big change we'll definitely
add a touch war sensor which allow user
to use their hand to interacting with
the content on the wall directly for
some kids and children that really
aren't motivated by a traditional
classroom experience is going to help
want them to want to learn and be more
engaged and more impacted and
potentially change their life forever
type of a magic Roma's magic is so much
fun I can just imagine kids absolutely
loving it
she really warmed up to it after a
little while ago right in that's a very
interesting concept and really really
cool thing on and the ease of working
with H+ and the team has really been a
treat

replace the existing light switch with
this base switch then you can put the
gecko switch wherever you want
and it's done you can place an icon lets
you know what the geckos switch controls

LED behind the icon lets you know when
