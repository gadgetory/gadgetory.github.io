in a time well the world is moving
faster and faster it is sometimes hard
to take a break and to let go we tend to
forget that it's often too small and
simple things that make us happy coming
home after a long stressful day we all
need to recharge our batteries what else
would be better to relax and to unwind
and bringing back the simplicity of your
childhood by watching the toys Overland
gravity also simply having fun with your
friends and loved ones is very precious
in these techniques time
we have created business involves the
fastest unemployed on this planet of
fascinating sitting toys we invented an
elegantly
then it's been balls are made from two
solid steel balls box welded together we
have used industry-leading
coating technology and materials for a
perfect spinning experience exposed to
light beams involved also create
fascinating light effects we have never
seen before
together with our smart screen maze and
it's integrated smart controlled LED
lights you can create your very own life
shows by using the spinners iOS and
Android back
we could spend hours exploring all the
different light effects and colors which
can be created by this wonderful toys we
have spent more than 10 months with
developing dining testing and
prototyping to bring this toy to
perception we have looked into every
detail and we've been working hard again
as our suppliers and sure only the best
materials and using the result is an
amazing and exceptional choice which
involves and everyone else who is
fascinated by the simplicity of light
speed or was the great back child helped
us to bring this toy to life support is
now and become a spinard
digit is the combination of digitally
spheres spheres were used to create the
outer mass to give the toys is to learn
one of the things that I fell in love
with after I held it for the first time
this the way the light plays across
those screaming spheres
it just makes almost like an infinite
amount of concentric and intersecting
circles and why a film it's magical
well it's design is I want it to be as
curvy as possible so when I set out to
design something that not only that I
wanted to be functional but I wanted it
to be beautiful
this is kind of hard to explain you can
see it on the screen you can see it in
the drawings I saw as I was describing
it and it didn't really become real to
me until I actually held it so when I
first created digit I didn't know what
it was going to be like to hold it and I
can't describe the very first time when
you rushing to put something together
and you finally spin it for the first
time it was really amazing like if we
hope that this is going to be a pretty
unique product full
