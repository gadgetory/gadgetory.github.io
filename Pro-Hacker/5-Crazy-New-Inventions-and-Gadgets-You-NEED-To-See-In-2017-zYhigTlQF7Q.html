various devices such as mobile phones
tablets and laptops but with that
there's a problem none have been able to
capture the magic of a cinema movies are
losing their magic but what if we could
have the comfort of watching films at
home but with an experience that would
exceed that of a movie theater
introducing sanera the world's first
fully immersive personal cinema a
headset that brings you an IMAX like
movie experience in the size of a book
while a normal cinema on average gives
you an angle of around 54 degrees the
scenario screen is considerably larger
and on par with a 70 degree angle of the
IMAX screen to guarantee the image
quality on its super wide screen sanera
uses groundbreaking dual 2.5 k displays
with a resolution three times that of a
cinema and eight times that of an iPhone
7 plus
driving such high resolution is beyond
the capabilities of any existing mobile
processors on the market
unlike existing products which split a
single screen into two and only use the
central part of the screen saneras dual
screen architecture utilizes up to 95
percent of the screen area which
achieves four times the sharpness and
fully alleviates the screen door effect
sanera is also super easy to use it
works like any Android smartphone you
can install your favorite streaming apps
like Netflix or HBO or play from a
microSD card it also works like a TV by
simply connecting the headset to a
blu-ray player gaming console or a
computer with a simple click sanera
upgrades your conventional entertainment
to an immersive and cinematic experience
because of comfortable experience using
sanera has always been one of our top
priorities we designed an ergonomic
hands-free arm to take the weight off
the headset the burden free arm can be
easily adjusted to any position and can
be attached to different surfaces it
allows for a new way of watching movies
burden free truly immersed in the movie
without discomfort besides video the
audio has been fine-tuned to recreate
the acoustics and sound effects of a
movie beer
the scenario 3d mode is easy to turn on
and provides more vivid and pride our 3d
images than those in theaters without
the need for 3d glasses it is a much
better way to watch 3d movie to see we
