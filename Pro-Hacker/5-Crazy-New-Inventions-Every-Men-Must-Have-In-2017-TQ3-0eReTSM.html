with you the riptides r1 an electric
skateboard that blends massive power and
a compact design let's check it out
the riptides has dual belt-driven motors
at 1,800 watts of power you can fly up
the line and get it to the top speed of
20 miles per hour in no time with all
that power riding up hills is no problem
the board is rated for 8 miles of range
and it actually gets it once you get
your destination just grab it and go
more than anything I designed the
riptides out of my love for surfing
skating and snowboarding
this board is built by riders for riders
which drove some very key decisions
first it had to have a kick tail so I
can tack it around or kick it up then it
had to be built to shred so it can
handle anything I throw at it
to ensure a smooth ride it has wide
trucks and some of the best long
boarding wheels on the market finally I
knew I'd want to bring it on all my
adventures so our battery pack is UN
approved and airline friendly I've
ridden almost every electric skateboard
on the market and I found the perfect
board for me doesn't exist so I designed
the riptides focusing on big-time power
and a small pad
I've riptide electric we build a board
that blends massive power and a small
package if you can handle it
you're gonna love the way it rides

sans old wartime the point shank an
apology Jogia mission solution Emma
yeah yeah we went to Xian it was a very
very beautiful city
I love exploring the world with my
little companion he watches me carefully
following my every command he's always
waiting for me to take him outside
he loves to travel with me he's always
curious to see what's around the next
corner and thanks to him my travels make
much more sense meets turtle my
four-wheeled friend
and me TAS we're a team of both
engineers and travelers for some time we
thought about a solution that could help
people just like us develop their
passion of creating and let them easily
share all the adventures with friends
and that's how the idea of turtle was
born turtle is the world's first earth
rover a remote control open-source
platform capable of working in harsh
terrain turtle is the ideal travel
companion helping you to rediscover this
beautiful planet in real-time allowing
you to reach new and unseen places with
a design inspired by NASA turtle easily
overcomes all terrain obstacles made of
strong aerospace grade materials turtle
drives slowly and steadily making it a
super stable and reliable mobile
platform driving turtle is just like
playing a video game but in real life
the only device you need to control the
rover is your smartphone or tablet if
something strikes your eye snap a
picture or record videos whenever you
like then share them with your friends
one Rover provides infinite
possibilities if you want to upgrade it
add more cameras or sensors no problem
thanks to turtles multiple waterproof
slots and open source software you can
add whatever you want to give you an
example we've included a robotic arm in

oh hello there I see you're admiring the
rocket steam locomotive designed and
built by myself
Robert Stephenson and my father George
Stephenson back in 1829
however marvelous as it is this is not
what I'm here to talk to you about I
would like to talk to you about my
latest invention that happens in the
future I'll see you there Robert
Stevenson now in the year 2017 yes
Robert Stinson is my real name the
Georgia Robert Stinson really my
ancestors I've got no idea it was just a
bit of fun anyway as promised
I said I'll show you my latest invention
so excuse the pun come with moon
like most of the mechanical sex machines
on the market the first thing you notice
is how incredibly small it is not only
that the Hoppus has a very unique
arcuate motion providing faster dance
stroke than an upward stroke making it
feel very realistic indeed ever right
George wouldn't have been allowed in my
day and this is where it all started in
my humble little workshop at the bottom
of my garden and after the initial proof
of concept
professional contractor certified to ISO
9001 or above were employed to further
the design and development with the
brief only the finest of components and
materials were to be used to ensure the
end product to be of the highest quality
excuse me a minute I can see smoke
coming from George's shit oh just let it
off a bit of steam
Hoppus is very compact making it very
easy to store away it's fully
rechargeable so there's no need for
batteries it's unisex straight or gay
pompous we'll play it's wearable making
it truly hands-free it has variable
speed from a gentle stroke to a full-on
thrust it mimics hand or wrist movements
for a natural realistic feeling well
mate top quality components and
materials used I'm Laura nice that's
what you're supposed to do just great
what do you think now then George
Roberts that's a patent you can put your
own name on I already have George
your support will allow us to order the
two lead and our first production run
and any additional funds will benefit
the growth and brand enabling us to
bring you even more exhilarating
attachments for the home purse now take
a look with the funding options
available there are some right sightings
to be happy em on he's just enjoying
himself
starting a business nowadays is easy
everyone has great ideas but sometimes
it takes a lot of repetitive work to
realize them this is where do bot m1
gets in do bot m1 is an industrial level
robotic arm production platform it's
precise fast and extendable and also
affordable it can be your 3d printer
laser engraver soldering machine or
whatever else you build upon it yes you
can build one do bottom one has 0.02
millimeters repeatability and 1.5
kilogram payload with these standardized

and control them via our app on PC or
smartphone with a force sensitive 3d
mouse you can control do bot m1 as
precisely as you want no more trying and
guessing on a confusing software with
its hand whole teaching feature you can
input coordinates in the fastest and
most intuitive way
do bottom one is programmable via the
integrated api's you can use official or
self built developing environment or use
this visualized programming interface
making things a lot easier but we don't
stop here do bot m1 is highly extendable

on it the maximum reach of do bottom one
is 400 millimeters which is enough for
most of the situations but why don't we
think bigger
when it can actually go further or use a
camera for visual with it's fast and
accurate image recognizing algorithm it
can distinguish colors without making
one mistake do bottom one loves
companions they can work seamlessly

has brought out the best of both
strength and speed repeatability of 0.02
millimeters
maximum payload of up to 1.5 kilograms
angular speed of up to 200 degrees per
second it's also a steady player never
slips up everyone loves creating things
and having a robotic arm is awesome with
do bottom one it's no longer a giant
business's privilege to use professional
