Oh
hi there are you in front of your webcam
right now most people use their webcam
for social innovative features such as
Skype and FaceTime but did you know that
people with much different intentions
may be using your webcam to more and
more reports warned us about such
occurrences bringing the importance of
covering the webcam to an all-time high
so you want to cover your webcam
why does they have to be ugly and
impractical we designed a sleek and
simple gadget that is media projects use
then enough to close your laptop without
removing it and complement the design of
your device
introducing the spy fly webcam cover a
beautiful gadget is better than a paper
clip and made of durable stainless steel
you can endlessly slide it open and
close whenever you please and it is
remarkably easy to install on your
laptop desktop and tablet our webcam
cover will make webcam spying impossible
so whether you're in a business meeting
discussing classified files or in the
comfort of your own home using the
patient's device
you can feel safe the spice live webcam
cover is the most elegant and practical
ways to cover your webcam thank you for
watching our video their retinas are
Christian and therefore we need your
support please spectrum IndieGoGo
provide you with the most elegant
flexible welcome life is about human
connection our strongest bonds are with
family but you can't always be there
with them and calling doesn't give you
that same feeling there are a lot of
things you enjoy doing together and you
can't do through a call so we made Omni
the robot that makes these things
possible even if you live miles away
I'm needs in like a phone call or
ordinary video chat they're there in the
robot you have the control to move and
look around and it's freed up the other
side from having to stop and answer a
call you can just join in no matter what
they're doing no more phone tag or
scheduling a call like a meeting our
testers are using Omni to do awesome
stuff like cook together hang out for
barbecue or even watch a whole movie
together it's the stuff they never do
with Skype or FaceTime because it's just
way too cumbersome and the coolest part
is that none of this was planned at a
time as soon as they got the bot these
experiences just happen naturally
we want to make a home robot that's not
just a toy but something's built to last
to be truly useful week after week our
design philosophy has two main parts and
the first is to maximize the human
connection so omni's made to be human
height to give you that most natural
view of the world people on the other
side can look straight at you talk to
you just like normal we really wanted to
enhance presence a feeling that some of
there with you so we design Omni with a
moving neck and a seamless control
interface we call motion map the neck
may seem subtle but we thought it really
makes the experience
engages a lot more human so the second
part of our design philosophy is to
minimize all hassle because nothing
should get in the way of the Omni
experience setup is simple unfold
connect to Wi-Fi and call in with just
one click and there's no software
installed
we also made Omni super quiet so you can
hang out for a long time without bugging
anyone and if you need to move it around
it's like you can take upstairs move it
out in the patio or pull it up into your
car you know if they're worried about
keeping it charged when you're finished
press one button to auto dock Omni is
different right down to its materials
and how we make it resource sustainable
bamboo and we use sudden anodized
aluminum another cool thing is we use
additive manufacturing to build omni in
a scalable and efficient way we're doing
it all in-house to keep it lean and that
means less risk
you've already been shipping Omni to
test uses around the world for over a
year
we're also backers like you tired of
campaigns over-promising and
under-delivering
so that's why we waited to launch our
campaign until now after two years and
nine generations with prototypes we're
super passionate about bringing families
closer with your support we can bring
the omni experience to everyone join our
campaign and enjoy Omni with your own
family
