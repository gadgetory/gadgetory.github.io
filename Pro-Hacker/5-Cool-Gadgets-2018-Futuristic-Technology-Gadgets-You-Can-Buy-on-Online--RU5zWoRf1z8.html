hi I'm David and I want to introduce you
to this book the word first known
electric our wife amplifier with soos
Pro you can easily double and even
triple your Wi-Fi range and also
maximize your Wi-Fi quality just by
mounting it on your router antenna sous
pro focuses the Wi-Fi frequency to 180
degrees instead of 360 degrees most
Wi-Fi routers nowadays have two or even
more antennas so in installing Zeus Pro
you still can get 360 degrees Wi-Fi
connection but now with three times the
range and that's not all
it could be your old neighbor surfing on
your Wi-Fi but it can be an unwanted
guest Wi-Fi is highly easily hackable by
turning Zeus Pro and aim it to your
private area you can secure your
wireless network from unwanted guests
Zeus Pro also increases your Wi-Fi
connection speed by reducing
interferences that block the Wi-Fi
signal and for the gamers between us it
reduces lags and disconnections
