powerful flying camera that you can take
anywhere it's so clever
it activates by recognizing you just
launch it from the palm of your hand
it even returns when you call it and
land like this easy can't get everyone
in the shot no problem
watch as it hovers precisely in place
always at your command control it with
your hands
remote controller mobile device or DJI
goggles using GPS spark knows where it
is even if you don't it will even sent
obstacles to avoid things in front of it
and come home safely
thank you guys movemove bar footage is
smooth it takes the shake out of your
shot so you look like a pro not feeling
the control stick perform preset flight
maneuvers with a single click and get
those epic shots here's a way to stand
out from the crowd spark automatically
add shallow depth-of-field to your
photos if you don't know how to fly just
tap like let's see if you can handle
sport
spark keeps you in the frame so all you
need to do is act naturally edit your
epic videos and share them instantly
spark your aerial creativity anywhere
all you need to do is seize the moment
you
you
you
in
you
it may sound crazy but you can do this
to all of it it's easy how do we know
because we've made it eat at DJI we
created the flying camera as you know it
and there's a good chance that the drone
videos you've seen online were shot with
one of our cameras this time we started
small so you can dream big we created
your first personal drone but we're
still squeezing in big powers it
automatically follows you or whatever
you want without a bracelet or tracker
avoid obstacles and comes packed with a
4k stabilized camera 27 minutes flight
time and a whole lot more this is the
DJI nomadic pro and this is the DJI
Mavic pro unfolded to make it this small
we have to rip out a ton of cool stuff
right now
it's got 24 high-performance computing
cores dual satellite connectivity and
all-new transmission system with a 4.3
mile range for vision sensors and more
sound complicated it's not it's easy
the Mavic knows where it takes off from
where it is in the air where it's going
and what is captured when you take off
the MAV accuses two vision sensors and
connects with up to 20 satellites also
it can remember your location
this means the Mavic knows where home is
so it can return by itself precision
landing technology means it can land
almost exactly where you took off at the
touch of a button as you fly satellite
systems keep track of you working in
harmony with all four vision sensors
telling it what's below and what's in
front
whether you are flying beside a cliff in
a forest or even indoors
just like you Maddox teas and things
that means it can avoid the things in
its past from tree to wall any good
flying camera deep stabilization the
Maddox expertly miniaturized gimble it's
the entire camera steady
unlike electronic stabilization we use
every pixel from a sensory and you don't
have the weight of a Bolton add-on
camera shooting an epic tracking shot of
a friend is easy active track technology
means it just takes a few taps not just
one kind of tracking shot either
it's got spotlight profile and trait or
you tap lock
adapt and fly
Terrain follow mode keeps the Mavic at a
height you define as the ground right so
you can focus on your shot not your
height everything can be controlled
using a gamepad size controller you can
keep in your pocket it opens up to clamp
around your phone and has been custom
engineered to give you more feedback and
more accuracy you will always feel in
control if you don't want to bother with
the controller fly using virtual
joystick right from the phone over Wi-Fi
whether you fly with the remote
controller or just your phone active
tracked modes are ready to make you
shoot like a throat want to be on camera
not behind it it just takes a wave and a
gesture then there's the new DJI gothic
strap these on to really feel like
you're flying combine them with sport
mode to get your pulse pumping while you
fly at an incredible 40 miles per hour
once you've got your shot edit
everything together the DJI go and share
or even stream your flight live to
Facebook or YouTube inspiration can
strike from the smallest thing a sketch
a feeling and experience the Mavic has
been designed for you to take it
anywhere ready at a moment's notice
whenever inspiration strikes you to
create something truly great
DJ I'm addict wherever you go
