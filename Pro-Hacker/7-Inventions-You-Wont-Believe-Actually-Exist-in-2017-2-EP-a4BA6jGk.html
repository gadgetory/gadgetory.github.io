environment which is one of the most
difficult for us to handle this has to
be changed
hello Kickstarter's I'm James and this
is our solution to a problem this is
heat Oh
heat Oh is a modular heating system for
personal use it has two components each
with four heating panels you are free to
place the heating panels wherever you
like Kito is compatible with all items
of clothing and you needn't change your
outfits this is our battery and it can
last for up to 15 hours yes 15 hours
we've added extra flexibility so that it
can bend and adjust to fit your body it
has high impact protection and is
waterproof to set up the temperature you
can use the wireless remote controller
which is also waterproof if you want you
can also use your smartphone or
SmartWatch heathrow will not obstruct
your actions it's lightweight and
non-invasive heat o drive is compatible
of the lighter socket or battery clamps
on your vehicle he tow dive is our
answer for divers who use dry suits for
cold diving it is safe to keep it under
your suit and the remote control is up
to 100 metres water resistant
for more than two years we've been
prototyping developing and testing
now we proudly present to you our final
outcome
so Peto is ready for production now we
need your help
we believe that hito can improve your
routine and help combat the cold
hello I'm Chuck Martin general manager
of innovation here at Bissell Bissell we
know pets and the messes they make
around the home and when it's time to
bathe them the messes they get even
bigger we focus on cleaning up the
messes that life brings including the
pet messes now we're bringing these
insights to the dog bathing process the
Bissell bark bath truly is the next
generation of bathing your dog a faster
easier and less messy way thistle
strengths are really around
understanding the consumer in the needs
of the consumer especially the pet
parent and we know pets we know how pets
interact with the household and the
messes that they make in a home and we
realized that people are very frustrated
with the bathing process and we took a
look at that and we thought well if
we're cleaning up after the dogs when
they come into the house and they leave
spots and stains on the carpet and
upholstery and we're never really
addressing the animal itself that is
dirty so we started taking a look at the
technology and the knowledge we had of
both pets and cleaning and we found this
great new idea and this new concept
about dating your animal anywhere in
your home so marrying the insights that
we have around the consumer experience
and around the consumer with the
engineering knowledge is the perfect
match because we know pets you know pet
parents we know messes we know dirt bark
bath is really important because it
gives the consumer a new way outside of
their traditional way of bathing to
actually bathe their dog anywhere in
their home that they want whenever they
want what it also allows people to do is
clean more frequently in ten minutes I
can have all three dogs just just a
slight cleaning and the smell goes away
and everything I mean it works great
because you could actually bathe your
dog every other day if you wanted to and
it wouldn't be a chore
where were before it was a charge of a
three dogs you can use it in your
kitchen and just within less than 10
minutes you can wash your dog this is
different because we're actually
changing the way that you wash the
animal normally you would wash from the
fur down and what we're doing is we're
cleaning from the skin up that's how we
can actually use less water because in a
traditional bathtub method of washing
your dog
about 19 gallons of water to wash an 80
pound dog we use less than 48 ounces of
water because we're much more efficient
at the process so our nohrin shampoo is
really unique because it doesn't have a
lot of the harsh chemicals that other
shampoos might and it's really safe and
effective on the animal are you gonna
give yourself a bath it was perfect
there was no mess and that was about an
hour shorter than what it would have
taken me to give him a normal bath it
was great and he dried a lot faster when
I first saw the product I thought that
there was no way that this was actually
gonna work on Oreo she just got too much
care it really really worked good it's
better for the homeowner because they'll
use a lot less water it's better for the
homeowner because they won't have to
wrestle the dog to get them in and out
of the bathtub and it really delivers on
the promise that it's supposed to give
to the pet parent which is we're gonna
take care of your dog in a way that's
never been done it's easier for you and
easier for your dog please join us in
this new adventure in caring for your
dog be one of the first to get your bark
bath order now and keep checking back
with us as we'll be posting new videos
and updates
okay enough of that yes indoor air is
more polluted than outdoor air because
our buildings are tightly sealed and
pollution increases in circulates and
yes we spend a lot more time these days
inside those tightly sealed buildings so
things like asthma and allergies are on
the rise but the good thing is that you
can take control of your indoor air and
even better we have just made it
affordable meet hex tear this is hex tio
a breakthrough in air purification and
sterilization incorporated our multiple
sensors that constantly sample the air
for dust germs and VOCs compact stylish
fully automatic and 10 times more
efficient than others in its class
hexia reacts to air pollution and glows
red whilst switching to high speed into
the pollution has been neutralized
a lot of people have air purifiers and
HEPA filters are really popular the
great at catching particles like dust
dander and pollen but what about
nitrogen dioxide from traffic fumes
formaldehyde from your furnishings
chemicals from your cleaning products
VOCs and toxic gas from cooking asthma
trigger in tiny mold and fungus spores
or that cold that comes back from school
and infects everybody for those
pollutants you need more than just a
dust collector ultraviolet photons
damage the DNA molecules of living
organisms and neutralized viruses and
bacteria the ultraviolet light in hexia
also reacts with the titanium dioxide
filters to create hydroxyl radicals
which destroy all other air pollutants
many dangerous air pollutants cannot be
caught with filters and must be
neutralized so what's the big deal
UV and PTO systems have been around for
a long time well not like this they
haven't fully automatic and react to air
pollution super-stylish visual air
quality indicators more affordable than
ever before and we've improved the
efficiency in fact we've made HEC teo
ten times more efficient hex teo uses a
Scirocco fan for greater air flow and
lower noise the super reflective chamber
greatly amplifies the ultraviolet light
whilst the multiple chrome coated
titanium dioxide filters reflect the
light in increased efficiency designed
to be the most efficient and
cost-effective air purifier and
sterilizer for all home and work
environments so if you want to protect
yourself in your family at home create a
healthy working environment in the
office stop virus is spreading in
nursing homes and hospitals or even
advertised clean air in your hotel or
restaurant heck steals for you using the
making and brought to you by two
specialist air purification companies
for opposite ends of the world with
great pride we bring hex teo to life
thanks for watching and enjoy the air
you breathe

sophisticated tests combined with the
highest quality materials to design a
state-of-the-art USB cable our team has
chosen the largest manufacturer that's
made over a hundred million electronic
devices for many of the top brands to
build this awesome design and we're
ready to go we need your support for our
