nation in the world almost 900 meters
per person but that also means we have
350,000 bike related injuries now
imagine that we would make biking safer
smarter and easier by applying
self-driving technology to bike
we taught herself driving bike to figure
out where it is what's around it what
will happen next and what it should do
we leaned on Google's expertise in
self-driving cars but we have to adapt
the technology to work on a bike
we decided to add two additional
features first you can request the bike
to pick you up wherever you are and we
developed a comfort mode adjusting the
pedals to a perfect resting position I
think the self writing by could really
give a boost me come you could people
could also work on their bicycle you
work in your office you work in your
home you work in your car we could even
work on your bike I have so much more
time my kids love it they're just freed
it can go anywhere they want anytime
they want it's amazing at the feet
respond we feel that this is the biggest
invention since the invention of the
bicycle itself at Google we always put
our users first with the launch of this
bike we believe we do that again

gmail blue was part of the initial
conception for Gmail when it was
launched at the time the technology was
simply not there the culture of Google
really is to incorporate moonshot
thinking to every project it's taken us
six years to develop the technology to
achieve gmail blue our major challenge
was how do we make this intimate
intuitive realistic and organic in
trying to bring email into the 21st
century we are faced with a challenge
how do we completely redesign and
recreate something while keeping it
exactly the same the answer is Gmail
blue
you click on compose the button can post
blue the word compose itself blue bold
face is blue underline is blue I calyces
blue as well you write in the body of
the email the font comes up blue you not
to make it blue it is blue it just is
with the little lines they are in blue
when you go on to help it's blue it's
gmail only blew her
we experimented with a lot of different
colors we tried to orange brown brown
was a disaster who tried yellow the
inspiration of blue came from nature
ocean sky blue whales a blue that was
reminiscent of nature but better than
what nature created gmail blue is it
just opens a lot of doors that haven't
been opened before I think the first
thought that's going to come to the end
users mine
is I can't believe I waited this long
for this
with Google Express we're constantly
looking for ways to improve home
delivery like everyone in our industry
we were intrigued by the idea of drones
but we also asked ourselves what if
there's another way drone technology is
exciting but it's not ready and that's
when the breakthrough happened an
autonomous delivery service that not
only brings our users packages but also
brings them joy the answer parachutes
we're proud to announce the launch of
parachutes by Google Express quiet
reliable gentle they're the perfect
marriage of form and function this
parachute technology is going to change
the way we think about parachute
technology people only know what they
see in TV and movies it's not all
shouting Geronimo and barrel rolls it's
science our controlled hover utilization
team of engineers researchers and
scientists spent years developing the
parachutes function from the apex vent
to the suspension lines to the canopy
Gore's but the question remained does it
actually work answers yes beautifully
Google Express has always been about
delivering people the things they need
and the stores they love with parachutes
by Google express our users are
constantly connected from placing an
order to tracking delivery to the moment
they catch the package out of the sky
delivering you the things you need when
you need them and forget the obstacles
of brown delivery the parachutes you can
receive deliveries anytime and
where parachutes are a lot like mine
they work best when they're open how do
we get the parachutes into the year we
use drones

hi my name is Ben Segura and I'm on the
Google Fiber team we have heard a lot of
rumors that we've been building a fiber
optic network that will deliver internet
speeds 100 times faster than most
Americans have access to today and while
we are humbled by these speculations we
have focused our efforts on developing a
different kind of fiber Google Fiber
here at Google we try to solve big
problems using technology we have done
everything from building self-driving
cars to developing Street View
technology we strive to use the advances
of technology to help our users live
better and more effective lives however
we have seen an even bigger problem when
it comes to our bodies as we still rely
on outdated sources of fiber and
nutrients to give us energy help our
intestinal in colon efficiency and
sustain us throughout our busy lives
prior to Google Fiber I never felt like
I came close to my full athletic
potential I was sluggish and tired now
i'm racing winning and feeling great
this is not just fiber it's google fiber
for short weeks after eating the google
fiber bar the bar actually can take
feedback from the body determine which
nutrients are needed and target delivery
to the specific organs that need those
nutrients google has revolutionized
preventative healthcare washington you
have to take a look at this we have
spent a long time perfecting google
fiber and are excited for its potential
to positively impact the health of our
users it's not just vitamins and it's
not just fiber it's google fiber and
it's like nothing else out there let us
help you make the most of your health
one bite at a time for more information

Google Fiber please visit www m forward

I'm going to show you a new android
application that's been developed
through our translation technology our
new app google translate for animals
translates animal speech into human
vernacular the handset records the
animal sounds and then transmits them to
our server where the speech recognition
and translation engines analyze the
neurobiological acoustics the voice
recognition software then checks itself
against the millions of sounds in our
animal linguistic database and produces
a translation in plain English let's see
how google translate for animals works I
activate the translate app as you can
see there's a large range of animals to
choose from I choose pig then I make a
recording see here it transcribes it but
if i push the speaker button we can
actually hear what bella said me person
smells good that's amazing
let's find out what's on Donna's mind
love you to get google translate for
animals go to android market and search
translate for animals
at Google Fiber we are passionate about
bringing our users super fast internet
and ubiquitous connectivity but as we
rolled out in Kansas City and then in
provo and then again in Austin we
realized that there was something that
we had overlooked people didn't have
enough time to do the little things in
life we hear you you want a chance to
grab a snack to text your mom to run to
the restroom so today we are excited to
announce dial up mode a way for our
users to get their time back we look to
doll up and he won for inspiration and
we found a solution of all places in
meditation once we got to the root of
the problem it was easy by incorporating
dial-up technology into the fiber we are
able to slow the photons down by three
hundred seventy six times give you more
time to load the dishwasher or hug your
kids it turns out days power in slowness
switching to dial up mode is easy just
select dial up mode at the top right
corner of your browser once selected
close your eyes and relax to the
soothing familiar sounds of a 56k modem
the ala mode has really benefited my
work life by video conference for work
and last time my boss asked me a tough
question and I was totally caught off
guard now I'm faced with a tough
question I just turn on dial-up mode my
face gets all pixelated my voice goes in
and out and they just rescheduled a
meeting i loved i love mode before
dial-up mode everyone was glued to their
devices now we can have family time
again I call it dial up and hug I've
never felt more loved when trouble with
our trusted testers in Kansas City we
notice three times more calls to Grandma
10 times more hugs and 15 times the
amount of popcorn consumed per household
we are encouraged by earlier
souls and we're excited to see what you
do with dial-up modem so what are you
waiting for dial up and hug</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
