things to our lives a lot of wearables
track sleep but tracking sleep doesn't
necessarily mean improved sleep but what
if we could change that what if we could
create a wearable which not only track
your sleep but improve your sleep at the
same time as sim we're doing just that
and we want to work with you the
Kickstarter community to bring this
project to life we sleep for one third
of our lives but it affects us around
the clock the benefit of falling asleep
faster is that you can get more out of
every day I think the most exciting
thing is that we can change people's
lives them helps you to fall asleep
quicker and this will ultimately more
sleep across the knife the development
of film is really based on a lot of
excellent university research that has
shown a better way of improving sleep
but for the first time now spin allows
this to be translated into the home
environment start by placing them on any
of your fingers before you go to bed sim
will then accurately determine when you
fall asleep to the nearest minute the
algorithm then implements a retraining
program to allow people to fall asleep
more quickly that has been used by
researchers for the last 10 years this
is a simple behavioral approach to
improve your sleep but for the first
time then allows this to be carried out
in your own home this is a way to teach
people to sleep better and from our own
research we know that it works them is
about more than helping you to get the
plate quicker then can also help you
take the pathetic town app research from
Nessa down the bay astronauts from study
hall percent better having taken town
apple
the secret to a perfect power nap is
sleeping for exactly 10 minutes five
minutes won't do much for you and
sleeping for 20 minutes will leave you
feeling groggy once you wake up the
incredible accuracy of BIM of knowing
when you fall asleep to the minute
allows you to take the perfect hour nap
for the first time sim also collects
your sleep data and provide you're
asleep school so that over time you can
see how your sleep is improving curat
dammit we've been heads down building
for some time we're a team of
researchers designers and engineers we
collectively have built products that
people around the world use and love our
most recent invention was the retailer
which received worldwide acclaim at them
we've reinvented the wearable for sleep
our research is based on a peer review
evidence base this is more than a step
forward is a quantum leap for how will
you sleep technologies we wanted our
design to represent the ability to
disconnect to the dream we wanted to
engineer something that you forgot
you're wearing we've done just that
fitting the components into such a small
and light package between a challenge
we've gone through hundreds of
iterations we've given our 3d printer a
serious workout with every iteration
we've learned something new and it's
definitely improved our design the
journey so far has been thoroughly
rewarding I'm really looking forward to
seeing what's to come we would love to
work with the Kickstarter community as
we go through final design
considerations for this wearable this is
your chance to be part of something
where we change the face of wearable
technologies forever we'd love you to be
part of it and you can do that by
clicking the grand button thank you
excellent the first fully autonomous
irrigation solution for your home this
is how it work the system keeps your
plants healthy by providing them the
exact amount of water they need and it
does it without any user intervention
our wireless water pressure sensors are
easily installed in your backyard near
some of your plan
they report in the valve switch the
water pressure level in a soil of the
relevant backyard section the valence
which connected to the electronic
irrigation valve transmits all this data
to our cloud server which in turn
calculates blend and how much water each
section of the backyard needs the server
replies with commands to the valve
switch for execution starting and
stopping irrigation of each section of
your backyard this is how our system
closes the total autonomous loop of
irrigation using the most accurate data
from your plants you can easily set up
and monitor our systems using iOS and
Android applications or web interface
it took us three years of development to
investment sound to pay the system for
the professional firemen the uniqueness
of the system is its ability to create a
water absorption profile for any plans
and to irrigate this autonomously we
have transferred all our success and
experience in agriculture into the
excellent system and made it fully
autonomous for you it means saving time
and money while giving the best care
plan no more irrigating manually no more
configuring contact irrigation timers
just a green bacon every time you get
there barbecue with your friends our
system achieves excellent results of
water in fertilizer optimization
maximizing plant growth and yield and it
does it in a fully autonomous mode
we present will never again worry about
watching up the speed cameras or other
measurement devices wolf food we brought
wolf has been carefully designed with
attention to buy clothing it's made from
high quality water resistant leather and
is practical slim uncomfortable even
under close to England hands-free and I
phone the room wolf watches your back
it'll keep you up to date or when and
where you need to be extra careful it
will let you know when you need to stop
going down
our app takes advantage of the leading
technology and global mapping and an
ability to measure speed and other data
to bring you the highest level of
accuracy and constant updates the closer
you come to a speed control zones the
more frequent the wristband vibrations
become helping you to reach the exact
right speed slow down at the right time
and wave goodbye to expensive fine
license suspensions and other harsh
penalty

hi Kickstarter we are stacker in 2015 we
came to you with a new kind of 3d
printer your generous support helped us
launch more than a printer that helped
us launch a company and now we've come
back to Kickstarter to launch a new kind
of industrial-grade 3d printers our
design goal was clear create the most
capable industrial grade 3d printer in
the world and make it affordable for
education business and professional
market introducing the all-new f2 3d
printer
let's make prints that are bigger with
superior quality more complex and
colorful and at twice the speed and
let's do this on a printer that's
affordable the s2 is a to head 3d
printer with enhanced capabilities you
can use both heads to print two
different filament materials on one
object for amazing print like these or
you can print to the same objects at
once to achieve twice the print speeds
like this why print just one item at a
time when you can get to the new SQ is a
large build volume so you can print
bigger things all stacker printers are
made in the USA and we guarantee your
quality with a few year warranty the SQ
model rolls for easy maneuverability
built on for easy to lock casters for
relocation this is an essential feature
for schools and other collaborative work
environment the s2 is industrial grade
this means you can print all day every
day the s2 is robust enough for harsh
environments and busy work groups as
well as high volume manufacturing run
the SQ hot ends and filament drives are
designed and built by stacker and work
with all filaments on the marvel
here is just a small example of the
items we have printed on the new s2
please visit our website to see even
more including some truly incredible and
intricate customer friends the s2 shares
the same engineering and many of the
same components as its bigger sibling
the Model S for which we have been
shipping to customers for months now in
other words the SQ is already a proven
design but we didn't stop there we also
sent production level sq printers into
the wild for testing by actual users
please visit our website for more
information designing a great product is
just half the equation knowing how to
build it in production quantities of the
other half our new s2 is built on the
same assembly line as the s4 using
parallel methods we are confident about
our shipping timelines for the SQ
because the build process is identical
to the s4 we are able to leverage our
established manufacturing techniques to
see protocols and vendor relationships
big machines like the S to take a lot of
money to bring to market and building up
a sufficient inventory can be
financially challenging for any size
companies here's where your support will
make it possible to launch the new xq we
are grateful for your support on our
first Kickstarter you can see the
results in our company evolution current
product line and in the quality of our
print imagine where we can go from here
with your continued support now imagine
where you can go with a new s2 3d
printer Thank You Kickstarter
