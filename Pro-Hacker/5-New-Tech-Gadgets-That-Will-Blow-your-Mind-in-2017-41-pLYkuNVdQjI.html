twelve months one week two days and four
hours ago
we launched the revolutionary device
pyro we condensed it into a smaller more
compact version and along the way we've
added crazy features i'm happy to
introduce you to pyro me
one of the big advantages of pyro mini
is actually the size right with this
half the size of the original pyro the
possibilities of this thing are
literally endless you can put it under a
spread of cards by open that hide it
inside a card box hide it behind your
iPhone behind objects in your house it's
so small you can take a credit card out
of your wallet and hide it underneath
your credit so we've been jamming out
with this thing all week is TV and the
things we've been coming up with are
inspiring to say the least USB charging
no more batteries you don't have to go
to the store and buy triple-a rip open
the packaging none of that plug it into
your laptop plug it into your car charge
it on the way to a gig if you want when
I charge this thing I personally get
upwards of 600 shots before I have to
recharge it detachable wrist strap you
now have the ability to lock and unlock
pyro from your wrist without having to
remove the strap you're at your gig
you've launched the fireballs you want
to get rid of it for the time being it's
never been faster or easier to remove
pyro throw it in your case carry on with
your dramatically increased signal range
we've added an antenna that actually
plugs into the remote which gives you
upwards of 30 feet of range you can be
in your bedroom around a corner and fire
it off in the living room
burst-fire it allows you to shoot two
fireballs to push of one button at the
very same time the perfect dramatic
punctuation for your favorite routine
more fired more in everything we wanted
built in to a phenomenal device
