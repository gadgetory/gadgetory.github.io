when we first launched the 3doodler we
asked the world to imagine a pen that
could literally draw in the air two
years on we've made the world's first 3d
printing pen even better with a new and
improved version that's slimmer lighter
quieter and even easier to use the
3doodler heats then rapidly cools
plastic allowing instant 3d creation and
with no software or computers the
possibilities are limited only by your
imagination we've shipped over a hundred
and thirty thousand first generation
three jewelers and our community has
used them to create amazing things from
jewelry to RC planes fully three doodle
dresses architectural models and even
writing Braille it was because of the
support of this Kickstarter community
that we were able to make the 3doodler
