windshield wiper for your car brand
design price in fact none of these
things matter you make your choice based
on the design of the rubber insert but
the wipers we see today all have the
same shaped
rubber insert that's why they all make
noise and at the same poor performance
now this is a superior wiper blade the
kim blade the kim blade is unparalleled
in its design it has a rectangular shape
and is made from a hundred percent
silicon traditional wiper blades are
shaped like inverted triangles over time
traditional wipers been which causes
more contact to the windshield which
results to smearing streaks and noise
however kim blade are shaped like
rectangles their shape maintains optimal
performance angles no matter how much
they bend so you'll get strong
long-lasting cleaning performance
the Kimble aid applies a thin layer of
water repellent as the silicon blade
glides across your windshield the water
repellent makes raindrops slide right on
allowing you to use the lower setting of
your wife have their visibility and
drive safely to apply a new coat of
water repellent simply run the wipers
for five minutes on a dry windshield
replacing it is easy you can simply
replace the rubber insert you can also
attach a new wiper blade assembly to any
vehicle exceptional looks outstanding
performance Kym blade wiper blades have
you ever wondered what is causing that
slight headache or wooziness that you
feel at the end of your work day or why
your eyes burn when you cross the street

a long-term problem for you or your kids
air pollution both indoors and out is a
global problem today you can join us to

quality tracker that measures real-time
air pollution temperature and humidity
it's the most affordable and most
compact air quality tracker on the
market today people don't realize how
what's in the air might affect our
health
unless we have asthma or allergies we
don't notice any immediate impact on our
bodies and never really care about the
air around us but during the day the
concentration of volatile organic
compounds carbon monoxide and carbon
dioxide indoors may increase
dramatically if the ventilation is not
good enough with atmo tube it's easy to
track the pollution around you and
understand what you can do to breathe
better in the big cities we are often
exposed to air pollution outside too but
we are always too busy to pay attention
to it aDNA tube will immediately alert
you about potential danger so you can
prevent negative health impacts admah
tube can sense environmental changes in
real time to help to make the right
choices every day and live healthier
we have been helping other companies to
invent and develop hardware and software
products for years then we finally
decided that it's time to solve our own
problem we've been working on ACMA tube
for over a year to achieve the most
accurate readings from the sensors craft
it's beautiful and durable titanium body
and create the best user experience from
the data that the Admiral tube detects
now we're ready to share it with you
pre-order your admah tube now and be
smarter about the air that you breathe

Americans are receiving more packages
and home deliveries than ever before as
a result package theft is on the rise
over 23 million Americans have had
packages stolen at box lock we've made
an armed mission to protect your
deliveries from ports pirates and
package thieves recently my wife and I
joined the more than 11 million people
this year who will be victims of package
theft when two packages were stolen from
our front stoop
we never thought it would happen to us
but it did and we weren't able to get
back what was stolen this led us on a
search to find a convenient secure way
to safely receive deliveries of all
kinds we discovered that there are a few
options available and we sought to
change that with box lock our first
product is a smart padlock that opens
when you use it to scan a valid barcode
with box lock deliveries are safe
without having to ship everything to the
office make an extra stop at your P o
box chase down the delivery driver or
let strangers into your house while
you're not home all you need is a secure
locking storage bin internet access in a
box lock to use box lock your delivery
driver simply grabs the box lock and
presses the button on the top to scan
your package only packages addressed to
you
that are actually out for delivery that
day will unlock the box lock the driver
opens the bin places your package safely
inside closes the band and locks the
lock you'll be notified which package
was scanned and that your box lock is
safely locked with your packages inside
box lock works anywhere you can place
the padlock and get internet access on
your porch or shed your gate or cell or
your fridge it's great for homes or
businesses it even works for gifts box
lock works with all major carriers you
can create secure barcodes to share with
friends family anyone you can message
such as food or grocery delivery
companies even your lawn service or
liquor deliveries box lock is piloting
right now delivery drivers are happy to
use box lock because they know their
packages will be received securely it
also reduces the need for delivery
drivers to handle all the paperwork when
a claim is filed what's more there's no
recurring cost for using box lock we
really need your support to help us
finish the final design get the most out
of the battery life and get feedback to
make the product better our final
designs will be complete by the end of
the year and we plan to ship in early
summer 2018 today we're raising funds to
complete this final design and begin
production we're excited to share box
block with you and look forward to
making sure your packages are delivered
safely and securely
