active 5 enables over 100 full-body no
impact isometric workouts and seated
standing and advanced positions to
understand isometrics let's first look
at a classic bicep curl with repetitions
an isometric version of this bicep
exercise would have you hold the weight
still with your bicep firing as you hold
the weight during a resistance period
but weights aren't required with
isometrics you can have your own muscles
create resistance here one arm applies
opposing pressure to the other acting as
resistance weight this is one of the
reasons why short isometric workouts are
so effective half of your body is
working out against the other half
doubling your effort but you can't
effectively train understand your total
weight lifted or measure results using
just your hands that's where active 5
comes in active five measures your force
and pounds and tracks your performance
gains using proprietary technology
developed over five years with millions
of dollars active five measures your
applied pressure and sends it to the
active five mobile app via Bluetooth
active five calibrates each exercise to
your unique strength level and
dynamically personalizes over 100
workouts to your ability this is why
active five is perfect for any age in
any fitness level the active five mobile
app will coach you through each exercise
by adopting the correct pose and
applying varying amounts of pressure on
active five you'll follow each coaching
curve like a game in fact you can

hi
my name is Paula I'm a certified
chiropractor posture doctor online
educator with a fellowship in the
physics of posture now you might think
you've got your neck covered by regular
exercises you do in the gym but that's
simply not true most of the exercises we
do in the gym fail to address the core
stabilizing neck muscles the ones that
matter most
that's where fit neck comes in fits neck
is a patent-pending unique and
innovative device designed to strengthen
your neck stabilizer muscles and correct
your posture the exercise can be done
sitting or standing which means it's
suitable for all kinds of users it's
also the most effective way to enhance
your posture strengthen your core neck
muscles and prevent neck injuries with
our modern lifestyle we are constantly
looking at phones and computers this is
creating extreme pressure on your neck
if its neck is based on academic
research and was developed in
collaboration with professional sports
teams and chiropractors in the United
States and Canada I don't like spending
a lot of time in the gym I like spending
time on my bike but there's some
strengths that are just critical and
your neck is one of them that's why I
like fit neck it's easy as simple its
quick and it does what it's supposed to
do having a strong neck and proper
posture doesn't require much doing the
chin tuck exercise has been clinically
proven to improve your neck posture fit
neck makes it easy all you need is a
two-minute exercise done four times a
week
done standing or sitting wherever
whenever it comes with adhesive mounts
and can be set up anywhere just set your
resistance and within two minutes you're
done when you strengthen your neck
muscles with fit neck your body
automatically pulls your head back in to
correct posture did you know that
anxiety fatigue and even allergies may
all be connected to our posture let me
explain
our head is heavy roughly ten pounds and
if we carry it out in front of us
instead of over top of our shoulders
where it belongs the weight increases
dramatically the nerves are put under
great stress and tension in this
condition and because the central
nervous system runs your entire body
they begin to imagine that a stretch
spinal cord is a significant health risk
over time when we begin to use effective
neck exercise designed to realign our
head back over our shoulders where it
belongs we look more attractive we feel
way more confident in the age better
because our health improves dramatically
so please support us with our projects
and help us straighten up the world we
live in thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
