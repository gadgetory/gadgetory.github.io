for all the important things in our
lives that we never want to lose and
Kempton without there's tile a simple
little device that helps you find
anything attach title to your things and
then finding them is easy bring your
wallet to find it wherever it's hiding
or use the tile app to see where you
left your car on a map if it's your
phone that you're looking for press the
button on any of your tiles your phone
will ring even on silent
and if you lose your wallet and it isn't
very laughs hatted tile can still help
you find it just ask to be notified when
your wallet is found when any user in
tiles global network comes within range
of your missing wallet the tile app will
notify you of its most recent location
tile the simple easy way to find the
things that matter get tile today enjoin
the millions of tile users who very less
find more tile find what matters we all
love listen to music on a smart device
that hold thousands of songs and they're
easy to use the cramming 70 features
into one device comes at a cost and that
cost the sound quality if you have ever
listened to high-end audio equipment
you know the sound is richer louder and
has a superior bass but then I'll go
back to listening to music on my
smartphone or mp3 player which just
can't match the sound every year we get
better resolution screens plus the
computers and more gigabytes why is
audio think nada
that's why we created um you Ambu supply
me headphone amp light I picked in your
pocket and works with all your music but
now for the first time you have high end
audio down on the soil since life it's
really easy to set up um just plug um as
your audio device plug your headphones
into em and that's it now you can listen
to music the way the artist intended you
next step to the P I will today
cancelled all my plans that I snapped
right side with my guitar my you can't
take your hi-fi system with you to leave
the house but we do and you can and it
fits right in your pocket you can listen
to music while you're walking or on the
box
um pretend our battery life so you can
take it with you anywhere if you have a
nice set of headphones you know that I'd
go loud enough
um allows your headphones to go two and
a half times louder without sounding
distort and it makes your regular
earbuds sound great too and if you love
your base um has different in two modes
which includes an extra base setting
experience movies the way they were
meant to be your luck you're sitting in
the cinema
do you listen to Pandora or Spotify
well we design you amps make streaming
music sound even better you ant either
works in your cocktail so you won't miss
out for great sound even on the way to
work through the use of multi-layer PCB
technology micro sized components and a
tiny computer to handle it all we've
been able to take what's normally inside
a large device and fit it into a compact
convenient package with incredible
sounds there are so many other uses for
us like computer games speakers and even
plug your headphones into your TV we've
finished the prototype now we need your
help to manufacture and deliver the best
audio experience you've ever had being a
gun owner is not just buying a gun
you must always be prepared have to be
trained
you are your gun see when it's not on
you you want to know it's secure and
accessible safes are not always
accessible or easy to open especially in
the dark and locks are nuisance to
operate as for smart guns or smart guns
are a dangerous concept taking an
unreliable technology and embedding it
into your gun is not a smart decision
our mission is to bring you the perfect
solution introducing zorax the new
generation of gun stores
nor exes caliber specific has two modes
the first mode is awareness if someone
tries to tamper with your gun
you're immediately alerted and when you
need your gun charging it will eject
sorex and chamber a fresh round the
second mode is when your gun is locked
when Zoras locked
no one can charge your gun if someone
tries to charge your gun the locking
mechanism will immediately expand
preventing the gun from being loaded
special polymers in the locking
mechanism prevent any damage to the
narrow Zoras developed a revolutionary
unlocking mechanism rapid dial rapid
dial is a simple mechanism which counts
clicks while you turn it you don't need
to start from a specific point even the
direction that you turn the lock doesn't
matter these two factors allow you to
unlock your weapon without looking at it
even in the dark you can choose a simple
code or any length code you wish you
won't believe how fast and simple it is
until you try it you can also open zorax
from your phone but you can only lock it
by physically pressing the lock button
zorax normally communicates with your
phone directly through bluetooth it also
comes with a zorb bridge a Bluetooth 2
Wi-Fi router when plugged into the wall
near your gun you'll be made aware from
anywhere in the world if your gun is
being tampered with now if your home is
your safe and you don't lock your gun
but you still want alerts we have a
solution
Raziel watchdog
the zuhr watchdog is not a lock but
rather a notification device its sole
purpose is to notify you if your weapon
is tampered with
zorax with attention by veterans of
elite IDF technological in combat
worked on us for two years
bringing it to perfection Suresh allows
you to be ready aware and safe more than
ever before
join the zuhr revolution own your gun
match of the day in total park and get
from the palm of your hand
that you can bring to the credible sites
above the waves and sucked out of a hot
airport rescue
this is micro drone when we've began on
micro drone our aim was to create a
small size personal drone but with
affordable durable easy to fly that
works straight out of the box a drone
program whether you fly micro Troon in
extreme conditions like on a windy beach
or in delicate ones like inside your
home with its precision control
flexibility and durability you can fly
it anywhere no matter your age or flying
experience there's no other drone like
we're doing really innovative stuff we
don't cut corners we're in it for a long
run we launched the first edition micro
drones in 2011 and the feedback was
incredible
we redesigned the second addition around
modular architecture to support a unique
range of plug and play modules it
received rave reviews in the technical
journal online blogs and even TV shows
little drones that are like hey they're
awesome man have you seen the micro
drone two-point yeah that's probably my
favorite one it's incredibly nimble
perfect if you're filming extreme sports
it is very rugged and if anything did
break its modular design means it's easy
to replace any part now after two years
we're ready to make micro drone 3.0
micro drone 3.0 is designed with drone
enthusiasts and excellent engineers from
around the world components are easily
expandable upgradable and replaceable
it's also the smallest room to currently
carry a mechanical gimmick the HD camera
streams live footage to your smart phone
the battery slide in and out for quick
hot swapping and the plug and play smart
modules simply snap on with magnets
since everything either snaps or slides
in the structure is sleek aerodynamic
and beautiful so now it's possible using
a 3d printer technology like the
Ultimaker 2 you can print out your own
custom frame similar to the dragon or
the watch I was super excited when the
when the micro drone team reached out
and wanted to make a first person view
drone technology using the DODOcase VR
viewers very few people could use
first-person view
drone technology even a year ago I mean
the fact that the microcurrent team is
making this technology available is
really a revolutionary idea we want to
make the quintessential drone the drone
market is evolving and together we can
drive the technology forward
we need your support so no matter who
you are we're making sure that whoever
open the box
finding simple reliable affordable
durable and fun drone thank you we look
forward to making with you the next the
one and only micro drone
you're going to love this what is this
cuvee oh cool what everybody have your
favorite kind of ooh a special wine
bottle they work with a dispenser soon
just pick the ball you want pop it in
got that wine bottle keeps it good for
30 days
it's tells you stuff about the wine like
which foods you compare it with all
right so it says we should have one of
these for this meal our both or both I
found out that I love draw whites with
floral notes well you've obviously been
learning a lot while you drink a lot of
hard work that's good well then you
should read it
I got a membership they send me wine
each month and now they know which ones
I love I can have a white while I'm
cooking and a red lot eating dinner so
you're not going to make us force down
all these bottles of wine before we
leave nope we will take care of these
over the next couple weeks I'm totally
getting one of the fast pace will you've
got to stand out my name is Nelson bales
Olympic champion first african-american
on the US cycling team
I spent my entire life on a bike for
work play road is my home run streets
social that you can see bucket in case
of being seen as why wears a key turns
in clothes
God is now here distracted by so many
things
the smart streets are dangerous place
with Zack not only the drivers know I'm
coming communicate to save my life
Oh
I did finite pure soft inside
Zach Eastern Sigma gloves
you
yo
Oh
hi I'm Laura anthem our robotic
engineering students and a commuter
every day I take the train going to my
University it takes me one and a half
hour of walking every single day really
too much science I think a lot of you
are in the same situation and we all
know that commuting is both stressful
and fine consuming this made me think
how to move more quickly and with less
effort and with something portable you
could carry it on train and even in
class for this reason I created both
there's more less and lightest electric
vehicles in the world both is more than
just an electric board is the most
portable vehicle out there it's an
amazing mean of transport powerful
lightweight easy to use as marked as
more great revolution in the world of
mobility
Malka lady save time on your daily
commute and three more for your favorite
activities it does a top speed of 21
kilometers per hour
and it's just as fast as a bicycle it is
a range of about 10 kilometers more than
what you need for the short daily
commute in the city with a length of 60
centimeters if there's no less electric
skateboard in the world with a weight of
4 kilograms it's light enough to be
carried even when not in use with no
effort on your backpack for by hand to
build the balls I got help from my
father a photographer electronics
engineer and drones maker after one year
of prototyping and testing this is the
final version the battery and
electronics are embedded in the wooden
body he has a powerful model of 2,000
watts of power and you can go up ill and
start form a full stop the inside
batteries are so powerful that can
recharge your devices on the go through
the built-in USB port you can even
recharge completely your iPhone up to 20
times with the remote controller writing
balls if you just bring a video game
whoa I see thank you where is Italian
design bolt is both modern and practical
and exact is of the right size for a
comfortable and safe ending those who
has the brake to stop safety we can
think both like a compact longboard he
has a larger track for more stability it
has bigger wheels to overcome every
obstacle on the street both is marked
with bluetooth for connectivity we are
going to develop a smartphone app and
also integrate it with levels both as
extremely low running cost and let you
save money on fuel a complete recharge
for entire year will be less than five
dollars on the bills and when the Sun
Goes Down
turn on the light and continue to skate
we believe that everyone deserves a
better way to move
we want to make balls the most
affordable for anyone but to cut down
costs we need an economy of scale our
manufacturers are ready and now we need
your help to cut production applause
that's why we are here on IndieGoGo
if you like the project please tell your
friends and support them to receive
amazing perks thank you I think we can
all agree that we're living in the
future right now Jennifer here has a
smartphone that enables her to auto ride
home control the temperature turn on the
lights
hey Jason we're living in a
technological wonder and yet here we
find Phil who's forgotten the
culmination of his travel log is the
current solution to that problem
we live in an era filled with
technological marvels and yet this is
what happens when Phil forgets Allah
combination is that the best we can do
no because we live in an era where the
air voltage is the air bolt is a travel
lock you control with your smartphone
it's a lock the future deserves a lock
with customizable security settings this
air ball opens whenever my phone is
within Bluetooth range well maybe you
don't trust anyone in your life that's
fine the fittings on this air ball
require me to went to a password into
the app well maybe your air ball seems
solar that's fine too because you can
sit you're able to activate an alarm
when it moves too far away from your
thumbs or you can activate the alarm
manually stop that man
it's the justice the future deserves hi
Bill I tell them what happened bill I
left my bag you lost your we live in a
world where I can use my smartphone to
model my sleeping patterns but bill here
can't find his bag if bill have been
using the air balls instead of some
antiques you could have located it using
the air bombs crowdsource GPS networks
cord if you lose your phone
well you can still unlock your home
quite logging in for another device well
you can enter a backup button code using
your hand like some kind of prehistoric
man the air vault has a rechargeable
battery which only needs to be charged
once a year by our standard micro USB
connector it's TSA approved so airport
security is not an issue
the app will record a history of every
time you've locked and unlocked your
Apple you can even share access to your
event with your friends so you'll be
able to unlock it from the other side of
the world thanks pal you're welcome
buddy
and look how smaller this seriously look
at it it's really small ambled it's the
travel lock we all deserve
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
