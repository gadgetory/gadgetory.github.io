your newer existing PC by projecting an
invisible light field over the screen

fingernails pinch with your chopsticks
scroll while you're cooking or why not
use a paintbrush you get the idea with
air bar you get touch gestures when you
need them it's easy to attach it's sleek

best of all there's no manual no
installation its plug and touch it just
works air bar plug in touch when you
need
hi I'm Nikki and I'd like to introduce
you to hideaway the bottle you'll always
reach for because it's always within
reach so as a freelance product designer
I'm traveling a lot visiting clients
visiting factories going to trade shows
I was looking for a water bottle that
would not take up a lot of space in my
carry-on and I started looking around
for a product that would work that would
still be functional and it wasn't out
there as I'm going through airports I'm
seeing so many travelers probably with
the same problem and I figured this is a
problem I could solve myself you know
once I had a solution for business
travel I realised this had great
application my personal life especially
in the outdoors going backpacking or
just on hikes I could bring water with
me and when the bottle was empty it it
collapses and goes away and takes no
extra space in my pack yeah it fits an
active lifestyle weather in the winter
when you're skiing and you can fill up
the hideaway in the lodge or in the
summer when you're backpacking or hiking
it collapses in your backpack and takes
no extra space no one loves buying
disposable water bottles it's it's
merely out of convenience and the
Hideaway makes a reusable bottle more
convenient in fact in some places
disposable water bottles are being
banned so we're all gonna move towards
the reusable water bottle model and
that's why I feel like this is kind of
the next generation and in hydration
this gives you an option to have a water
bottle all the time without having to
throw anything away the hideaway bottle
comes in two sizes 21 ounce and 12 ounce
which is great for kids and both are
water type I'm really excited to share
the Hideaway bottle with with the world
and Kickstarter is an amazing
opportunity to do that to be able to
show you the backers what this is all
about so please check out the rewards we
need to raise a significant amount of
money to get this into production to get
it on the shelves this year
and just as important please share it
with everyone you know tell them about
this great water bottle The Hideaway
imagine if you didn't have to get your
phone out for every little thing what if
there was a simpler way to interact with
your devices flick is a wireless button
that connects to your iOS or Android
device so instead of going through your
phone you simply press the button that's
better I use the flick app to set it up
and then I can stick flick wherever I
want
I can even share this flick with my
roommate so he can use it when I'm not
around
flick isn't just for your house you can
stick your flicks anywhere like in your
car or on your bike
it's really cool
your destination is on the left
and you can clip your flakes it's great
for any situation where you need a quick
and discreet shortcut like now oh I'm so
sorry I have to take this but flight can
be so much more than just a shortcut to
your phone it could be integrated with
lots of different services beyond your
devices check this one out
take the old cabbie when I get home I
want everything to just take care of
itself
Shh movies starting
another great feature of flick is that
it can be used as a safety device with
just a push of a button you can send
live updates of your location or even a
distress signal to your family and
friends first me and the Flik team all
right you guys ready one two three
flick high three Swedish team that's
been working for almost two years to
create flick and we're really excited to
finally show it to you we've gone
through a hardware incubator in San
Francisco we traveled all across Europe
and China to finalize design and to find
the right partners we have developed a
flake app to be super simple to set up
just open your app press the button and
select the function that you need we
also have an easy software development
kit that allows other apps to work with
flaky we already have some amazing apps
that will work with flick already from
the start and now we need your help to
make this all happen in order to bring
flick to the market and into your hands
we need to fund the tooling and
certifications that are needed in return
for your contribution will send you the
very first flakes ever made thank you
for watching hope you enjoyed the video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
