are a lot of them available in the
market each of them have their own set
of uses but most of them have one thing
in common they're ugly we came up with
an idea to make a multi-tool with the
perfect set of solutions to our daily
problems
so what's the big deal unlike all the
multi tools he wanted our tool to be
artistic so we designed it to look like
a bull symbolizing power and agility
it's lightweight yet powerful the size
of the credit card makes it easy to
carry around

hi my name is Glenn clacker this is my
son Nathan I've been a engineer and
designer and inventor for about 14 years
now and I've designed a lot of knives
and multi tools that you might be
familiar with I came up with the idea
for the clacks last year over the last
six months I've been designing
developing prototyping and testing out
the clocks to end up with the floor
versions that we have here today the
clacks is more than an axe the clacks is
a multi-tool built into the head of an
axe it has a lot of useful features
built-in carabiner jimping for your
thumb to hold on to bottle opener
gut hook axe blade which doubles as an
Euler knife the knife blade lanyard hole
hammer with a built-in ruler five
wrenches and a hex bit brighter the
clacks has a lot of useful features like
wrenches hammer head and knife blade
along with our innovative new clamping
system that allows you to take the axe
to the field and be able to break it
down for easy transport
the clacks is useful for people who are
involved in hiking climbing camping
survival experts people who do bushcraft
all sorts of things including emergency
preparedness I'm Mike peal from Mike
Pihl logging Vernonia Oregon and I'm a
logger the clacks it's a great tool this
morning I used it to wedge over a
Douglas fir tree and it did a good job
this is a clacks lumberjack it's our
most popular model because it includes
all of the features this is the clacks
woodsman the clacks woodsman has the
clamping system carabiner hammer and
knife blade but the more rustic version
that we've created is called the clacks
feller the clacks feller attaches using
the paracord bracelet by pulling the
paracord out and wrapping it around the
handle like you would a tomahawk this is
the tie clacks
the tie clacks is a titanium version of
the clocks lumberjack he does our
top-of-the-line model and it includes
all of the features plus it has blue
anodized highlights and it comes
weighing in at half of the weight of the
feller that's why the tie clacks is our
top of the line model
clacks thanks for watching we appreciate
your support kolaks
more than an axe
