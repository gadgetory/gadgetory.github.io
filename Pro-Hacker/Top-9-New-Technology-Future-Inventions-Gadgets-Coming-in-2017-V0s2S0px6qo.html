fiction
this unusual quadcopter is in the
initial stages of testing before a human
pilot takes a seat on it the concept was
developed by New Zealand inventor Chris
Malloy who wanted to build a small and
cheap aircraft for cattle driving and
land surveying his britain-based company
Malloy Aeronautics manufactured the
prototype which the US technological
company service engineering is testing
for possible military use this craft
were designed from the ground up for
someone to get on and off this one
provides the stability of having four
rotors so you're not as sensitive to
center of gravity issues but they're
they're not so separated that there's
problems with getting on and off the the
craft during a demonstration the
remotely controlled scale model
performed beautifully carrying a dummy
pilot called Buster the US Army thinks
it could someday carry soldiers flying
low over rugged or dangerous terrain a
full-size model is already being built
in Britain but testing by a human pilot
will depend on the craft safety and
reliability we're looking at several
ways to improve that including the
ability to operate with one rotor out
that capability I think we'll make sure
that it's reliable and and safe for both
military and civilian use the full-size
hover bike will be powered by a gasoline
engine turning an alternator to provide
power for it's for electric rotors there
will be two versions with one and two
seats they will fly up to 96 kilometers
per hour with a range of up to 240
kilometers but Kiev it says there are no
heart dates set for testing the
full-size model talking with the US army
counterparts we're looking at a three to
five year development effort so that
would be
good timeframe to expect additional
progress on the hover bike for now
Malloy Aeronautics is selling a
battery-powered scale model of its hover
bike for about 1000 to 1600 dollars
useful for aerial photography or light
deliveries gorge footage VOA news

hey Kickstarter I'm J I'm Daniela four
years ago we started goat Anna to solve
the no service problem we set out to
make it possible to use your phone even
when you don't have cell reception or
Wi-Fi after a lot of hard work we
developed this device which is the first
and only way to use your smartphone to
send text messages and GPS locations to
others over long distances even when you
don't have any service of any kind our
award-winning product has been enjoyed
by tens of thousands and used all over
the planet while adventuring outdoors
traveling abroad attending crowded
events or even during an emergency over
the last year we've been working on a
next-generation product it lays the
foundation for a kind of communications
network that has never existed before
and now we're finally ready to share
what we've been working on and invite
you to be a part of it has this ever
happened to you you're traveling with
friends and vs. card and everyone has a
different adventure plan for the day
mean wants to climb a mountain take
pictures David and I don't want to find
a river and enjoy the Sun and you you
just want to plateau Reinheitsgebot cuz
you don't go to birches garden without
trying the right height spot the problem
is is my phone has no service and
Bridgette Scott and I still want to know
what my friends are doing that's why in
this adventure we each brought a goat in
a mesh once paired with your phone
Goten Emes generates its own radio
signal so you can send text and GPS
locations using a simple app no towers
routers or satellites required sent and
received
I can send a direct message to David a
group chat to my friends or broadcast to
any Goten in the area go tena has great
point-to-point communication range but
with this groundbreaking mesh networking
technology is possible to double or
triple your range by hopping through
other go tender mesh units in the area
you don't even need to know the other
users or do anything it's automatic and
privately so I'm able to receive a
message for Ming who's on top of a
mountain because our friends and other
go 10ms users act as relay points
between us imagine using this out of
music festival or on the slopes the
possibilities are endless unlike
traditional communication networks
Goten amesh actually gets stronger the
more users join it
we call this people power connectivity
one more to go please
we're excited to launch goat NMS because
it's the first mesh network of its kind
100% off-grid mobile long-range and
consumer ready this kind of technology
has never existed outside of the
military
and even then they've been big heavy
systems that cost tens of thousands of
dollars
goat Animesh however is tiny and
affordable Goten amesh is our first
product available internationally and
having completed industrial design and
advanced prototyping earlier this year
we're now busy testing and setting up
manufacturing and distribution so people
all over the world can use our
technology to stay connected to each
other during fun off-grid adventures as
well as unplanned emergency situations
it's worth noting that goat Ennis
technology is already fielded and
trusted by public safety organizations
during mission-critical operations which
means that you can count on it - in our
headquarters in Brooklyn New York we've
assembled a small but scrappy team that
includes some of the most talented
engineers in the world we're all
motivated by the mission of empowering
people to create their own connectivity
even when traditional communication
networks are unavailable unreliable or
unaffordable we've built faux tena mesh
because we believe in a future where
communication isn't just delivered by
top-down infrastructure but also made
possible from the bottom up by people
like you we want you to be the first to
experience the future of people-powered
connectivity it starts with enabling
essential communication when you don't
have service but it can be something
much bigger we've built revolutionary
technology into goat NMS but in order to
change the game we need you Kickstarter
we invite you to become a mesh founder
with us so please support this campaign
until everyone you know about goat NMS

we have evolved alongside the honeybee
in a symbiotic relationship we care for
them they pollinate our crops and of
course make lots of delicious honey but
getting the golden nectar has always
been quite a task I just thought it was
crazy they'd have to crack the hive open
for the hive apart stress out all the
bees and spend all day in the shed just
to get your honey and I thought hmm
there must be a better way so my dad and
I got to work and we've done it now you
can simply turn a tap and pure fresh
money flows right out of your mind
delicious ready for you to eat oh it's
amazing it's amazing it's honey on tap
for those that don't know harvesting
your honey used to be a real labor of
love you had to protect yourself from
stings fire up a smoker to sedate the
bees crack the hive open lift heavy
boxes pull out the frames try not to
squash bees brush them off the combs or
use a leaf blower transport the frames
to a processing shed cut the wax capping
off filter the honey and clean up all
the mess then the frames have to get
back to the hives again now you don't
need to do any of that turner tap sit
back and watch the honey pour out it's
pure unprocessed untouched delicious
honey directly from the hive no mess no
fuss no expensive equipment and much
more friendly for the bees this is the
first time in the world this has been
possible there is nothing else like it
it really is a revolution
we can see into the hive we can see when
the honey's ready and we can take it
away in such a gentle way what a
wonderful thing the flow frames are
designed with clear end so you can
easily check the huggers healthy in the
colonies strong you can watch all the
girls handing nectar into honey and see
when it's ready and isolate individual
combs allowing you to taste all the
different flavours of the seasons you
can just have us one frame and get three
kilograms of honey or harvest more than
twenty kilograms per box but you know
tap it off so easily means that when
there is a good honey flow you can keep
up with the bees and harvest a lot more
honey so how does it work the flow foam
consists of already partly formed
honeycomb cells the bees complete the
comb with their wax and fill the cells
with honey capping it off ready for
harvest when you turn the handle our
patented split cell technology creates
channels inside the comb allowing the
honey to flow down and out of the hive
while the bees are undisturbed on the
comb surface turn the tap again which
resets the comb into the original
position and allows the besa to the wax
back and fill it with honey again for
the commercial beekeeper the frames
built to accommodate a pneumatic system
which means you can flick a switch and
harvest your whole a pre at once we've
been testing prototypes with beekeepers
from around the world I spent hours
taking honey out of highs this system is
just blows my mind I say I was very
excited too when it actually worked
I actually put the tubes in and watch
the honey come out I was sitting there
going what I was completely amazed and
surprised at
mount of honey that came out it was easy
to use and there was very little
disturbance to the whole hi it's this
over simplistic idea of how I've been
working yet here you've actually
accomplished that that's my bottle
that's amazing flow makes harvesting
honey easier for the beekeeper and it's
easier on the bees but don't worry we
haven't taken all the fun away the brood
box stays the same and needs the same
care it always has you still get to use
your smoker and bee suit and do all the
normal things to keep your bees healthy
like inspecting the brood nest for
disease mites beetles and so on
prevention
you still need to pull your home apart
to do this and you still get stung by
your beds if you are new to beekeeping
you will need some help from experienced
beekeepers to get started these are such
incredible little creatures and the most
experienced of beekeepers realize there
is always more to learn after a decade
of development and three years of
testing the current design we are now in
production with top manufacturers in
Australia and the US our Flo hives and
frames are now available for pre-order
on our website honey Flo calm to make
Flo affordable for everyone we've
designed it so you can simply add a few
flow frames to your existing home or you
can go for a complete flow hive kit so
you can experience the joys of
harvesting honey watching and caring for
your bees sweet bees is such a crucial
part of our world without them we
couldn't sustain the human population as
we know it and without the beekeepers we
wouldn't have enough bees join us and
become part of this evolution in
beekeeping
don't guys thanks big honey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
