beauty and elegance of this design
compared to all the other 3d printers
we're using 3d printing to create custom
GoPro mounts it's a gorgeous looking
printer these hasn't really done their
homework and that's definitely going to
be integrated into our whole film
production pipeline a true desktop
printer vision being compact
good-looking super easy to use and most
importantly reliable right out of the
box and this is why Mia was created
Nia is round sexy and minimalistic but
not without cause
Nia's cylindrical shape adds to the
overall strength and stability compared
to conventional box Jake practice we
know that desktop real estate is crucial
that's why this footprint the build
volume is unmatched we like to say you
got room for a lamp you got room for a
Nia
out-of-the-box Nia is ready to print
with easy-to-use feature-rich software
and our very own cool school fill in the
cartridge
however feel free to use any open source
software and third-party filament that
is compatible Nia will give you the
print quality and speed for an expensive
machine but at a much more affordable
price but don't let the prices fool you
Nita is made smart not cheap our
printers are designed manufactured and
assembled right here in North America
using only high-end electronic
components and hardware and in order to
be future ready Nia is modular once
upgrades are available easily swap out
the standard components for future
innovations that are already in the
works don't be left behind with an
obsolete unit it's the best of both
worlds beautiful like a Mac well put
upgradable like a PC moving on
neat stuff is our online community where
users can download share and market
their creations our goal is to make 3d
printing more accessible and friendly
which is why neat stuff will also
include Nia specific video tutorials and
educational tools
crowdfunding is a great way to market a
product but campaigns that don't live up
to their hype and promises are becoming
all too common we had to remove any
internal doubt by making sure that our
prototypes were not just smoking mirrors
put actual 3d printers that worked well
unveiling at CES this year proved just
that people walking by were skeptical as
they should be but when they stopped got
their hands on NIA learn the differences
and actually saw it printing they got
super excited we've heard from you the
user what you liked and what you didn't
we learned what's important and what
matters which further reinforces why we
think you'll love Nia just as much as we
do with your feedback at CES we've made
Nia even better and we can't wait to
share it with you via printers will be
available online and in stores shortly
after fulfillment but we want to give it
to you guys the community first and at a
ridiculously low price that will never
be available again with your help
we want to make a buzz in a 3d community
show it off to your friends and family
quality 3d printing has never been this
easy and affordable Nia is available in
three sizes and a bunch of different
colors which one is right for you
you
Oh
you
you
you
I've been involved in the field of
personal fabrication for five years now
and I've seen what an amazing impact
that these tools can have but I've also
realized that these tools are just a
fraction of what's possible when we were
at the Media Lab at MIT we had access to
an amazing set of tools
3d printing being one of the most
important for designers and engineers
like us there was simply no solution if
you want a high-resolution 3d printer at
low cost on your desk so we decided to
build it ourselves
you
I really cannot imagine where my
research would be without 3d printers I
would really like to have a 3d printer
on my desk we don't currently have any
of the existing low-cost machines
because the part quality resolution and
repeatability is nowhere where we need
it to be in architecture and many design
fields the software tools have advanced
pretty significantly but there's been a
gap between what you can actually design
and what you can actually make and I
think the formlabs printer provides an
exciting opportunity to be able to
design and then physically make quickly
precise complex geometry formlabs
changes the way people design things
they're going to be able to get really
pro quality 3d printed parts way cheaper
way faster than they've ever been able
to do that before form labs takes us a
giant step closer to the engineers dream
which is routine 3d printing the way
they'd print on paper to design a 3d
printer that produces great parts every
time we've got to bring together a team
of designers engineers and material
scientists to make a tightly integrated
product if you can do that you can
fundamentally change through your
printing and I think we've done exactly
that stereo barfi is great to try then
through process it's been around for
well over 25 years
it produces the best quality parts in
the industry the way it works is pretty
simple the laser beam is drawn across
the surface of the liquid plastic resin
that hardens when exposed to a specific
wavelength of light after the layers
drawn the build platform lifts and the
process is repeated layer by layer until
the part is finished
we have a great user experience we have
powerful and easy-to-use software we've
built a reliable and beautifully
designed printer and we're developing
materials which will enable our users to
make amazing things
we've been working on the design of our
product for over a year and it's nearly
complete and so now it's time to start
gearing up manufacturing so that we can
get it into the hands of users
everywhere but to do that requires
substantial resources the bottom line
designers are going to be able to make a
lot more 3d printed plugs and I don't
mean a few designers I mean a few
hundred thousand designers a million
designers are going to have access to 3d
printing in a way they didn't before
formlabs imagine you have an incredible
concept and what we want to do is give
you a great tool to make it real this is
row box a desktop manufacturing platform
I'm Chris house worthy lead engineer for
the project
so Nikkei is a product design and
development company based in Port Said
near Bristol in the UK we're passionate
about design and we're famous for a
number of consumer products that have
been released most notably the power
eight workshop which was released over
three years ago and we now have over
10,000 units in circulation worldwide
Robox has every system in place to print
with the materials available in market
we have a nozzle system which includes
needle valves so we were able to shut
off the flow of plastic instantly this
means no more using no more stringing as
you move between parts and it no more
bumps on the outside this means perfect
parts every time we've also got a new
extruder design that rather than relying
on one feed wave and a follower we have
two contra rotating feed wheels that
grab hold of the filament ensure it
never slips always forces material to
the head and reduces the chance of
blockages and not only that the extruder
includes a closed feedback system so we
have an indexing wheel that monitors the
the filament moving into the extruder
versus that that's coming out so if
there is any stall or blockage the
software knows straight away as soon as
it knows it can stop the print you can
then intervene and fix any problem that
may have occurred and then the printer
will resume from where it left off
resume from where it left off something
I don't believe is yet been seen never
before has a 3d print have been offered
with this higher specification at such a
low price in our head we have a twin
nozzle system this has a point three
millimeter and a point eight millimeter
nozzle this means that you have a high
resolution but low-speed nozzle for
completing the high quality surface
finish and perimeter of the part and
then a much larger nozzle which is
capable of filling the path resulting in
print times of up to three hundred
percent greater than our competitors
because we have a very rigid frame we
can operate the printer at much higher
speeds than normal and not only that we
have a badge of extruder so that the
extruder is kept separate to the weight
of the head this allows us much higher
printing and travel speeds robots isn't
just a stylish 3d printer by simply
removing the head we can add much more
functionality to our platform so we're
starting out with 3d printing but we
hope to move into 3d scanning stylus
cutting die-cutting pick-and-place maybe
for surface mount PCB assembly and also
into milling using simple
cereals such as bolts or foam plastics
and maybe PCB tracks the robotic
platform really is endless it's not just
a 3d printer
the robots project is well into its
development we have electrical engineers
software engineers firmware engineers
mechanical engineers all working hard to
produce this product we've had a lot of
our tooling completed and have our first
generation of PCBs manufactured we need
you to help us drive this project
through to its completion we're
passionate about designing things making
things and we wanted everyone else to
have a go so we decided to come up with
the world's best 3d printer we want to
ensure that robots is easy to use and
everybody can get involved with 3d
printers with your help we can make
robots into the best printer in the
world when we were trying to think of a
name we wanted something short and
snappy so what is it it's a robot in a
box
we called it robots
hi Kickstarter my name is Nikhil I'd
like to present to you the mammoth
reading
two years ago I saw my first 3d printer
and I was immediately intrigued by all
the possibilities 3d printing can give
you so I started to build my own printer
and after seeing the prints that came
off of the printer the excitement was
even greater than before it was the
first time I could physically produce
products at home for the last ten years
I worked in the industrial automation as
an engineer designs electronics software
and mechanical designs recollecting what
was needed to build my first printer and
to start using it I noticed you need
some technical skills to complete it and
to use it so with that in mind I wanted
to design a printer that was easy to
build and easy to use we broke down the
printer to its basics just to focus on
high precision high speed and high
quality the printer is made out of an
aluminum frame it's an open-source
Hardware frame and together with the
laser-cut metal plates it makes a rigid
printer we designed to a custom extruder
drive for the printer so it is easy to
change your filaments you just push back
the lever take your old filament out put
new one in and start training again in
seconds so now that our third prototype
is ready and finally meets our high
expectations we need your help your help
to not only take it into production but
also share your experience with it be
part of our community to exchange that
experience and give us good ideas to
even develop the printer further when
you support us you get a complete
building kits to start building your own
3d printer the kit contains all the
electronics metal parts and screws we
provide you with a step-by-step manual
so you can build your printer in just a
couple of hours
and together with it you get a filament
sample package so you can start printing
right away step into the world of 3d
printing soft printing your own objects
and get inspired by all the great
possibilities make your pledge today to
support us in reaching our goal
this is the mm1 the world's first
modular 3d printing system shared maker
mix we are makers just like you a makers
never settle for simple we never settle
for completed we are always modifying
and improving what we have
that's why makers are so great and we
see how the world of 3d printing is
changing so quickly and let's face it
naughty wants to spend their hard-earned
money on something that will be updated
in six months so we thought to ourselves
why settle for a 3d printer that can
only do one thing why can't my printer
easily switch from printing
biodegradable PLA right over into
printing high-temperature polycarbonate
why can I print high quality prints with
a dual extruder setup and then the route
3d icing on my kids cookie a couple
minutes later for in six months why
can't my printers do what all the new
printers can do why do I have to buy a
new one with thing that's crazy that's
why today we introduce you to the maker
max mm1 modular trader printing system a
fully modular 3d printing system that
allows the user limitless 3d printing
potential our system currently has
several modules developed for easy to
use fun for the whole family simply swap
out the single extruder for paste
extrusion system or for advanced
printing swap the dual extrusion heads
or even our high-temperature head for
the more advanced makers with just a few
clicks and a couple minutes the user can
easily modify the printer to the medium
they desire making the MM one modular 3d
printing system great for home office or
the classroom can make a mix we love
being makers it's pretty much awesome
makers coming
shapes sizes and colors we all have
different interests and creative ideas
so why shouldn't you printer be the same
why should you preacher be able to keep
up the awesome the same pace as you we
love to see what everyone can create
we've given a little opportunity and we
will continue to develop modules to
improve our system that's our promise to
you we will continue to adapt and modify
what we already have and not replace it
our platform will allow the user to
develop and refine our product as well
but don't worry we won't steal your
ideas upon them as our own maker mix
wants you to be successful to supporting
our campaign and helping us achieve our
goal will allow maker mix to bring
consumer level 3d printing to the next
level the question is simple what are
you making today and with anyone we
cannot wait to see
you
you
you
Pauline needs to 3d print the jewel she
has just created Henry wants to make the
PCB he has designed robusta would like
to engrave an image on cyber for an
original problem what do these people
have in common
great idea wouldn't it be nice to have a
single device to do all of this how can
we help them make these ideas real
we have already developed the most
affordable high quality resin based 3d
printer last year but we want to do more
this is lumipocket LT all-in-one resin
based 3d printer
laser engraver
employer means ultra most UV PCBs
we are looming industry we have
developed different models produced and
ship them to our backers we know how to
turn an idea into a product we are now
presenting lumipocket LT and we have
tons of new innovative ideas to make
your 3d printing experience unique here
are some samples of things we are
working on and believe me you will want
to see them produced
only your support will make them real</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
