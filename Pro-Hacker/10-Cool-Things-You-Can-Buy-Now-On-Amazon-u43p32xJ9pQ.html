I love my Clifford
I love my clip
hi I'm Ryan and I'm Valerie thanks for
checking out Lubitz we all of our shoes
but don't the laces present some
challenges there's the time the
squeezing the floppy bows becoming
undone
the double nodding
and the untying to get them off well
with your support weaving Zubat can help
zooids are small yet powerful magnetic
fits that you attach to your own
shoelaces making your shoes very easy to
put on so how do you really want to put
your shoes on wouldn't it be great if
there were no laces at all I mean
nothing to get in the way
well this is what zoo boots are like
when separated the zoo bits eliminate
three rows of laces so there is a huge
mouth opening to easily slide in
then just connect the magnets
and that's it
now go for a run
go to the playground
go to the gym
play some basketball
Zubaz hold securely for most
recreational activities the two boots
are not just for athletic sneakers
they're for your everyday casual shoes
with su bits you have a clean looking
shoe no ugly bows and they'll never come
undone
imagine if he didn't have to get your
phone out for every little thing what if
there was a simpler way to interact with
your devices flick is a wireless button
that connects to your iOS or Android
device so instead of going through your
phone you simply press the button that's
better
I used the flick app to set it up and
then I can stick flick wherever I want
I can even share this flick with my
roommate so he can use it when I'm not
around the flick isn't just for your
house you can stick your flicks anywhere
like in your car or on your bike
that's great
it's really cool
your destination is on the left
and you can clip your flakes it's great
for any situation where you need a quick
and discreet shortcut me me me me
like now oh I'm so sorry I have to take
this but flight can be so much more than
just a shortcut to your phone it could
be integrated with lots of different
services beyond your devices check this
one out
take the old cabbie when I get home I
want everything to just take care of
itself
Shh movies starting
another great feature of flick is that
it can be used as a safety device with
just a push of a button you can send
live updates of your location or even a
distress signal to your family and
friends first me and the Flik team
alright you guys ready yeah one two

flick hi three Swedish team that's been
working for almost two years to create
flick and we're really excited to
finally show it to you we've gone
through a hardware incubator in San
Francisco we traveled all across Europe
and China to finalize design and to find
the right partners we have developed a
flake app to be super simple to set up
just open your app press the button and
select the function that you need we
also have an easy software development
kit that allows other apps to work with
flaky we already have some amazing apps
that will work with flick already from
the start and now we need your help to
make this all happen in order to bring
flick to the market and into your hands
we need to fund the tooling and
certifications that are needed in return
for your contribution will send you the
very first flakes ever made thank you
