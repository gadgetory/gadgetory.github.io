delivery of basal insulin based on
continuous glucose monitor sensor
glucose values and can suspend delivery

falls below or is predicted to fall
below predefined threshold values
warning Medtronic perform an evaluation
of the mini men 670 G system and
determined that it may not be saved for
use in children under the age of 7
because of the way that the system is
designed and the daily insulin

also not be used in patients who require
less than a total daily insulin dose of
8 units per day because the device
requires a minimum of 8 units per day to
operate safely
Lily used to climb the highest mountains
in search of the freshest air with wind
she doesn't have to anymore wind is the
world's first personal air quality
system that generates fresh and clean
air that's portable and is simple to use
its built-in sensor monitors the air
quality around Lily and adjusts its
power to filter more or less wind helps
Lily keep the air around her clean and
fresh even when she's traveling wind
works by creating a bubble of healthy
air around it dirty air is drawn in by
vents pulled through a medical-grade air
filter and clean air is propelled out of
the top wind can filter things like
allergens dust pet dander smoke pretty
much anything except that Lily can
adjust the amount of clean air wind
releases by simply twisting the wind app
allows Lily to check the quality of the
air around her gain insight about the
air she's filtered and check the air
quality of her friends and family Wynne
knows when Lily's filter is used up and
can automatically ship a replacement
filter to her home and the air quality
tracker can even detach to keep Lily
aware of the air she's breathing while
she's on the go
wind blends seamlessly into Lily's life
allowing her to breathe easy no matter
where life takes her what we breathe
matters we all have experiences or know
of loved ones who have been affected by
poor air quality whether that's from
allergens germs smoke or industrial
pollution I founded wind because I've
watched for too many years as my
relatives in beijing suffered from poor
air quality the air problem goes way
beyond china and we want to enable
everyone no matter where they live or
where life takes them to enjoy a healthy
air environment wind is designed not
just to clean the air but also
understand the environment so that can
proactively take care of any problems
and to do both wherever
user goes past eighteen months we've
been working hard with an amazing team
of engineers scientists and designers to
bring win to life today we're proud to
come to you to get your support so we
can launch the product spread the word
and grow the community thank you
proud to announce the Whelan's camp
first data-driven camera built from the
ground up for drivers our system
includes a high performance camera a
bluetooth-enabled obd2 connector and a
stylish steering will promote all of
which comes paired from out of the box
so it's as simple as plugging in and
play we've gone beyond the ordinary
foxiness regular camera and design a
device that fits into the interior of
any high-end vehicle by combining video
and data our camera enables users to
tell the full story of their
behind-the-wheel
experiences the Bluetooth enabled obd2
connector taps directly into the car's
computer allowing users to show what's
going on under the hood as well as on
the road in addition to the performance
data from the vehicle
the Whelan's camera is loaded with its
advanced sensor suite including a 10
Hertz gps sensor for professional level
track timing a nine axis motion sensor
for recording all of the g's at a
carpals
and dual microphones for capturing the
symphony of exhaust mates
gone are the days of having to sift
through hours of footage the camera
software can identify the most
interesting clips using data for example
it can identify the highest g-forces or
it can identify clips with the fastest 0
to 60 volts by the time you pull over
the Whelan's mobile app presents you
with interesting clips that are ready to
share through a simple interface with
the included steering wheel remote you
can even share your driving experience
from behind
without ever touching your phone we've
assembled an incredible team of
world-class designers developers and
engineers we're not just launching a
product we're building a community we
want our first users to appreciate all
the hard work that's gone into designing
and engineering this camera that's why
we're launching a Kickstarter to provide
our early adopters with pre-orders at a
fraction of the retail price
come help us build the Whelan's
community
you
how do you know if the pillow you're
sleeping on is garbage warnings what
you're about to see is actual actual
garbage I'm as shocked as you are ah so
that's how you know if the pillow you're
sleeping on is full of garbage
unfortunately expensive or cheap most
pillows on the market are simply
terrible and this is exactly why the
real-life comfort scientists that
brought you the revolutionary purple bed
with their inventive genius to work on
designing a completely new kind of
pillow
presenting the purple pillow the only
pillow designed to perfectly respond to
your individual sleep type interesting
huh but before we get too far into the
purple pillow let's take a quick look at
what's inside other pillows on the
market you see for years pillow
technology has refused to grow up like
your brother who's still waiting for his
Hogwarts acceptance letter they
basically take some loose softish stuff
and put it inside of a bag this is a
problem though if the inside of a pillow
is just loose fluff no matter how you
shape and shift your pillow to fit your
neck as you sleep it all falls flat this
is the reason that no matter what your
bedtime pillow looks like your morning
pillow looks like this the half pipe a
u-shaped Gulch caused by a complete
evacuation of the pillow fluff to either
side the wedge the flattening of fluff
resulting in no neck support and basic
sadness the untamable bulge caused by an
overstuffed or / firm pillow result in
the 90 degree neck sleep position and a
future job as an evil henchman the curvy
girl these curves are always either too
much to handle or there just isn't
enough for true neck support oh and it's
memory foam so no thanks
others though have tried to fix the
problem of loose fluff with this memory
foam but memory foam has its own
problems
it starts softish then as it warms the
cells compact it loses its shape and
becomes a hot sweaty brick unlike any
pillow before it purple pillow uses a
patented comfort grid system that gives
locally but not globally and even the
designs the grid itself is specially
engineered to sink a bit more in the
center where your head rests while
remaining comfortably supportive under
your neck where you need it I mean just
look at that beautiful neck alignment
and it doesn't matter if you sleep
backside or undecided the purple pillow
will give you the exact support you need
every time
and that there is the magic of science
everybody but what if you find you need
more or less support well for those who
crave adjustability the purple pillow is
equipped with an adjustable air booster
that you can raise or lower to your
exact comfort needs it's a completely
new sleeping experience it doesn't feel
like the pillows of old it's got kind of
like a blobby feel like sleeping on the
belly of a friendly fat man also we've
said it before weight is quality and the
purple pillow is quality and it's
adjustability makes it the perfect
pillow for everyone
yep that's 80 comforts per minute
comfortable so you can go ahead and take
all your old pillows and burn them
actually don't because many of them are
full of toxic chemicals that we just
don't want to breathe and hey to all you
chronic pillow flippers always craving
the cool side of the pillow well you are
always sleeping on the cool side of the
pillow it reads much cooler and post
leak temperature than the competition if
you or someone you know sleeps you need
the purple pillow click here to go to on
purple comm purple no pressure
actually yes yes yes mother snitches
mine
