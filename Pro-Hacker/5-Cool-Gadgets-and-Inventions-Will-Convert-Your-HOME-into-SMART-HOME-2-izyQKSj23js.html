life can be smelly
that's why you need venti fresh the best
weapon to take out stinky odors it works
like add in ventilation to your trash
can and other closed spaces freshen up
the air so you can actually relax when
it turns into this guy who keeps a spill
in this area a lot more tolerable and it
makes sure that you can smell the sweet
scent of this little devil right here
rather than this you can install fancy
fresh to your trashcan easily within
seconds just leave it alone no
maintenance it's a high-tech ventilation
system combining UV lighting and
platinum dioxide technology to break
down odor molecules and yield fresh air
a light sensor starts there
deodorization
when the trashcan is closed Fanta fresh
adapts to all kinds of trash cans and
you can use any regular garbage bags
there's no consumables that keep you
spending more and with an additional
portable power bank you can use vent
fresh all around the house such as
treats in the fridge where needed under
the kitchen sink and of course your
smelly shoe cabinets
let's go get a fancy fresh so easy to
install and 100% hassle-free and acid I
call clean job a couple years ago we set
out to build a family of affordable yet
high-quality smart weather station and
we've done it our weather stations are
simple to install require almost no
maintenance and automatically connect
with your smart phone your smart home
and the Internet they're better than
other stations sold at twice or three
times the price finally you can have
useful weather information from your own
backyard this is air air measures
temperature atmospheric pressure and
relative humidity and air does something
else special it detects lightning it'll
not only alert you in lightning strikes
but it'll estimate the strength and
distance of the storm up to 25 miles
away and it'll tell you how fast the
storm is approaching just set it outside
in the shade air has a battery that'll
last years and it connects wirelessly to
your smartphone tablet or home network
you don't have to think about it when
there's something you need to know it'll
alert you you can also view your data
anytime through our smart weather app as
well as other popular weather apps like
Weather Underground and this is sky sky
measures sunlight solar radiation
including UV index it also does two
really cool things
it measures rain and wind with no moving
parts unlike old-school tipping buckets
that can break or fill with things other
than rain sky senses each individual
raindrop using an innovative haptic rain
sensor it can alert you the instant it
starts to rain tell you how hard it's
raining and how much it rained yesterday
or last week
sky also measures wind speed and
direction using an array of sonic
transducers this sonic anemometer is
better in many ways in traditional
spinning cups and usually only available
in much more expensive systems like air
Skye comes with a long life battery and
is completely wireless also like air
Skye is simple to install just find a
spot with a clear view of the sky both
sky and air work with all the popular
smart home platforms so you can do all
those nifty smart home things like
reminding you to put on sunscreen when
the UV index is high delaying your
sprinklers when it rains optimizing your
air conditioning system to save money
turning on your lights when the Sun Goes
Down or closing your garage door when
the wind kicks up if you've made it this

weather geek just like all of us at
weather fluid

you to be the first to get your hands on
one of our new weather stations and

hardware and in the app there's still
time to make changes ask us questions

better please take a look at our perks

every day new technology makes it easier
for governments and corporations to
track your activity and location through
the internet a tan on Ibaka we believe
that an internet privacy is an
endangered species one being
marginalized or eliminated by these
entities
that's why we've expanded our line of
personal plug-and-play take anywhere
Internet privacy devices to include both
VPN and tor access with our Anana box
pro but our dedication internet privacy
isn't the only thing that inspires us
John Draper it's a legendary figure
within the computer programming world
and the hacker security communities and
is also a long-standing advocate for
Internet privacy and security known
colloquially as the crunch man John has
inspired fascination with computer
systems helped to spawn the Kakkar
counterculture and has been a continual
advocate for Internet freedom and open
source software that's why we were
honored to accept John's official
endorsement of our products but not long
after we learned that John had been
working towards publishing his
autobiography but had been hampered by
ongoing unrelated expenses we decided to
help not a box is proud to announce
Project Blue inside this special limited
edition device is the best internet
privacy technology we have to offer
available exclusively through this
campaign and of course colored blue and
homage to John's now infamous blue boxes
these devices provide all the privacy
benefits of both tor and VPN that is
found within our nada box pro portion of
the proceeds of course will go directly
to John to ensure his ongoing expenses
don't prevent him from sharing his life
story
when we told John about Project Blue he
was ecstatic
hi everyone this is John Draper also
known as the crunch man it's very easy
for you to protect your privacy and your
web surfing habits the Inanna box is an
embedded Linux Internet router that uses
tor an open source protocol that can
bypass censorship and provide anonymity
this is what it looks like this is just
the regular white version but you can
also get a blue version which is a
limited edition only and inside this is
the PC port of the inside of the box I'd
also like to thank the crew of Inanna
bucks for putting this campaign together
for me and you for helping out fund the
campaign for my autobiography like John
we believe internet privacy is a cause
worth fighting for purchase a project
blue special edition and not a box pro
today and help us fight for Internet
freedom and support this industry legend
John Draper at John's request portion of
the proceeds will also go to the
official tour project a nonprofit
organization thank you for taking the
time to watch this video and please
