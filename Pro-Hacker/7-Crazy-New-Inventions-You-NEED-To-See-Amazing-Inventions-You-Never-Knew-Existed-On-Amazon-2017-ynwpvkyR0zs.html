your eyes message sent to mom but

do with your press e take instant photos
and upload them to your favorite social
network turn on your LED light send your
location for emergencies start a
discreet tape recording don't tell
anyone but I like bears check into your
favorite social network and much more
pressing is not just a one-trick pony
you can easily configure the Pressy app
to execute different actions for

mom and two long clicks can call your
dad but what if you want to use your
headphones just let press e rest in the
special key chain and use the headphone

use one-handed get the hold button from
the lovely company five people were
invited to share their experiences with
the in case I 7 first thing I noticed
was probably the quality of the screen
it's super light the text is clear and
every word is like crystal sharp it
tells the time the date the whether it's
a phone case but the screen functions
better than full-blown e-readers my task
lists my reminders kind of means I don't
need to lug my Kindle around anymore
it's like a second screen for my phone
that has like six days of battery life
what's not to love the name case just
works wherever I go it's anti-glare so I
can read in feet and at night my eyes
don't hurt
being able to save my articles in one
place has surprisingly made my life so
much easier I can even see the expected
time it takes to read each article I can
find on my jet it's not I'm gonna take a
stack of books with me when I go camping
not even an e-reader it's the best
probably you know what you call a
so probably what attracted me most I
automatically think all my ebooks into
my Inca case just by using the Bluetooth
in my phone I like to be prepared in
whatever I do so having my checklist
it's always on right there when I
actually need them it makes a huge
difference in my day I move around a lot
my things take a beating but the in case
is solid it seems to shock-absorber
better than any case of ever years
there's no scratches there's no dents
there's no cracks and I've probably
dropped it like more than a dozen times
guys when I really need to focus turning
my phone around and having my favorite
photos they're like a picture frame
that's actually a really nice touch
now I feel spoiled just automatically
saving my news to read later so I don't
have to do anything bigger screen maybe
like Reading area if I could customize
the way my schedule is shown like the
templates to choose from is that
possible if I could take a photo yeah
and then see it here you'd be my
favorite people period the iPhone 7 is
waterproof so if the case to be
waterproof as well that'd be kind of
cool what's this that is the new in case
I 7 plus fitting perfectly across your
iPhone 6 plus 6s plus and 7 plus with a
waterproof casing that's 40% larger and
screen size and uses the latest Carter
1.2 panels
offering the best contrast ratio
available on any new ink device oh you
guys made this waterproof too you guys
okay that's a big screen
for the record here it actually pushes
my news direct to my in case I actually
don't have to do a thing I just thought
I was being lazy Hey look at that that
is awesome you did schedule templates
you asked we listened does it Christmas
with your support help bring in case I
seven plus to life
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
