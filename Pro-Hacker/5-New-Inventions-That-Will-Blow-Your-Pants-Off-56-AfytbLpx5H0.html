happens when you don't use it do it what
did I do
you just backed into me prove it no one
was
I saw your on the phone oh I saw it with
my own eyes
okay well uh nicely
what do you mean witnesses know there
there was no witness might my car is all
scratched up and ice
I expect my insurance to cover what do
you mean you can't help me
is this the life people really lead to
know that car accident happens every
three minutes every day which is why we
built the Volvo - you just backed up
into me if it the Vava - is smart with a
built-in G sensor that automatically
detects when collisions happen so you'll
always have the footage you need no I
wasn't on the phone can you prove it
whether your car is on or off the Volvo
- is there to protect when paired with a
Volvo charger the dash can automatically
record any unexpected activity when you
are away from the car how do you feel
leaving a car alone what if you could
see what's going on in your car while
you're not there
the vah vah - knows what happened and
now so will you videos can be captured
on the ba-bah - mobile app and upload it
to Facebook or sent via email that's
amazing
hi my name is why I am I'm the designer
behind a baa-baa - we want to go beyond
the boxiness of traditional dash cams
and design a video camera that is easily
installed has great video quality and
has features that we thought were
missing we thought that it was important
to show the 360 capability of the camera
and which is why it is in a circular
form our culture driven design process
delivers experiences that are simple to
use beautiful to the eye and meaningful
to the user on a daily basis we spent
the past year taking this from an idea
to building our first prototypes now we
need your help to bring it to life if
you care about a safer and better
driving experience back our project on
Kickstarter now thank you for your
support and together we can make safer
and better driving experience for
everyone thank you
communication is beautiful it keeps us
together
it brings us close it is the key element
of love
but although we can find it almost
anywhere it hardly exists on the roads
driving and communicating at the same
time is almost impossible how many times
have we wanted to say please let me
merge
or please lower your lights
or thank you for waiting
what if we could tap our finger to
deliver our message
introducing auto top
a digital sign that shows anything we
wish to say by a touch of our finger
it can easily be installed on any car
window and programmed to display our own
list of messages from our smartphone
boy from a special remote control we can
add or delete messages based on our need
with support for different languages and
even emojis we can use it for our safety
for our assistance or just for fun Auto
talk is based on LED lighting technology
to ensure that our message will be seen
in any time of the day and in any
weather conditions
it's a beautiful and simple way to greet
the world and to let the world greet us
back we see communication devices
everywhere these days people are more
connected than ever by inventing on a
talk we wish to connect the roads to
this new age of communication after six
months of development we finally have a
functioning prototype our goal now is to
complete design and bring the product to
consumer level and we can't do that
without your help help us bring
communication to the road
how could you be his father if your last
name is Vader and his last name is
Skywalker oh hi this is no go ahead
mount display with image quality that
doesn't suck like other head mount
displays moco turns your phone into a
big screen but unlike other head mount
displays Mogo doesn't lose pixels the
magic of bogo is in the lenses they were
created by this guy Arthur Sze the
lenses of other head mount displays can
only see half the screen so the devices
cut the size of the original screen in
half then puts an even smaller image
side by side that allows you to watch 3d
movies but also creates pixelation so
even if you have a 2k phone you'll only
see 1/5 of the pixels and that's less
than HD with Mogo Arthur created these
special lenses each covers the whole
screen thus maintaining the full quality
if you've used other head mount devices
you might have noticed that your eyes
ache you can get dizzy and sometimes
even nauseous that's because their
lenses need to be perfectly aligned and
adjusted to the distance between your
eyes mogo's lenses don't need any
adjusting so you can watch a full length
movie without any side effects man I
feel so far Mogo has a lot of other
advantages unlike other devices mochou
allows you to see your peripheral
environment so you don't look like an
idiot
to use mojo just put your phone in
that's it
and Danny phone fit and there's also a
foldable version logo fits perfectly
even with glasses and if you want to
pause a rewind just use your finger
that's good rewinding oh and ask for
drones you know when you use them to
shoot fancy high-resolution video
wouldn't you want to see the full
resolution of what you're shooting yeah
GameChanger look at that whale that's a
man drowning we should call for help
Mogo also has an app that shows your
actual drone location on your phone
screen even when the drone is out of
sight now that's at a site so if you too
want to watch content in the best
quality or phone offers get Mogo
are you having trouble finding the right
cable out of the mess to charge your
different devices forget about the cable
frustration this is mag dime a
beautifully designed cable for your
Apple Android and any other devices with
micro USB you can easily connect magpie
into your phone or Android devices easy
and quick connection to different
devices with just the same people unlike
traditional cables that always get in
your way when they are connected the
night line ensures comfortable and
smooth views even when your device is
charging thanks to the right angle
design
also because of the right angle design
mag pine doesn't Bend when it's
connected which largely decreases the
chances of cable damage from long time
bending therefore mag pine is much more
durable than other cables leave in a
hurry that battery's still dead
no worries with high quality and more
robust wiring mag fine charges your
phone 30% faster
of course we all eat messy tables but
with mag binds magnetic function you can
simply join both ends together and ready
to go
compatible fashionable portable durable
you deserve a mag mine bag what would it
be like to play a guitar made out of the
same type of material as a Boeing 787
Jack it's a travel guitar beautiful
sound
it's called clothes guitars the clothes
guitar is the ultimate versatile guitar
the hollow body and wood guitars is the
first thing to crack her death we
ultimately strengthen this weakest link
by hand crafting the body of a durable
and light carbon fiber we make the neck
out of a lightweight and high-quality
mahogany we re-engineered the bracing in
the soundboard to produce a great sound
and tone and we pay particular attention
to filing the nut leveling and polishing
the frets to give superb playability I'm
doing reviews like crazy this guitar was
incredibly and you're really telling me
this is the same stuff that Jets are
made out of yeah this is carbon fibre
it's way lighter than wood and it's way
more durable
but I think the beauty of it is is that
you can take this guitar anywhere and
not worry about its that trade-off of
gosh do I bring my full-size guitar and
worry about it or do I bring something
smaller that's extremely durable that I
don't have to worry about now that you
can plug your closed guitar into an amp
possibilities are endless
- Taylor 6:12 it's like a four thousand
dollar guitar and this it has that level
of comfort in that field now we need
your help to make this model a reality I
love the science of the guitar for the
the guitar has already been in the hands
of hundreds of musicians and their
reviews that have come in have been
fantastic the guitars traveled hundreds
of thousands of miles all over the world
what will you do with your closed guitar
there's something about working out and
the way it makes you feel
almost everyone when tasked would like
to have more fitness in their lives but
for most of us it falls to the bottom of
our priority list so we developed the
body boss 2.0
we wanted a product it would empower
people to reach their goals where you'd
be able to exercise more often and
consistently we want a product that is
compact but something that could do it
all with no restrictions this equipment
is something that anyone could use no
matter their fitness level a product it
takes all these concepts from the gym
and combines them into one solution
bringing the gym to you the platform is
strong the posts are spaced evenly apart
on both sides so you can simulate any
exercise movement and quickly adjust
difficulty the base is made wide enough
to stand comfortably during your workout
and we even added a layer of non-slip
material to assure you stay in place the
bands were customized for this concept
and can handle any height
there's even cloth in the band's to
protect you simply clip in to get
started
shorten the bands or add bands to
increase difficulty our most popular
exercise is squatting with the bar it's
like a workout bar you would see at the
gym but more portable it can unscrew and
it features grip padding for comfort the
ends of the bar spend a full 360 degrees
and are shaped to avoid the clips from
sliding providing you the most natural
feel possible through all of your
exercise motions adding or dropping
bands easily provides many resistance
levels we added accessories to simulate
even more solutions such as handles that
will add weight adding bands are like
increasing your weight with a dumbbell
the wrist straps are double padded for
comfort and sweat resistant to stay in
place we even added a door anchor so you
can increase the workout the body boss
is lightweight made of high-grade
injection molding and capable of
handling hundreds of pounds of force the
underside has non-slip feet for safe use
on any surface the adjustable posts make
for easy storage starting from day one
you can choose your color green pink you
can choose your package
and choose how you want to follow
workouts live reflect program all on
your own
normally it cost of thousands of dollars
to buy or recreate all of this equipment
but by backing this Kickstarter today
you can get it for a fraction of that
price our hearts and souls have
developed the body boss 2.0 and we're
making our first prototypes to be able
to produce the product and make it
available we'll need your support
together we can make this happen make
this a part of your lifestyle share this
video with a friend help us expand
practical lifelong fitness my name is
Shaun Appler and I am a business
traveler and like millions of people out
there I can't sleep on plans travel
pillows are simply too big to fit to my
small carry-on and to be honest they
look kind of ridiculous like having a
life preserver wrapped around your neck
so we set out to design something better
introducing the bowl rest the travel
pillow reinvent
it's eighty percent smaller than
traditional childhoods so it easily fits
into any small carry-on it works by
using an ergonomic design that locks
your head into place keeping it
straighter for superior comfort and rest
it is designed to fit both men and women
using memory foam to hold each unique
neck size of shape
and with four colors to choose from
there's a style for everyone
with the bulrush travel pillow you can
finally get the rest you deserve
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
