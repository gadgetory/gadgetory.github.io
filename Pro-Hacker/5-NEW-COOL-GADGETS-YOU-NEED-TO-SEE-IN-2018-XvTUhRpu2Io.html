windshield wiper for your car brand
design price in fact none of these
things matter you make your choice based
on the design of the rubber insert but
the wipers we see today all have the
same shape two rubber insert that's why
they all make noise and at the same poor
performance now this is a superior wiper
blade the kim blade the kim blade is
unparalleled in its design it has a
rectangular shape and is made from a
hundred percent silicon traditional
wiper blades are shaped like inverted
triangles over time
traditional wipers been which causes
more contact to the windshield which
results to smearing streaks and noise
however kim blade are shaped like
rectangles their shape maintains optimal
performance angles no matter how much
they bend so you'll get strong
long-lasting cleaning performance
the Kimble aid applies a thin layer of
water repellent as the silicon blade
glides across your windshield the water
repellent makes raindrops slide right on
allowing you to use the lower setting of
your wife have their visibility and
drive safely to apply a new coat of
water opponent simply run the wipers for
five minutes on a dry windshield
replacing it is easy you can simply
replace the rubber insert you can also
attach a new wiper blade assembly to any
vehicle exceptional looks outstanding
performance kim blade wiper blade a

hi I'm Connor and this is solo solo is
the first open-source fight o2 security
key using solo can log on the websites
like Google Facebook Twitter and others
passwords and temporary codes can be
fished but not solo
using solo is as easy as pressing a
button or on that later we'll be
offering two versions of solo one as USB
and the other has NFC so you can use it
by tapping it against your phone and of
course you can pick between getting a
USB A or a USB C plug and will provide
professionally molded silicone cases you
can pick your favorite color
you probably hear a lot about websites
and accounts getting hacked online how
security Keys like Google's you type in
key solve this solo is like any of these
keys and will protect your accounts so a
little special to us because it's
open-source we wanted to make a key
that's not only secure but trustworthy
anyone can verify the code running on
solo is the same as the code we post
online and anyone can set up solo on a
website by going to your account
settings add a new security key and
pressing the button now whenever you log
into that site you'll have to use your
security key so if your password gets
compromised you'll still be safe solo
will work with major browsers operating
systems and devices for hackers and
makers will provide solo unlock so you
can reprogram it and customize it using
no extra hardware
so we have solar prototype and we're
ready to put in production but we need
your help please back our Kickstarter
will make secure trust of old products
this is the hydra 3 the beginning of a
new generation of bike lights that make
night riding so much better hi I'm Chris
and I'm Ernest and we're missing devices
and we've set out to make mountain
biking at night an experience that you
will never forget standard bike lights
can be expensive bulky and have short
battery life we set out to change that
the hydra 3 is the first bike light that
senses the motion of your bike and
automatically moves the beam to light up
turns and switchbacks just like the
headlights on high-end luxury cars
essentially the hydra 3 lights the trail
where you want to go this technology
means you can run a single handlebar
mounted light only the Hydra 3 is packed
with intelligently designed features it
outputs an equivalent 900 lumen
brightness on the trail all the
high-quality custom optics deliver a
uniform beam which enhances brightness
inside our neutral color LEDs for better
color rendition and less trail wash out
the internal rechargeable lithium ion
battery will run for two hours at full
brightness but the hydra 3 also has a
hybrid power design and give you run
from the external battery pack
indefinitely through its USB C port so
you can use it on all night races as
well as your local after work ride there
are two modes standard mode which is
best for general use in the climbing
mode which keeps the outer LEDs on at a
low level to give a wider beam for
slower technical climbing or descending
in addition there are four brightness
levels to cycle through it has a durable
waterproof IP 64 design so you can ride
in the rain or snow without concern the
unit is compatible with common handlebar
sizes and weighs only 8 ounces it's
great for cross-country trail downhill
or fad biking riding the night at your
local trails or on an epic excursion can
be simpler and more exciting when you
have gear that perform as well and gives
you the confidence to ride the way you
want
we've spent the past year developing
prototypes refining the designs and
testing the algorithms and are ready to
bring it to you when it comes down to it
with this light the Hydra 3 it lights
where you want to go it's predictive
it's amazing I promise you you will not
be disappointed with this light try the
Hydra 3 adventures don't stop at dusk
and neither should you
we are ready to bring the Hydra 3 to
market and in order to start production
we need your help so please help us
reach our goal and send the Hydra 3 to
production thank you for your support</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
