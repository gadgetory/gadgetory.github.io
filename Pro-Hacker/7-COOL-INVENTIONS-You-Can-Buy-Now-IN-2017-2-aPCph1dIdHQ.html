like this my entire life
this thing is insane I didn't even know
with motorized but to look at it and I
mean the board had a lot of great
technology but I've got to say that the
new design is amazing
it's kind of like the new Apple style of
design right clean seamless this thing's
got juice I was flying around I think
design very sleek it's very cool overall
I think it's the best product on the
market
forget the familiar
introducing the first intelligent
electric board that is exceptional in
every way it is better on every level
not just thinner or lighter the board's
artificial intelligence allows it to
collect data about the way you ride
evaluate it and then create unique
settings to adapt to your style it then
uses the data to improve its performance
and efficiency riding the board is easy
and intuitive no previous experience is
necessary because the board will teach
you how to ride it it's both powerful
and safe
the board can recognize whether I'm
standing on it or not so it won't move
by itself the Xtend board is light and
comfortable to carry its special anti
slip surface makes it safe for clothes
too during the night it lights up
automatically range can be extended with
a swappable battery pack the in wheel
motor recharges the battery while riding
downhill or braking
everything is designed perfectly to the
last detail and every detail has its
purpose every extend board is made out
of 200 high quality engineered parts
that we have designed from scratch we
have already secured all the major
investments that have brought us to the
final product we have it's a small
operation that brought this board to
life just a group of people with big
dreams and passion for design and
technology the board is handcrafted
perfection made out of carbon fiber
titanium and space grade materials we
have already made dozens of prototype
iterations to test our manufacturers now
we are ready to craft one for you as
well now you have the opportunity to get
a special Kickstarter edition and help
us bring this unique board to the market
hi my name is Rita suave and I'm a
professional designer as a motor sport
enthusiast I spent many years selling
choleric on cell board challenge again
during every possible floating device
that exists back to the city life as a
designer I still dream about personal
smart board that could fit any
environment and scale any waters to
fulfill this goal against a team of
professionals who all share same dream
and design purity and efficient
generation after a 15 lots of hard work
this is the time to enjoy hyper high
part is a modular smart boat that can be
rapidly transformed from a kayak into a
rowing sailing or even solar powered
boat its innovative hull shape ensures
excellent speed and stability whilst the
groundbreaking folding design enables
instant transformation from a boat into
a backpack in less than three minutes
and thanks to its modest dimensions and
lightness high bar fits into any means
of transportation vehicle or location
Portability and storage have never been
so simple we rethink the concept of a
boat completely to conceive a unique
shape of the hull a perfectly
streamlined sleek elegant hull is
bordered by hard shines running from the
sharp wave piercing bow to the wide
stern the shape is conceptualized around
two counterpoise hyperbolic paraboloids
hence the name high par this form
resembles the water surface when pierced
by a moving object the angle and shape
of high par matches with water wake
patterns thereby improving performance
by reducing drag optimizing stability
and enhancing control high par is well
suited for several environments from
open sea to narrow streams Gale wind and
breaking waves of the ocean
metropolis waters and the most remote
corners of the planet are all open to
high park we have been working in close
collaboration with D F Smith plastics
France a leading European plastics
manufacturer D F Smith introduced a new
grade of advanced polypropylene material
Aki board specifically adapted from
Green conditions and the unique design
of high par to conceive a sustainable
solution for the environment hype R and
D s Smith team made sure that the
material would be 100% recyclable with a
lifelong replacement policy outdated
holes will be replaced with only a small
fee charged to cover transportation and
recycling now we have to begin type of
production we need your support at all
come flying campaign for the H hi Poland
the amount of the source type of all
this firstly is the would become part of
hyper evolution
we're here to present you with the nano
spark it's the world's smallest
self-contained fire starter that has the
tinder belt right inside
this is our one-handed sparker
engineered the exit back way
tinder can be found within the storage
capsule use a nano spark to expand the
surface area of the quick light tinder
aim the Nano spark towards the tinder in
the Flint wheel to light it we make our
products in the USA for a number of
reasons the passion that comes with
making something on your own and having
the result in your hand so we can come
out to the factory right here and grab a
product right from the machines and see
exactly what we're making it's just such
a cool feeling and then also we have a
really tight control quality so in my
mind that's really know something making
something if it's not going to be
perfect and so we can ensure that every
product can be perfect every product we
make is a hundred percent expected by
hand so the inspiration behind the Nano
spark was we wanted something that was
really small a spark based fire starter
has to work exceptionally well because
it's catching something on fire from a
spark alone unlike a ferrocerium based
fire starter that has burning globulars
of magnesium this just uses a spark in
the spark is has a very very short
impulse of time length so it needs to
make a huge spark and a capture as much
of that primal material with the spark
envelope as possible also the Nano spark
we really wanted tinder stored right
inside it was kind of all in one package
you didn't have to worry about sharing
anything else in a minimal and ultra
light environment and this product
really really fits that that bill the
last thing is just aesthetically
pleasing right that probably has to be
is very aesthetically pleasing and very
functional and on this product we did
that mark 100 110 percent so we've
already begun production of the Nano
spark we need your help to back the
project and help spread the word thank
you so much for supporting American
manufacturing
designing starts from a small idea to an
incredibly magical one and we love to
bring our incredibly magical design to
life

helmet is a must-have tool for safety
while following safety rules your hands
are not free of course using other
devices can put you in danger that's why
we need some ridiculous accessories like
head set but these ear blocking had said
too risky when your precautions even the
road is filled with a bunch of threat
you still have to talk to your peers
those existing devices can't guarantee
your safety in the end you have no
choice but to stop and make phone calls
so we've developed smart communication
devices for helmet users and it's called
a head you can attach a head to any kind
of helmet and connect your phone via
bluetooth
a head on your helmet can transmit sound
through vibration with a head you can
make hands-free phone call and even
group chats with your friends it also
performs various audio functions such as
listening to music and smart
notifications riders will never get lost
with a voice navigation with just a
simple click call Louis keep connected
even when you're at home when on the
deck it can be used as a speaker while
it's being charged a head is a
completely different Bluetooth device
unlike traditional devices the secret of
this device liveliest vibrator this
vibrator on the bottom of the device
transmits vibrations to the helmet and
make sounds clearly I think it's a cool
product we found a very good
I wasn't it too heavy like I thought it
was going to be so that was nice
I think so one thing that could be
cooler is maybe some more designs I
don't know if you like full idea Simon
yeah way better when you wearing
earphones like suck in the helmet so a
car full is I ride bike it is
uncomfortable hard but this thing right
here can hear everything right here
totally comfortable awesome
I think amazing I think it's a brilliant
idea I I really like it I like exams
yeah roses that yours I think the beers
awesome yeah
