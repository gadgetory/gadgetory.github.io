neutral sounding and effortless systems

impressive and I think this definitely

there are kind of big speakers standing

looking forward to see it available in
the market it was so much clearer I can
hear a lot of sounds going in the
background which I have as a third
before
the idea of keen started when flora and
I met while working at the audio company
Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen and we we saw great
products offered by the industry back
then but we often wondered why do these
systems have to be so complicated Kim is
the first truly flexible Sun system it's
so simple it's just one Sun system that
can do everything
Kim lets you listen to your favorite
music with premium stereo quality or
watch a movie in true Dolby Surround
with five satellites and one subwoofer
and my favorite thing is there is no
setup required the system knows how many
speakers are in the room and where they
are this will provide you with the best
audio experience with absolutely no
effort
what makes it even cooler is that the
music can follow you automatically from
room to room with our follow me
technology the best part of it is king
satellites are possible
you can just grab any of the speakers
from your house and enjoy music on the
go we're also one of the first to
introduce wireless charging to an audio
product speakers are easily paired with
NFC technology simply tap your device
onto the speaker to bear with it or tap
several speakers together to create one
massive speaker we made it even more
convenient by bringing the controls back
to the speaker control your music simply
by swiping or tapping the dial on the
satellite speaking
in the end this is a speaker system so
what is most important to me is some
quality we are using high-end custom
drivers and with our experience in
acoustics we created one of the best
sound experience in the audio industry

shape of Kim we are providing you with
