sell me this pencil a rebar cane
we have successfully identified and
solved a number of issues with existing
pencils it's a pleasure to introduce to
you magna as design engineers is in our
nature to challenge and innovate
products we use every day
other products use a full release or
incremental action which dictates the
lead position our patent-pending
magnetic propulsion technology offers
finite controllability unlike other
pencils the secret to our revolutionary
invention is concealed within the core
of the pencil the outer sleeve
synchronizes its position to the inner
magnet shielded within the premium grade
aluminium body it works like magic
every detail has been considered whilst
it may not be visible to the naked eye
the ends of the pencil are slightly
larger in diameter to prevent the sleeve
from falling off
we have sourced our manufacturers pay
for tooling and have received our final
prototypes
so now we need your help to raise the
funds and hits and minimum order
quantities it really is the last piece
of the puzzle we want to make our dream
a reality and start shipping these
fantastic new products to your door we
strongly believe that making profits
should come second great design
therefore we price these pencils an
extremely affordable rate to make them
accessible to the wider Kickstarter
community a product with this level of
consideration really is a tool for life
and perfect as a gift your family and
friends so now it's up to you to help us
bring the pencil into the 21st century
thank you for watching
you
we are surrounded by technology it's
entering our homes and helping us
automate daily tasks but I find myself
thinking there has to be a more natural
and accessible way to control the
devices around us if the goal of
automation is to simplify our lives why
does it feel so complicated our goal as
a company is to solve this
say hello to knocky knocky is a small
elegant device that instantly transforms
ordinary surfaces in your environment
into remote controls using naki couldn't
be easier simply take it out of the box
pick a place to put it
select a surface to attach it to and
then define all the things you'd like
Nike to do
Nike can control a wide variety of
devices around us but the true beauty of
our technology is that what it can do is
only limited by your imagination put one
in your living room for the kitchen or
even your bedroom I mean imagine rolling
over in the morning and tapping a simple
pattern anywhere on your nightstand to
snooze your alarm and start the
coffeemaker without even opening your
eyes you just bought ten more minutes in
bed and you'll definitely want to put
one in your kids bedroom it's exciting
to think of how naki will spark their
imagination as they figure out all kinds
of ways to use it using Wi-Fi which is
proven to be far more reliable and would
better reach them Bluetooth you can
enjoy using naki from anywhere the
number of devices and software that naki
interact with is rapidly growing every
day it currently includes nest Phillips
you lifx smartthings IFTTT and more but
even if you're new to the smart
technology world you can still use naki
for simple functions around your home
other technologies that rely on sound or
voice control can be unreliable and
confusing to use they can be triggered
accidentally and don't always work in
which spectryx
our patent-pending technology uses non
acoustic sensors it's able to
distinguish deliberate tap or knock
patterns from random vibrations in the
environment the beauty of our product is
that it makes any regular environment
into a user interface think about the
surfaces around you so many of them
serve one or two purposes add an AA key
to them and you instantly have a hub for
automation we carefully chose every
material and finish for naki we've gone
through a series of different tests and
prototypes to make sure that naki blends
in in your environment and also looks
beautiful on your surfaces we're doing
our first production runs here in the
USA because it's important for our
entire team to be there on the ground
floor ensuring that we're manufacturing
the best possible product it's not some
far-fetched idea we have finalized our
designs we have beautiful working
prototypes and we need to raise funds to
actually get it into production and
immediately start shipping them to your
door we couldn't be more excited about
how this product is going to change
lives and bring joy to people everywhere
naki accomplishes what technology is
supposed to do instead of taking over
our life it enhances it allowing you to
put more thought and effort into the
things that really matter
happen to the world around you with the
magic of naki
you
have you ever tried to meet up with
friends or been running late for a
meeting only to realize that your phone
battery's about to die
see charging your phone is inconvenient
so we've created a simple and easy way
for you always to stay charged and how
do we keep you always charged with this
because this is your charger and it's
just a sticker and this is your power
strip it's not a block that you hide
somewhere it's an ultra thin surface
that you can put everywhere and this
this is how I always stay charged thanks
to a wireless tech up to 4 times faster
than induction and 20 times more
powerful than a classic charger with no
electromagnetic waves and full charge
efficiency with classic chargers you can
charge one thing at a time with energy
square you can charge all your devices
at the same time at the same power
everywhere thanks to our intelligent
detection system we make sure no energy
is sent until the battery is detected so
the surface is completely inert so all
day long you'll be charging your devices
without even thinking about at work and
evening with friends or family and all
night when you're asleep we started this
project in engineering school when
charging devices was a real pain for us
so our team has been working hard for
the past two years to change that we
started from prototypes to a real
product that is tailored to fit all
units we are engineers designers
managers coders that really believe we
can reinvent the way we have access to
energy our vision is that at every
moment of your life you can forget that
you're actually charging and for that we
designed 2 different sizes to adapt to
all your usages
for now an ERG square is compatible with
smartphones
tablets but we've developed an
open-source standard so we can work
together with manufacturers and makers
to make more products in a t-square
compatible if you want to be part of
this adventure you can join the
community by backing our project on
Kickstarter and sharing it with your
friends and family in order to build
with us a wireless feature
these are the brand-new r 5 rocket
skates from actin they're the first
rocket skates that can be controlled by
a wireless remote controller or even
from your phone I'm Ben from authentic
let's check them out first off the
design is really nice and sharp you may
look like Optimus Prime rolling around
awesome build quality with plenty of
padding around the ankles and the foot
strap is well designed to you're able to
ratchet strap your feet in tight and
snug weight is a little heavy the lead
skate that has the drive motor is 7
pounds and the follow skate is three and
a half pounds but this weight is
necessary to house all the skates motors
and battery and it also adds to the
field that these skates are durable and
well built with quality materials they
say you can go five miles on single
charge and top speed up to seven miles
per hour to fully charge takes about two
and a half hours the big update with the
new r5 model is that you can remotely
control the skates with an included
controller similar to a boosted board
it's very intuitive and easy to control
you can double tap the main button to
change speed modes roll forward to go
forward and pull back to slow down
really simple an additional bonus if you
lean back on the follow skate there's a
mechanical brake system built-in that
will help with slowing down another cool
bonus of the r5 is that you can fully
control your Rockets from their app
which is really well-designed and
intuitive connecting to the rocket
skates via bluetooth couldn't be easier
or faster from within the app you can
switch speed modes drive around with the
digital slider which is no lag over the
Bluetooth connection and even view
detailed statistics like speed battery
life and a whole lot more I do feel it's
more comfortable using their included
controller as it kind of makes me
nervous if I crash I'd probably destroy
my phone but it's sweet to have that
option in case my controller batteries
are dead or something I can use my phone
as a backup solution learning to ride on
the rocket skates takes a lot of
practice they recommend to keep your
feet parallel to the ground have the
motorized skate the one with the red
buckle lead in the front and the
follower skate behind in an inline
position it's definitely an awkward
stance that takes time getting used to
and to be
it's actually a great workout every time
I ride around I feel the burning in my
legs and core so hey this can be great
for extra nice too right
these rocket skates are great for those
of you who want to have a fun skating
experience and a unique riding challenge
that will definitely turn heads and
spark conversation that being said I
don't think they're the perfect last
mild transportation device just yet but
maybe in the future they really remind
me of adult motorized Healy's which I
always dreamed about with continued
practice and time they'll only get more
fun now huge thanks to act in for
sending me the rocket skates to review
the current price of these skates is
about four hundred dollars and I'll give

sleep is crucial to our life but the
majority of us are not happy with the
sleep we are getting according to forbes
about 40 million americans report that
poor sleep regularly affects their lives
and CDC has identified insufficient
sleep as a public health problem aren't
you tired of being tired we created
sleep man to help you and people like
you our team of scientists and engineers
have been developing and testing sleep
man for two years implementing the most
efficient and non intrusive technologies
for monitoring alertness and sleep
sleeeeep man is a new multifunctional
device that will help you get the most
out of your night's sleep or a short nap
it is also a unique road safety tool
that alerts fatigue drivers if they are
in danger of dozing off it is
scientifically proven that people feel
groggy and tired when they are forced to
wake up during the wrong stage of sleep
even when they are getting the right
amount of sleep we've all been there but
sleep man will never let you get up on
the wrong side of the bed sleep men's
high-accuracy is based on the unique
patented EDA monitoring technology sleep
man monitors your sleep phases through
the night and always wakes you up in the
right stage of sleep up to 20 minutes
before your alarm time although you
might lose a few minutes of sleep you'll
wake up well-rested and full of energy
sleeeeep men knows where others just
assume according to the National Highway
Administration nearly 100 thousand
crashes and thousands of deaths in the
u.s. are caused by fatigue drivers every
year sleep men does not need to track
eyes or head movements as other products
do when your eyes are closed or your
head nods it may be too late
sleep men can detect driver dozing long
before it becomes unsafe and it's alarm
intensifies until the user reacts sleep
men is the only device that individually
adjusts to your unique bio signals and
can be fine-tuned by the users feedback
if you're driving regularly operating
machinery or just need to stay
concentrated through the day sleep man
is for you sleep man does not just give
you a warning it also offers the easiest
solution to daytime drowsiness with its
bio smart power nap alarm no matter what
we do we're under some sort of pressure
every day the benefits of short power
naps are being more and more recognized
and even encouraged by employers
according to the National Sleep
Foundation a 20 to 30 minute nap is an
effective way of increasing energy level
boosting focus and productivity the key
to an effective power nap is in the
timing you should wake up before falling
into a deep sleep
otherwise you wake up more tired than
before sleep men can effectively detect
at that precise moment and wake you up
well-rested recharged and refreshed stop
for minutes and run easily for hours
sleep man can also transmit a visual
history of your sleep patterns and
daytime activity to a smartphone to help
you learn to sleep more effectively
let's sleep men improve your day and
optimize your sleep sleep man never
sleeps Elf Emeth is an active
non-invasive wearable technology that
helps us face the challenges of our
stressful lifestyle even when you're
chronically stressed elf Emmett will
help you return to a balanced state
with so many things going on it's hard
to keep a clear and focused mind so you
can effectively learn about Emmet will
help you focus and concentrate when you
need to
most people have struggled with
sleepless nights all the stress of the
day just keeps you from resting belf
Emmett will calm you down and rock you
into a deep sleep
elf Emmett works in synergy with the
natural rhythm of your mind and body
waves when you're active and focused
your brain frequency is high when you're
resting it slows down
however because of our busy lifestyle
our brain waves aren't always in tune
with what we need elf
Emmett uses pulsed electromagnetic
technology to non-invasively synchronize
your mind with the frequency of what you
want to do learn and concentrate while
feeling stressed improve the quality of
your sleep
stay awake when feeling tired relax
after a hard day we designed the
technology around a beautiful light
headband that is powered by your
smartphone or tablet and operated with a
simple application
people have always used extremely low
frequencies to achieve altered states of
consciousness just think of meditating
to the rhythmic sound of drums Gong
therapy or the steady flashing light of
a fire things that take us into a state
of thoughtfulness even when the sound of
train news
different rhythms in music
but they all have an effect on us we
always adapt to an external frequency
our entire biological system the brain
and the earth itself work at the same
frequencies mister Nikola Tesla once
said that if we can influence those
frequencies electronically we can
directly stimulate the entire body and
mental system of humankind elf Emmet
uses the same power source as your
headphones to generate a weak
electromagnetic pulse between two coils
to demonstrate we can connect the coils
to a speaker and actually hear the
frequency that the application transmits
it's music you can't hear the cerebellum
is the part of our brains that links the
brain in the heart depending on our
situation it suggests our performance
rhythm this is the spot that says slow
down there's no danger relax or it says
hurry up we have work to do concentrate
elf Emmet works directly on the
cerebellum and can influence the whole
system it tells both the brainwaves and
heartbeat to speed up or slow down
