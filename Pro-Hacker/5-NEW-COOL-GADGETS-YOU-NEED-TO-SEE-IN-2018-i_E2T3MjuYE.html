and creative director of Prague Hill the
design studio based in Brooklyn New York
we developed a manufacturer variety
distinct and thoughtful objects inspired
by experimentation and our sense of
curiosity some of our most popular
products include the Wilson hearing the
ripple opener the Jack puzzle and now
introducing our newest product the Ven
puzzle Ben puzzles comprised three
identical pieces diecast and stainless
steel and weighing in at almost two
pounds the assembly of the puzzle
initially seems pretty simple but once
you get it in your hands you realize it
requires a high level of dexterity and
precision all the pieces have to align
the simultaneously and then the
unexpected success of some of our more
conceptual products has given us the
confidence to produce the Ben puzzle
we've been lucky enough to find an
audience for many of the strange
sometimes functional objects that we
love to make and we're hoping to
continue expanding that community
through this Kickstarter campaign
we've been working on the design for the
Ben puzzle for the better part of two
years fine-tuning the geometry finding
the right manufacturing partner and
refining the finishing process and now
we're finally ready to go into
production we've got our tooling made
the first production samples are in hand
and we're eager to bring the Ben puzzle
to life the finished product feels
smooth cool and surprisingly heavy
it's an oddly satisfying and meditative
distraction we're still trying to figure
out if anyone can assemble it one handle
puzzle comes with a small metal display
stand is packaged in a sturdy chipboard
tube for our Kickstarter backers we're
offering the venn puzzle at a
significantly discounted pre-sale price
and the first 500 puzzles were shipped
by November 15th we're passionate about
experimenting with industrial
manufacturing and making products that
inspire curiosity and hopefully make
your day a little more enjoyable
with your help we're excited to bring
this puzzle into the world thanks do you
hate this three easy steps to break the
boundary on the Internet
step 1 find a place that has Wi-Fi

freedom to choose securing your data and
blocking ad pop-ups butterfly VPN the
smallest and lightest VPN device in the
market where bio life and today we're
out to redesign a classic outdoor
wearable and see it in a whole new light
introducing the bio light headlamp an
ultra thin 330 lumen USB rechargeable
headlamp featuring 3d slim fit
construction
that makes your hands-free light wildly
capable and so comfortable you'll forget
you're wearing it
the 3d slim fit construction is based on
three dimensions of a perfect fit
a flush front better balance and smart
fabrics seamlessly integrated housing
merges the electronics directly into the
band creating an ultra-thin front that
sits flush on your forehead with no
bouncing by reorienting the battery to
the back we keep the weight off the
front of your face
reducing slippage and creating a more
natural fit and the entire headlamp
features moisture wicking fabric that
keeps you cool and dry during activity
clocking in at only 69 grams the
headlamp features four modes and the
ability to control your light through
easy dim ability one-handed articulation
enables your light to move with you
without any disruption with easy
recharging via microUSB and run times of
up to 40 hours you can ditch the battery
swaps and power up with the bio light
energy ecosystem we're thrilled to be
back on Kickstarter and this time we're
doing things a little differently
not only will all headlamp backers
receive a free Lantern stuff sacks
you'll also get your headlamp by Holiday
2018 one more time free Lantern stuff
sack that transforms your headlamp into
an overhead light and delivery by this
holiday season a design in the making
for over three years this is a true
passion project for the bio light team
and we're here to ask for your support
in making it a success the headlamp
world is crowded and controlled by some
big names we all know and with your help
we can shine a light on fresh designs
and new solutions and introduce a
wearable that's actually wearable and as
always a violate a portion of every
project we launched gets reinvested in
our work in
Africa bringing safe affordable lighting
to families living off-grid meet a
headlamp that feels great stays put and
gets the job done wherever you may be
Bacchus today and get it by holiday
this is a smart safe remember going out
of town for a few days
before we're just having guests over we
like to keep our valuables hidden secure
smart saves our line of products
designed to look like everyday household
objects but are actually hidden
compartments we tried other safes and
they were either way too big and bulky
or they just took way too long to get
into which can be a problem when storing
objects you need daily access to like
jewelry or prescription medication the
vent fits between two studs which makes
it easy for anyone to install smart
safes use your phone to open up and they
give you a variety of ways to access
your safe different open options allow
me to customize my level of security
oh and if you don't have a smartphone or
you just don't want to use one you can
always use your RFID card to open up the
app keeps track every time we're smart
States used now you know who opens your
safe and wet the shelves come in a
variety of colors and styles which makes
the easy to find the one that matches
your home
now your valuables are locked and
secured well conveniently accessible
hidden in plain sight hi I'm Luke and
this is my dad Mike and we are the
creators of smart safes we know everyone
has valuables that they want to lock up
so we've created safes that are
affordable convenient and practical in
the past you may have seen our safes
that use RFID keys only we now want to
start using our smartphones and utilize
the technology that comes with them
please back us today to help us complete
this project thank you for your support
and be safe when I had the initial idea
several years ago it was about
developing the best product for your
daily commute it started with a passion
for electric mobility and now we've
founded a company and we've developed an
entire vehicle thermal turbo is a small
light and foldable electric vehicle it
is self balancing very easy to steer and
it's the perfect solution for your last
mile in your city self balancing
vehicles totally makes sense they are
very easy to learn
you just stand on and most people just
need 2 to 5 minutes to learn how to ride
it
and if you suddenly find yourself in
front of some stairs simply pick it up
and carry it and since it's so compact
you can take it on a train nowadays with
the trend of urbanization traffic in
cities gets worse and worse first part
of your journey to the city with your
car is rather quickly but when you enter
the city it comes almost to a complete
stop this is where mo comes into play
you can take mo in the car with you you
will arrive at your destination much
faster and of course happier when you
enter your company in the morning you
can use mo to skip all these long
hallways and just drive from the
entrance to your desk in a few moments
with one lift and within two seconds the
Irmo transforms from fully functional
electric vehicle to just briefcase size
so how did we achieve the low weight
well one part of the story is to use
advanced materials such as carbon fiber
and aircraft grade aluminum another part
is we developed all our electronics in
the last two and a half years from
scratch so we developed our own main
boards our own battery modules and so on
at the end of the day Emma's not only a
clever vehicle it's also fun to drive
drive of Mo wherever you want on the
street and curb or cobblestone mo goes
up to 15 km/h and is created for your
hands to be free if you feel
uncomfortable with the balance there's
always the possibility to add an
additional handlebar and still have your
hands-free for the coffee to go when you
come home after a long day just plug mo
into any power outlet and after 2 hours
it will be ready for your commute the
next day it or move with three founders
figs Jacob are the engineers and in
charge of the mechanical an electronical
development of mo sebastian takes care
of the business and the financing part
today there's a whole team behind animal
and working in our vision we have
partners and suppliers from all over the
industries and we rarely have the chance
to change mobility together with the
rest of the team we're really sure to
bring our mo to you as fast as possible
our vision is to bring the mo in every
city of the world and to ramp up our
production we need your support pack us
now and be part of our vision to change
urban mobility</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
