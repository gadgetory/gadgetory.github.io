food goes through a long journey which
can take months even years before it
reaches our kitchens every food has its
own story so fooling it understanding
where the products come from it's a
beautiful thing well y'all enjoy
deliciously served meals with fresh
ingredients the recent study from Oxford
University shows that artfully presented
food actually tastes better we combined
our skills to create something useful
memorable and we would enjoy having it
allowed speciali the walnut cutting
board with a removable built in premium
Damascus knife that spins around the
board and makes cutting easier for years
the hunt for the right knife had had us
wondering about that perfect blade that
would work its way through all types of
food items perfectly we got our hands on
Damascus steel a historical meadow with
a wavy surface pattern hammered out with
steel and iron and molded into your
motion perfect kitchen experience and we
picked the most preferred wood for
cutting boards by professional chefs the
walnut which the cunning board has been
carved out of is of the finest grain
selected for its durability and for the
splendor that it brings to speciality
these two facts combined have led to the
development of a unique knife and
cutting board solution that allows for
ease of cutting chopping each slicing
dicing and even peeling of delicious
foods such as fruits vegetables cheeses
breads meats and more for presenting
them in an appealing manner with
speciality cutting board every chop and
slice will be fast and straight cut as
professional chefs do the idea behind
speciality is green sophistication and
ambience together which will amaze
friends and bring something special to
any of our demas this knife can rotate
around the board and does not just work
its way up and down but right and left
as well we spent a lot of hours finding
a way to attach a custom knife at a
walnut cutting board that spins it
around we finally developed a built-in
brass pin we made the brass pin and
knife removable so when any of the parts
need to be cleaned including the knife
and pin will be able to unassembled the
whole system is incredibly intuitive the
knife swiveling along the surface of the
cutting board in order to reach any food
item that you place on it when we
designed our knife we didn't want to
have the unnatural plastic handle so
that's why we used fine goes wood in our
knives
the idea is to give value to good
quality food and using it with enjoyment
if you're happy when you're cooking your
food is gonna be happy and it's gonna be
more delicious our 17 inches long
Damascus knife can be easily separated
from the cutting board for cutting extra
large items whether it's delicious pizza
or a gigantic watermelon make an
unforgettable impression on your guests
they will not stop asking you questions
about your special a cutting board we
know that there are a host and hostesses
all around the world just we need to get
something like this into their homes we
are very excited to bring specially to
your home and hope you want to please
