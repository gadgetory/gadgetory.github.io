Wi-Fi routers are dumb machines and they
make us act like dumb people and I try
to plug in it for 30 seconds yes we
unplugged it these machines worked just
fine a decade ago when I only had one
computer but now my house is more
connected devices and I can even count
I want a modern Wi-Fi network that's
reliable and consistent wherever I am in
house a network that's fast and secure a
network that keeps kids like my nephew
out of harm's way
enter luma an intelligent Wi-Fi system
that actually delivers on the promise of
fast reliable internet it surrounds you
with Wi-Fi using technology that was
previously only available to large
companies you put one here another one
there immediately you're up and running
we call it surround Wi-Fi luma is smart
enough to know things like what devices
you're using what networks are
interfering and where potential problem
spots are or to make smart decisions to
get you the fastest data everywhere and
of course no network should be without a
good security system
I can easily grant people access to my
network and just as easily revoke it
speaking of that I can rest easy knowing
that luma has modern parental controls
so I can limit the kid to G level
website monitor make sure you that up to
any shenanigans I can even set time
limits or pause the internet like during
dinner time yay awesome here I'll plug
this in
I love you speed safety security this is
the future I was promised this is luma
hi I'm Taylor founder of nose at
sleeping bag
even the best dipper snag so we came up
with a better solution magnets
that's right magnet we've married
magnets with sleeping bags magnets
provides a simple consistent and
effective closure system getting all
tucked in tonight is a snap these
puppies are strong enough to keep you
tucked in all night but convenient
enough to break out for those late-night
emergencies limiting the most annoying
part of sleeping bags is zippers to
preserve that bad
nobody asked you wanted Roo okay so we
did more than just eliminate zippers
we're able to tackle another sleeping
bag issue what we call comfortable
temperature range or CT are basically
boiled down to a bags ability to keep
you comfortable in a variety of weather
condition think of a zero Degree bag an
hour after sunup in the summer it gets
hot mighty fat or if you're sleeping
near a bag of extreme limit you might
not die but you're not going to be happy
about it how did we address this with
more magnets with more magnets of course
by adding an extra row of magnets that
line up interchangeably we've been able
to create the first ever sleeping bag
that can change its shape based on user
preference mummy mode roomy mode open
mode
this is awesome because at non extreme
temperatures it gives you lower room and
it's easier to dump heat all of which
grant you faster access to sleepy town
but no zip bag is the ideal one bag
solution because it protects you during
the extreme temperatures but doesn't
overheat you the rest of the time oh and
it doesn't have any being outdoors is
awesome and staying here should be
awesome too
the last thing you want to do is fumble
with something you assumed was easy
we've made it easy with your support of
the backer this project will be a
success I'm an avid camper and traveler
but I'm also a professional engineer and
I've guided mega projects from design to
reality we've assembled an elite team to
support us in manufacturing sourcing and
logistics and we're ready to execute and
get you inside the nose that sleeping
bag so we're coming back here today
heads up and let's go on a adventure
together
hi I'm Frank Harrington and this is
outdoor Tex biggest baddest do anything
go anywhere wireless boombox the big
turtle shell it's really loved like
rattle your teeth shatter the fish tank
honestly bro I can't hear you loud the
big turtle shell wirelessly connects
with your phone or any other Bluetooth
enabled device and has a range of 32
feet pairing happens by pressing and
holding the multifunction button for
five seconds which may seem like a long
time but think about how long you spent
reading tweets about people eating
sandwiches today the other two buttons
control track and volume on top of this
we included two grab handles a built-in
microphone for phone call functionality
and it's IP X 6 rated water-resistant
thus proof and shockproof casing so you
don't have to worry when Kenny Powers
straps it to a speeding jetski and
shoots roman candles at it while you're
calling in sick it cool it so what we're
getting at is that the occasional splash
will do no harm it's basically a water
resistant opera house minus the value no
opera we thought about you when we
designed the big turtle shell so not
only can you use it in its normal flat
position to blasts multi-directional
audio but we made sure that you can
achieve a more directional sound by
designing the big turtle shell to be
able to chill in an upright position on
its side so it's a real-life turtle that
can do that and I mean we'll really be
impressed
oh yeah since ODT went ahead and put a
battery in there that has three times
more power than the big jambox you'll be
sure to play music longer than you can
party and they figured hey might as well
put all that power to use so the big
turtle has a built-in USB port and
functions as a power bank so you can
charge your iphones ipads samsung galaxy
and GoPros a whole bunch of times
not only is the big turtle shell the
perfect tool for the skatepark the
bonfire
the pool party and your romantic camping
trip with your buddies it is also the
right tool of choice for the zombie
apocalypse to keep your swag all charged
up the big turtle show wireless boombox
is some stuff you probably want so you
know the go buy it and rock out and
whatnot
in
a cake
is
Hey
pity
you
Oh
stylus take better smartphone photos
hi my name is Thomas Chen I'm with
stylus and today I'm going to introduce
you to the stylus camera kit to install
the case is very easy all you need to do
is slide your phone in and then attach
the bottom piece and screw it down
looking at our case we have a very
screen protector friendly design we have
cutouts so you can have access to all
your original ports and buttons and we
also have a flip-out kickstand on the
back that allows you to set it down and
watch your movie the unique part of our
case is the removable disk on the back I
can take this disc off which opens up my
kids to a world of possibilities one of
our attachment is our revolver lens you
can attach this to the back of the case
and this gives you access to four
different types of lenses on your phone
here we have a circular polarizing
filter which allows you to cut glare on
windows where you can make this guy's
bluer
here we have a fisheye lens which gives
you that really distorted fisheye
wide-angle look next we have a
wide-angle lens which gives you just a
little bit wider field of view if you
remove the wide-angle lens this is our
macro lens a macro lens allows us to get
really close to our subject and really
magnify it
once you're done taking pictures you can
flip the lens back in the case and all
the lenses are protected by the case
you can remove the revolver lens and
return the case back to a slim profile
when you're done taking pictures as you
can see the stylist camera kit is the
first of its kind it's very stylish and
very compact the 4 in 1 revolver lens
allows you to turn your smartphone into
a better camera anytime anywhere</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
