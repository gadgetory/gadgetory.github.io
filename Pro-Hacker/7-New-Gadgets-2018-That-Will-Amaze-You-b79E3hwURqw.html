sensors let you know immediately if
something happens to your car and sends
you an alert with an instant video clip
report and here are a few other cool
things about owl owl is always on even
when your car's off
it's very presence and it's pulsing
security beacon keeps away the lurkers
and the sticky-fingered and since owl is
always recording the cameras will be
rolling even during traffic stops owl
protects you from contentious crashes
because the camera never lies
unlike that guy that were in the
intersection and since whatever does
happen is recorded you can go back and
check it out later whether it's the
weird the wonderful or the outrageous it
all happens all around us when we're
driving and owl captures it all when you
see something you want to share just say
okay presto an owl will send the clip
right to your phone owl sets up in about
five minutes with just a few simple
steps and all video is protected so no
one except you can get to your video
