making super efficient wood-burning
backpacking and camping stoves our
unique patented design doesn't require
any bulky batteries or fans all you need
is a handful of twigs or sticks year
after year we enjoy interacting with the
growing number of solo stove users we're
grateful that they trust our products
enough to take with them on their most
memorable adventures we believe that
time spent outdoors with family and
friends can create some of life's most
precious and meaningful moments but with
our lives becoming busier and busier
spending time with those we care about
is becoming more difficult so we're
making it easier for you to spend more
time with family and friends outdoors
introducing the solo stove bonfire a
backyard fire pit like you've never seen
before the bonfire uses the same
patented design and technology as our
other solo stoves but it's her largest
model yet it's designed with unique
double wall which allows airflow through
the bottom poles of the bonfire to
channel air to the bottom of the fire
and up between the walls this preheated
air allows the fire to burn more
complete which results in a more
efficient fire with very little smoke a
more efficient burn means you'll get
more fire from your logs compared to an
open fire pit the bonfire is super
durable made out of premium 304
stainless steel and is backed by a
lifetime guarantee
we can't wait to bring the soothing
ambience the dancing flames and the
rustic smell of a glowing campfires

hi crowdfunders I'm Jake and I'm the
founder of cinch two years ago Yelp has
been the ultimate pop-up tent to over 30
countries worldwide and the response was
phenomenal
you've proven the crown from them is the
best way to launch an innovative idea of
your feedback we've made even more
improvements I came to you with a vision
for exceptional camping without
compromising you brought my dream to
life all the benefits of a regular 10
plus tons more with none of the
household
I've designed every singe 10 so you can
attach a solar power pack this captures
solar energy on the roof of the tent
channels it inside for a weatherproof
thought to a pocket-sized power bank
which we've upgraded this year to as
three times at the capacity of the
previous model the solar pack is so
versatile
you pal all of the USB powered gadgets
and there were two USB ports to get
power to devices at the same time we
could take the power bank with you on
the move just unplug it and slip it into
your pocket the two entrances each with
their own port banning loads of
functionality you can tailor to your own
needs you need to cinch each entrance
that it's all kind of pee with
detachable poles and new 2016 it's a
super extended canopy which lets us then
you live in space by a negative 4 square
meters
all the kid that's nearly away into the
bag this year each cinch as to cool
safety mode that's hastily inside of the
tent cinch comes in three sizes two and
three four person each one is the
largest in its class and a format with
over six and square meters of living
space
it's the biggest pop up tent in the
world every ten is double skinned to
stop common assertion use advanced
walkthrough fabric which is three times
the industry standard give you extra
protection really wet conditions you
don't want to get to a campsite master
spend ages assembling your tent want to
be able to enjoy yourself straight away
and make the most of being outdoors I
came up with cinch after years are going
to music festivals on camping trips and
never find an attempt to suit my needs I
went through dozens of tents and the big
manufacturers always let me down
they had ventured as an airman our Sun
Goes Down nighttime it just as important
as day since she's fully equipped for
the dark every singe is packed with LED
Tampax to cool torches at the turn into
lanterns
well now add the live affective
guidelines glow-in-the-dark
we designed a blackout canopy there also
regularity super easy to fall in a
matter of seconds in the morning you'll
sleep in the tent as long as you want
still stare cool and comfortable
temperatures instantly takes less than a
minute to pack down to
pop-ups a grave be still on space
comfort and good quality materials the
sort of stuff you get when you spend the
time in putting up a regular tent
I could have found my ideal tent
anywhere so I decided to make it myself
the criteria was non-negotiable light
and easy to carry with everything packed
together Lords of cool features was some
really serious kit underneath easy and
fun but made from the highest quality
materials and built to last in 2014
thanks to you we were able to produce
cinch on a bigger scale than ever before
as a massive success but it's all in the
beginning that jump taught me loads
about the land scale of manufacturing
process made it clear even got even
further the next generation cinch is
ready to go testing is complete and our
manufacturers fully briefed we just need
your help to finish buying materials and
get production underway in return you'll
get a new and improved since before
anyone else in early 2017 some really
cool extras just take a look at the
awards to see what's on offer you have
confirmed my belief that sint is the
ultimate popular 10 must make the
hassled comfy thing of the past give
people an experience to fit the great
outdoors
