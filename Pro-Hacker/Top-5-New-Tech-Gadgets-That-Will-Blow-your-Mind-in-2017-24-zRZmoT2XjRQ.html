we're proud to share with you today a
product we've been developing it's glow
the first smart headphones that glow
with laser light music inherently is a
very expressive medium and having light
synchronize with music makes that whole
experience much better I think that's
where glow really stands out it's a pair
of headphones but it's also something
that builds up that musical expression
through the form of light the first time
we saw fiber and fiber after wire was
really incredible that fiber ends is
just super vibrant it looks like
something I've never seen before like
something magical the inspiration
actually went back to our childhood when
the movie is tweens to watch and it
worked we used to read who is portrayed
lights and lasers and sort of the
teacher the first time we were actually
able to see laser wire in the form of
fibrous wire and we got the idea that
maybe we can use this to actually create
a product with it and that's where we
thought the idea of a headphone because
that's sort of a natural connection of
the glowing wire with the pair of
headphones and have the wire too low to
the music with glow we've actually
provided five buttons to be able to
control your musics prior headphone
designs don't give you that flexibility
they're a lot more complicated they
don't have a single button below has a
tight integration with the Android
platform so we're able to use and
leverage that platform to do very cool
things for example I could take a
picture by hitting the center button or
I could even trigger Google now and use
voice actions to control my phone your
wasn't enough that we built an
expressive here at headphones
we wanted the audio quality to be
absolutely amazing
we've come up with a lot of impunity
designs such as the negative profile
which allows you to even take a nap with
your headphones we also chose a in-ear
design because it minimizes the external
interference of sound which allows the
music to be a lot more crisp and have
deeper bass over the last few months
we've been building a fully working
prototype and we're there but now we
need your help to take glow from a
prototype to final manufacturing to be
able to bring this to market it's not
enough that we have a fully working
prototype we need the backing of the
community we need the Kickstarter
community
