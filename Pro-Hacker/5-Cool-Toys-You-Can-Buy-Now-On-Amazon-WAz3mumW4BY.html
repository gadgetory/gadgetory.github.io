yo what up I'm cutting that see sting
commands tell that worked
look a new friend show up
you guys doing is sampling of a shark
right
another day another drive
Sam that was a great run
and the crowd goes wild hey Dad cover
your car that's all now it's done okay
time to watch a pro
kakaw wait what we were just getting to
my favorite part hunky overdrive uses
robotics and AI create a product
experience that feels like magic but
what do we mean when we say the cars
have artificial intelligence the comic
comes with three important systems
positioning reasoning and execution you
can think of positioning as how the cars
know where they are on the track in Anki
overdrive every car is equipped with a
dedicated processor and an infrared
camera five hundred times a second the
cars adjust their steering and power to
stay on course scanning patterns encoded
in the tracks and sending that data to
the players device the supercars now
have a complete understanding of their
environment so they can start planning
their next moves the sophisticated AI
engine infuses each commander's
personality into every aspect of the
game it then stimulates thousands of
possible driving actions taking into
account virtual upgrades as well as the
physical properties of the cars and
track once it identifies the best course
of action it moves on to the next phase
execution the players device sends the
final instruction to the AI car in this
case the AI decide to hit the gas pull
ahead of ground shop in a typical game
our AI can consider well over 50,000
possible actions think you can outsmart
it
