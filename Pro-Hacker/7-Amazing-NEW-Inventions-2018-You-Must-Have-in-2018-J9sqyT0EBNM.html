something that we're all familiar with
what we're not familiar with is the
danger and the driver behind you that
can't gauge when you're slowing down
about a year ago we set out on a purpose
to make riding your bike safer we did
this from a driver's point of view and
as everyday driver I noticed this and
it's very difficult for me to gauge when
the cyclists in front of me is slowing
down
by using multiple accelerometers coupled
with smart algorithms the light goes
from a blinking pattern to a full
intensity solid
we call our bike light loosened and it's
designed and made in California machined
from a single piece of aluminum so this
keeps the bike light extremely light
while also making it extremely durable
this is where you come in we already
have prototypes in the field being
tested so that we can make listen even
better what we need to do now is ramp up
production so that we can drop the cost
and make urban cycling safer
introducing the Simtek smart sensor
reinventing security for the things that
you care about it's a small light motion
detector that alerts you when someone
gets into your things every day millions
of guns and other valuables are
supposedly secure in things like closets
jewelry boxes gun safes and storage
units but who's watching your stuff when
you're not around and how do you truly
know it's safe every year up to six
hundred thousand guns are stolen and
many are used in suicide accidents and
crimes despite the growing popularity of
gun safes here are the problems colonel
arms are designed for houses and not
saves gun owners don't want smart
technology that could restrict the use
of their firearms I decided to change
that and that's why I developed Simtek a
simple and effective way to monitor any
enclosed space like your gun save the
moment your safe is opened Simtek sends
you a text alert over a cellular
connection which is more reliable than
Bluetooth or Wi-Fi it's an extra layer
of security for the things that you care
about it's sleek and portable and it
uses infrared motion and light so there
are no false positives a common problem
for other sensors the battery can last a
full year on a single charge and because
it uses cellular connection you can take
it anywhere in the world without
additional setup I created sim tech to
help people understand what's going on
with their guns and their valuables
someone close to me almost took their
life with a gun and as an alumni of
Virginia Tech I understand all too well
what can happen when guns get into the
wrong hands my gun running friends tell
me that there's no easy way to reliably
monitor their saves but nobody wants a
product that could potentially restrict
the use of their guns and that's why I
developed sim tech a smart sensor that
can be used anywhere in anything to help
keep you and your things safe gun owners
around the country have been testing sim
tech and we've received great feedback
Engineering and design are complete and
we're ready for mass production
so back us today and know when your
belongings are accessed wherever they're
stored
the spaces we inhabit impact our lives
every moment of everyday as humans what
surrounds us defines us our productivity
our creativity our happiness so
shouldn't our spaces be regulated with
something just as versatile as we are
glass as a thermos
it's daily reporting provides the
insights needed to create the perfect
atmosphere for your business your home
the places you want to visit the places
you need to visit lass knows when you're
in the room and when you're not last
constantly monitors indoor and outdoor
air quality and intelligently changes
its settings making it capable of
providing leading energy savings and
what's behind the innovation Microsoft
and Johnson Controls
IOT core Cortana voice activation in
Microsoft Azure glasses built on
Microsoft Technology and brought to life
by Johnson Controls
a beautiful combination of Technology
and aesthetics glass was designed to
make our spaces ours
Johnson Controls redefined the
thermostat
Microsoft redefined the possibilities
you
my name is Joey Mucha and I'm San
Francisco technology entrepreneur and
skee-ball champion I'm one of the first
super hosts on Airbnb the process of
swapping a key with a guest is very
cumbersome and time-consuming so using
lockitron was mesmerizing when I put
that thing on my front door and it was
able to unlock directly from my phone
with just the tap of a button
our latest lockitron product is bolt and
bolt is essentially taking all the
elements from the previous locket ron's
and putting them into a smaller more
robust elegant package and we're
actually able to offer that at a better
price point when you open the app you're
presented with a simple lock unlock
button what you also have is an activity
log so this shows you who's come and
gone you can check to see if your
roommates home it also has ability to
add and remove guests you just tap a
button next to your friend's name and
suddenly they have a key for the weekend
I've had a guest come stay with me and I
wasn't even the same state I was in
Arizona and I let them in remotely from
my phone using lockitron the latest
version of lockitron consists of two
products bolt and bridge bolt is a
Bluetooth low-energy replacement door
lock bridge will connect your lockitron
to the internet which gives you the
capability to say be in London and
unlock your door for someone at your
apartment in San Francisco we have a
vibrant developer community that's
making SmartWatch applications for their
pebble for their I watch for their
Android watch one of the guys at pebble
built this application that you can just
do a fist bump with your pebble and
it'll ox your door you look at the
successful technologies of the past 20
years and the only thing that works is
things that enable people to work better
with other people if lockitron went away
I would be devastated it would be a
total bummer I have shown it off so many
times and it impresses so many my
friends and my guests I think the only
thing better than lockitron is rolling a
perfect game of skee-ball I'm Cameron
I'm Paul this is lockitron</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
