Wi-Fi routers are dumb machines and they
make us act like dumb people yes we
unplugged it these machines worked just
fine a decade ago when I only had one
computer but now my house is more
connected devices and I can even count
I want a modern Wi-Fi network that's
reliable and consistent wherever I am in
the house a network that's fast
secure a network that keeps kids like my
nephew out of harm's way
enter luma an intelligent Wi-Fi system
that actually delivers on the promise of
fast reliable internet it surrounds you
with Wi-Fi using technology that was
previously only available to large
companies you put one here another one
there immediately you're up and running
we call it surround Wi-Fi luma is smart
enough to know things like what devices
you're using what networks are
interfering and where potential problem
spots are so it can make smart decisions
to get you the fastest data everywhere
and of course no network should be
without a good security system
I can easily grant people access to my
network and just as easily revoke it
speaking of that I can rest easy knowing
that luma has modern parental controls
so I can limit the kid to g-level
websites and monitor to make sure he's
not up to any shenanigans I can even set
time limits or pause the internet like
during dinner time yay awesome yeah I'll
put this in
