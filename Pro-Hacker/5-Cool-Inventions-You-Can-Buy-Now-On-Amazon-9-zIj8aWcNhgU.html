Wi-Fi routers are dumb machines and they
make us act like dumb people yes we
unplugged it these machines worked just
fine a decade ago when I only had one
computer but now my house is more
connected devices and I can even count
I want a modern Wi-Fi network that's
reliable and consistent wherever I am in
the house a network that's fast
secure a network that keeps kids like my
nephew out of harm's way
enter luma an intelligent Wi-Fi system
that actually delivers on the promise of
fast reliable internet it surrounds you
with Wi-Fi using technology that was
previously only available to large
companies you put one here another one
there immediately you're up and running
we call it surround Wi-Fi luma is smart
enough to know things like what devices
you're using what networks are
interfering and where potential problem
spots are so it can make smart decisions
to get you the fastest data everywhere
and of course no network should be
without a good security system
I can easily grant people access to my
network and just as easily revoke it
speaking of that I can rest easy knowing
that luma has modern parental controls
so I can limit the kid to g-level
websites and monitor to make sure he's
not up to any shenanigans I can even set
time limits or pause the internet like
during dinner time yay awesome yeah I'll
put this in
I love you speed safety security this is
the future I was promised
this is luma
cycling is fun extremely fun
however for cyclists safety always comes
first as crazy cycling fans we
understand all the problems that you may
or have already encountered during your
ride that's why we made the live all
bling helmet the smartest bicycle helmet
for safety live all has many features
that can simplify your ride and keep you
safe the LED outline lights on top of
the helmet will make you stand out in
the night while the taillights will
indicate directions for your fellow
teammates never worry about falling
behind anymore find the shiny helmets
and you will find the team the built-in
Bluetooth speaker and mic enable you to
take phone calls or communicate with
teammates directly using the
walkie-talkie function and of course you
can listen to music with bling helmet
and cycle to the beats if the built-in
gravity sensor senses an internal strike
SOS signals will be displayed on the
helmet in emergency contacts will be
alerted automatically we call this
multifunctional remote-control bling J
it can simply be mounted on the bike and
is very easy to use bling jet will
connect to both your phone and bling
helmet so you can use it to control the
lights on the helmet use the
walkie-talkie take incoming calls or
play your favorite songs beside that we
designed a live all phone holder so you
can easily take your phone the phone
holder also contains a battery so it can
also be used to charge your phone
no more running out of power during your
rides the best part of the live all
products is to live all riding act
it's compatible with different wearable
devices to measure and display different
parameters of your body or your ride
it measures slope rate gradient altitude
cadence speed etc and shows the stats
directly on your phone
we've also invented the live all Nano
cadence sensor the smallest single unit
cadence sensor in the world besides
analysing your ride the live all riding
app can also be used to take photos or
shoot short videos by processing the
photo taking button on bling jet with
all this awesome looking data and
fantastic photos or videos will help you
to map your unique rode book and share
on social media platforms we spent a lot
of time to design the live all products
and are using materials of the best
quality we've already gone through all

produce the bling helmet and the bling
jet and small amounts the product is
