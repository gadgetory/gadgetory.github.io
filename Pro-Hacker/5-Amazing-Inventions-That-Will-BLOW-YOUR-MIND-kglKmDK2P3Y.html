two years ago I got my flu science
degree from Cornell University as a real
foodie I enjoy cooking trial of my own
herbs but it was so hard for me and then
I realized that a lot of people have the
same issue to solve this problem my
friends and I spent a whole year to
develop this machine Nitra box as a
botanist I believe the centralization
we're also hiring agriculture field to
control the girl environment the
hydroponic technique and other soilless
cultivation methods become find in
nature bugs
currently we are applying patent for the
growth matrix we develop it as an
industrial designer I have developed the
inner structure of the product and also
an application in your cell phone so you
can easily control your plans in a more
accurate and accessible way as an
interior designer I design the product
look to fit it into the home environment
and I try these herbs they are way more
flavorful than the ones you see in the
market now we finished the Rd process
for naturebox and it's just the one step
away from mass production all we need is
your support</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
