let's talk about taking the perfect
photo first compose the shot
check the histogram adjust the exposure
focus on your subject confuse the
hyperfocal distance to keep everything
sharp enable bracketing to get more
dynamic range and a neutral density
filter update the exposure and then take
the shot we built a better way
today's DSLR and mirrorless cameras have
amazing optics and sensor but they do
very little to actually help you take a
good photo
finding the right test involves a series
of complex techniques and formulas as an
engineer with a background in artificial
intelligence I knew I could build a tool
to simplify the process I wanted
something that would let me focus on the
composition but would handle the details
for me so I created arsonist the world's
first AI photography assistant with one
tap arsenal find settings take the best
photo possible
Arsenal's AI searches thousands of
images in its database to suggest good
settings next it fine Tunes the
suggestions by analyzing 18 different
factors Arsenal uses state-of-the-art
machine learning to help you take a
great photo in any condition
Oh
many of the memorable shots you see
today are captured by combining multiple
exposures through a labor-intensive
process called photo second with Arsenal
you can do this in seconds to capture
all the details and seams with high
dynamic range get everything in sharp
focus and create long exposures without
buying expensive filters using these
advanced techniques Arsenal lets you go
beyond the limitations of your camera
sensor or lint four times when you want
complete control you can wirelessly
adjust manual settings see a live
preview and trigger the shutter all from
up to 100 feet away
Arsenal also improves the experience of
reviewing photos in the field you can
flip through the photos on your camera
zoom in to check out details at full
resolution then share your favorite
photos right from your phone and finally
Arsenal makes it easy to capture
stunning time-lapse
it automatically adjusts the exposure in
changing lights giving you a smooth
day-to-night transition you can even
watch a high-def preview of your
time-lapse while it's being taken
whether you're a pro who is already
mastered manual shooting or you just
bought your first DSLR Arsenal can help
take your photography to the next level
so before you replace your gear try
upgrading your techniques with Arsenal
Arsenal is already being tested in the
field now I need your help to ramp up
production by supporting our campaign

art we've got exclusive rewards for our

amazing photos of you

steady cinematic videos at a breeze with
Reid yet simply slide in your phone or
GoPro and turn it on and all the
creation is at your fingertips for many
stabilisers it is impossible to record
videos using the underslung position

region continue to record the video in
this position with it's easy to use
control panel you can easily switch
between photos and video mode front and
rear camera and zoom in and out
bridgitte can also charge your phone or
