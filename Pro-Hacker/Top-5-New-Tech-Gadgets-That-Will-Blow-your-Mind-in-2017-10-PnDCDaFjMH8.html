this is power up by homing fast
lightweight and contacts more than just
a macbook charger power up has one USB
see data connector and three additional
USB a slots that let you think and
charge more devices say goodbye to the
mountain of chargers power up allows you
to charge your macbook just like the
Apple charger but you can also connect
your other devices like your iPhone iPad
and Apple watch and what's more without
connecting to macbook power up is a
standalone charging station that
provides two times faster charging speed
get more charge on more devices in less
time as a hub power up provides a
lightning fast five gigabyte per second
data transfer speed that syncs your
documents photos and music faster than
ever and you won't be limited by the new
macbook USB C port
unlike other devices power up is durable
and safe to use with specially designed
copper cooling fins to prevent
overheating during use no more carrying
around tons of dongles and chargers or
even losing them travel light and be
more organized isn't it time you went
from this to this get power up with a
pledge of just $69 that's the same price
as a standard apple macbook charger so
why not just go with power up the
world's smartest macbook charger keep it
simple with power
what if we could design a case to
protect your throne in any environment
where would you take it
hi I'm Andrew and on that we're the
founders of pro shop the iPhone 6 once
again set a new standard for portable
video recording devices this has become
a one-stop device for our lot but it's
fragile can break and shatter most
importantly not waterproof so we created
pro shot we want to give people the
confidence patient phone everywhere with
the pro shot case you can capture the
most exciting moments of your life
whether you're on the top of the
mountain scuba diving and crazy
we spent the last year engineering the
most waterproof iphone case available
our highest priority was to make it 100%
waterproof and durable without
sacrificing style the shell is made from
a polycarbonate and ABS blend and sealed
with three aluminum Clips around an
airtight silicon gasket we've developed
an app that allows you to control your
camera's functionality using the volume
buttons on your phone the minus button
cycles through mode between video slow
motion and photographic mode and the top
button allows you to take photographs
and videos pro shot can be easily
mounted on a wide range of accessories
on almost every surface
we design a case it's perfect for
everyone well for the SS there's no need
to justify spending $400 on our new
camera use that money to book a flight
bring a pro shot and never miss that
shot again
it is incredible how much we rely on
weather forecasts and so-called local
temperatures the truth is that those
values available online or through apps
come from weather stations that can
easily be dozens of miles away
nothing beats measuring the values by
yourself right where you are but that's
just not possible and silly so we have
created the world's smallest weather
station that can easily fit in your palm
simply plug weather point into your
device and start the app simple as that
it consists of four sensors to
temperature humidity atmospheric
pressure and ultraviolet radiation with
this information you can have the most
accurate weather forecast anywhere you
are also by measuring atmospheric
pressure you can know your altitude more
precisely than GPS devices you can also
measure UV radiation and limit your
exposure to these harmful UV rays the
housing is made from aluminium and
titanium and ensures longer life time
when you're not using weather point it
is safely placed on your keychain so you
don't have to worry about losing it
where the point doesn't use a battery
well who likes them anyway it doesn't
even require internet connection the
building hardware is costly we invested
a lot of resources into making weather
point possible and now we need your
support to make it available and
affordable for everyone thank you
you
the best camera is always the camera
which you have with you phone is in your
pocket all the time thank that makes
what opportunities pop up all day long
you
different
you
Hey
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
