measurement is an essential part of home
improvement however the measuring tools
have not got any radical innovation for
decades the measuring tape has a limited
range and you have to worry about
sagging and miss reading when the
distance gets long you have to use a
marking flag or need an extra hand
the laser measuring tool is limited for
single purpose use it is not even able
to measure a table because there is no
target to reflect off the laser Arum one
is the first AR multifunctional
measuring device that actually works it
is way better than any other measuring
tools available in the market and it is
super easy to use let's start with
measuring a straight line simply attach
Arum one to your smartphone it generates
a precise laser beam use it to point at
the start of the line tap the button
then point at the end and tap the button
again that's it the line and the
dimension are shown on the screen as we
use the augmented reality technology you
can walk around while the line and
dimension are still displayed in the
original place next let's measure a
circle use the laser beam to specify any
three points on the circle now we get
the diameter radius circumference and
the centers location Arum one can be
used to measure angles use the laser
beam to determine the sides and the
endpoint now we have the degree arrow
one is also a leveling and marking tool
for example if you plan to hang two
pictures on the wall and want them to be
centered horizontally you can easily get
it done with era 1 specify a line along
the wall it will ask you how many equal
segments you want in this case we choose
three now we have two vertical reference
lines passing through the tri section
points switch to leveling function
create a horizontal reference line on
the wall now you can hang the pictures
based on these reference lines
precision is our top priority
Arum one has the precision of plus minus
1.5 millimeters within 20 meters range
to achieve this level of accuracy Aaron
one uses a series of sophisticated
technologies there are a few a are
measuring apps on the market however if
you have ever tried them you would find
out that they are just a concept demo as
they all depend on the software hit test
results the precision is not reliable at
all arrow one uses fda-approved laser
module with 40 meters measure range
built-in lithium ion battery provides
enough power for one thousand times
measurement with a single charge using
Aaron one is so simple and intuitive the
idea of measuring in this way is what we
are all familiar with we have waited for
a long time until the technology gets
here and it's real now Macs are really
cool computers but if you need to run
