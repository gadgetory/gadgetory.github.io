tempest cope I released the first
tempest code three years ago as an open
source project when I was looking for
ways to feel the tropical skies in my
daily life and ever since I received
overwhelming interest from people all
over the world which is why we're
excited to announce our first campaign
to actually get the tempest grip into
your hands our team consists of
engineers and designers based in Tokyo
and we now have everything we need
other than the actual fun to get Jen
into mass production
I really need your help to get this
exciting new product into reality so
thank you very much for your support
when you're away it's easier to live in
the moment knowing that everything is
okay at home but if you had the power to
always know for sure butterfly is a leap
forward for the connected home it's more
than the next generation security camera
it's a whole new way to experience and
interact with your home inside butterfly
is a technology to know what's going on
around it but at the heart of butterfly
is something unlike any other home
security a powerful computer then learns
and makes decisions based on what it
sees and hears that way it only records
when there's something going on that you
need to see it can learn a unique rhythm
of your home and realize when something
is out of the ordinary it can also
detect familiar faces and tell the
difference between humans and pets
but if I becomes an extension of able to
know what's more MORE
that way you only get alerts but it
really matters
with the top of a finger you're
instantly in two places at once
the butterfly app is a portal into your
home when you're away and sorts the
moments into an interactive timeline
that's like a curated newsfeed of what
you missed when you were gone what if I
was designed to look like a natural and
elegant part of your home and it's Wire
free so it can be placed where you need
it
instead of where your power outlets are
traditional home security systems are
just not practical they're expensive
complicated to setup and difficult to
use
so we reimagine what a security camera
could be and then set out to make it our
team has been developing butterfly for
the past two years building a powerful
device that's reliable and easy to use
right out of the box when they're using
it to protect your family pets or
property butterfly keeps you in touch
and helps keep them safe we're excited
to share this new technology with you
join us in bringing simple home security
everyone be one of the first to
experience butterfly and a whole new way
of connecting with your home and no bee
pollination is essential for a third of
the food we eat but we lost 42 percent
of bee colonies last year there's a
movement of backyard and urban
beekeepers who want to make a difference
and save the bees we created a
technology to help them here's how it
works
we attached a camera to a small but
powerful computer that lets us visually
monitor what goes on out of
beehive all day every day we developed
an algorithm to track B flight activity
and translate hours of video to an easy
visual real-time summary we found that
healthy colonies have a unique happy
activity pattern and we can measure that
happy over time not just flight activity
with the signature of the flight
activity gives you a ROI interesting
window into what's going on in that
colony of that in real time just moving
our understanding of nature forward
using high-tech
for very low-tech and natural situations
which is very cool it also lets you
share the joy and importance of bees
remotely without internal eyes and eyes
watches your bees for you all day every
day it helps you see when something is
wrong so you can do something about it
in time with its revolutionary tool
because we've never had a tool like it
before but it means that basic than the
bees are gonna live here we're excited
about what's possible when eyes on
highest measures bee health on a big
scale please pledge to help us support
beekeepers and the bees
thank you
or tack up a family buy company for the
last seven years we've been creating
bike strollers that are loved and
enjoyed all around the globe this is our
latest project and we do not hesitate
when we say this is the next step in the
evolution of family bikes see three
years ago we searched for our next
project we turn to a lot of people and
ask them what they would want in a
family life some answers were strange
you make it fly somewhere i opening
young babies should be facing their
parents and some were just adorable we
listened and set out to create the
ultimate family bike for two years
remade sketches prototypes studied
materials carried out experiments and
explored every aspect of family bike
should have basically we reinvented the
family bike this is the taiga 2.0 the
most comfortable safe easy to ride
practical and just all-around coolest
value like you could possibly imagine
the targa 2 has everything our customers
wanted and much more safety first
Tonga has three wheels so it's
inherently stable the cargo box
materials are super strong plastics with
a metal frame inside that makes the
seating area durable and resistant to
impact the child seats themselves have
endless features and options
tige can take one or two kits facing
forwards backwards or facing each other
or a boatload of laps to keep it
versatile in seconds taka two turns from
a family bike into a lockable cargo bike
with extra load space on top we use this
brakes and a Shimano gear and you can
always easily turn it into an electric
bike for effortless long distance rides
now for the fun part apart from the wind
in their hair we wanted the kids to have
a truly enjoyable adventure on our bikes
so we added the accessory bar which you
can attach a variety of fun add-ons yes
there's also a water gun and when it
rains or if the kids just want some
privacy
there's the royal canopy let's see what
else no it can't fly yet but it can all
be taken apart to fit in your car truck
oh and the seats come in a variety of
colors because you know the personal
touch transforms our own ultimate bike
into your own ultimate fighter last but
certainly not least the price while
creating the Targa - we never forgot the
one thing everyone asked make it
affordable make it affordable so we did
because to turn the family bike trend
into a real revolution we had to make it
accessible for everyone
whether you use it for a weekend trip a
drop-off
for shopping or to carry your loyal
friends pataga too is an ideal solution
our company has a proven track record so
this is one of those projects you can
back safely we need your help to make
this piece of family on a reality so
backed agha and help us make the
ultimate family bond
tada
you
