show you just how easy it is to start
monitoring controlling and securing your
home from anywhere with the brand-new
Samsung smartthings home modern kit come
on in the home monitoring kit helps you
rest easy by letting you know the answer
to one simple question is everything
okay at home
inside you'll find the smartthings hub
two multi-purpose sensors a motion
sensor and an outlet the first thing you
want to do is to download the free smart
things app for iOS Android or Windows
Phone then you'll create an account and
select your region next into your hub
six-digit welcome code here's a tip it's
located under your hubs tray in the Box
there are three simple steps to set up
your home monitoring kit the first step
is to set up the hub you can start by
installing the four double A batteries
that came with your kit into the hub
these will keep your hub active for up
to 10 hours and working in the case of a
power and internet outage now you're
ready to connect your hub which is as
easy as plugging in the two cords that
came in the box the ethernet cable and
the power supply the app will not prompt
you to give your home a name
this can be Karl or Jerome or really
anything but you'll probably just want
to call it my house or my home you also
be able to set up something called a
geofence this is a custom range around
your home that can trigger smart things
to perform different actions when your
phone enters and leaves this area and
look at that success now let's connect
your smart devices and give this home
some brains
step 2 is connecting your things when
you tap next you'll see some pretty
simple instructions to connect the
devices that came in your kit connecting
your devices is literally just as easy
as pull pull plug and that's it
you will just want to keep these devices
within about 15 feet of the hub during
the connecting process after that you
can place them anywhere in your home
when smartthings has found all of your
devices you're free to place them around
your home and name them based on where
they're located to help you better
organize your home in a way that makes
sense to you after you give an each
device a name you can tap where it's
select a room and then create a new room
like bedroom living room kitchen and so
forth you can also set a custom image
for your room to help you better
identify it once you've set up your
smart things devices and use the app to
name them and to place them in a room
you're ready to start exploring smart
home monitor this is kind of like your
ground zero for controlling and securing
your home let's take a look and see how
it works there are three main settings
for security and smart home monitor when
there's no one at home select armed away
this will put your home on full alert
in this mode you'll receive an immediate
alert if there's unexpected motion or
entry when you're asleep
select armed stay this will put your
home on partial alert in this mode
you'll only receive alerts if a
multi-purpose sensor detects unexpected
entry finally when you're home during
the day
select disarm this will disarm your home
so you don't receive any alerts from
motion or entry you can easily adjust
the settings to meet your individual
preferences you can also add compatible
cameras locks alarms and more to enhance
your smart home and there you have it
all done my home just got safer and a
whole lot smarter thanks for watching
you

sonic soak sonic soak is a smartphone
sized device that uses ultrasound
technology to clean almost anything in
ways never before possible it cleans to
the microscopic level beyond what any
laundry machine or cleaning spray can do
the inspiration for this device came
from the fact that we were frequent
travelers and cleaning our clothes while
on the go was always a hassle so we had
to set out to find a good solution it's
also quiet
and can be used to clean more than
clothes it can clean glasses jewelry
fruits razors baby bottles the products
that are tough to clean using sponges or
rags or your hands or soap and water I
think they get the idea is ok I just
want to be clear this is the best way to
clean pretty much anything sonic soak
works by generating ultrasonic sound
waves that create microscopic high
pressure bubbles to wash away dirt grime
and oils we had no idea at the time that
we come up with was a device that had so
many benefits outside of travellers
wanting an easy way to wash clothes
while on the go
it's also simple to use you simply place
it water add some soap turn on the
built-in timer and walk away minutes
later your clothes are cleaner than ever
before sonic Stoke is designed for
travelers moms neat freaks looking for a
thorough cleanse and not just on clothes
by the way but on fruits and vegetables
to folks with small loads of laundry
fashionistas that eat a better solution
for their gentle cycle or hand wash only
clothes folks that don't have the space
for a full size laundry machine really
it's for anyone who wants a cleaner will
almost anything because sonic soak is
more than a great way to clean your
laundry it can clean just about anything

you like things clean free from all
those nasty things you can only see up

canvas is a groundbreaking new
application that allows you to capture a
scale accurate 3d model of your home in
minutes all on an iPad here's how it
works first attach a structure sensor to
your iPad and launch the canvas app next
start scanning canvas captures thousands
of measurements per second and combines
them into a single 3d model you can use
instantly you don't have to anticipate
every measurement or view that you'll
need because with the 3d model you'll
have all of them the great thing about
canvas for us is that we can take any of
our employees send them out to a site
have them capture the whole thing we
have all the information you need
without error a raw 3d model is powerful
but if you want to make changes using
professional tools you'll need a
simplified editable CAD file that's why
we built a new first-of-its-kind service
right into canvas we call it scan to cab
and it converts your raw 3d model into
CAD within 48 hours when I got my first
CAD file back I really wasn't sure what
to expect and when I saw the file I
couldn't believe it
it was so accurate so thought out
everything was in perfect layers I can
rely on canvas and structure sensor to
provide me with more information than my
brain would even remember
to take a look at clients of all levels
want to see 3d modeling now that we have
canvas we can create that same level of
project and a presentation for all of
our clients I think it would pay for
itself in one project to make real-time
3d mapping possible on the iPad we had
to create new hardware and new software
first we created the structure sensor
giving mobile devices scale accurate
depth sensor next we're introducing a
new 120 degree wide vision lens which
means you'll experience our most stable
motion tracking yet and most importantly
we've upgraded our mapping algorithms
we've gone from enabling you to scan
objects to now allowing you to capture
entire spaces for the first time it's
actually easy to turn a physical space
into data space is the new digital asset
that you can store and bring with you
wherever you go
canvas is available now a canvas dot IO
and on the App Store and we can't wait
to see what you do with it
