if you drive chances are you've got a
speeding ticket and let's be honest some
of you more than others don't worry we
get it you're important you're super
important your slow motion tossing your
hair in the wind important you got to
get there 42 seconds earlier I get it me
too
the thing is you're not and speeding
that's some serious stuff
fact is you spend eight billion dollars
a year on speeding tickets and that's
just in North America this stops now
that's why we designed trap tap this
round little Marvel can save your life
and you guys account cool right you're
trapped up and notify your potentials
rivals such as red-light cameras and
schools a flashing red I'll leave them
flash green to let you know when you're
speeding also this little guy flashes
blue for those hidden speed traps and
cameras we rely on you and everyone else
to help find these around your city when
you see a speed trap and you're trapped
tap doesn't light up it means you're the
first one to find it
you're like a modern-day Columbus just
tap twice and boom you saved everyone
cash possibly a life
sounds like that could be annoying right
now it's not just tap the device once
while slit up silence II think the speed
trap is no longer there double tap to
remove the alert and update the
community thinking about setting fake
alerts don't bother we have algorithms
prevent false positives that's fancy
talk for it won't work I know what you
think Scotty I already have now why do I
need this good thing they're easy to use
I'm not distracting at all and yes you
know their other maps and apps that can
help you too problem is you're confusing
and dangerous to use so dangerous they
force you to take your eyes off the road
now this this is easy and safe all right
let's see your car isn't available and
you need to use your friends right you
can't take that pension now system you
with trap tap it's simple
to change cars just pick it up and move
it what's that you don't have a car I
hear you brother we haven't forgotten
about you easily attach the trap top to
your bike and read it right so let's be
real if you wanted to be safe and lower
the amount of money you waste on
speeding tickets so you can continue to
the things that you love we are trapped
up you're not so annoying backseat

wedding and need to get around my
smartphone might have all the
information I need to navigate but
tapping away on my cell phone screen
while I'm driving seems like a bad idea
and what about this clunky GPS device
supposed to stick on my windshield
wouldn't it be great if you could just
speak to your car and all the
information you needed would magically
pop up in front of you introducing our
Loudy an ultra portable smart heads-up
display system that puts all the useful
information directly onto your
windshield check this out

hi and I'm Dan another and we set out a
mission and so I certainly can you say
this quickly on the road
introducing the deluxe magnetic ice
shield
compare the length of time that would
normally take you to scrape the ice off
your car window in the morning now using
an ice screen instead you can simply
remove the cover shake up the ice and
snow stuff it back into its own pocket
and off to go safely with a completely
clear window saving you valuable time
the ice cream was designed with no
suction caps or any straps whatsoever
instead we use clever magnets to simply
clip onto the body of your car we
included security flaps on both sides of
the cover which can be placed inside the
door to prevent it from blowing off and
strong winds those pockets also double
up with an ankle strap deterrent
you can even keep your dashboard and
seats fresh and cool in the heat of the
summer just by flipping the cover over
to the Sun reflective site but wait it
gets better
we're making an app forecast the app
will send you a friendly reminder to put
up your cover so you can hit that snooze
button one more time we first began
sewing these and AM be dining room all
the original ice creams were home named
we have secured a manufacturing for this
project some of your backing we can
complete the production so you can get
your hands on one of these ice creams on
time for Christmas we have prepared some
fantastic rewards for you so don't
forget to spread the word and share this
with your friends and family and
together we can put an end to the ice
scraping blues
I like oh fuck
this is the rapid X X 5 and X 1/2 high
speed car chargers the X 5 charges up to
five devices twice as fast as regular
chargers the two front ports use
something called intelligent recognition
to read your devices and charge
accordingly sending out up to 2.4 amps
they power devices almost twice as fast
as your average wall charger with a five
foot cable the X slide easily extends to
the back seat providing a steady stream
of 2 amps to each of the three back
ports that's enough power to charge a
phone tablet and handheld gaming device
all at the same time with the X 5
charger everyone can claim a port and
get a full battery fast if you're more
of a solo driver rapid X also makes the
x1 with a single lightning connector
that charges an Apple device at twice
the speed whether you need to charge a
single device or a whole group rapid X
gets the job done fast
