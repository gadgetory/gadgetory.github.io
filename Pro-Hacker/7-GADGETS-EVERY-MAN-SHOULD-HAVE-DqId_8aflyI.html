I'm Greg Lewis age the inventor of zooss
halo a revolution in preserving wine
I've been a product engineer for over
thirty years and I'd love the drink
great wine like most of the people who
drink wine it makes us crazy women end
up wasting a good bottle of wine because
we didn't finish it we all know wine
soils really fast even a few molecules
of oxygen an open ball of start a chain
reaction that spoils the delicate flavor
of wine hi my name is Jonah beer I'm the
general manager here at frog food winery
in Rutherford right in the middle of the
Napa Valley over the years I've
discovered and found that there are many
wine preserving products in markets that
attempt to make that open bottle of wine
last or you can make I've tried you on
the bottom that is none work with
complete and reliable to stuff and some
are really cumbersome to you there has
never been a technology that could stop
the toiling effects of oxygen until now
simply put the doc is our company name
and it stands for zero oxygen solutions
our first product is called halo halo
eliminates all the oxygen in the bottle
quickly and economically when I met Greg
it's already created I realized that
wine drinkers and enthusiasts finally
had a real solution that works my name
is Rick figner president and CEO of
Jackson family one when I was first
introduced to the halo product I was
pretty skeptical not a good work well I
put halo 3 two separate preservation
tests with all the time-lapse you know
no wall after one week two weeks even as
we drank to last from the same bottle
after 18 days the wine was fresh almost
as if it had not been open with halo we
will not have to pour wine down the
drain and our consumers can drink what
they want when they want with full
confidence you can open a bottle on
Tuesday finish it on the weekend the
wine is perfect I was blown away and
here's the best part
easy to you to make it super simple for
the user to know the product is doing
its job halo lights up and verifies to
the user that your precious bottle is
being preserved correctly with halo you
can leave it for a few days
weeks or even months the soft technology
is a revolution in wine preservation
that will outperform any product at any
price by several orders of magnitude
chalo is an extremely cost-effective
zero oxygen solution that can save wine
aficionados restaurants bars and
wineries money and time it gives me the
opportunity to own my life instead of
letting my wine own me I opened what I
want drink as much as I want what I want
and Zhou Taylor does the job of
preserving it so that when I come back
to it it's just where I left it zero
oxygen zero wasted whining zero effort I
will feel good as a whiner executive
knowing that our product with the
preservation tool like Halo will give
consumers results but also makes me feel
good as a brand owner that this thing
actually does work your support will
help propel the sauce products to
worldwide market for everyone to enjoy
funding will be used to supplement
internal expenses such as our D
manufacturing packaging marketing and
sales effort we thank you in advance for
your support and invite you to review
all of the sauce product offerings
our first product halo will be on the
market very soon check it out

how many times have you experienced
frustration having those uninvited
mosquitos during your outdoor adventures
in certain areas of the world
the fuze are well known for bringing
inspections diseases like malaria or
dengue / which can be fatal to people
and children at an eco as adventure and
people lovers we have decided to stop at
once and for all this is why we want to
present to you the new mosquitoes our
glance it is a compact and portable
lanterns but don't let its small parts
trick you it is very powerful the
lantern is easy to use controlled by
only two buses featuring two main
functions feeder killer and lighting
them as I told you don't let it start
confusing the anti mosquito lanterns
comes with 2000 million per hour which
translates up to 20 out of non-stop uses
wall charts so how does it attract the
mosquito is very simple the lantern uses
ultraviolet lights to attract them and
then electronically fastened with the
wires in the upper section and if you
want to use the lantern in the outdoor
you can easily hang it on trees or
inside tent by using the hidden hook on
top as you can see you just unfold it
and it is ready to be hung where the
second feature the lantern itself has
three modes up to 200 women to regulate
the amount of light you will need is
different scenario and just in case
you're wondering yes you can use both at
the same time the tailing mode and the
light
whenever the lanterns becomes dirty and
you need to remove that inside you can
just use a small brush to gently brush
them off or you can use water the dr.
Magnum is highly water resistant with
ip6 creating therefore you can sink it
without damaging the lantern once you
take it out of the water you can
immediately turn it on and as you can
see it works and peccable to ensure that
the lantern works perfectly we have
tested it in many different scenarios
until we have come up with a final
perfected version as the one you can see
in this video the lantern uses a USB
port charge
allowing you to charge it and use it at
the same time for extra convenience we
want to get rid of mosquitoes and for
that we're asking for your help and your
support fill our warehouse with the
mosquitoes our winter it is finally only
get lighting and set aside more than
three hundred seventy two thousand
people can be saved from drowning this
year that's why it's our mission at
Kinji to provide water safety hi I'm Tom
I got the Audis I came up with the idea
of Kinsey after I lost a very good
friend of mine three years ago he
drowned in the lake similar to this one
and it could have been prevented when
you drive a car you put your seatbelt on
when you ride a bike you put on your
helmet but how do you protect yourself
in water you set out to make the
smallest inflatable in the world and we
came up with a convenient non-intrusive
way to provide safety to all of those in
and around water
this is Kinji affordable floatation
device that comfortably secures onto
your wrist it's fast to deploy durable
and contained within a compact design
kenji helps in case of exhaustion or
heavy currents or when there's for
circulation or cramps
anytime you're on the water even if
you're just relaxing you'll want a
kimchi for you and a friend
we like kimchi because it's small
because again your way when you're
trying to paddle out a lot of times when
you're surfing there's not a lifeguard
anywhere near so this gives you a little
bit more sense of security
Kinji can stay inflated for over 48
hours it includes a compass as well as a
whistle for signaling help in case of
emergency having knowledge of your
judgement pair steps and water safety
but Cindy can be an important aim when
you're needed it's easy and fast deploy
and it's already been great out of it
Kinji is durable and the co2 cartridge
is replaceable so you can reuse Kinji as
many times as needed we need your help
to stop production and fight the dangers
of drowning with your support you become
an integral part of our team of
ambassadors and you'll be the first to
receive a kingdom do it for yourself do
it for your friends surf mates fishing
buddies and your family together we can
revolutionize water safety on the global
scale join the movement</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
