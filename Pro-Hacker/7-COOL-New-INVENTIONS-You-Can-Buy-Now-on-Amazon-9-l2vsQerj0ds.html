the Wi-Fi router is one of the most
important utilities in our lives that we
usually take for granted but many
routers are really difficult to set up
configure and maintain security for our
Wi-Fi shouldn't be taken lightly but we
usually don't want a password that's too
complicated and hard to remember with
sacrifice security we can run so the
combination is 1 2 3 4 5 stupidest
combination I have arrived my life
typical home routers are optimized for
just a few devices but nowadays each of
us owns multiple devices cheap
components equal a weak signal which
means we're sometimes left to do some
signal strength yoga we're going to say
it a good Wi-Fi router is something
that's worth investing in and now ladies
and gentlemen I'm going to show you the
greatest gain your eyes and everything
else key Wi-Fi is designed to be simple
sophisticated and secure to set up cue
Wi-Fi just plug it in
and you're done we've simplified it all
to connect we've patented a unique
authentication procedure that is simple
and secure just go to the Wi-Fi
selection page tap qi5 and you're
authenticated now you're able to connect
devices that aren't authenticated simply
can't join everyone notices when the
internet slows down there are thousands
of possible problems that might have
nothing to do with your internet
connection but something to do with the
connection between your modem and your
router or your router and your device
we've designed hoping that so much more
than a simple reset button the Zen
button too runs the self-diagnosis the
most common connectivity issues and
attempts to resolve them automatically
and you can also use key Wi-Fi as a
range extender for your existing routers
even configure multiple Wi-Fi networks
using either traditional passwords or a
proximity authentication procedure your
choices
so that's qi5 easy to set up and use a
new secure way images indicate devices
