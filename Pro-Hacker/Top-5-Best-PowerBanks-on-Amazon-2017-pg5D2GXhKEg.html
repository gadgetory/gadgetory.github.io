campaign we've shipped thousands of
units to people in places around the
world we've heard your feedback we've
created something three times more
powerful than the original
you
you
if you can check the wall outlet to go
what would you tower
share this campaign with all your family
and friends and let's live life off the
grid let's take the wall outlet anywhere
we live in a big world with so much
beauty all around us like these giant
redwoods that are hundreds of years old
but that doesn't mean we still have to
experience the outdoors like it's the
eighteen hundred's introducing the
jakhary paulo pro a portable generator
designed to power everything you take
with you and keep your adventures going
just because you're off the grid doesn't
mean you need to stop discovering
sharing and capturing memories keep all
the devices that help you enjoy the
great outdoors charged because it's not
just about what you see when you're out
here so that way you take back with you
Iko floats river is a new generation of
smart clean mobile power it's a portable
lithium-ion battery with the world's
most comprehensive array of charging
ports and one of the highest total
energy output of almost any storage
solution on the market it's designed for
everybody from outdoor activities and
indoor leisure to industrial
applications and emergency services
River releases you from the shackles of
an outlet so you can power a free life
the unit is equipped with 11 independent
charging ports which can all be used
simultaneously for a total output of 500
watts to put this in perspective that
means you give power to iPhone to iPads
to mash books a mini-fridge a lantern a
drone battery a mobile Wi-Fi unit and
stereo speakers all is the same time
without limiting the output on any port
with the storage capacity of 416 watt
hours River gives you more powers than
almost any battery at the time you can
jam on your electric guitar for 20 hours
straight or you can watch a 10 hour
marathon of your favorite TV show by
campfire
rivers battery can be recharged in three
different ways a standard outlet or a
car charger can replenish the battery
for full capacity in just eight hours
with eco flows portable solar panels
River can be recharged with absolutely
zero carbon emissions in just 12 hours
the real-time display allows you to
monitor the battery's current output
power remaining capacity and charge pack
being a documentary filmmaker a lot of
my shoots happen outside a lot of times
our locations are way out in the middle
of nowhere first time I use River I was
really surprised at how much these
little units can accomplish on location
everything runs on battery we have to
set up a DI T station battery charging
station and we could even run our LEDs
when we need extra lights and never have
to worry about the noise and the
pollution of a generator applications
for battery power are endless River
isn't just an accessory if your power
companion for harnessing clean energy
anywhere so you're free to go everywhere
and by the way this isn't just a concept
river has been tried and tested and as
you can see this entire production has
been lit by River</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
