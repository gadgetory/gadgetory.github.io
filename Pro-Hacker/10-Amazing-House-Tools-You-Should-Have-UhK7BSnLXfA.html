Oh litter tapes are very precisely
printed and given a tough clear coating
to protect them the Ronnie cases are
comfortable to the hand and your side
when you've got it start on your belt
and yes the steel hooks on all inner
tapes are little loose and they're
supposed to be that way for a reason
when you hook the tape already outside
edge of a board that little tip moves
forward and I'm out that's equal to his
thickness that way to tape itself is
right at the edge of the board when you
measure an inside surface the tip slides
back again an equal amount to its
thickness so you're getting reading from
the end of the tape and get an accurate
measurement
even though in-house is a full 25 foot
long tape this case doesn't seem very
big or cumbersome and he put a tough
belt clip on the back of all of them so
you can carry it with you wherever you
go and naturally they put the blade
breaking button in exactly the right
place and it works real well the
standard looking tape has got nice clear
markings as we expect to find them the
numbers are big but not so big that you
can tell which line they go with every
12 inches you'll have these markings
that show you it's how many feet on top
and how many inches on the bottom and
you'll find these red markings every 16
inches and they showed a standard stud
separation and you have the black
diamonds to show you how to lay out roof
trusses for snow logs using these black
diamonds you get five trusses and an
eight foot span rather than four and a
centering role you notice that the red
scale on the bottom it's exactly one
half for the scale on top when you
measure a board you can look directly
below that number and it tells you what
the exact center this board would be I
know that's easy was common with boards
but this makes it easy with any width
board the quick read tape has the
numbers running down the tape and that's
really handy when you're laying out jobs
on sheet stock even have the decimals
marked out on the right side for each
inch for when you're working with
blueprints or technical drawings
