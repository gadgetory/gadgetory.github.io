carry our work tools everywhere and
that's why more than ever we need a bag
but from our own experience most bags
out there are not made for the modern
lifestyle so to end our own frustration
we decided to design a backpack from
scratch
after endless testing we are now ready
to show you our creations the bird
backpack and with over ten noteworthy
features we believe that this is one of
the best everyday backpacks ever let me
tell you about it
it's made of a new and innovative
material that makes it scratch proof cut
proof and water repellent
we wanted the bird backpack to be steps
proof so we designed a unique hidden
zipper place up against your back you
can turn your bag against anyone with
ease of mind to have less pressure on
your back we prioritize weight balance
with the laptop compartment placed
firmly against your back the weight is
distributed more evenly and it feels
dramatically lighter a remarkable
difference from traditional backpacks
the back panels are made of breathable
material to bring extra comfort from the
outside there are two easy to access
pockets one big on the back for the
passport or wallet and a pocket on the
side that is big enough to hold an
iPhone 6 plus is easy to reach with only
one hand
you
let's look at the inside there are
protected sleeves for a laptop and
tablet
three big pockets for a charger or
camera gift or anyway
there is a place for your pens a zipper
pocket in the top for the stuff you
don't want to fall out you can also plug
in your smartphone from your power bank
in the bag while you go and an elastic
strap for your gym clothes or jacket
you can very easily reach your laptop
and tablet from the protective sleeve
with traditional backpacks you have to
dig from the top to find what you need
in the bottom we made it possible to
open all the way so you always feel
organized we were tired of the black
linen that you see in most bags so we
made it red so it looks and feels like
the inside of a nice suit now we need
your help making the bird backpack a
reality we already have deals with
manufacturing companies with years of
experience in making top-class products
and they are standing by to take care of
production and logistics this makes sure
that you get your backpack on time and
in the best quality on the market
you
to
hey I'm Adrian the Canadian and welcome
to life back
the NTSF solar-powered backpack that
keeps your phone charged and your stuff
safe let's check it out the 21st century
has redefined the way that we live our
lives you're no longer tied to an office
37 percent of US workers say they work
from home in the past month that's up
over 400 percent since 1995 I'm pretty
sure that your phone's been upgraded
since then and it's time that your bag
was to give life back we've reinvented
the mobile office does your phone
battery ever die are you ever worried
about your bag getting stolen or broken
into do you have a hard time keeping
organized well lucky for you life hacks
here to save the day
let's start with why you're never gonna
have to deal with a dead phone again the
solar bank is a removable unit which has
a solar panel and battery with enough
power to charge an iPhone 6 up to 12
times you can charge the silver bank the
USB know when you're out and about the
solar panel keeps the power topped up
the solar bank also has built-in
Bluetooth speakers so you have great
sounding audio with you when you're on
the go
life back has an integrated lock this
means you can lock the zipper shut when
you're on the go and what's really cool
about this lock is you can actually
unlock the bag to something when you're
sitting still because of the unique
design of the zippers you can also lock
a zipper shut while locking it to a
fixed point the bottom of the cable can
not be removed and the exit point is
reinforced so it's super strong also the
end of the lock mark is a bottle opener
cheers salud some things go the work
zone is incredibly organized is a
separate section for your laptop iPad
there's a space for your wallet there's
a key hook business cards pen there's
also a section for loose papers in a
separate pocket so you don't lose
receipt in the light zone is a protected
pocket for your sunglasses is room for
clothes and any of your non-work stuff
because you don't want your onions
falling out in a work meeting cuz we all
know that that just means that's nothing
- there are four hidden departments on
the tag on your shoulder straps or two
pockets these are big enough for credit
cards travel cards for the subway or
Metro cash loose change or even your
headphones
press up to your back or two more hidden
pockets easier ideal for your passport
and boarding card when traveling these
pockets are even big enough for an
iPhone six-plus and on one side there's
a USB plug that connects to the fotomat
