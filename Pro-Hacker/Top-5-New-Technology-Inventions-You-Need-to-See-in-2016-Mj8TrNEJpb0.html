my first impression of the tick wise
tool is it fits great and it looks good
on my wrist each little point that you
touch it's very specific and I like how
it goes from being a traditional type
function looking down at it to really
being able to interact with it my first
impression was that it was a neat watch
but outside of that I didn't really know
that I'd explore the functionality or
get to use it in the real world
normally I wouldn't consider answering
any phone calls while I'm riding my bike
but with the tick watch too you just
flip your wrist twice answer the call
flip another two times and hang it up it
tracks my workouts and it fits with my
lifestyle I'm not really what you call
tech savvy but the tick watch tubes and
really easy to use okay tiko we want
sushi I can ask it to find a nearby
restaurant and it shows the rating and
the review and how far away it is
whenever I want to go for a run I can
always track all of my fitness goals on
it it's really important for me to be
able to track how I want to do my
workout if I want to use it by calories
or with distance or based on my heart
rate I was really impressed with how
convenient it was the scheduled tasks in
meetings responded my voice commands
very easily okay tiko scheduled a
meeting with Bob Williams for 7am
tomorrow I thought was pretty awesome
that you call an uber by just saying
call an uber into your watch and it
would request one for you it's great to
be able to focus on the task I have it
hand instead of having to check my phone
all the time by receipt of text i simply
glanced at my watch i can dismiss it
until I'm ready to reply later you know
I don't see how I've really been able to
function without it it's really helped
me be more efficient it's made my life a
lot easier when it comes to my workouts
or even just my daily life okay tiko
how's the weather when I'm selecting a
watch it actually matters to me how it
looks it's cute I like it overall I was
really impressed with the take walks too
it's fast it's intuitive it recognizes
my voice faster than the other
SmartWatch have ever seen
so I get to keep this right
what if all cars had a single light in
the center strange then why do we only
have one light in front of our bicycle
introducing luma a 360 degree light
system that shows your true width while
cycling it combines all the lights
needed on your bike front lights rear
lights and side lights all integrated
into the bicycles grips three different
lights at each end of your handlebar
never worry again about leaving your
lights home or having them stolen the
grips feature a solid core for easy
installation and lock on rings for
secure fastening looma meets all the
legal requirements even in countries
with strict regulations such as Denmark
and Norway though it makes you visible
looma itself is almost invisible it has
a compact elegant design that does not
interfere with looks of your bike the
body is made of aircraft-grade aluminum
the same alloy used for helicopters and
airplanes it's tough almost
indestructible we've paid special
attention to the surface finish anodized
ultrasonic cleaned and hand brushed for
a premium look finally each set comes
with built-in lithium batteries that are
easily charged through a standard
microUSB port we love bicycles and we
love to cycle we want to have a product
that is not just good but one that
advances the frontiers of visibility and
traffic safety help us spread the word
and save the world get a loom before
someone you care for it's not just a
light it's all you need to see
being a gun owner is not just buying a
gun you must always be prepared have to
be trained
you are your gun safe when it's not on
you you want to know it's secure and
accessible safes are not always
accessible or easy to open especially in
the dark and locks are nuisance to
operate as for smart guns while smart
guns are a dangerous concept taking an
unreliable technology and embedding it
into your gun is not a smart decision
our mission is to bring you the perfect
solution introducing sorex the new
generation of gun storage sorex is
calibre specific and has two MOS the
first mode is awareness if someone tries
to tamper with your gun you're
immediately alerted
and when you need your gun charging it
Willie jets or rats and chamber a fresh
round the second mode is when your gun
is locked when Zoras locked no one can
charge your gun if someone tries to
charge your gun the locking mechanism
will immediately expand preventing the
gun from being loaded special polymers
in the locking mechanism prevent any
damage to the barrel Zoras developed a
revolutionary unlocking mechanism rapid
dial rapid dial is a simple mechanism
which counts clicks while you turn it
you don't need to start from a specific
point even the direction that you turn
the lock doesn't matter these two
factors allow you to unlock your weapon
without looking at it even in the dark
you can choose a simple code or any
length code you wish you won't believe
how fast and simple it is until you try
it you can also open zorax from your
phone but you can only lock it by
physically pressing the lock button
zorax normally communicates with your
phone directly through bluetooth it also
comes with as or bridge a bluetooth to
Wi-Fi router when plugged into the wall
near your gun you'll be made aware from
anywhere in the world if your gun is
being tampered with now if your home is
your safe and you don't lock your gun
but you still want alerts we have a
solution the Czar watchdog the sword
watchdog is not a lock but rather a
notification device its sole purpose is
to notify you if your weapon is tampered
with
sorex was invented by veterans of elite
IDF technological in combat units we
worked on it for two years bringing it
to perfection lorex allows you to be
ready aware and safe more than ever
before join the Tsar revolution own your
gun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
