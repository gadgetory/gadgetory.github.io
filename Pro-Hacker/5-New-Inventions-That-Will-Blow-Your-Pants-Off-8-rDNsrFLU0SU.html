device so you can finally carry just one
tiny adapter

technology our secret is switching
faster

smaller lighter electronics
as a team of MIT graduate students we
set out with a goal of using our
technology to radically shrink the bulky
charger
we focused on the laptop adapter first
and it put a tremendous amount of time
and energy into developing the dart
we have finished our design and our
securing the approvals needed to move
into production we now need your help to
get the dart into your pocket if you
join our campaign we'll know that you
are as excited as we are and looking
forward to the day when you can finally
travel with one

I'm a hiker and with the little space I
have to carry stuff I want to be able to
remember moments like these forever
that's why the my site 360 is the
perfect solution the my site 360 can
capture everything in beautiful 4k
without needing a big rig or heavy
equipment to get stable shots and if the
trail gets bumpy or the camera isn't in
the right position the my site 360 keeps
videos level with its built in
calibration the horizon optimization
ensures level viewing and to make sure
your viewing quality isn't sacrificed by
unexpected camera positioning or tilting
the stable calibration minimizes motion
gimbal Lake quality without the excess
weight and equipment and it's water
resistant so the my site 360 can capture
the entire experience rain or shine
plus if you need to change the position
it only takes a second
when I get to a place with a great view
I know that the my site 360 is getting
the best quality photos and videos if I
missed anything on my way here the my
site 360 has a long battery life so I
won't miss it on my way back
on my way back I can start posting right
away
the my site 360 app uses artificial
intelligence to create a feature called
life log which looks at all the videos
from my hike and stitches the best parts
of them together into one clip that way
I don't have to go through hours of
footage hi Angie Bunga off my test
resist my side 316 is not a fully
360-degree camera if what you want is to
make a true three city degree video you
may want to look somewhere else but what
we are hopefully is a wearable camera
decide for Kaiser to capture and
recreate hiking spirits we have no
intention of making the best 360-degree
camera out there but I can confidently
say that if you are hikers who want to
create your hiking experience my side
recipe is a product for you thank you
what if there was an aerial camera
platform that really could capture your
world from any perspective something
completely different from anything
you've seen before
an aerial platform that was portable
unbelievably rugged powerful and simple
to use one that you could take with you
anywhere without a lot of hassle
introducing sprite the world's most
portable and rugged unmanned aerial
vehicle whether you're an active outdoor
enthusiast or a serious professional who
just needs to get the job done sprite is
as portable rugged and hardworking as
you are
the motors and electronics are all
sealed tightly into the airframe keeping
them safe from dust dirt and water
whether that's happening in the backyard
or the backcountry it even floats but
it's also really easy to use with
sprites powerful autopilot you can
create three-dimensional GPS flight
paths you can change speed hold a
position fly circles a survey pattern
even scan structures or regions of
interest all while keeping the camera
pointed right where you want it
sprite can even follow you to capture
that ultimate perspective or if you like
you can fly sprite with an optional
remote control transmitter the automatic
controller lists flight modes let you
program sprite will leave the
controller's back at Basecamp or at home
the airframe is made up of durable
connecting sections making it super easy
to change batteries or even payloads on
the go without tools sprite comes with a
camera mounted on a one axis stabilized
gimbal to take crystal-clear video and
still images in full high-definition a
GoPro module with the two axis
stabilized gimbal is also available and
attaches to sprite in seconds because
sprite is modular you'll be able to
easily add new cameras sensors network
communications hardware and other
accessories as they become available
we've spent more than 2 years perfecting
sprite and the hard part is behind us we
now need your help to get us over the
final hurdle and into production but to
gets right out of our backpack and into
your hands we need to know that the
world is just as interested in a
portable rugged and simple to use aerial
platform as we are
please support us on Kickstarter choose
a reward that's best for you and help
spread the word among your friends
family and colleagues tell anyone who
you think can use an unmanned aerial
vehicle is portable rugged powerful and
simple to use is sprite please visit our
website for more information and details
about sprite and about us and thanks for
your help
the future of sprite is in your hands
oh man
bunny mom did you get parmesan did we

what if we could advance technology to
create a speaker big enough for a party
but small enough to always go with you
where would you take
pancakes Tyler I'm Peter and I'm Tom
we're the founders of newdoria we're on
a mission to make premium audio products
accessible travel it easy to create
premium products and high prices a much
more interested in the challenge of
using design to create high quality
products at affordable prices we
launched the audio last summer with a
range of portable Bluetooth speakers
that came typically in sizes s M and L
alpha round the house M to grab and go
an S to be small enough to leave
attached to your backpack or snowboard
jacket the grab-and-go size of M was by
far our most popular with the M we
achieved a near-perfect balanced price
size logistics we've been told time and
time again from the size and the price
the sound of the M is truly astonishing
one of you took the handcuffs off went
all out on the acoustics in the
grab-and-go size instead of using a
single driver we use two full range
drivers with neodymium magnets for the
most powerful output couple this with
passive subwoofer to maximize the bass
response this allowed us to pump out
incredible sound all in this beautiful
package
but that wasn't enough we took the
entire coup stick setup and repeated it
on the other side giving us double the
performance and true 360-degree salt
packing six drivers and an eight-hour
battery into a format this small was
quite an engineering challenge for to be
truly portable and go anywhere
it had to be packaged in a highly
protective housing we see that the
housing to the IPX 5 waterproof and
central and for shock resistance and
versatility we've wrapped it in our
signature high grade silicone sleeve and
nylon cord say hello to Pam our best
speak ear the Kickstarter price $99
we're a self-funded starter we've done a
huge amount of work in the last year got
our first line of products to market to
get super AM ready for production but to
get to the next level to get super em
into your hands as quickly as possible
we need your help in started our Hong
Kong engineering team and our
manufacturing partners in China we'll be
ready for production by the end of this
campaign as soon as we reach our goal
you'll immediately start manufacturing
fulfilling your pledges you'll have your
super em in half by the end of this
summer we don't have the marketing
dollars that our competitors have but we
do have the better product now that you
know you can have the best sounding
speaker that fits into the back pocket
of your jeans
