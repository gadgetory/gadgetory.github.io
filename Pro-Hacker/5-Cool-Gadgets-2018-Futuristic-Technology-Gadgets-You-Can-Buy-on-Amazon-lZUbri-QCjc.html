a new era of reality has arrived
experience the freedom of VR without
boundaries do you know what you're
breathing indoors do you think the air
is clean at home well I beg to differ
the air indoors is about five times more
polluted than the air outdoors
do you wonder why you start coughing
when you get home or why you're having
an allergic reaction every time you
enter your laundry room it might be
volatile organic compounds that are
polluting your home or household items
and chemicals such as detergents
cosmetics carpets or even your romantic
soothing candles
I am I baby air a smart air quality
monitor and purifier I'm here to make
sure you and your family are breathing
clean fresh air alerting you every time
the air quality drops
functioning as an air station I allow
you to see data from IBB air monitors
near you for comparison when I detect a
decrease in air quality I'll send an
alert straight to your phone and will
automatically start purifying the air
with ions
also I will provide you with graphs and
suggestions to improve your lifestyle
I'll make sure you're living a happy
healthy life just like I did for this
family
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
