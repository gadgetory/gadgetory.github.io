Bonjour Kickstarter the idea first thig
books came to me when I was walking in
the market and saw a shop selling selfie
sticks next to smartphone cases why
carry two things when you can carry one
this is thick books we just finished the
design and are now ready for production
FC beaucoup Tour X is the first smart
ball pump that will revolutionize the
way that athletes coaches referees and
parents interact with a vital element of
each sport the ball and it will take the
guessing out of your game
introducing the Tour X the Tour X is
compact and simple to use open the cap
by twisting to reveal the protected
needle Torx is designed significantly
reduces the chance of damaging the
needle in manual mode the Toric's
measures the ball pressure when the
needle is inserted simply increase or
decrease the balls pressure until you
find your perfect number
squeeze bounce or spike the ball to test
and determine that you are happy with
the pressure then you're ready to play
once you know your perfect pressure you
can switch to auto mode and achieve the
exact pressure every time with a push of
a button simply insert the Tour X and
hit the auto button once the Tour X
reaches the target pressure it will beep
three times and then you're off to play
the Toric's is powered by a robust
lithium ion battery that is rechargeable
through a simple micro USB connection at
full charge the battery is capable of
topping up 50 balls with torques as
battery capacity and auto mode coaches
players and referees can quickly and
accurately inflate or test multiple
balls for practicing games
the Tour X is designed to be used in a
rough athletic environment and to live
in a backpack it is engineered for
performance and durability we spend a
lot of time developing the Tour X and
our team is excited to see it
manufactured and used around the world
