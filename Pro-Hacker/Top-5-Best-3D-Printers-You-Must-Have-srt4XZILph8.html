the m3 D Pro based on getting feedback
from our existing users so we've already
gone through three iterations of design
prototypes and we're almost completely
done the engineering three months ago we
proved a lot of the important concepts
like making a heated bed that uses less
power proving that it can move a lot
faster proving the benefits of higher
quality and higher precision metal parts
and right now we're going through the
final phases of proving the feedback
system and finishing the next steps in
programming our goal with the m3 D Pro
is to make the most reliable 3d printer
in history and the way we're gonna do it
is by combining a full suite of sensors
what we call a sensor network with
precision metal parts the combination
allows the printer to become more
self-aware and it can correct for errors
that are common in all 3d printers a
cheap ones and expensive ones things
such as filament snags printhead crashes
even power outages first time I ever
heard about 3d printing was one of my
friends printed a ninja warrior training
hold and I thought it was really cool
the unique thing that you're getting
with them 3d pro that we have not yet
seen in this industry is that ability
for the printer to sense many different
things within itself it has the ability
to sense position it has the ability to
sense speed has the ability to sense
temperature in five different places and
if there's a problem it can be self
diagnosed and in almost all cases can be
self corrected ultimately that gives you
more time in the creative process with
3d printing I have right on my desk or
my granddaughter's have right on their
desk if they get an idea they can try to
make that idea on a 3d printer right
there they can turn their ideas into
reality this I didn't have when I
really the greatest advancement the 3d
printing could accomplish at any point
in the future is ease of use making it
so that anybody can just go from an idea
to creating that idea within an
afternoon we've introduced this new
thing that we call tutorial mode so what
we got from our feedback from original
backers was that they wanted more
detailed guides so they can grow into
becoming a expert user rather than
having a start as an expert user the
thing I think that needs to happen for
educators is speed as an issue how fast
we can turn around
so with m3/d Pro you have the ability to
print a single prototype with extreme
accuracy and high quality but you also
have the ability to take that prototype
and print it in quantity cover the
entire print bed with multiples of your
model and produce it at volume I am so
excited for the future not only for me
for my daughter to grow up being able to
use her mind to create anything she
wants to thanks to a 3d printer I've
been fascinated with just the whole idea
of 3d printing for quite a while now
focusing on just simple things that I
could print for around the house or you
know toys that I could print to play
with my kids really just the idea that I
could create something myself so the M
3d pro is already successfully funded
and is the largest crowdfunding 3d
printer this year due to popular demand
we're opening up pre-orders using the
IndieGoGo in demand platform and what M
3d is doing I think many people are
going to see is extremely innovative and
they're going to want to be first to
support it and to help nurture where
this technology is going to go
they just also happen to get a printer
as one of their rewards very early and
at a deep discount

introducing Coppa an innovative 3d
printer designed to give you an
experience like never before by creators
for creators Coppa is the world's first
3d printer utilizing the Scott Russell
straight line mechanism used in
pick-and-place robotics this precision
technology guarantees quality
consistently our proprietary design
feature is the linear movement of the
nozzle to the bed the result a large
build volume with the small footprint
print more with less the modular design
requires simple assembly and can be
completed in a few minutes this
modularity keeps kapa compact for easy
storage the customized mold and CNC
milling process used to produce the
aluminum unibody towered ensures our
technical specifications are met exactly
every time
incorporating a detachable bed makes
print removal effortless and has
eliminated the need to recalibrate the
machine after each use working out of
the national university of singapore we
have been developing kapa for over a
year each iteration was driven by our
focus to achieve accuracy and
reliability we have worked with our
manufacturers and suppliers to produce
our prototypes on the actual machinery
using the final materials so that our
transition to full-scale production is
seamless our design for manufacturing
and assembly approach is to provide
flow-on benefits for production delivery
and customer experience we are now ready
to share kapa with you with our OEMs on
standby we need your support to make
kapa a reality experience something new
experienced kapa hi my name is Arya I'm
an engineer and a certified always
professional
and one of the developers of Clube
bought a compact affordable yet
professional 3d printer my dad and I
started out in the garage our goal was
to imagine 3d printing for a wider
audience and make this tool usable for
everybody for most people
3d printers are either too large too
expensive too difficult to use or just
basic tiny toys with unacceptable
quality we wanted to create something
that would be high functioning yet
affordable simple enough to use for
everyone just plug it in and click
printer after two and a half years of
hard work we are proud to introduce you
to kuba
the first machine that makes 3d printing
available to all people you don't have
to be an expert or a technology buff to
use it
cubot is capable of printing any object
you can imagine and design however to
jumpstart your creativity we have
created our own design database that
contains many different designs ready to
