for thousands of years humans have been
filling their notebooks and then just
buying more said the notebook industry
has given up on innovation hey what's
this
the notebook Hemingway wrote on that's
cool I guess we're from rocket book and
we make notebooks from the future at
rocket book we are already famous for
inventing the wave notebook the smart
notebook that can be erased in the
microwaves we've shipped 100,000 waves
to satisfied customers around the world
others may stop there but we are maniacs
obsessed with blending old fashioned
notebooks with future and awesome so
we've spent a year in the rocket lab
designing a new notebook that feels like
pen and paper but is endlessly reusable
and completely integrated with your
digital lifestyle
introducing the Everlast notebook from
rocket book the Everlast brings cloud
scalability to pen and paper simply
write scan and erase imagine 1,000 of
your favorite notebooks in one sleek
design that fits in your backpack here's
how it works
Everlast pages look and feel like paper
but they're actually constructed from a
polyester composite rather than would
you write on the Everlast using any pen
from the pilot FriXion line which are
available in-store and online writing on
the Everlast feels perfectly natural and
smooth and as the ink dries it forms a
complete bond to the polyester page so
it won't rub off but what makes this
formulation so unique is that each page
can be wiped completely clean with a
moist towel so it can be used over and
over and over again
the Everlast notebook is also compatible
with the rocket book app so before you
wipe your notes off the page you can
blast them online to your favorite cloud
services in a fraction of a second
rocket book machine vision scans
enhances and sends each page to the
specific destination they belong on the
cloud services you already use each
Everlast notebook page has seven symbols
set up the rocket book app to assign
each symbol to a location within Dropbox
Google Docs Evernote or many other
services you could configure your
diamond to send meeting notes directly
to your shared team folder in Dropbox
or students could configure their star
symbol to send notes right to a math
folder in Google Drive so you can make
your list break out that diagram for
color in that drawing then tomorrow
start your day with a brand new notebook
with the ever last one notebook becomes
one thousand notebooks the utility of
the cloud and the joy of pen and paper
that's rocket book
