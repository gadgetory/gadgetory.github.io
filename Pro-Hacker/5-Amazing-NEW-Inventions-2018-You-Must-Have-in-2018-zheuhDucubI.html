hours a day on mobile devices for
entertainment however to make your
entertainment portable you sacrifice
picture size sound quality and more
everyone makes this compromise but we
shouldn't have to
that's where capsule comes in
introducing capsule by nebula the
world's most advanced pocket cinema a
soda-can sized pico projector with
remarkable picture and sound when we
started building a powerful speaker into
such a small device without compromising
the picture seemed like an impossible
challenge so we had to get creative we
proactively built in a 360-degree
speaker with enhanced bass and boosted
treble and cut 9000 holes into the
speaker grill to make capsule the
world's first pico projector with
omnidirectional sound but we didn't just
want it to be small and loud we wanted
to make it really smart traditionally so
called smart projectors come with TV
chipsets which make them big and laggy
we integrated the most advanced
smartphone chipset ever used in a pico
projector into capsule making it the
smartest projector the world has ever
seen
capsule is the first projector ever
equipped with Android 7.0 OS you can
seamlessly watch Netflix YouTube and any
other streaming app directly plus
capsule can wirelessly mirror content
from virtually any mobile device to
display it up to 100 inches big powered
by anchors advanced battery technology
capsule delivers up to 2.5 hours of
continuous video for 40 hours of
non-stop music on a single charge plug
in a power bank and get all-day
entertainment anywhere
capsule the world's most advanced pocket
cinema when you upgrade your Wi-Fi to
arrow something amazing happens
everything just works letting you
connect with what's important that's why
we made arrow the world's best reviewed
home Wi-Fi system arrows replace your
router forming a wireless mesh network
that blankets your home in fast reliable
Wi-Fi arrow is simple to setup and can
expand to cover any home
meaning all your connected devices work
the way you want them to you wherever
you want them to with arrow you'll have
no more dead spots slow spots drop offs
or buffering its Wi-Fi so good you'll
never think about Wi-Fi again
honey where those photos from our trip
to Bora Bora
this is Jack Jack and his wife love to
take vacations but vacations mean photos
and photos mean files lots of them put
that all together and you have a recipe
for disaster in the Attic hate it up
here
so do your files so like most people
Jack relies on free accounts from places
like Dropbox and Google Drive just to
stay afloat but what if there was a way
to offer truly endless file storage with
speeds never before seen with no monthly
subscription meat file gear file gear
lets you take your files from your hard
drives computers cloud drives and mobile
devices and puts them all together
finally giving you access to everything
you own in one convenient place once
you've connected a device file gear
automatically analyzes and organizes
each and every file into categories
allowing you to browse through your
photos videos music or documents by date
location content and more honey I found
it with file gear sharing things like
photos is a breeze you can share by
links email or by using the apps you
already know and love like Facebook
Instagram and Google Plus file gear can
be used by other family members too so
you don't have to pay for multiple
storage accounts for each user now let's
talk about safety we already know that
file gear is way faster than the cloud
but it's also way more secure as well
and that's because your files live right
here at home
hi I'm Doug founder of file gear I
needed a way to organize all of my files
without spending a ton of time to get it
done so I teamed up with some of the
world's greatest coders and engineers
and after two years of development I'm
very proud to introduce you to file gear
but we need your help to prepare
expensive tooling and place volume
orders for production so be one of the
first to own this groundbreaking device
and finally get a hold of your digital
life so great price incredible speeds
total security and no monthly fees I'm
sold where do I sign up
filed here don't go in the Attic
introducing the Simtek smart sensor
reinventing security for the things that
you care about it's a small light motion
detector that alerts you when someone
gets into your things every day millions
of guns and other valuables are
supposedly secure in things like closets
jewelry boxes gun safes and storage
units but who's watching your stuff when
you're not around and how do you truly
know it's safe every year up to six
hundred thousand guns are stolen and
many are used in suicide accidents and
crimes despite the growing popularity of
gun safes here are the problems colonel
arms are designed for houses and not
saves gun owners don't want smart
technology that could restrict the use
of their firearms I decided to change
that and that's why I developed Simtek a
simple and effective way to monitor any
enclosed space like your gun save the
moment your safe is opened Simtek sends
you a text alert over a cellular
connection which is more reliable than
Bluetooth or Wi-Fi it's an extra layer
of security for the things that you care
about it's sleek and portable and it
uses infrared motion and light so there
are no false positives a common problem
for other sensors the battery can last a
full year on a single charge and because
it uses cellular connection you can take
it anywhere in the world without
additional setup I created sim tech to
help people understand what's going on
with their guns and their valuables
someone close to me almost took their
life with a gun and as an alumni of
Virginia Tech I understand all too well
what can happen when guns get into the
wrong hands my gun earning friends tell
me that there's no easy way to reliably
monitor their saves but nobody wants a
product that could potentially restrict
the use of their guns and that's why I
developed sim tech a smart sensor that
can be used anywhere in anything to help
keep you and your things safe gun owners
around the country have been testing sim
tech and we've received great feedback
Engineering and design are complete and
we're ready for mass production
so back us today and know when your
belongings are accessed wherever they're
stored
