creator of the easy with the full-time
job three boys one more on the way I was
looking for a half a free pet feeder
that had all the features I wanted to
one device I couldn't find one which is
why I created the easy P the easy P to
the most automatic hands-free and easy
to use pet feeder in the world now you
may have seen a few pet feeders in the
past but I can promise you nobody offers
a complete end-to-end solution like this
the easy feed provides both food and
water will let you feed based on your
schedule and your amount you can check
in anywhere with the built-in webcam and
microphone and best of all I don't have
food automatically delivered to your
doorstep from mmm when you're running
low this is truly the most set it and
forget it
feeder in the world
Oh
we love our cats but we hate dealing
with their litter boxes and they're
hardly user-friendly I mean your choice
is either the box with the scoop or some
expensive contraption that still needs
to be emptied but there is a better way
introducing the loop litter box
here's how it works to clean the litter
box just lift the top tray and the waste
is separated from the clean litter turn
the tray 180 degrees place it at the
bottom of the stack and that's it
cleaning your litter box takes seconds
with no mess or hassle
what makes loot better three identical
slotted tray individually each tray acts
as a cyst but when any two are stacked
together they form a solid tray add the
third tray and they create a perpetual
sifting loop you'll never have to scoop
again no more wasting cat litter simply
top it up from time to time in the
spring of 1994 I went to the
hairdresser's when I walked in with a
guy on his hands and knees with a litter
box
what are you doing I said well it's a
new kind of litter box and I'm looking
for an investor and when he showed me
how it worked I was absolutely amazed
and I put up my hand and I said hello
I'm beanie patty I'm your new investor a
few years later went to the US it was a
huge hit until almost two million units
and unfortunately like a lot of
television products in the 90s it
disappeared
in an interesting twist of fate I am now
working with my son to bring back the
best cat litter box ever made we've
redesigned the product using the
insights and consumer feedback from the
original version this allowed us to
create a new and even better litter box
we created a durable product of the
highest quality
that's aesthetically pleasing as it is
functional while still being affordable
we created it to be the last litter box
you'll ever have to buy it's an exciting
time because we are really close to
bringing back the world's best cat
litter box with your backing we'll begin
production immediately upon reaching our
funding goal everything will be produced
locally to ensure it's of the highest
quality all we need is your support to
make it happen the loop litter box and
the litter box reinvented
what if your dog started ripping golf
so going
or even liquid gold what if there were a
magic solution that could collect all
your dogs proof without any direct hand
contact because in reality your dog
doesn't poop gold introducing picker poo
at those parents dream
Kickapoo is made up of two parts a
rounded clip of soft silicon cushions
that secures comfortably around your
dog's tail and a durable disposable
collection bag that hangs beneath face
pick a poo on your dog's tail before you
go out for a walk and when he is ready
to poop all the droppings fall directly
into the collection bag when your dog is
finished pooping you just unclip the bag
and throw it away with no mess and no
leakage in the real world don't poop
it's not gold we love our dogs but don't
love cleaning up after them I grew up
having done has always looked for a
better and easier way to pick up after
them but a product in the market are
just not good enough for the best new
years my team and I have worked hard
testing and redesigning and testing
again to finally come up with the
entries every step of the process has
been about making seeker to something
that's real dog owners can actually use
we know that most dog owners want
something they can inclusively use with
only one hand so we build up into
piccaboo - and it's even small enough to
fit in your pocket with these eyes be
careful so there never has to be contact
between the tool and your hands or even
on the ground
everything goes straight into the bag
and are those days after your dog ate
something you shouldn't have
pick a handle in advicing
situations no matter what type of gold
comes out most importantly we wanted to
make sure the Kickapoo is big dog
friendly we've given the pickup food to
more than 100 dogs of different breeds
and sizes and the feedback has been
incredible with your help
sharing this campaign with at least five
friends we're hoping to finally change
the life
although by making our lot easier our
street cleaner in our hands
vote with Picabo you will never need to
pick up dog poop again
you make
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
