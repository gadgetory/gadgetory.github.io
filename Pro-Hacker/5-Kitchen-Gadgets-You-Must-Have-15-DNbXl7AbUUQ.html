our own home
anyone can easily get distracted while
cooking unattended cooking causes nearly
90% of all kitchen fires wouldn't it be
nice to know exactly when cooking
becomes a risk our innovative smart
turns package was designed to bring you
and your family peace of mind
unlike other solutions it's easy to use
and completely transparent to users hi
my name is Jessica founder of talk tech
I went to my parents place one day and I
saw a note on the door that says turn
off stove it's a note they wrote for
themselves this got me thinking there
must be a better way to help them to age
independently and safely that is why we
came up with the idea of smart phones
we're a team of IT professionals with
over 20 years of experience in wireless
product development we went through many
revisions of the design making sure that
the product is easy to use reliable and
does not require any change of behaviors
from users now we need your help to
bring this product to market to benefit
millions of people please help us to
share this video with your family and
friends and give us any feedback you
have thank you
welcome to Vollrath University I'm chef
rich and today we're here to talk to you
about the red Koh 5.0 unit this manual
processor can do a multitude of
different things it's probably our most
versatile piece because with this piece
you can dice slice wedge and corer so
frightens like peppers onions zucchini
soft vegetables like squash and cucumber
celery diced and sliced very accurately
okay that consistent result each and
every time and fry times like lemons and
limes and apples and oranges pears you
know there we can do the wedging and
coring if we want to core that product
as well so with this one piece of
equipment we can perform all these
different tasks the blade changing out
on this unit as I said we've got these
four different blades very simply to
change them out on the back we want to
just loosen up this nut pop out the
blade assembly and it's that easy
notice the blade assembly thermoset
plastic the blades are permanently
attached so there's any screws or blades
to attach to this and it's dishwasher
safe again very easy to replace blades
in the 5.0 unit and then how about this
last feature I want to point out to you
here a six inch deep sixth size food pan
slides right underneath the unit so when
we're prepping product right into the
pan how convenient is that our
competitors you can't do that with
talked about the construction notice
this unit is diecast nice smooth finish
easy to clean some of the sand cast
units out there a little bit bumpy or
finish not as easy to clean the sled
design on the leg okay that's for
strength if we were to drop this unit
these are always gonna stay straight so
they don't get that wobble much more
sturdy design and even the uprights much
easier to replace should you ever need
to replace these let's say the unit gets
dropped in these get bent on the bottom
there's simply a nut you loosen it out
change out the upright tighten it back
up our competitors you have to tap out a
little pressure pin and that's not
always so easy to do take my word for it
so that's the red kool 5.0 let me show
you how this unit works
well so after cutting all these fruits
and vegetables the slide rods are made
smooth if they should ever get little
tacky or gummy never a vegetable oil
we recommend petrol gel it's a product
we sell a little bit on each one right
back to normal so there you have it the
5.0 what a versatile piece of equipment
it is remember we dice we can slice we
can wedge and we can corer all from this
one piece of equipment okay remember
this is speed much faster that we can do
with a knife or any other traditional
means savings of labour we can have
those less experienced workers provide
these consistent results each and every
time and also take advantage of locally
grown sourced fruits and vegetables okay
organic much better processed here on
site versus somewhere else with they
have to use chemicals to prevent the
oxidation remember my dad always said
fresh is best
should you have any problems with these
products remember all the red coal
products full two-year warranty and the
support of a Vollrath technical support
team you should have any questions about
this or other products please give us a
