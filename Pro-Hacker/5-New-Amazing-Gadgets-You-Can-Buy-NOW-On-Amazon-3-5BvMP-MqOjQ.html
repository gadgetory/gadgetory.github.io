start with an idea make coffee just
kidding
I'm drink coffee gets the design kill
the design thinks more get out the
sewing machine take a seat sit on it
stop sitting star ceiling find it found
it tested back to the drawing board
chair chair chair let's do this free
machine it welded brandish reveal it
give it a leather seat give it red
stitching give it a shiny paint job give
it a handle for precise steering did I
mention it spins passing it get it in
the newspaper tighten it again we're on
a mission to make a product that is not
only unique but fun as well when you're
sitting 5 inches off the ground suddenly
every tree becomes an obstacle every
ramp becomes an opportunity and every
corner becomes a trip
spin-spin-spin you're way too happy
find your path or your turn because in
the end it's all about the feelings and
the excitement
this is what you've been waiting for
health escapes always had potential to
be a lot of fun growing up but the
technology just wasn't good enough to
let us do what we really wanted back in
1997 we set out to turn pogo sticks into
a whole new sport our concept was based
on the idea of having a portable
trampoline something you can jump three
six or even ten feet high on but also
take any where you want to go the v4 is
the portable trampoline Pete always
dreamed them with the v4 you have the
ability to add a remove air and
completely change the stiffness of the
balance someone who weighs 300 pounds
can jump on the same exact v4 with
someone who only weighs 80 pounds all
you need to do is change the air
pressure in less than a minute
you can perfectly tune the v4 to each
riders preferences pumping more air in
to jump higher and taking air out to
jump lower this makes sharing it with
friends and family a fun-filled
experience that everyone can enjoy
you can also collapse the v4 to make
transportation a breeze whether you're a
pro or just stepping onto the v4 for the
very first time you'll love the wait
list flight like experience you'll get
the basics in minute and from that point
on there's no limit to how far you can
challenge yourself if the v4 you'll be
able to jump up onto ledges down stairs
and over gaps of all sizes while mailing
down some pretty awesome tricks after
playing around on the v4 you'll never
look at your surroundings in the same
way again obstacles and features that
are too high for bikes and skateboards
for the before so those of you looking
for a fun way to stay in shape the be
for will worth most of the muscle groups
in your body and get your heart pounding
immediately it's a killer cardio workout
and the best part is that while you're
having fun bouncing around you won't
even realize how quickly you build a
sweat in order to achieve superior build
quality and maintain the high tolerance
is necessary for the v4 to work we
manufacture and assemble it right here
in our Southern California shop we work
closely with our suppliers to become a
part of the build process and as each
component is made or right there to test
them
this streamlines our manufacturing and
ensures that every before we make is up
to our standards if you're looking for
the portable trampoline that we always
dreamed of v4 is going to knock your
socks off whether you want to use it
simply for exercise or to jump eight
feet high and do crazy tricks on is up
to you and we know you'll love every
second of it join us and help change the
way pogo sticks Racine forever
this is Harrison he loves a good game of
ping pong but finding a competitive
partner is hard
Shane is unbeatable not fun
catherine is still learning also not fun
and Matthew now there's a great partner
but he's not always around introducing
trainer lot
it's your new ping-pong partner that's
always available and always competitive
they can shoot any spin anywhere on a
table on any table it's got the accuracy
of a machine triple its size put a fist
in your back and it's the first of its
kind that lets you control all of this
from your phone trainer bot lets you
pick a setting that's perfect for you
beginners can practice this for hands
and slow easy shots just choose location
spin type and a slow interval as you
improve Printrbot grows with you you can
create a sequence that involves multiple
shots like forehand and backhand and for
advanced players the Printrbot becomes
unpredictable you can make issues
randomly at maximum speed in close games
there's no feeling like hitting that
epic shot those moments are rare but
they don't have to be this trainer box
can recreate any match situation hit a
hundred smashes slice a thousand shots
it never misses having trouble beating
your friends
trainer la can turn their toughest shots
into drills with enough practice we'll
leave them next time and never wait
another tutorial trainer Bob transforms
hours of YouTube into hours of gameplay
it's also designed to help people
connect regardless of their experience
level now anyone can play together
without holding back or feeling
outmatched
it's your ultimate ping pong partner it
was so much fun especially that crazy
setting where the suits everywhere I'm
kind of sweating a little bit right now
within 20 seconds I was already starting
to make small adjustments to how I was
holding the paddle it was very emotional
it started out in the team but then it
got so much harder I mean there's
something for every skill level I've
actually played to Vaughn robot before
not actually blew my mind
hi Kickstarter I'm Alec and I'm Harrison
me and my brother always try to kick
each other's ass while we play ping pong
so we start shooting first turn about
with just a garbage can to just search
for us to smash but later on we find out
with app and software you can do a lot
more you can simulate game you can
create your own drills and the coolest
part is you can share those drills with
anyone in the world three months ago we
decided to join hacks which is the
world's largest hardware accelerator we
source a lot of motors and we also
designed all the mechanism from the
ground up to give you the fun experience
that we want you to have we have talked
to many manufacturers now now the last
part it's just toiling and Kickstarter
that's why we need your help please like
and share this campaign on Kickstarter
so we can bring turnabout to you thank
you
