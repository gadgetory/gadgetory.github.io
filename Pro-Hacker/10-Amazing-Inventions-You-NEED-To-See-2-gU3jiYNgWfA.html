you were able to swim explore and dive
while your camera follow
hi I'm Ben and this is Kevin
well divers go into exploring marveling
at the beauty of the ocean and bringing
back memories of our underwater
adventures if you're like us you know
how cool it is to share your diving
experiences with people online you also
know how filming gets in the way of
simply enjoying the moments which is why
we dive in the first place that's why a
year ago we had the dream with imagine
an autonomous underwater drone that
follows you during your - lets you
capture beautiful footage hands-free so
you can focus on the diving now above
all is in path of becoming a reality
this camera is completely autonomous
autonomous means that you don't have to
do anything at all
we've created and patented an underwater
localization technology it enables
ibubble
to know where you are and to keep you or
your surroundings in the frame now you
can record your diving adventures with
no camera handling whatsoever ibubble
comes loaded with a built-in library of
carefully designed camera movements all
you have to do is choose your shot from
the control bracelet and I bubble
executes the results are incredible
beautiful underwater footage from
completely new perspectives you might
wonder how I bubble performs when you
have let's say a specific close-up to
shoot good question you just call I
bubble back with your bracelet grab it
and film as you want
when you're done let ibubble go and it
goes right back to follow mode we've all
dreamed of following a telltale or month
away while it swim fast and far away
so we've enabled eye beable to do jet
dance all by itself press the target
locking button for a few seconds and
ibubble will recognize the shape it
needs to follow release it and watch as
it glides by turtles and sharks
capturing what's out of your reach we've
designed all the features in close
collaboration with the diving community
and professionals from the underwater
world gonna be consumed on fuji bubbles
affected on the bottom cap least GCE
domine Google Yahoo Beliebers uma le
Coon hunts redundant community it wasn't
the same Tom
whoo-yah in that competence to vet is a
doctor shrine can be able to know keep
it on longer you will you this anymore
you know every CEO it's just expands
usually the type of things that I can
create so how does a future presume on
Porsche in the revolution policy on
recidivism I can't wait to have my own
hyperbole today with the work we've done
and the team we've built we know we can
make above all a reality the last thing
we need is your help if we reach our
goal will access the resources needed to
deliver a bubble next year with more
fans will have even more features so by
I beable today thank you from the entire
eyeball team
when I started at Apple Steve's sister
Patti was plugging the chips onto the
boards on the coffee table in the living
room while she watched the GOG show I'm
pretty much the person who built most of
the Macintosh prototypes
there was just no access to technology
the way we have it now the Apple one was
a watershed event in terms of price and
capability and the average person being
able to own this computer
Pyne 64 is an improvement beyond my
wildest expectations introducing the
pine 64 the pine 64 is a fully
expandable 64-bit quad-core single board
computer with 1.2 gigahertz 64-bit ARM
Cortex CPU two USB ports in Ethernet
port and a full 4k HDMI output the pine
64 has everything you need to build your
next projects purchase the basic unit to
run Linux or Android or add-on
components to create your own custom
computer we're constantly developing new
modules for the pine 64 platform such as
a 5 megapixel camera Bluetooth 4.0 and
Wi-Fi card lithium battery or even an
LCD touch panel just to name a few
the pine 64 also has two i/o expansion
ports compatible with many other
components such as z-wave signe and x10
for the price of a meal the pine 64 is a
fully fledged computer it's versatile
it's modular and it's more powerful than
most of the competition on the market
we're at open up our excited about the
endless possibilities that the
combination of the pine 64 and open up
are conferring so having really a board
that works well with open hub this
really are perfect starting point for
many many more users and it means that
smart home technology becomes more
easily accessible with access to over
1.6 million Android apps on the market
today the pine 64 really can be your
most affordable 64-bit computing
platform run office apps watch full 4k
videos stream from apps like Netflix and
play games or more we're fully
compatible with Android lollipop 5.1 for
Mbutu linux openhab and more be one of
the first to join the pine 64 community
and with your help we can create more
modules and software to bring affordable
computing to all would we have ever
believed we would have the $15.00
supercomputer no I wouldn't believe that
it's a big step just from the Raspberry
Pi to the pine it's still hard to
believe that it's associated in today's
fast-paced and demanding world more and

hi IndieGoGo two years ago we came to
you with an idea of an innovative
gadgets that checks your vitamin and
mineral levels using a smartphone
together we successfully launched the
dusty smart device the right dollar-wise
Vita stick is a nutrient status tracker
it's an innovative gadget that checks
your vitamin and mineral levels using a
smartphone
based on the readings Vitas dick
provides personalized nutrition advice
you can easily keep track of your
progress as the app saves the previous
readings your feedback and support
encourage us to improve even more now
we come back to you and proudly present
our updated version with us pictu vita
stick to is Wireless and made of
titanium with a lighter more durable
body and a rechargeable battery
it offers even more quality it's easier
to use and more precise thanks to
bluetooth Vita stick 2 has a better
compatibility with smartphones and
tablets vita stick uses a method called
electroacupuncture
that has been applied for decades to
track imbalances in the human body
through the electrical conductivity
measured at the specific acupuncture
points
our first campaign far exceeded its
original IndieGoGo funding goal and
delivered perks to all of the backers on
time
we also got acknowledgments from many
professionals and from our users
join our global community of realistic
users support with a stick tool and be
the first together device at a special
in the gold price nice hi my name is Tim
Cheung with PRG I'm here to present the
hobby hand and we made some improvements
to mimic the human hand better so what
the hobby hand is is not only a hardware
but also comes with a micro controller
where he can control software also the
breadboard on the back you can actually
add expandability so you can add
different analog sensors like a sound
sensor of buzzer a light sensor
important steps to control the hobby
have any mana you which you desire - it
also comes with a manual controller so
if you just want to play with finger
movements directly you can just slide on
this mini mixer board that we
the biomechanical robotics group
envision the future where we can provide
affordable 3d printed aesthetic ends for
those who are in need of them and the
point of the Hobby hand is not only to
educate but provide a platform for other
users to develop code and in sensors
that may be helpful for this community
in the future so not only are we working
on hardware design but we're looking to
minimize and maximize the space of all
these different motors so the idea is
that all the functionality of the Hobby
hand will be in the hand itself for
example this hand was actually developed
after my own hand and that actually
shares the same size and rough diamonds
the BRT needs to be funded so that we
can provide the next generation of
future engineers scientists tinkerers to
start a base development for not only
the prosthetic markets but everything
else that comes in contact with
emerging markets of our best technology
and Internet of Things
thank you for begging us we hope you
enjoy the rice I could not imagine that
a time will come I'll be able to easily
observe all that has meaning for me it's
a dock station I needed anyways I chose
the one that fits my style thanks to a
software I can turn the camera on no
matter how far I am z-tech is really
fabulous using it I'm able to oversee
everything that's happening in my house
it's equipped with intuitive controls my
friends appreciated
actually loved it
however what our friends is slightly
disappointed my wife doesn't miss the
precious moments and no longer worries
about her baby at my workplace it became
irreplaceable and found out who is
stealing my ideas and exposed his and to
be honest we all feel much better
we know our grannies are okay wow it is
so cool and inexpensive for now although
of course there are things that are
rather left unseen
hi my name is Annie um though I know you
love simple life focusing on a variable
matters how awesome is it mochi is
simple and austere just like you
we found the keyboard and mouse are
never used simultaneously kissin was why
not share the space the simplicity can
be acquired simply but finally we found
the best solution
mochi provides you with the best typing
experience by a slim pantograph keyboard
thin and safe laser sensors generate a
large optical touchpad at the exact
moment you want to use it
Bluetooth Low Energy Technology assures
an extended battery life the gorgeous
aluminum body makes mochi more slim and
durable the cover of mochi not only
protects the keyboard from damage but
also it turns into a portable device
staff of course mochi never compromises
its style for great performance
play the book mocking in a simple and on
the satellite you
