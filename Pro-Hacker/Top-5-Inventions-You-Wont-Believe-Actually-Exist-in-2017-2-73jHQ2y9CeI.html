while is a revolutionary chemical which
could run with any kind of dry biomass
I'll use some branches small batteries
or even a solar panel what makes all the
magic possible the well-known technology
named pyrolysis but unlike traditional
pyrolytic so we found a way to make the
process simple stable smoke-free and
totally also take a traditional fire it
burns strongly but it wastes a lot of
energy and smoke while smoke itself has
a lot of energy what we do is transform
all the biomass into energy this way you
get a clean and reliable flame wherever
you want and for free yes free energy

professional flame you can use to cook
for real and grill as a pro do you know

the environment all the waste produced
by the gas tanks or the production of
charcoal you're also avoiding the
production of any pollution responsible

fire is gone is a wonderful biochar an
incredible active charcoal that makes
the ground better and more fertile we
designed our stove to be the best
companion at our outdoor adventure it is
minimal this compact and all the design
features are strictly linked to its
operation we made it in two sizes to let
