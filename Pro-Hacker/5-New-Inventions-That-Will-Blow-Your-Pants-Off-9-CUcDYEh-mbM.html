distances and the dimensions of
different objects
but a measuring tape doesn't work in
every situation
why isn't there a single tool that lets
us measure everything now there is
introducing bagel the smart tape measure
bagel lets you measure just about
anything at home and at work
bagel has three different modes spring
mode wheel mode and remote mode string
mode is great for measuring straight
lines curves and around corners wheel
mode lets you measure irregular or odd
shaped objects and it also makes taking
measurements with one hand much easier
remote mode lets you measure objects
that are far away and out of your reach
after you're done measuring you'll need
a way to record your measurements using
pen and paper can be a real hassle with
bagel you can quickly and easily save
your measurements with voice
descriptions just take your measurement
push the Save button and then tag a
voice memo to it dog the future ADA
when you're done bangle will send your
measurements to bagels mobile app via
bluetooth this mobile application lets
you review your saved measurements and
share them with your friends bagel is
precise it uses our patented technology
to make sure you always get an accurate
measurement also bagel has an
easy-to-read digital display that's
viewable in most lighting conditions in
the past few years also measuring
devices have become smarter and made our
lives easier it's not scales smart
thermometers and even smart watches but
when it comes to measuring size we still
use a tape measure which is more than a
century old
why don't you innovate the way we
measure size so we created bagel a smart
tape measure we put a lot of effort into
creating bagel our team work night and
day to make the best quality product
with this friendly design

ready for mass production now we need
your help to deliver this amazing
product to everyone please help us bring

Sylve two are completely we're looking
water sports the retractable hand
patterns put them on and they instantly
feel like part of you are working
alongside industry experts we developed
an innovative hand paddle system that's
lightweight comfortable and able to
power you through the water up to thirty
five percent faster than just using your
hands it's just really amazing you can
really feel the pull of the water
awesome fun they're easy to use you get
out you're putting like a super piracy
on great fun just so much fun I've been
designing paddles for world champions
and Olympians the last 30 years and I
think seal bleeds are an absolutely
fantastic piece of kit the reason that
steel blades work is our unique patented
quick-release system allows you simply
to release your grip and the blade
retracts leaving your hands-free if you
let go and they peg back in it's like
they're not even there and they're just
so clever
they kind of snap back which was felt
cool so a bit like an spider-man is I
mean to actually catch waves and get
into the sport it's a no brainer
we're currently building the tools for
the manufacturing process so we'll have
steel blades produced and ready to ship
later this year we're also offering two
exclusive versions and Kickstarter steel
blades zero for adults and seal blaze
zero rush designed for smaller adults
and teens thanks for watching the video
and please back our campaign
you
again okay let me get mine where is it
no I had it in here don't look at me if
you're passionate about ultimate and
this has happened to you
we're here to help hi Kickstarter I'm
Dave and this is our story I've been
lucky enough to have spent the past 14
years traveling and playing ultimate
every chance I got
I've played in 30 countries on four
continents from joining a team in Buenos
Aires to pick up in a park in India from
China Nationals in Beijing to throwing
around on a beach in Brazil those are
some amazing trips with a lot of great
ultimate but at times it was frustrating
I never found the right bag to get my
gear to the field if it was easy to
carry it was too disorganized or just
not big enough for all my gear if it
rained everything inside would get wet
when I got back home I met up with some
teammates they were all so tired of
trying to make do with bags designed for
other sports
I want a backpack I want a duffel I'm
sick of my water bottle always smell
like sweaty socks where do I put my beer
so we put our heads together drawing on
all collectives and ideas of experience
playing ultimate and a combined 40 years
in manufacturing we set out to make the
bass bass but ultimately we partnered
with a professional bag factory work on
different designs and materials and
after many iterations we created the
greatest bag the greatest bag has an
easy-access
organization system that has been
specifically designed for ultimate you
can comfortably carry your darks lights
and even a sleeping bag you can carry
two pairs of cleats so that a teammate
doesn't have to play barefoot back then
you can keep your snacks energy bars and
accessories handy and organ
and your wallet and phone protected your
wet smelly clothes will never stink up
your other dear it holds up the two
disks securely you can carry it to the
field as a duffel or as a backpack it's
made with water resistant durable rip
stop material and it's the only ultimate
bag with a built-in cooler compartment
you can cool off ice injuries and it
keeps your drinks frosty cold yep
for ultimate players this is our answer
to all those crappy bags you've been
using over the years but this isn't just
a tournament bag the possibilities are
endless
I've had this greatest bag for a week
now just took it to the east coast for a
frisbee trip or the ISO compartment the
rain fly those are two of my favorite
features pretty smooth worked really
well on the airport Lyrae it is very
durable very spacious this great bag
I've used to create the greatest bag our
team has worked for the past two years
and we now have a bag that's blown us
all away and now we need your help
Kickstarter
team up with us to turn our great idea
into your greatest bag
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
