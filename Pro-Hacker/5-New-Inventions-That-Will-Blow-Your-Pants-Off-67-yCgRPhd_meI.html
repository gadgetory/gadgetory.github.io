there are a lot of smart things in this
world a few smart people too and this
smart person looked at this dumb thing
and said I can make this fountain smart
now why in the world would i want this
dumb thing to be smart because the easy
part is the online ordering the dumb
part is the tracking waiting stressing
planning to be standing by my front door
during the all day delivery window where
the carrier guarantees to show up while
I'm in the shower ring the doorbell one
drop off a misdelivery note because we
would want to leave something on this
front porch it's a real pain in my pony
express it's high time someone made the
thing that was invented 100 years ago
smart this is you Sela it's more than a
mailbox for letters it's a mailbox robot
that can see when a package gets dropped
off and sends me a notification through
the app yes there's an app and yes it's
smart even if you're nothing like me
you're probably a one-click purchaser on
the internet just like me so this thing
will transform itself to fit just about
any box so I can order more stuff and
always return it speaking of returning I
can put stuff in there as well and you
sell it will up the carrier know that
it's ready to be picked up it's also got
other useful features like a microphone
for voice messages and security features
like a couple of cameras and one time
use access codes all of which I managed
through the app plus package tracking
online order management and easy access
to retailer support the apps great I
just didn't like that phone
you Stella is like my own teeny tiny
little post office right there by my
front door but you Scylla is not a toy
it's not an excuse to have yet another
connected device it's a responsible way
to protect and manage the things that
are meant just for me the things that
often get left out for people who aren't
me you fella my personal post purchase
package and postal concierge
the world of video game of paramilitary
into the dangerous that's why we work it
to bring interaction with them except
closes again motion controller expired
by the state of art of interaction
design near you might have contracted
the motion of IM very accurate and
precise and give me to provide feedback
on line three kind of
absolutely different because you can
really use it as soon as you get it you
can replace your controller to play your
mobile and personal computer on a place
is livin with the practice exchange in
your life
