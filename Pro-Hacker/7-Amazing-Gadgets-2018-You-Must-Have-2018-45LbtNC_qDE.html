and we gain an understanding about our
world through sight taste touch but
sometimes our senses don't give us all
the information we want now there's a
solution that can help identify things
around you with the click of a button
introducing Linc square SDK a portable
spectrometer and development kit
Linc Square uses visible light to
determine the exact colors of objects
and it uses near-infrared light to
detect their molecular makeup included
in your link Square SDK is a link square
spectrometer a user's guide a set of
sample color chips USB charging cable
and spectral data collection software
connect link Square to a Windows PC
using Wi-Fi next place the link square
in contact with the object of interest
then press the button on the side of the
spectrometer link scale will gather data
on how the object responds to light and
transforms the data into a spectrum
graph as a developer you'll be able to
use the graphs you collect to careen
applications for personal use you can
cream absolute distinguish between
medications validate the authenticity of
gemstones and much more link square can
be deployed in a wide range of fields
such as research pharmacy education food
and environmental studies
strata house engineers have tested the
software auto-type the hardware and
selected manufacturing partners all
that's missing is you
small spectrometer and big possibilities
links where SDK strontium
you
do okie charge is the new keychain cable
for anyone on the go it stays with you
so you never have to worry about missing
a cable mm have I certified by Apple it
works with both Apple and microUSB
mobile devices so making friends is easy
to no matter where you are syncing your
device is a breeze without having to
remove any devices as duo key charge
focuses final revisions product orders
can be placed backers will receive the
first production set after only a month
of campaign completion we want to reach
as many people as possible with this
special discounted price
the duo key charge is a very unique
product it's small is sturdy and it's
flexible it has both microUSB and
lightning connection this is not
uncommon to find but no product in the
market is keychain size and capable of
charging two different devices
this is the world's only dual teaching
cable that is awesome
Apple certified domestic shipping is
free in the US and only seven dollars
for international if you ever find
yourself searching for a charge cable
duo key charge is your answer
yeah okay that sounds good
I'll see you in a bit so you might not
be able to hear that but using Ori I was
able to have a call and that's because
Ori is a voice assistant bring that
turns your finger into a smart phone all
through just a touch of the ear but why
that's because the way in which we're
using our devices is changing changing
from a world where we use screens and
touch to one where we talk now Ori uses
a bone conduction and bone conduction
has been used in many medical great
devices we package it in a way that
ascends vibrations through your finger
directly into years so only you can hear
and that allows you to hear and talk to
just your finger hey man that's music
thanks to bone conduction and the dual
noise cancelling microphone you can hear
and talk even and loud places
so check this out or is perfectly
private and discreet using it makes me
feel just like a secret patient
Inori is more than just a neat gadget
for taking and making calls because
behind it is powerful voice artificial
intelligence a friend Siri and Google
assistant it puts them exactly where you
need them think about all the different
things that you can do and one of my
favorite translation all we have to do
is just motion up words you say Ori how
do I say where are the burritos in
Spanish understand lost burritos and
just like burritos come in different
flavors Ori comes in three different
colors I guarantee you there's an Oreo
ring for every outfit and every occasion
and even better Ori is splash proof -
look guys I know how popular you are and
that's why you have the Ori app because
it helps you filter out everything else
and there's four LED lights that tell
you what kind of messages are coming
through
come on let's hit the streets to see
what people think of already
thousands of people have tried or it and
we're finally ready to start making and
sharing the Ori dream with the rest of
the world and with everything that's
happened I can't help but think of our
inspiration my dad he also happens to be
visually impaired Ori doesn't just help
the visually impaired access something
that had difficulty before smartphones
but in turn they have inspired us to use
our devices in new natural screen
freeways I really want our venture in
darkness to power the screen free
revolution thanks for watching guys
remember to pack us today because one
day with Ori you too can find your voice
robots are here already they are part of
our day-to-day life and in a few years
they will be a basic element in our
lives with thousands of jobs depending
on them that is why it is essential that
young people understand how and why they
are great and how to communicate with
them roboball is the next generation of
educational robot it uses a smartphone
as the brain of the mobile base from
that moment you can program it with your
computer or tablet
robo-moe can feel just like you do see
colors hear sounds recognize faces
shapes sense when you touch him it also
knows how to talk show his emotions and
of course he can move all this thanks to
the combination of rubber bands mobile
base and the existing technology in
current smartphones now available to you
whether you do not know how to program
or if indeed you are already an expert
objects tacks or faces you can also use
speech recognition or some production
gps accelerometers gyroscopes internet
connection all of these together with
the computational power of current a
smartphone's allows you to develop a new
level of projects in educational Robo is
an educational tool to use in the
classroom robots will become an
educational element for classes as such
young people must learn to deal with
them and control them in a natural
manner Robo allows you to learn the
future of Robotics now as it has the
capabilities of robots that will
surround your life
few years time rokubu allows to
incorporate 3d printed parts to extend
its capabilities
so mechanical design is also part of the
educational experience behind the idea
of Roble exists a group of engineers and
researchers with the extensive
experience in the field of robotics our
team is not only being responsible for
the mechanical and electronic design but
also the support software for its
control the hardware of robots typically
limited us in order to provide
high-level functionalities to general
public robotics with Robo Bo the latest
technology becomes available to anyone
interested in learning how to program in
real world
robo-moe can do almost anything you can
imagine just combine the right commands
and see how it comes to life there are
no limits but imagination
robo-moe brings technology closer to
kids and makes it easy and fun this is a
power strip this is a dust bunny this is
a mess of cords plugged into that power
strip this is how the courts feel this
is a doggie pile a traffic jam a cluster
this isn't working this is the pivot
power this is Jake's invention
this is 709 people who helped bring
Jake's idea to life through quirky comm
this is flexible this is not this makes
sense this is how much it costs
this is pivot power this could be yours
at 40 calm
you
