you
my name is Andrew Thomas I'm a
co-founder of skybell we make a video
doorbell that allows a homeowner to see
hear and speak to the person at their
door from a smartphone whether they're
at home at work traveling no matter
where they are they love that they can
always see who's at the door by working
with nest we now have the ability to
give our customers more of what they've
asked for which is monitoring a feeling
of safety a feeling of control by
partnering with nests we can give that
to them in an easy-to-use integration
that just works
we started by brainstorming all the
different user experiences that we could
create we thought to ourselves just
because you can do something doesn't
mean you should so everything that we
decided to go with was look through the
lens of is this a meaningful way to
positively impact people's lives once we
pick the best ones we then spent a
couple of weeks diving into the API
documentation from nest and starting to
build out the technical requirements to
make these user experiences a reality
working with nest cam really helps us
provide the indoor and outdoor coverage
the monitoring which is what our
customers ask for and they say well what
about the inside of my house we've got
the front door covered but with a nest
cam you get coverage inside and outside
your home by working with nest protect
we can help deliver more safety to our
customers if there's a smoke or carbon
monoxide warning sky will can change the
color of the LED button alerting you
that it's not safe to go inside your
home for us the works with nest badge
means that a customer can feel confident
knowing that they can just take out
their sky Bell HD and quickly add it to
their nest cam or their nest protect and
they'll have a seamless cohesive user
experience we knew skybell HD was a
great product but we knew that with the
works in this program we could bring
even more value to our customers that's
the best thing that we get from working
with nest
we have seen advancements in mobile
phone technology that have surpassed our
wildest imagination but the biggest
problem with these devices is that they
rely on batteries and more often than
not these batteries are unable to hold a
charge the devices have evolved but the
charging technology has not until now
introducing sonic cable from blue tech
industries with Sonic's innovative
engineering you will have the ability to
charge your device twice as fast when
you're done syncing data slide the
switch to the on position and instantly
go into Sonic mode unleashing double the
charge power of a regular charging cable

time
sonic Cable was created to be the most
advanced charge cable on the market with
absolutely no feature left out its
innovative dual sided USB technology

what it's also built to last with
aluminum connectors on both ends it

guarantee
sonic cable is Apple MFI certified and
20 percent longer than your normal USB
charge cable so you can be sure it'll
reach when you need it - engineered with
braided nylon fiber and five stylish
colors sonic cable is 25 percent thicker
than a standard USB cable making it more
durable and tangle free a few months ago
we launched slim sure here on IndieGoGo
and it was a huge success The Slim sure
campaign surpassed its funding goal by
more than seven times over help us bring
sonic cable to the market by supporting
our IndieGoGo and hopefully together we
can bring this innovative product to the
market
our phones are the most important
devices in our lives they revolve us and
help us capture the most intimate
moments and communicate with the world
but they never seem to get us through
today and we always find ourselves
plugged into the wall we're always on
the go and need a wire free solution
that's completely mobile and highly
versatile however nothing quite like it
exists that's why we created consume the
ultimate iPhone 6 wireless charging case
when we first envisioned the perfect
iPhone case we wanted to create one
which was extremely thin and wire free
Zook delivers a full 100 percent charge
to your iPhone allowing you to get
through your entire day with full
on-the-go battery charge
we've spent countless hours
reformulating and tweaking our product
to make it the best it could possibly be

phone and resists from bumps Falls and
scratches and has a built-in LED
indicator on the back letting you know
exactly how much juice is left at any
given time and when your battery pack
needs a recharge of its own simply plug

charger pad for instant charging our
on-the-go bundle easily and comfortably
travels with you wherever you go are you
tired of going through iphone cable

phone made with nylon braiding and
strong enough for your everyday life
hidden beneath the nylon braiding is a
steel encasing they'll prevent your
cable from frame
this product is so well made we back it
with the lifetime warranty
when we take a project like the iPhone
and we create an accessory spirit the
most important thing for us is to not
compromise the very things that make the
iPhone the iPhone what we have done is
create an intelligent case that doesn't
jeopardize the sleek and lightweight
body of the iPhone they led us to create
something that we couldn't even imagine
before the lone case
the case becomes a part of your
professional or social image it's such a
simple way to make your phone more about
you it's fun stylish and very effective
the accessories market is overpopulated
with different types of cases different
sizes shapes colors and materials but
what we've done is designed an
intelligent product that not only
increases the functionality of your
phone but most importantly the usability
it's great having a case it frees you
from the limits of your home now
imagine you have a smartphone but a
smart case it captures electromagnetic
waves from around the iPhone and uses it
to power the notifications on the back
of the kids room case in the back of
your phone to life the case lights up
and identifies which message that we
have incoming on your device therefore
your phone even knows to get an
additional way to receive notifications
without compromising iPhone
functionality it's not just not offense
accessory for your smartphone the case
can work with you and let you know
what's going on in your life the coolest
thing about our case there with no
batteries and no cords you take it
straight out of the box put it on your
phone and you're ready to go
due to our frequent use of the iPhone
battery power drains quickly and
charging has become an unavoidable and
frustrating problem our commitment is to
not only make a better external battery
but to improve the charging experience
itself the results of this commitment is
cabin cabin is designed to be perfectly
combined with the iPhone aluminum
unibody construction enables cabin to be
both thin and light preserving the
iPhone solid build quality without
adding unnecessary bulk with our
specially designed micro adapter cabin
can be easily connected and fixed to the
iPhone the magnetic connection is fast
precise and flexible
inside cabin is a 2,200 milliamp per
hour lithium battery helping to extend
iPhones life almost one-and-a-half times
thanks to the non wrapped design use of
aluminium cabin retains the great in
hand feel of the iPhone in order to make
charging even more convenient we have
designed a special duct and lightning
adapter to work with Kevin allowing you
to easily charge your iPhone and cabin
both at home and on the road initially
we considered Wireless electromagnetic
charging but this would have required a
very large external case to house the
induction coils we then discovered the
most convenient way to charge iPhone is
with the magnetic connection similar to
the bag safe power cord on MacBook this
is much more effective than other
charging designs and is simply a joy to
use when in need of a charge cabin is
extremely easy to snap onto your iPhone
allowing you unimpeded and continued use
cabin is the modern battery for iPhone
with a humanized design and we believe
it represents the most perfect charging
experience yet
the Bluetooth headset is a great thing
it prevents tickets and accidents when
we're driving and it allows us to use
our hands to do other things but it has
some problems
hey can can you hold on I have to just
find my earpiece hold on one sec how
many of them have you lost how many new
ones have you bought how many times did
you wish to head one only to realize it
was dead or left in your car hey man I'm
gonna have to put you onto the car
speaker I can't find my headset I just
want to say not to bring the thief to
the party tonight he's really weird and
no one likes fortunately you're not the
only one who was looking for a solution
to this problem on three has been
working with the largest friends and
factories in the world and has recently
developed patented and prototype the
world's first all-in-one blue to a 4.0
hat set with a battery charging case
that is ready for a call when you are
the power click is the most simple most
user-friendly headset on the market have
a call just click it out and start
talking when you're done click it back
in to hang up there's even a smart
charging app that allows you to
determine when the automatic charge
activates so it won't burn out your
phone battery like most other cases on
the market the I stand 6 is a
multifunctional power case designed
specially for iPhone 6 users not only is
it a charging case but it also functions
as a vertical stand and includes a micro
SIM card box
which greatly frees the users hand with
your I stand six wherever you may be

out of battery travel is a key part of
many people's lives ensuring your phone
has sufficient battery is sometimes a
struggle however you wouldn't realize
the importance of an external battery
case until you feel embarrassed that
you've run out of power whenever you
arrive to a function or hotel the first
thing you do is charge your phone so you
don't miss any business calls or
important notifications the I stand six
packs at 3100 mAh battery which provides
an extra 100 70 % charging power for
your iPhone 6 with the I stand you won't

all in love with smartphones and tablets
while you get the hottest phone the
number one tech problem remains weak
battery life introducing you speedy the
first charging cable that not only
doubles your charging speed but also
maximizes battery life with healthier
longer-lasting charges featuring LED
indicator
magnetic ends durable exterior
and the right length
our devices it's smarter each year but
the charger still gets messy it breaks
and it slowly kills the precious battery
with heat and mini sights so experts
warn us don't leave your fully charged
phone plugged in lithium ion batteries
can overheat when charged or too long
samsung says unplug once charge is
complete and Apple tells us remove
certain cases during charging but we
can't always follow them Canada that's
why we created you speak once fully
charged you speedy cuts off the power
completely so you don't have to unplug
removing battery damages overnight and
extending battery life the next day when
you finish syncing simply touch the
button to switch into smart and fast
mode now you speedy charges your phone
twice as fast cutting your charging time
in half

ends next to your bed in your car
on your desk behind your desk top each
you speedy cable comes with a durable
and colorful braided exterior so no more
frayed or tangled cords you deserve
better charging experience imagine

hello my name is Patrick Gallagher and
I'm the co-founder and CEO of scroller
and one of the inventors of new peak
when developing new Pig our idea was not

generally lack using innovative optical
illumination architecture new peak
combines the advantages of several
advanced contrasting techniques when
using standard microscope slides remove
the microscope slide holder from the
adhesive back of new peak attach the
device to your phone
insert the microscope slide into the
holder and start working it's so simple
and powerful so don't be surprised if it
becomes a professionals first choice
new peak makes a great tool to teach
advanced microscopy at high schools and
universities where cost is naturally a
concern new peak not only helps to save
finances but also saves valuable shelf
space and thanks to MU Peaks excellence
portability project works are no longer
restricted to indoor locations students
can work directly in the field easily
record and share the pictures while
their smartphone and above all have fun
learning because music is so sleek it
may continue to be attached to your
smartphone and go into your pocket
almost unnoticed however once in wheeled
it will certainly catch the attention of
your friends give them a hands-on
illustration of new peak and sent them
the microscopic pictures taken by your
favorite social networks with our
spin-off companies Crona we are in the
ongoing development of a 3d printer with
nano scale resolution while being
designed to showcase the results of our
prototype printer new peak generated
such overwhelming performance and
utility feedback that we decided to make
it even better and transform it into a
standalone product so why buy a new peak
you not only buy a great product you
also support the further development of
our early stage printing technology into
the next game-changing platform of 3d
printing
