hi I'm Simon
creator of Geco hub and nimble and I'm
back on Kickstarter to get mo boo into
the hands of everyone frustrated by
troubles and cables I've tried many ways
of organizing earphones and charge
cables over the years and have never
found the one solution that solved
everything mo boo is that solution the
way mobi works is simple you clip it
around any cable size from skinny
earphones all the way up to thick USB
cables once in place Moby's modular
design snaps together keeping your
cables organized
Moe boo is based on a mathematical
theory that cables with ends attached
together in a loop far less likely to
tangle the cables or loose ends mobile
is great for out and about wherever you
are but it doesn't stop there either
with Mobe connect you can put Mobutu
work at your desk or around the house to
and you know what maybe works with other
stuff as well we are coming to
Kickstarter because we've got mobu as
far as we can on our own now we need
your help in taking the last steps
finalizing tooling with the factory and
meeting the factory's high minimum order
quantities if you like mobu there are
two ways you can really help support our
campaign first place you get mobi for
yourself or as a gift and second share
this campaign with a close friend who
you know would love this handy clip
you
bearable techies the flavor of the
season from Motorola to Samsung
everybody seems to be inspired by the
unexpected success of wearable computing
devices
Motorola's latest wearable the Moto 360

still in the Stone Age when it comes to
wearable devices the SmartWatch market
is still in the early stages with the
success of Pebble watch the fitness and
wellness market has seen initial
momentum with activity monitors like
Nike FuelBand and Fitbit activity
tracking bands but in the future we
could expect new wearable form factors

typical wearable device used on the
lines of Apple's rumored eye ring nokia
fit concept phone looks like a real deal

completely waterproof notifications like

notified through vibrations the wearable

buttons thanks to the ergonomic design

to shed light on one single core feature
of the nokia fit fitness generally
activity trackers and fitness devices
will help you track your stats going by
the name

sort of feature built-in that would help
