it's virtually impossible for modern
writers to stay focused using
traditional computers and that's why we
created traveller the portable
distraction free writing tool the travel
enables you to finish your novel finish
your blog post finish your paper finish
your screenplay whatever you're working
out whatever your writing and enables
you to get that done faster and more
creatively traveller is our brand-new
distraction free writing tool that we've
taken all of the feedback and all of the
comments about our original free right
smart typewriter and put it into a brand
new ultra portable small compact folding
product that's also available at a lower
cost so the way the traveller works is
it really is as simple as turning it on
and you can start writing you sit down
you start writing it's all saved locally
on the device and as soon as you're
connected to a network it seamlessly
backs up to the cloud I think laptops
rightfully so I've gotten a very bad
name for their keyboard designs as we've
kind of gone for slimmer and slimmer
keyboards we've lost through this typing
experience and so for us when we were
designing traveller it was really
important for us to think about how can
this be the best keyboard for the store
the writing's Gordon I think one of the
things that was really important to us
when we designed the traveller was the
battery life we knew that writers love
to travel they love to be inspired by
the environments they're in the
traveller has about 30 hours of battery
life of continuous use so this is the
device really can't take with you unlike
a traditional LCD that's found in your
laptop or your phone
we used gig ink is a unique type of
technology that allows actual ink
particles to come to the surface of the
display the best thing about a ink is
that you can use it outside and it works
in every environment with a long battery
life and the eing screen it is the
ultimate distract
we've shipped the original three right
smart typewriter to customers in over 50
countries all around the world and what
we've heard consistently from them is
that it's helping them actually double
their hourly work count so whereas
before some of writers may have written
in four to five hundred words now
they're writing 800 to a thousand words
per hour and that dramatically improves
their productivity and is able to
actually help them get there running but
for me one of the things that has
continuously inspired me and
continuously kind of has enabled me to
put like my whole heart into it is that
the people that are using free rights
and the people that will be using
travellers are making amazing thing
making works of art they're literally
pursuing their dreams with our product
and I think that is just the most
inspiring thing the traveller is in
prototype form and working great it's
based off of the freeride platform and
so we have a clear path to production
but we still need your help to be able
to deliver the product to you in the
spring of next year join us and be part
of our mission to help writers
everywhere break free from distraction
join our campaign and let's
revolutionize how the world writes
