user friendly your maxvill could easily
fall off the table by accident VIN
Possible's makes charging easier with

let's talk about taking the perfect
photo first compose the shot
check the histogram adjust the exposure
focus on your subject compute the
hyperfocal distance to keep everything
sharp enable bracketing to get more
dynamic range add a neutral density
filter update the exposure and then take
the shot we built a better way
today's DSLR mirrorless cameras have
amazing optics and sensors but they do
very little to actually help you take a
good photo
finding the right sentence involves a
series of complex techniques and
formulas as an engineer with a
background in artificial intelligence I
knew I could build a tool to simplify
the process I wanted something that
would let me focus on the composition
but would handle the details for me so I
created arsonist the world's first AI
photography assistant with one tap
Arsenal fine settings take the best
photo possible Arsenal's AI searches
thousands of images in its database -
suggested setting next it fine Tunes the
suggestions by analyzing 18 different
factors Arsenal uses state-of-the-art
machine learning to help you take a
great photo in any condition
well sure
many of the memorable shots you see
today are captured by combining multiple
exposures through a labor-intensive
process called photo stacking with
Arsenal you can do this in second
capture all the details and scenes with
high dynamic range get everything in
sharp focus and create long exposures
without buying expensive filters using
these advanced techniques Arsenal lets
you go beyond the limitations of your
camera sense of hurl in four times when
you want complete control you can
wirelessly adjust manual settings see a
live preview and trigger the shutter all
from up to 100 feet away
Arsenal also improves the experience of
reviewing photos in the field you can
flip through the photos on your camera
zoom in to check out details at full
resolution then share your favorite
photos right from your phone
and finally Arsenal makes it easy to
capture stunning time-lapse

changing lights giving you a smooth
day-to-night transition you can even
watch a high-def preview of your

mastered manual shooting or you just
bought your first DSLR Arsenal can help
take your photography to the next level

the IOT smart home light switch

this sleek sexy fixture will transform
your home and the way you connect with
it instant cloud connection to your
smartphone giving you full control of
settings and displays usage data now
that it's available on crowdfunding you
advantage
over the past few years the smartphone
has become the single most important
communication device that we use on a
daily basis no matter where we are we
need it to stay in contact with those
around us however smart phones are
entirely dependent on a communication
infrastructure that they use what
happens when this infrastructure becomes
unreliable or is non-existent for
instance when we are out in the wild
traveling abroad when there are too many
users congesting the network or when a
natural disaster locks down existing
cellular towers that's when we created
the sonic a wireless communication of
ice that enables your smartphone to send
for instant messages voice recordings
image data and GPS locations even when
there is no internet access or cellular
coverage how does it work
simply connect your smartphone to the
Wi-Fi access point on the phone and it
will transmit the data sent from your
phone to other sonic users via
long-range radio frequency no cellular
data no satellite service and no monthly
subscription the typical range for
point-to-point communication with the
sonnet is approximately five kilometres
for three miles
it also supports mesh networking that
can dramatically increase the defective
range by securely relaying data to other
sonic devices in the area the sonic is
designed specifically for use in the
outdoors it is rated ip6
meaning that it's duct tight and
water-resistant the sonic is powered by
a four thousand milliamp hour battery
that allows you to use it continuously
for up to 24 hours as a built-in USB
port so that you can even charge your
phone with it on the software side is
the sonnet app an intuitive instant
messenger that draws upon the familiar
user experience in addition the sonnet
app comes with useful features such as
offline map and real-time location
sharing so that you always know where
you are in relation to your friend in
the case of an emergency the stone adapt
has a panic button which will activate
the SOS mode broadcasting your distress
call in your current GPS location to any
sonnet users in range we've been
developing the sonnet for over a year
now and we're super excited for
possibilities prototypes are now
complete and we're ready to move ahead
full production that's where you come in
we're looking for your support to bring
this form of decentralized communication
into the mainstream
the sana is just the beginning and we're
so grateful for you to be a part of it
thank you for your help
hi I'm dr. Jason Wirthlin founder and
head of performance development at there
again if there again is for
chiropractors physical therapists
trainers and athletes and anyone that's
active the benefits of the faragon is it
increases blood flow decreases lactic
acid and interrupts the pain cycle in
the brain I've seen the most success
with both Aragon in athletes within
minutes loosen up their muscles and go
out and perform the way they need to
we all have our own routines what we
like to eat how we work out and the best
addition to my routine it's been Paragon
g1 whether it's pre workout or after a
long trip on the road and I'm just
unwinding at home the g1 is unmatched
when it comes to recovery it's
aggressive but it's not painful and I
still as soon as when I use it or dr.
Jason used it on me I mean it's it's
immediate results and it's easy to use
it's not heavy its lightweight you can
travel with it so I like that there are
going a lot better
the g1 is absolutely the real did I used
on my quads calves hip flexor I use it
everywhere it helps create blood flow
where you have knots or scar tissue the
ther gun is better than anything
currently in the market because it's
lightweight easy to use battery-operated
handheld mobile and go anywhere with you
with a really strong amplitude which is
the distance the head travels the
feedback on this Aragon has been
unanimously positive period I love going
outdoors staying connected with great
mother nature and staying connected with
family and friends I love sharing my
adventures but I've realized that it's
really hard to get access to electricity
to stay connected outdoors
the thing is today's mobile devices use
significantly less power than
traditional consumer electronics so one
day I came up with the idea what if we
could convert every energy resource into
personal power I want to introduce you
to e stream it's a portable water
powered generator
it converts any type of running water
into stored energy you can get personal
on-demand power with nothing but water
energy cool this is how it works
remove the cover unfold the turbines and
lock them hook and release eastream into
running water let it spin freely to
generate electricity and it charges the
built in battery it takes approximately
4.5 hours to fully charge one B screen
which can charge up to 3 smartphones
GoPros for tablet PCs 2 times faster
than charging through an outlet
you can also use it as a lantern with
four different modes even underwater
eastream works well even in weak current
or behind a kayak and regardless of the
weather or time of day
it fits perfectly into any sized
backpack it's ideal for use while you
enjoy camping fishing kayaking biking or
any other outdoor activities we didn't
start it just to charge a smartphone at
the campsite we wanted to provide a
personal own demand energy our goal is
to discover every energy resource around
you and convert them into your own power
we've been working hard to get here to
meet you
our journey has just begun
please join us in our adventure let's
embark on this journey together stay
connected as one line irreverence are
gone yes they love do things run thank
you thank you
