and my team at mine HELOCs that have to
do meet Rico your smart home security

Oh
Oh
Oh
you
Oh
it's no secret that mobile devices are
becoming increasingly powerful and more
useful everyday we live in incredible
times where smartphones and evil us to
work like stay connected and share
experiences from anywhere in the world
unfortunately most smartphone batteries
die before the end of the day if you're
out and about you will need a charging
cable that travels with you we've
studied these challenges and created a
charging solution that's compact enough
to take on the go easy enough to share
incompatible with 90% of devices this is
LightWire your key to secure hassle-free
charging for all Lightning and micro USB
devices it's the fastest smallest and
safest dual charging cable in the world
we design light wire to be the most
compact little charging cable on the
market it easily fits into the palm of
your hand so you can attach it to your
keys drop it in your back or put it in
your pocket they never have to worry
about charging your device's again light
wire is universal and combines the two
most widely used connectors until one
charging cable it's easy to share with
anyone whether they use an iPhone or
Android device it's the only charging
cable you will ever need when you need
to use a public charging station or
someone else's computer light wire
prevents accidental syncing and data
exchange protecting your data and
personal information we knew you don't
always have a lot of time to charge your
devices
that's why we engineered like wires to
charge your mobile devices at this speed
of a light it's up to twice as fast as
regular cables allowing you to top off
your battery quickly during those times
you're away from the wall and it's tough
enough to expend whatever comes along
during your day we made light wire
unforgettable it comes in five colors
selections so you'll always have a
charging cable that fits your style and
we've kept the price of small just
eleven dollars for the past seven months
we have created the fastest smallest and
save this dual charging cable you will
ever find and now we are ready to
produce it so join the compact dual
charging revolution and let's take
charge of our device this is snap tip
without switching to a custom app just
place your phone on top and press print
a few seconds later you'll have a
beautiful Polaroid photo of your phone
screen snapjet
is a slim portable instant film printer
for your smartphone it's like a tiny
photocopy machine you can bring anywhere
the best thing about snapchat is its
simplicity all you need to do is put
your phone on top press one button and
you get a flawless photo
it doesn't need any apps wires or
bluetooth to function with snapchat the
possibilities are endless if you can see
it you can print it
imagine a birthday card with a selfie
that was taken 30 seconds ago what about
printing a custom business card at your
next meeting snapchats text is sharp and
clear never be caught with an outdated
business card again and next time
instead of running a giant expensive
photobooth for your special occasion why
not use a snapchat instead snapchat
prints on Fuji Instax or polaroid 300
films and its innovative design can
support any smartphone Polaroid is near
and dear to my heart as a photographer I
was just really excited about working
with instant film again and I loved that
snapchat was incorporating the use of a
smart phone because it's just so
convenient to take photos we wanted
something that pushed the limits of
what's possible with instant film like
digital effects
to arrest in ink a pocket video that
doesn't require a single batteries
lenticular film and transparencies that
come to life with an Arduino and some
simple LEDs we're actually really
excited to see what people make with
snapjet and where it's used so the
biggest challenge with snapchat was
creating a really slim device we
designed something that takes what would
normally be a lens space of about 150
millimeters and squash it down into just
one millimeter we reached out to David
welfare and paradigm optics we
specialize in all Palmer optical devices
the fiber optic array is the main
component of the synaptic panel
mechanism making the custom order for
snapchat with challenging because there
are material combinations that we had
never done before it basically required
a reconfiguration of the entire oven to
make it work we did all of our
prototyping in-house we use laser
cutting machining and even a
kick-started 3d printer to produce our
first prototypes
once we get funding we'll have the
resources to create our injection mold
tools we'll be able to produce our
printed circuit boards in large
quantities and we'll be able to assemble
our devices snapchats hardware and
software will all be open-source we're
going to release our PCB schematics our
CAD designs and anything else that a
maker would need to hack reprogram and
make it better
one day we envisioned snapchats optical
technology and a printer so slim that it
could be part of a smart phone case
snapchat is an amazing creative tool
it's a great way to connect to preserve
memories and it's really fun by backing
snapjet you're backing the idea that
innovation should be open to everyone
and instant film technology pioneered by
the iconic polaroid company in 1948
still has a few surprises in store for
us now we really need your help on
Kickstarter to back our project and make
snapchat a reality and we won't stop
until it's in your hands
join us in revolutionising instant film
your life changes as it gets smarter and
faster what if you could print anything
anywhere you want at any time
