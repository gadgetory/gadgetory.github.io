our sleep is very important to us so we
decided to do something about it and
redesign every aspect of how beds and
mattresses are made and functions
we're Beluga come from is that we're
trying to utilize modern design and
technology to produce beds that you have
full control so that you can customize
in any way you wish the NCL suspension
system is very unique because it allows
you to control this firmness and it
stays as new throughout the lifespan of
the bed it acts like a spring that is
very soft and it yields itself around
you rather than resist you are climate
control works by using ambient air
already in your room which we then are
able to either heat or let pass through
to in the summertime ventilator to keep
you cool and in the winter time to
actually warm the bed so it's not
chilled when you come to use it we've
incorporated a Vibram massage that's
pressure point rather than a bed being
vibrated it's directly placed in
vibration sensors beneath specific
pressure points in your body because I
was developed to help you navigate your
way in the dark without disturbing your
partner it automatically comes on and we
use an external wireless sensor that
allows the light to come on for a
certain amount of time to help guide you
to and from your bed we also have a
variety of colors that you can choose or
what ambient lighting you'd like when
they come on anti snoring system we
developed because it's just one of the
most disruptive experience you have with
a partner we use our very specialized
air suspension system to change the
angle of which you sleep when snoring is
monitored we have a built-in sensor
within the mattress that is specifically
tuned to pick up your frequency what
sounds when you start snoring this will
change with the tilt of your head and
your neck to both partners separately
the idea of technology in a bedroom is a
challenge and we felt that it was very
important to keep the ambience of the
bedroom technology free and everything
we designed is designed to be invisible
and unseen everything you'd normally
have in your room to create the ambience
you want it's the most important thing
our control of the bed is either through
a nap or you can have our own touch
screen remote control if you wish to use
that beyond that we have obviously the
sleep monitoring system which can
interact with your existing sleep Andriy
technology as wearable or something you
have on your smartphone
or tablet with the help of the IndieGoGo
community we'd like the opportunity to
bring Beluga beds to the mass market we
already have manufacturing in place and
we're ready to take orders for any size
of bed for any continent worldwide
this is Nuria the first window air
conditioner designed with you in mind
Nuria is 40% smaller than standard air
conditioners and less than six inches
tall unlike typical window air
conditioners Nuria lets you keep your
view Nuria is smart using Android or iOS
users can control Nuria remotely or set
a schedule to save power when knowing
his home Nuria can bring fresh air into
your home on those cool september nights
not even central air can do that you
don't have to be a bodybuilder to
install Nuria the lightweight frame is
installed first making secure
installation a breeze other window air
conditioners forced you to hold a heavy
awkward object in place for minutes at a
time with Nuria installation is a
one-person job storage is easy allowing
you to keep it under the bed when not
needed
