breaths we take but by the moments that
take our breath away
our team is dedicated to creating the
perfect gear for your biggest adventure
meet Ali light
360-degrees source of light and safety
you're taking it on a journey with you
its primary objective is to bring vision
emitting high luminescence made for the
most difficult journeys and crafting
with precision
unleash the power by the touch of a
button
the light placed economically in a
revolving manner around your waist makes
you visible and safe from every
direction no matter where you focus all
obstacles on the go are well illuminated
a li light is unintrusive to environment
water-resistant and smart
in case of emergency beacon message
anyone you select
when you explore the magic of the world
alley light gives you freedom to get the
most out of it and brings you back home
safely
introducing the Simtek smart sensor
reinventing security for the things that
you care about it's a small light motion
detector that alerts you when someone
gets into your things every day millions
of guns and other valuables are
supposedly secure and things like
closets jewelry boxes gun safes and
storage units but who's watching your
stuff when you're not around and how do
you truly know it's safe every year up
to 600 thousand guns are stolen and many
are used in suicide accidents and crimes
despite the growing popularity of gun
safes here are the problems
Colonel arms are designed for houses and
not saves gun owners don't want smart
technology that could restrict the use
of their firearms I decided to change
that and that's why I developed sim tech
a simple and effective way to monitor
any enclosed space like your gun safe
the moment your safe is opened sim tech
sends you a text alert over a cellular
connection which is more reliable than
Bluetooth or Wi-Fi it's an extra layer
of security for the things that you care
about it's sleek and portable and it
uses infrared motion and light so there
are no false positives a common problem
for other sensors the battery can last a
full year on a single charge and because
it uses cellular connection you can take
it anywhere in the world without
additional setup I created sim tech to
help people understand what's going on
with their guns and their valuables
someone close to me almost took their
life with a gun and as an alumni of
Virginia Tech I understand all too well
what can happen when guns get into the
wrong hands my gun running friends tell
me that there's no easy way to reliably
monitor their saves but nobody wants a
product that could potentially restrict
the use of their guns and that's why I
developed sim tech a smart sensor that
can be used anywhere in anything to help
keep you and your things safe gun owners
around the country have been testing sim
tech and we've received great feedback
Engineering and design are complete and
we're ready for mass production
so back us today and know when your
belongings are accessed wherever they're
stored
my name is Scott boggy and I'm the
inventor of the goateesaver I wanted to
do a demonstration video for you today
to show you how guys around the world
are using the product to make their
goatee or VanDyke look even better I
wanted to first take and show you how to
adjust the goateesaver
to make it fit your size and your style
of goatee as you can see on the front of
the goateesaver there are three
different adjustments that you can take
and make there is an adjustment that you
can make for the top part closer to your
to the top part of your face and then
there's a middle adjustment that you can
make which will be closer to your mouth
or the bottom this will allow you to be
able to get the size and style of goatee
that you would like to have before I
actually shave with the goateesaver I
also wanted to show you that there's an
adjustment on the back for the
mouthpiece I will tell you that most
people will need to use the mouthpiece
in the default position but you can take
and twist and move the mouthpiece up
higher if you wanted to adjust it on a
different part of your face before you
take and shave with the goateesaver it's
important to use a trimmer to get your
goatee or VanDyke to the link that you
want to have it before shaving with the
goateesaver on the top of the
goateesaver there is a place that will
allow you to line the product up with
the center of your nose that way you
know that the goateesaver is straight on
your face
once you have the goateesaver placed on
your face and you begin to shave it
isn't very important not to move
the goateesaver until you're finished
shaving after I get through shaving with
the goateesaver I'll remove it and then
take the straight edge of the razor and
use it to shave right underneath my nose
when you shave with the goateesaver one
of the things that you'll notice is
there's still about an eighth of an inch
of hair that will stick out beyond the
goateesaver if you look at the bottom of
the razor you can see that the reason
this is the case is because how the
razor was designed there's about an
eighth of an inch between the edge of
the razor and the razor as you can see
it's very simple to shave with the
goateesaver as with anything new it may
take a few times of trying before you
get it down just perfect thanks for
watching the goateesaver and learning
more about it
