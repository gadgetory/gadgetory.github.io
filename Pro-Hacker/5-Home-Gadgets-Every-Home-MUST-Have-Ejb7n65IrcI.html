world's smartest video doorbell at your
fingertips we spend about 90% of our
time indoors and the air we breathe in
here is 2 to 5 times more polluted than
outdoors imagine all the chemicals dust
and toxic gases trapped in a room
nowhere to go and the worst part is we
do nothing about it simply because you
don't know
you who is a smart indoor air quality
sensor that detects an alerts you of
allergens and toxins in the air you
breathe think of the places you and your
loved ones spend the most time in do you
know the quality of the air in your
office at work in your hotel room when
you travel how about in your own living
room or your child's bedroom these are
important because VOCs are found in
paint and household cleaning products
dust can accumulate unseen in fabric
around us and humidity encourages the
growth of bacteria and mold all these
cause respiratory problems skin
irritations and overall poor health in
the long run you who let you know when
something's not right and what you can
do the simplest and easiest things to do
make the biggest difference cut down on
chemical cleaners wash your child's
favorite toys air out your living areas
and check on possible gas leaks don't
leave it to chance or guesswork you who
keeps track of the air you breathe
round-the-clock so that you and your
loved ones get to live work and play in
the best and safest possible environment
it is the most comprehensive indoor air
quality detector on the market today
with eight dedicated sensors that detect
volatile organic compounds dust carbon
monoxide carbon dioxide ozone air
pressure temperature and humidity hi I'm
Dustin co-founder of yoohoo and there's
a very simple reason why we created you
is there's a real need for the air we
breathe affects all of us why do we
spend so much energy and money on
nutrients and supplements and yet ignore
the air that we breathe we spoke to
numerous professionals who are otherwise
healthy with almost fatigue we heard
from asthma sufferers who have
persistent symptoms and travelers who
fall ill because the air quality in
their hotel rooms are not of optimal
levels we also heard from parents who
always worried about what their kids are
exposed to both at home and in school
and the thing is we can fix what we
don't know and there has never been an
easy and affordable way to find out
until now
with yoo-hoo your world just got a
little safer and you and your family
just got healthier
