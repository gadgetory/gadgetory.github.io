of product development and social media
we need pretty active lives

he loves a snowboard and he needs to
skis to stand up the ellipses fixie and
he loves his mountain bike but all of
our gear was taking up too much room in
our garage so much so that I couldn't
park my car in there many of the storage
solutions that we looked at we're gonna
work many worse unsafe or clunky so we
came up with this idea to raise all of
our equipment up off the ground in that
apartment way and that became a zero
gravity ground but in order make zero
gravity racks a reality we really need
