hey Kickstarter my name is Mark I'm the
founder and CEO of zero-gravity racks
and this is my son Nick who's in charge
of product development and social media
we need pretty active lives
he likes to serve he likes to stand up
he loves a snowboard and he needs to
skis to stand up the ellipses fixie and
he loves his mountain bike but all of
our gear was taking up too much room in
our garage so much so that I couldn't
park my car in there many of the storage
solutions that we looked at we're gonna
work many worse unsafe or clunky so we
came up with this idea to raise all of
our equipment up off the ground in that
apartment way and that became a zero
gravity ground but in order make zero
gravity racks a reality we really need
your help so click on what are the perks
on the right if you're on a computer or

is wonderful
it's a great tool
hi this is the oco-2 a simple home
monitoring camera when you're away from
your pooch or your baby or the grand
peace how can you check up on them meet
oco-2 it's gonna make the world a better
place and all that kind of stuff oco-2
your hunch is right Walker one exists
and is already on sale at the wheels of
progress never stop turning the oco-2 is
a self-learning bull HD camera with
hybrid storage one of a kind an SD card
will be useful in case your internet
connection gets lost and cloud storage
in case thieves want to steal your code
too and they will want to steal
self-learning is always good but with
the oco-2 it's amazing amazing and I
feel a bit sorry about the $200 cameras
that you buy and after three days you're
sick of all the fake notification every
time a car passes by or shree swaying
every light blinking felt learning is
always good our AI understand that you
don't want to be inundated with endless
notifications only smart push
notifications by the way what's that guy
doing in your kitchen 60 second set up a
magic magnetic face that you can fix it
to your Hall a point in any direction
you want yeah even their widest viewing
angle night vision and of course to a
talk I love you know the fact is these
days big corporations know more about
you than your own mother does they know
all your search history and habit do you
really need a camera that's finding out
even more about you we're just as
concerned about security as you are
amazing monthly payments be aware as a
hundred dollars a year no monthly
payments require that's how we roll it
the oco-2 is powered by the incredible
IV daeun which has outdone all other
video surveillance services for last
cheers to bestow on the world we have an
experienced and diverse team from five
countries the u.s. frog China Russia
