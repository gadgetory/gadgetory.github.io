whoever thought pollution could be in
fashion its current its global and it
isn't going away anytime soon
papers are sold on the back of it
fashion designers have embraced it it's
a political hot potato and there is no
getting away from it it is definitely in
the air it's been around for years
the London smokes of the 50s Los Angeles
air in the 70s and today it's the whole
of Asia the World Health Organization
sets a maximum limit of 25 of these
particles in this space he says we
shouldn't breathe more of them over a
24-hour period but a level of 200 is
routinely reached in many Chinese cities
and it once peaked at 800 a seriously
hazardous level our brand is respirate
we are a British company we design and
manufacture in the UK and distribute

air that we breathe gets worse

and most effective way to get our
message out on a global platform so
what's our message our message is simple
why wait till it's too late
this year alone 480 billion bottles will
be consumed and less than 7% of these
get recycled this has a huge impact on
our environment people are drinking more
and more bottle of water as they worry
about the health concerns in the content
of their tap water but this is costly
and unsustainable at tap water we
decided there has to be a better way so
we spent three years researching
existing water filtering technologies
and we came up with tap a revolutionary
water filter system for the kitchen tap
tap - is easy for anyone to install and
reduces plastic by an average of 380
bottles in carbon footprint by 45 kilos
of carbon dioxide per year and the best
part of it is that it's the first
biodegradable water filter so once the
cartridge life is over it can be
composted so no plastic waste ends up in
our nature and oceans with your help we
will reach our goal of avoiding 1
billion plastic bottles by 2020
