smelling wet spots on your furniture do
you want to eliminate the aggravations
of your wet dog racing through the house
shaking water and everything or worse
yet rolling outside in the dirt do you
avoid hugging your dog until they're
fully dry introducing the puffs and
fluff the puff and fluff is
revolutionising the dog drying process
it's simple it's easy it's fast and it's
safe gone are the days of confining your
pet or leaving them alone for hours to
dry that damn dog smell is now gone
within minutes from a third grade school
science project called Invention
Convention and with the love for her pet
pug mojo Marisa Strang set out to find a
better way to dry her dog the goal try
your pets fast before they have a chance
to run away and cause trouble here's how
it works
after bathing your dog towel will dry
any excess water from your pet locate
the head and tail barkings on the puffs
and fluff and place your dog
appropriately on top of it reach
underneath and pull your dog's paws
through the leg hole opening then simply
grab both sides of the pup and fluff
bring together and attach the velcro
lightly tighten the drawstrings around
your dog's neck and tail no need to over
tighten air should be able to flow
through the openings attach virtually
any blow-dryer to the flexo's and turn
your dryer on warm or low heat using the
high speed setting dogs love the
circulating warm air the puffs and fluff
not only calms your dog but makes your
dog fluffy or - after a few minutes
loosen the drawstring on the neck your
tail and reach in to feel the air make
sure the temperature is not too hot you
can also check to see if your dog is
completely dry now the hours of dry time
are accomplished in just minutes at an
affordable price my dog loves the warm
air and I like giving in the bath now
no more when smelly dog sits up puffing
back I rode the puffins fluff for more

the hope with with podcast is to
transform how we all see electronically
think about how you seek visual
information when you're not in the same
locations as the device you know
typically it's a narrow view and a
normal lens will give you 50 to 80
degrees
perhaps 90 and that's been a constraint
for a long time pretty much since video
was invented Panna cast changes all that
one advantage with our service or with
our integration for Microsoft Skype for
business is that in addition to sending
it to everyone we give each person
simultaneous individual control without
interfering with each other so that
makes it a very unique and a very
personal experience and helps people
communicate and engage much more
effectively one of the key features for
the panic as to camera is the USB plug
and play and majority of the people are
used to using a powerful cameras which
are USB interface among other things
that we wanted to achieve with panic as
to was a 4k resolution which we've named
panoramic 4k is 30 40 pixels for example
and 1080 pixels vertical our camera
provides ultra wide field-of-view that
fills up to 1080p displays with a single
panoramic frame panel Casto camera can
be used as a regular webcam or as an
enhance
panoramic camera then used with Skype
for business and now you have the
capability to stream a very
high-resolution panoramic video of the
remote party when we study box method
ten months ago we had a desire to bring
the panoramic view to the masses if you
think of having a camera design that is
based on the single and single optics
and then puts the optics in the single
housing so their complexity becomes
exponentially more severe so it formers
had to be achieve high quality and
manufacturability while also being
aesthetically desirable one of the
things that I've been very interested in
the last three years is building a
global classroom that experience has
been significantly enhanced by our use
of pannacotta cameras that give remote
students the ability to join and
contribute to class in a much more
meaningful way we think one of the great
use cases for the panic has to will be
for companies that have a lot of huddle
rooms or small conference rooms that
will hold a number of people from two to
maybe even twenty upgrade your campus
with panic has to
this is the wall-mount grocery bag
dispenser you know all those plastic
grocery bags you keep in an overstuffed
drawer will no more this dispenser can
hold up to 30 bags and keeps them handy
for reuse
just tug bags through the top opening
like this when you need to use one pull
it out of the wide dispensing slot it
mounts to the wall or inside a cabinet
