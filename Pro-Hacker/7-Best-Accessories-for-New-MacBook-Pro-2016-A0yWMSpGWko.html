we live in a connected world now more
than ever the Internet is accessible on
virtually every device in our homes and
as parents we've all had that moment
when we realize how exposed our children
can be on the Internet existing parental
control solutions are complicated to use
so we started by asking how can we make
it simple for busy parents to create a
safer online experience for our children
introducing Griffon a simple to use
Wi-Fi router designed to help parents
work together to better manage our
connected families the simplicity of
Griffon starts with an app where you can
view all your connected devices and
manage settings for each individual
device in your home because all the
traffic goes through the router there is
no need to install complicated software
on any of your devices as parents we are
constantly multitasking so we've
developed an exciting new technology to
allow parents to have real-time control
over their child's internet access from
anywhere even outside the home digital
parenting is better together so we made
it simple for parents teachers and
schools to work together with a social
collaboration platform it's difficult to
know which websites are appropriate for
our child to guide the parent Griffin
aggregates the approval ratings from
other parents and the community through
crowd ranking managing your child's
online activities is not just about
blocking harmful websites but also about
discovering useful content to help your
child learn and grow with Griffin the
parent can easily manage screen time
through the app you can set bedtimes and
homework times or simply pause the
internet for family time
while you are spending time with the
things that matter Griffins keeping all
your connected things safe with 24/7
intelligent intrusion detection and
active malware filtering Griffin is
elegantly designed with the latest Wi-Fi
technology
wireless mesh six high-powered antennas
tri-band Wi-Fi radios antenna beam
forming and mu-mimo hi my name is John
I'm the co-creator of Griffin like many
parents I struggled with managing my
children's screen time the existing
solutions are very complicated to use
and many parents we talked to simply
gave up that's why we built Griffin to
be simple to use design by parents for
parents to build riffing we have
assembled a global team of experts with
a proven track record of delivering
powered winning products like Apple iPod
and my favorite hotspot we have world
over the past year creating a beautiful
design and developing the software
platform we're using Qualcomm and their
latest Wi-Fi technology and we are
partnered with Kaspersky

malware detection we have chosen our
manufacturing partner

product to production please join our

lift was inspired by the design of Apple
MacBook MacBooks are innovative slim
sleek and designed to use anywhere as
you go however we notice that even
though users are still bound to the
old-time accessories they are not able
to use MacBooks everywhere solely and
freely that is why we finally proposed
an innovative way of interacting with
your MacBook throughout the day the lift
lift provides you adjust Wilhite
flexible mobility and stylish protection
turn your MacBook into a comfortable
workstation at any time anywhere and
express your personality by giving your
MacBook a new look using different
covers early we have perfectly
prototypes for macbook pro and will
experience manufactures ready to start
production process however in order to
make it happen we need your help please
back us up to bring this project to life
I love my laptop I rely on it every day
and I take it everywhere but
economically laptops are not ideal the
longer we spend on them the
we hunch leading to tension or pain in
our neck to shoulders and back which is
why we've designed the timing tower a
portable and height adjustable laptops
down the tiny tower allows you to set up
and get to work in no time whether it's
at the office at home in a cafe or
wherever it has an elegant design which
integrates beautifully with your laptop
helping you work comfortably and protect
your posture I suffered a serious disc
herniation in my neck after hunching
over my laptop for too long I realized
that a lot of existing products don't
really solve a problem and they're not
something I want on my desk so as an
industrial designer I decided to create
a product that laptop users would be
proud to own the tiny Tower has a clever
push-button mechanism that adjusts your
laptop screen to a height that suits you
there are 10 different height levels
available
when you're done it takes seconds to
fall down flat into a compact and
lightweight unit that you can take
anywhere it's compatible with both Mac
and Windows laptops from 11 to 15 inches
in size your laptop sits firmly and
securely on a non-slip grip all for
added security
the tiny Tower has fingers you can
extend
we've also created a high-quality zipped
nylon pouch to carry your Tiny Tower
keyboard and mouse we've been working on
this project for over 18 months during
development
we tested seven different prototypes to
get every detail just right we wanted to
find the perfect balance of
functionality and simplicity and to
create something you'd be proud to own
and use we decided on aluminium as the
main material because it's strong
lightweight and durable the aluminium is
precision cut bead blasted and anodized
to give that lustrous semi matte finish
hi I'm Matt and I'm ant life together
we've created the tiny Tower
the money we raise can pay from the
tools to molds and materials we need to
get the tiny tower into production if
you want a stylish clever solution
that's as portable as your laptop and
you care about your posture and
well-being while you work and we'd love
your support</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
