think about the amount of cables you
deal with on a daily basis have you ever
wanted a simple solution to keep your
cables organized
say hello to clue your magnetic cable
keeper
hoop is easy convenient and fast save
time get organized and stay on the go
a loop is made of a durable elastic
silicon which allows for multiple cable
profiles it has two strong neodymium
magnets embedded at both in to allow for
a quick snap and release mechanism it
features a cable passage to allow you to
route your cable through the loop this
way your gloop stays attached at all

including the new clue XL we are excited
to announce the launch of our
Kickstarter campaign for the coop XL
last year we had a successful
Kickstarter campaign to help fund the
production of our small and large group
we listened to our backers needs and
have now designed an extra large clue to
tackle those even larger cables now you
can do more with a larger design so
Kickstarter's we need your help get
started with the production of the new
coop XL
we use our smartphones for everything
but it seems like the battery can never
keep up before long it's at 1% and on
the verge of dying
now you might carry a charging cable
with you
but sometimes there are no power outlets
nearby and even if there were the chief
cable that comes with your phone isn't
always reliable but think about the
power sources that are all around us all
the time everywhere you look there are
people with smartphones and tablets each
with their own battery what if there was
a way for our devices to connect with
each other and share their battery well
now there is with anyway the only
charging table you'll ever need
on one end there's a micro USB connector
for Android phones for iPhone just slide
on the attached lightning adapter the
other end has a standard USB connector
for wall chargers and computers the
cable itself is protected with tangle
free nylon for extra durability but what
really makes any link so unique is its
ability to share battery life between
devices here's how it works
hidden within the USB connector is a
pop-out micro USB I just plug this end
into my phone
she plugs the other end into hers and
just like that her phone is charging
pretty amazing right no wall outlets no
batteries just one amazing cable any
link works with more than just both if I
have my tablet on me I can use its large
battery at the power source to keep my
phone charged I just connect the two
using my any link cable throw them in my
bag and I can charge my phone on the go
with any link I can stop worrying about
my battery life and enjoy my social life
if my battery's running low I know I can
count on a friend to lend a charge but
any link goes beyond just passing on
battery light connected devices can
transfer files too
with any link you can quickly transfer
your media to another device without
using up your data place so I can
transfer files cards from a friend or
plug into an outlet all for the same
price as a standard Apple charging cable
our friends are all different and so are
their devices Android iPhone tablets
smart watches even Kindle it doesn't
matter any link lets us connect our
device so we can stay connected with our
friends
