international and the inventor of the
barricade box I spent over 20 years in
the Marine Corps and through multiple
law enforcement agencies throughout this
country since 1999 with the tragedy and
Columbine I've really focused on active
shooter survival teaching civilians on
how to stay alive in an active shooter
event during my training I teach a lot
about barricading yourself a lot of
times the safest place you can be as
inside a classroom or inside an office
but unfortunately I use extension cords
and shoestrings to try to barricade a
door so through that training I've
developed the barricade box the
barricade box is a very simple fast and
secure solution to barricade yourself
within a room it doesn't violate safety
codes and it could work on nearly any
door with a handle that swings inward or
outward the barricade box is simple to
install and easy to apply in less than
seven minutes the barricade box can be
installed in any wood steel or masonry
door frame and can be applied by any
child in less than seven seconds simply
remove the cover pull the cord wrap
around the handle and secure into the
barricade box any attempt to breach the
door when the barricade box is applied
simply cinches down the Kevlar cord even
more the applications for the barricade
box are endless whether schools offices
churches or even safe rooms with inside
your own home the barricade box uses a
Kevlar core with over 2,000 pounds of
tensile strength its burn proof and cut
resistant as a parent of three young
kids and a husband to a teacher when I
developed a barricade box I really took
into consideration my own child safety
and security
why choose one decor when you can turn
your wall into an interactive canvas
meet Scriven the world's first write and
erase robot that creates a different
image whenever you want to nails and a
plug is all you need to install scribble
and thanks to the app it's always
connected create an image or source it
from the web then upload it to the app
and scribble will reproduce it on your
wall within minutes and if you get tired
of the design no worries scribble will
just erase it and you can start over
again you can connect script to your
favorite apps and show you the latest
news and weather forecasts or even your
Twitter updates any surfaces gained
whiteboard glass or standard plaster and
with four color options the
possibilities are endless the only limit
is your imagination
turn your wall into a wonder wha with
scribble today we need information but
we spend too much time from the screens
from our smartphones computers TVs so
the question is how can we get
information and data but without adding
more screen sterilized what I love about
scribble is that it can literally turn
every surface you have around you into
something dynamic surfaces that can show
data art or murals that remind you of
the good times and it's an amazing way
not just to help you work leave but also
to interact with other people and to
interact remotely as well with other
people of your life really what you can
do is limitless
think about having a super gifted hand
it's a robotic hand and do whatever you
want in a walk you can think about basic
information as you know the weather
forecast or the things need to buy it's
like having an infant library of apps
allow you to turn anything in life into
something on your walk weather like the
most about scribble is that the advances
everyone's forgive you and let you
transform your house in a more beautiful
place to live
scribble hands in the wall with just two
tiny wires and it moves thanks to its
two motors also we even try a new ink
which is completely invisible with heat
a fundamental part of scribbles user
experience is the platform that allows
people to upload share and download
content to display under voice the whole
concept behind scribble is to create a
community and everyone is already
excited about it I can't wait to see
where our system people will do with the
platform imagine drawing share with
straighted the possibilities are endless
crowdfunding is amazing because it's a
way for us to understand what you think
about our idea and for you to get your
script before than anyone else so please
support us in any way you can because
this will help us to bring scribble into
your hands as soon as possible
