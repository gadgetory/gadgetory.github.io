nice
let's face water can be lots of fun
until we need to drink it sure we know
it's healthy but it just doesn't taste
as exciting as all those flavored drinks
which means we drink a lot less water
and a whole lot more of that Chuck hey
and that's a problem a very big problem
so we decided to put some fun into
drinking water with the right cup it's
the world's first ever fruit flavored
cup designed to get people drinking more
water sure it might look simple but it
actually took six years of research and
patented technologies to get where we
are today and we believe it's gonna be a
real game-changer
so how does it work well for starters
our brain identifies flavor using two
main senses taste and smell that's why
we inserted innovative FDA approved
fruit scent and flavor directly into the
right Cup so when you drink water from
it your nose picks up the fruity aroma
your tongue senses the hint of a sweet
taste and your brain yells when in fact
you're only drinking natural water
Oh sounds great but does it work well we
asked ourselves that very same question
so we put the right cup to the test with
our orange flavored prototype whoa okay
Wow you're kidding me right
what's in this is not just water tastes
like something else just water it's
crazy brilliant just brilliant now that
we know that it works let's meet the
team behind the idea for years have been
researching and lecturing about scent
marketing showing how easy it is to
manipulate the brain with smell when I
was 30 I was diagnosed with diabetes and
my doctors told me to drink only water
but I hated the taste that's when I came
up with the idea for the right cup
after years of research and development
we've reached the stage where we need
your support to turn the right cup into
a reality the right cup is great for
anyone who wants to cut down on sugary
drinks and drink more water which is
basically everybody please help us
change the lives of millions of people
by supporting our project on IndieGoGo
together we can make a real difference
and turn the world into a better and
healthier place one cup at a time
let's make drinking water fun again
well we hope you have sweet dreams on
the lines of Italy the defeatable Denver
it's back to reality
we go back this
so am
and all my people
and all my people say
and all my people say
then we go back this is the moment
tonight is the night we'll fight til
it's over so we put our hands up like
the ceiling can't hold us like the
ceiling
for over 5,000 years
Eastern healing practices have improved
the health of millions of people yoga
mats on the other hand have only been
around for a few decades and they have
plenty of room for improvement now we've
taken ancient arts and infused it with
modern technology to produce a
revolutionary yoga mat that will vigor
at your body reduce muscle and joint
pain and prevent slipping during your
most vigorous yoga routines introducing
grips mats the first-ever
non-slip acupressure yoga mat this is
Katrina after she was undiagnosed
misdiagnosed and finally diagnosed with
Lyme disease she refused to be defined
by this incurable illness and turned to
more holistic methods of treatments such
as yoga and acupressure Yoga and
acupressure has improved her health
immensely so she decided to combine both
practices get all the benefits of
acupressure therapy and a durable easy
to clean yoga mat Griffes mats is a
non-slip yoga mat covered in soft
acupressure points the points are firm
enough to provide powerful reflexology
and acupressure therapy but gentle
enough to practice even your most
complex yoga flows by combining
acupressure reflexology and yoga grips
mats will dramatically increase the
effectiveness of your healing practice
the mat stimulates pressure points to
release life-giving energy throughout
your body
this eases muscle tension and provides
better blood circulation the acupressure
points also give extra surface for grip
during your normal yoga practice so you
won't slip no matter how complex the
pose the mat is closed-cell meaning it
won't absorb sweat or develop odors to
wash it simply run water over it and
shake off to rinse
stretch on it lie on it meditate on it
feel the difference the moment you step
on it
let acupressure unlock hidden potentials
in your body as yoga stretches you
deeper into them
let your blood flow freely through your
veins go deeper stretch further
experience complete revitalization we
need your help after countless
prototypes and consultations with
acupuncturist and yoga instructors or
finally ready to get grips mats - you

support we can spread healing to the
world grips mats live better

successfully identify any exercise in
the gym without any user interference

accustomed to your form and build
patterns of your unique movements

quo that fundamentally enhances the
capabilities of wearable technology

next-generation fitness tracker that
combines daily lifestyle tracking with
in-depth analysis of your gym workout

and let it rain sitting costs for the
sports performance thing and puts it
right there on your wrist acto fit auto
logged data over a weekly monthly or a
time period of your choice allows you to
evaluate what's working versus what's
not where you are against where you want

want
