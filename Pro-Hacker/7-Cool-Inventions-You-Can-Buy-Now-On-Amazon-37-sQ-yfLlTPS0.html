having to hold up the tablet for long
periods of time the tab lift fits
virtually all brands and models of
tablet devices it has three viewing
positions one for sitting up one for
reclining and one for lying completely
flat the tablet's unique patent-pending
design uses four adjustable legs that
keep your tablet in level viewing
position on any uneven surface
the wide footprint of the legs keeps it
totally stable on all cushioned surfaces

size for easy storage and portability

highest quality components all

way you use your tablet what are yours

ideal way to defend responsibly the gun

love pasta but are looking for a healthy
alternative vegetable noodles are just a
twist away with aux those handheld
spiralizer our spiralizer works with a
variety of fruits and vegetables so
whether you want to make zucchini pasta
sweet potato curly fries or anything in
between we've got you covered
it features an open blade design a
non-slip grip for comfort and a food
holder to protect hands when in use that
doubles as a cover for safe storage
spiralizing works best when the produce
is straight and at least one and a half
inches in diameter
if the produce is longer than six inches
just cut it in half if it isn't
naturally straight cut it into straight
sections place the flat end against the
center of the blade and apply pressure
when twisting clockwise the result will
be long uniformed spirals it's that
simple when you start to reach the end
of the vegetable use the food holder for
safety to keep your fingers away from
the sharp blades a few twists later
you've got a plate of delicious and
healthy vegetable noodles so you can
dress up however you'd like in addition
to veggie pastas you can also use the
spiralizer to make uniform spirals for
salads it's even great for curly fries
hey guys I'm Jeff hi guys I'm helmet I
think it's amazing how many people had
the same experience with their ear buds
it definitely is you know an earbud
problem you know they're falling out you
can tell people are kind of pushing them
back in or that they're uncomfortable
they make your ears tender so we needed
to create a solutions in that solution
is in your hooks when you're running you
know outside or when you're working out
in a gym you want sometimes people to
stay with you as an active person you
want to achieve that focus where you can
push yourself to a limit that you've
never been before and why be distracted
by any of your buds when you don't have
to be and we don't want you to think
this is only for athletes the problem of
ear buds falling out it's so common so
what we've created with ear hooks is a
universal attachment that connects to
almost all in-ear circular ear buds that
increases their fit increases their
comfort as far as design goes we really
looked at every piece of ear hook you
can see we've got a shark fin design on
the top here which we call the tip this
piece is what disperses a lot of the
weight of the actual ear bud you see
you've got the elastic tire here which
stretches on and off we've did a lot of
testing me relentlessly tweaks and
change the design we prototyped over 20
different ear hooks throughout the
process the testing range from running
cycling swimming surfing we really try
to do everything we could to make sure
that these ear hose could endure with
every environment that they would ever
see we were very thoughtful in our
design process each step of the way
we've redesigned and we've reproduced
and we've retested and we know now that
we have a product that is passing all
this test whereas flying colors the same
way athletes push themselves to be great
at what they do
we've pushed ourselves to make your
hooks great at what they do
right now your hooks are something that
not too many people know about but it's
really I dunno about it have had a great
response we want to share this product
with the world and we can only do that
with your help we're hoping this will be
a collaboration hoping to learn more
about our products from all of you
willing to hear some stories from you
guys and you know really make this a
great product together when you talk
about listening to music it makes you
want to move in with your hook you
finally can</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
