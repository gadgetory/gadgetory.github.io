but while following safety rules your
hands are not free of course using other
devices can put you in danger that's why
we need some ridiculous accessories like
dead-set but these ear blocking headsets
are risky when you're precautious even
the road is filled with a bunch of
threat you still have to talk to your
peers those existing devices can't
guarantee your safety in the end you
have no choice but to stop and make
phone call so we've developed smart
communication devices for helmet users
and it's called a head you can attach a
head to any kind of helmet and connect
your phone via bluetooth
a head on your helmet can transmit sound
through vibration with a head you can
make hands-free phone call and even
group chats with your friends it also
performs various audio functions such as
listening to music and smart
notifications riders will never get lost
with a voice navigation with just a
simple click call Louis keep connected
even when you're at home when on the
deck it can be used as a speaker while
it's being charged a head is a
completely different Bluetooth device
unlike traditional devices the secret of
this device lies in its vibrator this
vibrator on the bottom of the device
transmits vibrations to the helmet and
make sounds clearly
if needed I think it's a cool product we
found was very good
wasn't too heavy like I thought it was
going to be so that was nice
I think the one thing that could be
cooler is maybe for design oh sorry
the whole idea although music sound so I
am a schematic yes
way better when we're here both like
stuck at the helm a stoic artful my
right like it is uncomfortable but this
thing I hear you can hear everything
right here throwing up football
I think it's amazing anything I really
like it I like to have ya got a good
experience
ah we started the folio to make a simple
studio for everyone thanks to you guys
people all around the world are using
the folio for their product photography
the site has increased approximately two
times from audio to the folio three is
the bigger and better solution for your
product photography for folio three we
invented a new design to upgrade the
size and portability the folio 3 also
comes as a magnetic structure making it
easy for everyone to use the lighting
device of the folio 3 is redesigned for
better performance the triple LED
lighting is more powerful than before
helping to decrease shadows more
efficiently we created an additional
lighting device the halo bar which can
be used with the folio 3 to improve
lighting conditions attached the halo
bars to the folio 3 then control
additional lighting or you can use the
halo bars only to create a totally
different atmosphere now start creating
more amazing photos with the folio 3
a perfect studio for your product
photography it's the solution to upgrade
your photos for your hobby website or
workplace don't forget you can use the
folio 250 with the folio 3 to create 360
images of your product
dream about touching the untouchable
you
wish to feel with their fingers and
marvels of the universe
recover forgotten sensation
everything begins with a sensation we
discover the world of touch do you dare
to experiment
hi I'm Luis Castillo founder and chief
executive officer at Nell digital
technologies we develop innovative
hardware and software solutions for
finances games using virtual reality we
are very proud to present the glove one
hour to play project amazing team
amazing technology amazing possibilities
glove one is a haptic feedback wireless
device that lets you to feel and touch
everything on your screen or through
virtual reality headset it has been
developed 100% in our lab in the
reference design to the final prototype
I am really happy to work
we love making technology accessible for
everybody and this is our dream kitchen
we provide gloves one and you will make
your ideas come true
I was totally cool I just caught a
butterfly and I could feel it wings
flapping in my hands it was just like
real life and everything I touched
reacted and I could feel it it was a
really really cool experience I would
absolutely do it again everything was
totally interactional it was super cool
I really liked the rain could feel like
every drop on my hands without getting
wet where's the very best part I think
the experience is very a very realistic
when you touch certain things like the
fire you actually feel that it's
actually a warning you and we when you
touch the guitar you can actually play a
small song there so I can see a range of
possibilities potentially this
application can be useful in many
different effects
currently it's very expensive for us to
produce prototypes that's why we want to
talk that with Kickstarter campaign and
need your help keep your home and family
protected with the halo plus smart smoke
and carbon monoxide alarm with weather
alerts Hill smart logic combined six
different sensors to quickly detect
faster slow burning fires even carbon
monoxide with less false alarms halo
lets you know exactly where the danger
is a voice alert will tell you what's
wrong a ring of light illuminates and
you'll get an alert sent to your
smartphone stay on top of important
alerts with mobile notifications sent
straight to your smart device or connect
with one of our smart home partners
Alexa iris and smart stings to name a
few
customizable NOAA Weather Radio keeps
your family informed of any nearby
disasters such as tornadoes hurricanes
wildfires and floods transform your halo
into an accident-- life and customize it
to suit your mood by using the hello ask
or speaking to a left press plus our 10
year backup battery ensures that you'll
never need to get out of bed to take
down a smoke alarm again halo smart labs
safety reimagined
here we go
now
cool
I
that case
three
it's time to take a new look at 3d
printing it's time to take a look at
obsidian obsidian is the fourth 3d
printer a Bitcoin it's rated a silent
opponent medically before in the
industry Ophidian office the reliability
and print quality of ashamed home
private clients and all of them would
have black beautiful
choose from a palette of colors and
materials as unlimited a few ideas bring
3d printing into your creative process
for the first time opinion is a tool
that brings your ideas into reality
obsidian makes proving high quality 3d
models effortless our optimum louver
interface guidelines adjust art don't
print
choose any major software to design your
model whether on your computer or in
virtual reality but you don't need to be
a designer to get those thousands of
creators from around the world are
sharing their models online for free 3d
printing is a movement joyner
obsidians app lets you control your
printer from anywhere
keep an eye on your print and adjust
them even on the dome obsidian camera is
made not only for life dreaming but also
for time out recording as you can share
your favorite print and social media
show friends your creations and lotion
we think there is only one spot between
imagination and reality between holding
an idea in your mind and seeing it
materialize before your eyes
and we call this that obsidian
at the end you make we believe that
everyone should have the opportunity to
become a maker so that's why we've
created the maker kit which will give
you the chance to build your very own
robot meet quad walk while studying
engineering we found there to be loads
of theory but very little hands-on
making so we found it in society through
robotics from there we developed the
community and set out the blueprints
that offer people the chance to get
actual robots and since then we spent a
lot of time around maker spaces when we
have run dedicated workshops in order to
share this knowledge with others all of
this experience and distilled into the
maker came at the core of any robot life
is hard in this case the quad board an
Arduino based platform that makes
robotics easy plug in headers allow
interfacing with any sensor or motive
plus onboard power management handles
charging and voltage regulation in this
kit you'll get a quad board several
motors and all the other materials that
you just can't print using the resources
supplied with the make get along with
free online software like Arduino and
fusion 360 you can go from beginner to
intermediate and finally expert
you can learn how to 3d design and print
new parts how to use electronics to
increase functionality how to apply math
to something real and how to code having
no experience to developing yourself
into a real-deal coder
what started as an idea soon became its
first meaning to life through laser
cutting before being further refined
with 3d printing Quadra has seen his
fair share of iterations before getting
to where he is now
and guess what we've enabled his design
to be entirely open for you to change
what we really want is for you to take
quad bot and then make him your own last
week I knew nothing about robotics and
now I've already built our own laser
board it's our dream to get everyone
moving now to do that education needs a
change we want to drink quad bar into
schools and create the next generation
of makers this is intense
this is a ride a war intended a good
solution to lead the nature Rhino world
is an all-around incredible solution
that's just incredible yeah
we repeated the word incredible can
attend to this
no it can't oh and when you lay down to
sleep in a tent you need a sleeping bag
and a mattress you know what Rhino wolf
has to say about that stupid tent Rhino
over the modular attachable are what do
I call it not a tent cuz it's so much
better than a tent it's a modular
attachable rider wall because there is
nothing like it
Rhino wolf is amazingly built everything
is precise the private is the strongest
possible with extra thought to the
weight with all those right materials
and a built-in sleeping bag and mattress
rhino wolf weighs only five pounds
that's at least two pounds less than
carrying a sleeping bag mattress
ten separately and you also don't look
like a snail when carrying it ha look at
that smile man snail man Rhino wolf also
weighs less than other all-in-one ten
but it's also better than them because
it's not a tent
it's a writable Rhino wolf has a main
arch that gives the entire structure
it's solid strength and allows for
straight sides which enables great
airflow and a fit for the human body
you're human right yeah you are Rhino
wolf can you stand very low temperatures
and feels very cool in warm one of
course it's windproof rain proof and bug
food
it's a rhino it's strong and yes it also
comes in pink Rhino wolf can pull out
any colour the setup Ryan will you just
use one pole yeah one that's less than
any other number just push the pole
through the sleeve and you're done now
thanks to the rhino wolf part you can
easily attach your incredible Rimel to
other credible Rhino walls and create up
to pack of rhino walls get it a rhino
wolf pack take a look at the rhino wolf
sleeping bag that weighs less but keeps
you warmer we took some filling from the
bottom added it to the top and put an
insulating air mattress instead so you
sleep like in a bed not like you're
stuck in a cube like some two speeds or
something you're not toothpaste you're
human and you deserve comfort Rhino warm
comfort when you attach another Rhino
wolf you can also attach the blankets to
create a double bed for you know things
you do in a double bed need some privacy
just close your own rhino wolf and
you've got your own room
yup a double bed with privacy is that
better than your home probably not that
the stupid comparison he we have vision
no more tents no more carrying eggs are
sleeping equipment just ride wolves
everywhere because a tent that's okay
Rhino wolf isn't
animals get one and be happy it's simple
Rhino wolf Oh what does a rhino wolf do</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
