you're stuck with the same old boring
piece of block her morning's look

ones wherever they may be this is the
beginning of the toaster a journey
unique creative and interactive help us
get start your morning's with toaster
wait there's something about how things
were made a while back it's like magic
it has a certain feeling to it it was an
era when people had time to pay
attention to every detail and things
were made to last inspired by the old
headlights we've collected over the
years we combined our skills to create
something useful really amazing we would
be proud of having around
we wanted it to have a personality
the stance had to inspire confidence
just like a superhero stance the
footprint is large enough to keep it
balanced the size was chosen so it will
be tall enough to provide light for the
entire office the head rotates in a
direction and at any angle it's even
large enough to be used as a headphone
stand we fitted it with LED light
sources to have the perfect light for
any situation a clear one for reading
that you could easily turn on or off and
set the intensity just by touch and an
RGB controlled by mobile turn it on or
off change the color or intensity while
sitting comfortably on the couch this
light can even be safe to music so we'll
flash to the beat when you're having a
party
books of functionality weren't enough if
the materials had to be top-notch as
well the head is made out of old tractor
headlights it's all metal and glass so
it would last even in the toughest
conditions the neck the only exposed
part is made from aluminum so it won't
rust the body is made from recycled
polyurethane to help the environment a
bit we wanted everyone to be able to add
a personal touch to it so starting from
day one you can choose a color to match
your room
style to Metro personality to have
full-body coverage each lamp store will
have two layers of non-toxic water-based
paint and two basic layers of clear
coated to protect the paint job from
wear and scratch over time for heart and
soul into designing the lamps there and
making the first prototypes to be able
to produce it and make it available
we'll need your support together we can
make this happen you are a person and
like all people you like to take
pictures and post them to social media
so that your friends think you're cool
so go ahead and snap that pic your
self-esteem depends on it
