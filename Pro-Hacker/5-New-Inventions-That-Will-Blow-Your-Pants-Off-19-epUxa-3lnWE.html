that brings family and friends closer
together when was the last time you were
this excited for breakfast
probably when you were her age or
probably never look at those smiles has
your breakfast ever been so enjoyable
with toaster Boyd she can design
anything she wants on her toast while
you're stuck with the same old boring
piece of block her morning's look
magical while she waits an appointment
for that golden-brown crunch so how do
we do it inside toaster eyes innovative
and minimal design the smart toasting
system is powered by microfilament
heating technology but it can do so much
more
let your toast seek your mind with a
smiley face or a light send a message to
that special someone for a surprise a
superhero toast might be exactly what
you need to power through the day each
pop of toast is a surprise there's
excitement in every pop take a look at
Tom we can toast the latest weather
forecasts and other useful information
anywhere in the world whether he's in
London or Tokyo or anywhere in between
toaster oh it's got him covered so he's
ready for the day's challenges
what is more exhilarating than a morning
message from your loved one how about a
toasted secret messages that are only
readable on toast
so the secret
stays with you forever it's the perfect
way to stay connected with your loved
ones wherever they may be this is the
beginning of the toaster a journey
unique creative and interactive help us
get start your morning's with toaster
wait there's something about how things
were made a while back it's like magic
it has a certain feeling to it it was an
era when people had time to pay
attention to every detail and things
were made to last inspired by the old
headlights we've collected over the
years we combined our skills to create
something useful really amazing we would
be proud of having around
we wanted it to have a personality
the stance had to inspire confidence
just like a superhero stance the
footprint is large enough to keep it
balanced the size was chosen so it will
be tall enough to provide light for the
entire office the head rotates in a
direction and at any angle it's even
large enough to be used as a headphone
stand we fitted it with LED light
sources to have the perfect light for
any situation a clear one for reading
that you could easily turn on or off and
set the intensity just by touch and an
RGB controlled by mobile turn it on or
off change the color or intensity while
sitting comfortably on the couch this
light can even be safe to music so we'll
flash to the beat when you're having a
party
books of functionality weren't enough if
the materials had to be top-notch as
well the head is made out of old tractor
headlights it's all metal and glass so
it would last even in the toughest
conditions the neck the only exposed
part is made from aluminum so it won't
rust the body is made from recycled
polyurethane to help the environment a
bit we wanted everyone to be able to add
a personal touch to it so starting from
day one you can choose a color to match
your room
style to Metro personality to have
full-body coverage each lamp store will
have two layers of non-toxic water-based
paint and two basic layers of clear
coated to protect the paint job from
wear and scratch over time for heart and
soul into designing the lamps there and
making the first prototypes to be able
to produce it and make it available
we'll need your support together we can
make this happen you are a person and
like all people you like to take
pictures and post them to social media
so that your friends think you're cool
so go ahead and snap that pic your
self-esteem depends on it
but wait there's a problem you can't
take pictures on your phone because
you're wearing gloves and you don't
really want to go out and buy a new pair
so what do you do all right there i'm
tony the creator of taps well I'm not

the actor they had to play them so what
is tap you ask well taps is this amazing
sticker that makes any glove touch
screen compatible miss peel stick and
you tap will work with any device like
this like this and like this how does it
work you ask well it's simple really
we took this magical formula that we
created before and the super strong
adhesive and we bonded them together
science and it doesn't just work with
gloves either worse this works with this
and also works with this dude here dry
yourself
yo that say but will it ruin my gloves
that is an excellent question
no no will not and it's waterproof yeah

your dad your brother your mother

than this glorious day you that's right
