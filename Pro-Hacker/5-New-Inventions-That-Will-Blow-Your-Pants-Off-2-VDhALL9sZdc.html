introduce to you today fabulous a new
product the wine squirrel decanter the
special decanter allows you to have a
glass or two of your favorite wine and
enjoy the rest of the bottle days or
even weeks later
now some products tried to solve this
problem of wine going bad with a device
that you insert into the wine bottle
problem is that were still trapped
inside and the seal wasn't good enough I
thought why not decant the wine bottle
into a special container that completely
avoided any contact with them we teamed
up with talented Australian designer
Clive Solara and now we're proud to
present the wine swirl the camera this
unique product can completely change the
way you drink wine I can now enjoy a
glass of wine with dinner and not worry
about the waste so how does it work well
the product consists of this beautiful
lead-free crystal glass decanter and the
seal after you pour the wine into the
decanter you simply insert the seal at
the level of the wine and turn the seal
you've just created is so effective you
can turn the decanter upside down no
wine will come in when you're ready to
drink the wine simply disengage the seal
and remove
we're here in Sonoma County California
with vineyard owner Jennifer crane who's
been using our wine squirrel I opened up
a bottle of my whoa Farms crane vineyard
designated poured it into the wine
squirrel after a week the flavor was
perfect it was like I just opened the
bottle resealed it with the wine
squirrel
two weeks later opened it again tasted
it again just as if I'd opened up the
bottle this product works
it looks fantastic you can put this
right onto the table every wine lover
needs this in their house
introducing the zoo smart tire safety
monitor the next-generation technology
that puts you in control of your driving
safety safety has never looked so sexy
using the most advanced German sensors
Zeus monitors both tire pressure and
temperature in real-time and sends this
data to the app Zeus is the first ever
tire monitor to be able to detect slow
leaks with its advanced data mining
technology this proprietary algorithm
called accurate temp analyzes pressure
and temperature data over time and
alerts you to any slow leaks that other
tire monitoring systems would have
missed the app report clearly pinpoints
the exact tire and the rate of leakage
to make it even more versatile we've
designed it as a device that anyone can
self install take it with you on your
next trip and easily install in just
three steps on your rental car
when it comes to protecting your family
everywhere you go choose the next
generation and safety technology zoo
smart tire safety monitor Binondo
today's technology for yesterday's car
training for that half I bet you're very
thirsty
think twice before you reach for that
single-use bottle that's a lot of
plastic you're using how about a more
sustainable choice doesn't exactly smell
of Meadows right how long is it since
you washed that bottle these are the
germs in your unwashed bottle bacteria
can double every 20 minutes leaving it
dirtier than your dog bowl or your lucy
perhaps you'd like to wash that bottle
before you use it
there you go just get right on in there
how's that handy ogre working out go on
go ahead give it a sniff so you want
clean perfectly fresh tasting water how
about a bottle that cleans itself we've
created the quartz bottle the world's
first self-cleaning bottle with
on-the-go water purification
quartz uses UV light to break up the DNA
of harmful odor causing bacteria
hospitals have been using the same UV
light to quickly and safely sterilize
operating rooms for the past decade
we've scaled this LED technology to fit
inside this cap imagine a picture of
unquestionable water quartz begins
working at the touch of a button and in
60 seconds
I've got pristine drinking water quartz
works automatically in the background
six times a day to keep your bottle and
water crystal clean and quartz is 100%
BPA free stainless steel it's vacuum
sealed and double insulated so it stays
cold for 24 hours and hot for 12 hours
and never breaks a sweat
ah there's no hydro challenge quartz
can't handle
whether you're bopping around town
training for your next triathlon or on
an expedition to the summit quartz is
always working hard so you don't have to
keeping your water fresh and your bottle
clean and stink free so help make the
perfect water bottle a reality and never
ever worry about that stinky bottle
again
