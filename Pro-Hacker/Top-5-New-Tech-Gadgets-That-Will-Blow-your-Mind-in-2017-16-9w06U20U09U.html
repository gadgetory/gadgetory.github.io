I love to barbecue and I love to grill
there's just something about the taste
of Hickory mesquite alder and cherry mmm
the juiciness you get from a slow cooker
now I just use my Z grills wood pellet
grill I can smoke grill bake brains
roast and barbecue all in one I have to
say it's my new secret weapon Z grills
automatically moves wood pellets into
the electric burner at a consistent rate
for even heating the fire never touches
the food keeping it from unwanted
charring after plugging Z grills in just
tells the grills whether you like to
smoke or cook providing that great wood
flavor with the ease and convenience of
a gas grill using a gas grill you just
don't get that natural wood flavor and
aroma and charcoal grills are just too
messy it's difficult to control when you
start or stop cooking after my prep it
straight into the Z grills you smoke and
cook all in one place besides the
convenience of smoking and grilling at
the turn of a dial I can also make this
delicious wood fired pizza Z Girls
digital temperature control makes it
easy for me to step away for the more
important well more fun things now that
you know all of my grilling secrets get
one for yourself at an amazing price
get yourself a Grylls Elite 900 today
when you see a problem my brain just
immediately starts thinking about how I
could put these things together these
these materials are these processes
together to really solve that problem
there's a personal satisfaction I get
and being able to take technology and do
something very meaningful and important
and valuable with it my name is Stefan
Marsh I'm the inventor of the ear ring
technology and the president of the
company my name's Tom Cotton's I'm live
in Southborough Massachusetts with my
wife I'm a farmer it's what I like to do
I found I had sleep apnea through a test
sleep apnea is an inability to maintain
normal ventilation during sleep
oftentimes there's very dramatic snoring
gasping and choking in the night why
it's important to treat sleep apnea is
the longer-term consequences and that's
where the associations with heart
disease metabolic disease higher risk of
stroke coronary disease heart attack
when you stop breathing and there's no
oxygen going to your brain that's gonna
do some damage over time the most common
treatment is delivery of airway pressure
through a mask it wasn't working for me
it was extremely cumbersome I didn't
want to take the mask off I wanted to
rip the mask off it's a minority of
patients we were able to tolerate the
treatment at home so I've got to find
some way to deal with this and keep a
smile on my face man starts out usually
doing things in a way that's brute force
but sometimes you can figure out a way
to do it that's a little bit more
elegant a little bit easier simpler but
that usually requires an invention
this is amazing I think that if this
works this will be the answer for 99%
they'll never go back to using that Star
Wars piece on their head again when I
see this I say how can that possibly get
the air in me when I first talked to
people about this and I say well you
know we have these little micro pumps
and and it turns out that they're very
powerful and they can they can pump the
right amount of air at the right amount
pressure their first response is no way
get out of here and you know I got well
yes I think we can because our micro
pumps our micro blowers are very very
small it's based on two membranes that
are electrostatically attracted or
repelled from each other opposite
charges attract and that's the bellows
closing and blowing the air out and like
charges repel
that's the bellows opening and sucking
air in and if hundreds and hundreds of
these little bellows are plus of minus
plus and minus going together you get a
large amount of air to flow through
zinc-air batteries is a battery
technology that has a lot of stored
energy in it it's very dense which means
it can be very small and have the right
amount of energy the nose buds they're
easy to insert really it's one hand grab
it stick it in you knows you've done the
molded silicone rubber is extremely
pliable everybody that we've tested it
with has found it very comfortable
really for the first time in this
disease we have a treatment that
patients will be willing to use
long-term consequences of sleep apnea
reduced it's comfortable it's well
tolerated patients can sleep in a
variety of positions just a perfect
treatment it's almost like you can't
wait to try I I don't know it's
important to get this technology to get
this device to get the airing into
people's hands as quickly as possible
the fastest way that I know how to do
that is to raise sufficient amount of
money so we can manufacture it produce
it and get it out there so we're here to
ask you to give us a hand if you can
take this simple technology and treat
this sleeping disorder this condition it
just that's what technology is for
you've got to go do something that's
important and I can't think of anything
more important for these blowers to do
then just save somebody's life so the
fish feeds the plants and the plants
thing the water this small sustainable
ecosystem right on your kitchen counter
the fish they poo NEP and all that waste
which normally just builds up in regular
aquariums actually gets pumped up to the
grow bed and broken down by the plants
into a perfect organic for life
clean water falls right back into the
tank and the best part about it is that
if all of this is happening but any soil
of chemical fertilizers the plants are
going just on rocks and all the
nutrients are coming from the fish so
all you have to do is just feed Sammy
we spent six months work when the top
industrial designers and aquaponics
experts make Aquafarm beautiful and
incredibly simple to set up and maintain
no green thumb or toolbox required and
it can fit any kitchen or classroom
across the country if something we're
really proud about it actually found the
perfect manufacturer right here in our
back yard so every aqua farm is made in
California the aqua farm comes with
everything you need to get set up
organic seeds fish food starter pump
just fill with water add your fish and
plant seeds
it's been so cool watching this
community of Paco farmers develop and
everyone just making this their own but
I didn't ails and shrimping well lights
been so fun to watch so join the
movement get going with the occupier
happy farming everyone
measurements are integral to our
everyday lives but they can put us into
risky and tricky situations or require
someone else to help gange those lengthy
distances but here's a change by back by
tech eh indeed
now you can get out of that risky spot
and don't need a helping hand to
determine long distances
vhat measures and not one but two
directions from one press of a button
you can acquire the left-right and tonal
value at once saving you precious time
and energy on every move and allowing
you to work with greater efficiency by
making you the focal point also your
measurements can be instantly updated to
your smart device with our sketch
application where you can design and
plan for any projects VHA knees
additional functions enable you to use
continuous measuring mode to find mid
points
pythagoras function to reach heights
and calculate the area and volume of any
stance
life made easier
vhat by mag pine tech we take that extra
step so you don't have to
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
