I love to barbecue and I love to grill
there's just something about the taste
of hickory the Skeets alder and cherry
mmm juiciness you get from a slow cooker
now I just use my feet grills wood
pellet grill I can smoke grill bake
brain roast barbecue all in one I have
to say it's my new secret weapon the
grills automatically moves wood pellets
into the electric burner had a
consistent rate for even heating the
fire never touches the food keeping it
from unwanted charring after plugging Z
grills in just tell d grills whether you
like to smoke or cook providing that
great wood flavor with the ease and
convenience for the gastro using a gas
grill you just don't get that natural
wood flavor and aroma and charcoal
grills are just too messy it's difficult
to control when you start or stop
cooking after my prep it straight into
the Z grills you smoke and cook all in
one place besides the convenience of
smoking and grilling at the turn of a
dial I can also make this delicious
wood-fired pizza the girls digital
temperature control makes it easy for me
to step away for the more important well
more fun things now that you know all of
my grilling secrets get one for yourself
at an amazing price get yourself easy
grill the lead 900 today
when you see a problem my brain just
immediately starts thinking about how i
could put these things together these
these materials are these processes
together to really solve that problem
there's a personal satisfaction I get
and being able to take technology and do
something very meaningful and important
and valuable with it my name is Stefan
Marsh I'm the inventor of the erring
technology and the president of the
company my name is Tom cotton ins I'm
live in southborough Massachusetts with
my wife on the farmer it's what i like
to do i found i had sleep apnea through
a test
sleep apnea is an inability that
maintain normal ventilation during
oftentimes is very dramatic snoring
gasping and choking in the night why
it's important to treat sleep apnea is
the longer term consequences and that's
where the associations with heart
disease that evolved to the high risk of
stroke coronary disease heart attack
when you stop breathing and there's no
oxygen going to your brain that's going
to do some damage over time the most
common ter even a delivery of airway
pressure to amend their wasn't working
for me it was extremely cumbersome I
didn't want to take the mask off I
wanted to rip the mask off it's a
minority of patient we were able to
tolerate the treatment at home so I've
got to find some way to deal with this
and keep a smile on my face man starts
out usually doing things in a way that's
brute force but sometimes you can figure
out a way to do it that's a little bit
more elegant a little bit easier simpler
of that usually requires an invention
this is amazing I i really think that if
this works this will be the answer for
ninety-nine percent they'll never go
back to utha netting star wars the piece
on their head again when i see this i
say how can that possibly get the air in
me when i first talked to people about
this and I say well you know we have
these little micro pumps and and turns
out that they're very powerful they can
they can pump the right amount of air
the right amount of pressure their first
response is no way get out of here and
you know I go well yes I think we can
because our micro pumps are micro
blowers are very very small it's based
on two membranes that are
electrostatically attracted or repelled
from each other opposite charges attract
and that's libelous closing and blowing
the air out and like charges repel
that's the bellows opening and sucking
air in and if hundreds and hundreds of
these little fellows are plus 2 minus
plus and minus going together you get a
large amount of Arabic poetry zinc-air
batteries if the battery technology that
has a lot of stored energy in it it's
very dense which means it could be very
small to have the right amount of energy
then those bugs they're easy to insert
really it's one hand grab it's thicker
than you knows you've done the molded
for the rubber is extremely fine
everybody that we test with has found it
very comfortable really for the first
time in this disease we have a treatment
the patients will be willing to use
long-term consequences of sleep
the reduced it's comfortable it's well
tolerated patients can sleep in a
variety of positions just perfect
treatment it's almost like you can't
wait to try and I doubt a no it's
important to get this technology to get
this device to get the airing into
people's hands as quickly as possible
the fastest way that I know how to do
that is to raise sufficient amount of
money so we can manufacture to produce
it and get it out there so we're here to
ask you to give us a hand if you can
take this simple technology and treat
this sleeping disorders condition it
just that's what technology is for we've
got to go do something that's important
and I can't think of anything more
important for these growers to do them
thats a somewhat spotty the fish needs a
plan and the plants cream your water the
small sustainable system right on your
kitchen counter the fish include when
they pee and all that ways which
normally just builds up in regular
aquarium's actually get pumped up to the
grow bed and broken down by the plants
into a perfect organic fertilizers clean
water falls right back to the tank
and the best part of diet is that it's
all of this is happening but any soil of
chemical fertilizers the plants are
going to just the rocks and all the
nutrients are coming from the fish so
all you have to do is to speak damage
we spent six months with when the top
industrial designers and aquaponics
experts make Aquafarm beautiful and
incredibly simple to set up to date a no
green thumb or toolbox required and it
can fit any kitchen or classroom across
the country if something we're really
proud about it actually found the
perfect manufactured right here in our
backyard so every Aquafarm is made in
california the Aquafarm comes with
everything you need to get setup organic
seeds fish food starter pump to fill
with water add your fish plant please
it's been so cool watching this
community of aqua farmers develop and
everyone just making it their own but
added nails and shrimping grow lights
I'm so fun to watch so join the movement
get going with the octopod happy farming
everyone
measurements are integral to our
everyday lives by they can put us into
risky and tricky situations or require
someone else to help gange those lengthy
distances but here's a change by back
bisect needs in between now you can get
out of that whiskey spot and don't eat a
helping hand determine long diseases
eugenie measures and not one but two
directions from one press of a button
you can acquire the left right and total
value at once saving you precious time
and energy on every move and allowing
you to work with greater efficiency by
making you the focal point also your
measurements can be instantly updated to
your smart device with our sketch
application where you can design and
plan for any project VH Amy's additional
functions enable you to you use
continuous measuring mode to find the
points

and calculate the area and volume of any
