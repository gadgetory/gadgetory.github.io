special drone one that could help people
learn how to code when we first launched
Co drone
we immediately became a hit at CES Co
drone was even selected as one of the
top 10 finalists of last gadget standing
for most innovative products our focus
with Co drones is simple we want to help
people become better coders while having
fun in the process
we can't wait to release Co drone and
see what cool applications people will
come up with the full the force is what
gives a Jedi our it's an energy field
created by all living things around the
penetrator
aspire galaxy together
oh wow
I found a holocron
all the baby
creation it's at the very core of
Education when we teach we create
knowledge we create Drive and we create
possibility the goal at Sparrow has been
to instill the desire to create in
everyone and give them the tools to do
so while laying the foundation for
computer science and programming our
spark program is also about discovery
and the belief that the best lessons are
the ones we teach ourselves with the
tool set like spark that is accessible
and unbounded in its potential you can
give students a challenge and let them
discover the rest it's not our role to
limit young minds and place them on one
step past but to knock down the barriers
and let them forge their own at zero we
see this creativity at work every day we
see kids thinking outside the box and
asking their teachers how they can do
more and be more spark is comprised of
an amazing community of students
educators and leaders that will help us
discover our future and we are just
getting started so get inspired get
coding and get creative make and keep
making
