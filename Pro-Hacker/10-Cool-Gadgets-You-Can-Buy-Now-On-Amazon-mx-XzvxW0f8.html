we've been doing cybersecurity with the
Department of fence Pentagon Homeland
Security the FBI three experts we're
gonna start with a kik messenger
question can kick be safe I've got Jerry
Simpson and Jared Agnew that both the
cofounders of net pure a secure parent
controlled Wi-Fi network for every
device in your home in two steps
gentlemen welcome to the video thank you
thanks for having us we have some really
cool features that we've been working on
like being able to shut down certain
types of Internet content during certain
times so maybe you only want them doing
social media between the hours of 7 &amp;amp; 8
or you want the entire network to shut
down when they're supposed to be in bed
but I really believe that there's a
social responsibility to this product
and it adds value and consumers will
like it from fuel they're trying to
exploit children and they're safe from
going out and looking at all kinds of
other content say you want to block
YouTube a lot of parents have problem
with YouTube their kids hit something
it's educational in the next video it's
something horrible they can block
youtube.com but YouTube is an embedded
technology it's in Facebook it's all
over the place and they can't block it
from going into other apps or other
sites and because we're doing everything
at the network level it's shut down from
anywhere it just won't make it through
the network apps and now we're pivoting
to a hardware product that protects
children such a simple beautiful little
device that does so much plug this into
the internet and plug it into power and
you're done
hey can this kick out be safe at all for
students so the thing that we always we
do a lot of education at net peril is a
way to try to inform parents Jerry and
Jared Jared I want to hear from you what
tips would you have for parents to say
hey everything could end up public
someday and be hacked to let your child
know you know that there is nothing
private on the Internet
nothing nothing that's going to escape
our paddle in some shape or form yeah
net pure is a great product I think
that's wonderful and obviously the proof
is in the pudding that you guys are here
celebrating right
I'm gonna switch back to the net pure
off the corporate networking back to our
net pure restricted child safe network
should be connected there and I'm gonna
go right back and click on one of those
videos and you can see it's restricted
and furthermore let's just run that
search again and see what what kind of
results come back you can see that it's
a very different set of results you know
how to use a big thank you so much you
guys no job this video may help somebody
else the same way a lot of a heavy
consumer lifting good good product I
appreciate your time yeah thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
