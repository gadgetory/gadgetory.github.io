connecting to a charger it's the sound
of relief knowing you are still
connected to the world connecting and
disconnecting your phone from a charger
should be a simple seamless app but it
isn't
we've all been there frustrated at our
cables for any number of reasons the
placate looks it's becoming smaller they
haven't evolved to become any easier to
connect until now presenting the future
of USB cables ASAP Connect featuring
rare earth neodymium magnets with 18
karat gold plating ASAP Connect will
change the way you interact with your
USB devices forever
featuring the world's first reversible
cable on both the phone and in charger
ends
it works by inserting the tip to the
phone and the cable magnetizes on to the
tip instantly meaning you can
effortlessly connect when you only have
one hand free or in a hurry to head out
or even in the dark you no longer have
to worry about your devices getting
damaged
ASAP Connect even helped you retreat
your phone from hard-to-reach places
we've designed to test one for micro USB
devices such as Android phones mini
cameras and speakers the other is for
Apple product we've removed the weakness
of your traditional Apple Lightning
connector tip which snaps off easily by
combining the tip and base into one
piece we call this the alpha connector
one of the engineering hurdles in
designing a SAP Connect was its compact
size by condensing the technology down
to the size of a fingertip we're able to
make sure that it's compatible with all
phone cases in creating a new standard
for USB cables we have performed the
most stringent quality control tests
combined with superior materials to
really challenge the users expectations
of what a state-of-the-art USB cable
should be we've spent the past two years
working closely with one of the world's
largest USB cable manufacturers we're a
team of disruptors from Sydney to LA who
believe that users should be the
creators of products not large
corporations seeking profit over
practicality we've created the final
prototype and delivered samples to
dozens of major tech publications
worldwide through your help
combined with the magic of IndieGoGo we
hope to bring any SAP connect to life
and unleash the future of USB cables
