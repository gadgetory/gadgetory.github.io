Lee what is a game sometimes he wins
sometimes not oh come on Leroy

device feel the power feel the power
equipped with color changing LED
lighting and attached directly to the
Shuar foot the beacon connects to the PC

whatever keystrokes you would like with
four distinct motions leroy has
immediate access to up to 24 additional
hotkeys use it to pilot your ship or to
transform your character or to change
your stance and roll to the right or to
the left and or I guess roll back to the
right and then come on Leroy now you're
just rolling around in the dirt let's
get going
want to keep your focus on movement and
aiming use your foot to switch weapons
to reload
it's lien from cover or anything you
want and thanks to the beacons zero
point calibration you can play in
whatever position you want for tactics
sake or simply to make a gaming more
comfortable
the beacon reduces mechanical fail
making trigger complex comedy without
the use of automation scripts are
backwards the possibilities are endless
you're saying I can map anything I want
of course you can you can map any key
for any game you can oh wait a minute I
see what you're doing here
well played Leroy
the moment has arrived
no more waited no more guessing no more
using internal HD graphics yesterday's
science fiction is today's reality it's
time to reveal Hardware that pushes the
envelope for truly portable gaming and
productivity the power of 1800 million
transistors in the palm of your hand a
package so small and light it can be
taken with you anywhere this is six
screaming and this is our first buckers
our angel investors and engineers have
placed their lives and souls for the
development of the export no more
carrying heavy laptops no more carrying
heavy power supplies introducing XCore
in sports is more sexual activity than
with a keyboard but the keyboard wasn't
designed for gaming professionals in
their early twenties are suffering
frequent neck back and wrist issues if
they're already experiencing health
problems
what will be like in 10 years and for
the millions playing computer games
every day hi I'm Luis de leur Sevilla
founder and CEO of digne former fanatic
League of lions head coach and two times
EU LCS champion looking for solutions
for my players I discovered that the
keyword that we use for gaming hasn't
changed in 30 years and that's way too
long
during the last 14 months we've been
prototyping and dusting with users we've
created a beautiful premium quality
mechanical gaming keyboard design team
good performance health and comfort it's
called grace
a normal keyboard forces the risk to
vent over the inside of your hand raises
split design allows you to rotate both
halves so you reduce the strain in
wrists and shoulders race has a cool
aluminum body their connectors and
joints are magnetic and the cable gives
you an extra USB port you can create
multiple fully configurable layouts and
toggle instantly between them and assign
to each group of keys a different
backlight color and the under glow will
give you visual feedback when you change
layouts race has the functionality of a
full-size you are in a much smaller
footprint it's crazy that we use both
hands for only one massive key race has
eight thumb keys
they are comfortable to use because they
are in the area where our thumbs
naturally rest raises a keyboard and
again in keypad in the same device you
can detach any side and the other will
still work this way you can have more
space for your mouse while your gaming
it's comfortable for both left and
right-handed gamers there are many kinds
of mechanical switches all races
switches are hot swappable so you can
easily pull them out and replace them
whenever you want regular keyboards then
the wrist up creating strain over time
pounders are needed to raise the wrist
making a neutral angle if you want a
premium quality mechanical gaming
keyboard with a beautiful design that
can help you improve performance health
and comfort support us
let's make race a reality the way we
interact with our technology hasn't
really changed in 60 years
welcome Kai a revolutionary controller
that will redefine the way you work and
play
switching your slides is now a joyride
and exploring your timeline on Premiere
Pro that fluid and playing with
SolidWorks is an absolute delight the
Chi is your magic wand
it becomes what you want it to
a steering wheel of fury check a sword
of destruction check an accessory of
fashion double-check the potential is
limitless the Chi isn't looking to take
away your keyboard or your mouse it's
meant to die in the gestural experience
with them so using the Chi while typing
or pointing is a breeze the Chi comes
with an adjustable and customizable
strap it's extremely accurate with a 10
millisecond latency and an entire work
day of battery life guy comes built in
with ble connectivity - and that means
the Chi isn't just limited to computers
we've taught the guy to do things like
home automation and virtual reality
control and even controlling drones in
the near future
our young and passionate team has worked
on over 22 iterations and we are ready
to take the chi for large-scale
manufacturing we are 100% ready to go
for manufacturing and your contribution
will help us get there if you love the
Chi please do contribute and help us
make a revolution in digital interaction
