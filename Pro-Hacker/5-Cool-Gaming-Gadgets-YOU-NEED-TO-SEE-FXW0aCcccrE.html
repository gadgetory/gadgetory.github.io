envelope for truly portable gaming and

transistors in the palm of your hand a
package so small and light it can be
taken with you anywhere this is six
screaming and this is our first buckers

placed their lives and souls for the
development of the export no more

heavy power supplies introducing XCore
in sports is more sexual activity than
with a keyboard but the keyboard wasn't
designed for gaming professionals in
their early twenties are suffering
frequent neck back and wrist issues if

the millions playing computer games
every day hi I'm Luis de leur Sevilla
founder and CEO of digne former fanatic
League of lions head coach and two times
EU LCS champion looking for solutions
for my players I discovered that the
keyword that we use for gaming hasn't
changed in 30 years and that's way too
long

prototyping and dusting with users we've
created a beautiful premium quality
mechanical gaming keyboard design team

vent over the inside of your hand raises
split design allows you to rotate both
halves so you reduce the strain in
wrists and shoulders race has a cool
aluminum body their connectors and
joints are magnetic and the cable gives
you an extra USB port you can create
multiple fully configurable layouts and
toggle instantly between them and assign
to each group of keys a different
backlight color and the under glow will
give you visual feedback when you change
layouts race has the functionality of a
full-size you are in a much smaller
footprint it's crazy that we use both
hands for only one massive key race has
eight thumb keys
they are comfortable to use because they
are in the area where our thumbs
naturally rest raises a keyboard and
again in keypad in the same device you
can detach any side and the other will
still work this way you can have more
space for your mouse while your gaming
it's comfortable for both left and
right-handed gamers there are many kinds
of mechanical switches all races
switches are hot swappable so you can
easily pull them out and replace them
whenever you want regular keyboards then
the wrist up creating strain over time
pounders are needed to raise the wrist
making a neutral angle if you want a
premium quality mechanical gaming
keyboard with a beautiful design that
can help you improve performance health
