made a while back it's like magic has a
certain feeling to it it was an error
when people had time to pay attention to
every detail and things were made to let
inspired by the horse headlights we've
collected over the years we combined our
skills to create something useful really
amazing we would be proud of having
around
we wanted it to have a personality the
stance had to inspire confidence just
like a superhero strength the footprint
is large enough to keep it balanced
besides was chosen so it will be tall
enough to provide light for the entire
office that has repeat the name
direction and at any angle even large
enough to be used as a headphone stand
we fitted it to LED light sources to
have the perfect light for any situation

can even be synced to music so we will
flash to the beat when you're having a
party
look some functionality weren't enough
the materials had to be top notch as
well the head is made out of old tractor
headlight it's all metal and glass so it
would last even in the toughest
conditions the network the only exposed
part is made from aluminum so it won't
rust bodies made from recycled
polyurethane help the environment a bit

personal touch to it so starting from
day one you can choose a color to match
your room biometric personality to have
full body coverage each land so we'll
have two layers of non-toxic water-based
paint and to basically as clear coated

scratch over time we put our heart and
soul into design of the land there and
making the first prototype to be able to
produce it and make it available we'll

immediate wall clock the original idea
was based on a simple principle making

focus on the current time and little
else just on simplicity neatness and
immediacy a little window on the current
time the freaky segments the section
reads the time basically a digital hound
stretching a line finding the right
measurements drawing the racing in the
attempt to reach the goal that only a
few have ever reached to get from
product to accessory the move had been
made the aim was very clear freakish
clock had to be made into an accessory a
small and elegant window on time

all times a watch for everyone an

hi we are blue wave I'm here I'm too
fast we love music and good sound we
love our wire that phone but we also
love the convenience of wireless we've
been working for a while now on an
elegant solution that combines both me
yet it's small it's light and it's the
best wireless headphone amplifier ever
made headphones just like speakers need
to be driven they need an amplifier for
them to work so there's a tiny employer
in every smartphone but it's not
powerful enough to properly drive your
high-end headphones up to now carrying a
headphone and men strapping a bulky
brick to your phone the solution only
hardcore audio files would contend with
no more get bring the solution that is
the best of both worlds it will drive
your headphones beautifully and
wirelessly in a nutshell the headphones
will sound better plugged in to get them
plugged directly into your smartphone
we packed an awesome amount of
technology in this tiny device every
single component in the electronic
design was chosen with audio performance
in mind we spare no details to achieve a
crystal-clear sound you'll see the specs
great specs but adding worked in audio

sum of its parts I'm sure you'll enjoy
