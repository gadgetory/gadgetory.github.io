content without touching the beer
whatsoever knowing the amount of co2
generated during the fermentation allows
us to calculate these key parameters
Plato is designed to optically measure
to co2 flow through the glass clear
Triton airlock making a truly
non-invasive data is gathered calculated
and sent to the online clouds using
Wi-Fi Plato gives you more than just
instant and historical data it analyzes
the ongoing fermentation and generates a
