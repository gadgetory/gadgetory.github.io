sometimes the best moments of our lives
are the unpredicted ones the small
surprises or the everyday experiences
they're the happy accidents that change
our lives we won't always have the time
to take out our phone to record these
fleeting moments of happiness wouldn't
it be great to capture and keep these
memories instead of simply watching them
pass by this is what we invented the
mocha cam
snap-snap is the world's smallest 4k
camera and unlike any current action
camera Snap is small enough to wear
comfortably and it's elegant design is a
fit with any fashion statement the
innovative 180 degree flip lens allows
you to shoot from the best angles and
enables so many creative possibilities
it may not always be easy to find the
button when you wear a camera but with
snap you can turn it on and start
filming with just a click of the remote
the snap battery-life allows for
one-and-a-half hours of continuous video
recording which is impressive for a
camera of its tiny size
what's more the video can be uploaded to
the cloud via the Wi-Fi connection so
you can share the story of your life
with friends and family anywhere
immediately with the magnet clip quarter
inch adapter or waterproof case you'll
have numerous ways to wear it and
explore and with 4k image quality those
precious moments of life are yours to
remember forever
this is our fourth crowdfunding campaign
from the development and launch of our
mocha cam mocha 360 and alpha products
we've learned how to turn good design
into reliable and durable products
quickly and efficiently memory can be
blurry notes can be lost but recorded
images tell the true stories of our
lives capture the best moments of your
life with snap upload them to the cloud
and keep them forever
finally a gaming mouse that puts full
control in the palm of your hand
LexA is a mouse specifically designed
for gamers of all levels so whether you
play in professional gaming tournaments
or you're just a weekend gamer LexA is
designed to be a versatile mouse for
gamers everywhere Oh awesome the mouse
is super smooth and this is something a
lot of companies can't get Alexa plows
easily allows you to perform complex
tasks at multiple dimensions with
increased precision usually you'd have
to stop in order to switch through your
items in your inventory but when you're
using the joystick you can just simply
just scroll through your items so it
does genuinely give you an advantage
when you're playing your game like
Minecraft lexif provides six degrees of
freedom via two joysticks and one laser
glide sensor it works by tilting forward
backward and side-to-side the mouse
moves with your hand and it goes with it
that's a very big plus this mouse but
actually here a competitive advantage in
gameplay the laser sensor lets the user
control the mechanical gliding at very
high speeds while maintaining the best
accuracy the tilting allows you to have
more three-dimensional movement all
within the mouse itself so you can
combine multiple movements into your
Mouse seamlessly it has a joystick on
the side so if I'm playing and I want to
zoom in to shoot someone it
automatically goes into the zoom mode I
don't have to like double-click on the
mouse I'm kind of shot are they gonna
give you I doubt that lexif sheet is
designed in a way that buttons are very
accessible while still providing a solid
feeling the sides are covered in the
finest rubber enabling a strong grip
when needed that's comfortable it's
smooth I wasn't ready for it
the lexif gaming mouse also provides a
separate model specifically designed for
left-handed gamers what truly sets the
LexA Mouse apart from its competitors is
it's conveniently positioned joystick on
the side of the mouse along with its
internal mechanical two axis joystick
which allows users to operate the mouse
to tilt or to use as a joystick offering
two options in one this mini joystick
features mechanical feedback forces that
only regular-sized joysticks used to
offer making
this the first of its kind the joystick
allows me to go through the entire map
which is actually really cool it's great
it's gonna make a massive difference in
big games well yeah you can use the
joystick over smaller here lexis control
panel allows you to customize and
configure the settings specific to what
you're comfortable with providing you
with various shortcuts and once you
configure the settings you won't need to
configure them again our goal is to
bring the Lexx emmaus to gamers
everywhere but we need your help please
support our campaign so that you too can
take advantage of the innovative
features our gaming mouse will offer you
elevate your gameplay with LexA
oh Jesus Christ
you cool only the world's strongest
cable
unlike other phone cable companies we
won't speculate that you can lift
weights of our cable after all why don't
you want to do that
however you put on get to the real test
come on let me show you what I mean rom
grim this should be library welcome to
after that this device here we'll be
testing our cable by sending it 90
degrees both ways at a rate of 60 pence
per minute
see how long you last for
we could be here forever but hey let's
take it even further so for the final
test let's see what people can withstand
the forces beyond as you can see our
cables are harder better faster
