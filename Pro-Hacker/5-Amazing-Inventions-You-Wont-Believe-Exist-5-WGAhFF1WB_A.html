like to take pictures and post them to
social media so that your friends think
you're cool so go ahead and snap that
pic your self-esteem depends on it but
wait there's a problem you can't take
pictures on your phone because you're
wearing gloves and you don't really want
to go out and buy a new pair so what do
you do hi there I'm Tony the creator of
tests well I'm not Tony actually uh
that's Tony I'm just the action they
hired to play them so what is taps you
ask well taps is this amazing sticker
that makes any gloves touchscreen
compatible just peel stick and you taps
will work with any device like this like
this and like this how does it work you
ask well it's simple really we took this
magical formula that we created before
the super strong adhesive and we bonded
them together
science and it doesn't just work with
gloves either worse this works with this
and it also works with this do here dry
yourself
yo that sick but will it ruin my gloves
that is an excellent question no no will
not and it's waterproof yeah taps will
make a pretty great gift for your dad
your brother your mother doesn't need it
your sister back us today
what we want to do is bring his physical
experience of using the energy the
impact that you get at a concert or club
into the real world where you can have
it everywhere and anytime you want bass
is really the part of the music that
connects you to the music physically in
a club you get that big energy from a
big sound system if you put on the music
the next day and you just have
headphones on you're just missing that
part whatever music you're listening to
it adds a physical element to it which
is something that you're totally missing
normally in a home listening or
on-the-go environment people are pushing
the envelope of what they can get out of
those big systems with the way that they
make it music when we put put the based
on someone's arm and we turn on the
music and soon as the beef kicks in they
have this big smile on their face
because it really pulls you into the
music you listen to it but you can also
feel it in your body I more aggressive
sort of on the base and you wouldn't
think that you know the same pace and
you know the same intensity that the
baselet would be able to match it it's
really the power of it is the ability to
get that you know tactile physical
immersion that you get with like sub
bass and yet in the end it was just fun
I didn't want to take it off you know
the baselet has very high fidelity it
matches exactly the waveform of the base
that we're trying to reproduce for us
the main challenge was no technology
existed that could do this in such a
small size so we had to create our own
and differentiate between this melodic
baseline and hard kicks so even if the
music is a melody and a kick in between
you can feel the difference the drums
you can actually kind of feel them like
palms and cake and stuff I felt the mall
walkers on the wrong with it inside the
baselet is amazing technology we've
built our own haptic engine which takes
up roughly half the space we've got the
other half which is battery to give a
really long play time and we've managed
to squeeze the electronics around the
battery and the haptic engine so there's
hardly any room for the electronics and
it was a tough job to get it into this
size the baselet is really designed as
an everyday companion you can hook it up
to a smartphone to a computer you can
hook it up to a laptop or VR headset you
can really use it with anything that you
would use for for listening to music for
playing games or watching movies the
basics designed to be really easy to use
you just plug and play basically there's
no app to load there's no software to
configure ideally in the morning you
leave the house you put it on you put on
your headphones when you come you to war
when you're at work or whenever you want
to listen to music out and about I think
that's when the basic comes in bass
actually has a really powerful
energizing impact on you I think it's
going to be great when you're out about
jogging or doing sports that it really
elevates you kinda activates you and
keeps you going one of the cool things
about the basis that it hooks up to
anything that has a headphone out of it
and so what I tried right away is
hooking up to a synthesizer and you play
a bass line and suddenly you have that
physical impact on base you can feel the
beats of the music you're creating and
if you're DJ you can also use the
baselet to get a sense of how the music
will feel on a big sound system in a
club as well as for music lovers I'm
really making the basic for myself I
want to use it everyday and we're
already at this stage and I'm really
really happy with that music is
certainly the most important content in
people's lives so whatever chance I have
to make that experience better I'm gonna
going to use it when I jumped on it I
wouldn't take it off this used to be me
starting another day with the same for
wireless connection we all experience
for Wi-Fi day and night and never found
a good solution this has been my problem
for the last 10 years in probably yours
too hi I'm David I want to introduce you
to the circle the word first known
electrical wife amplifier with sous Pro
you can easily double and even triple
your Wi-Fi range and also maximize your
Wi-Fi quality just by mounting it on
your router antenna seuss pro focuses
the Wi-Fi frequency to 180 degrees
instead of 360 degrees most Wi-Fi
routers nowadays have two or even more
antennas so in installing Zeus pro you
still can get 360 degrees Wi-Fi
connection but now with three times the
range and that's not all
it could be your old neighbor surfing on
your Wi-Fi five days but it can be an
unwanted guest Wi-Fi is highly easily
hackable by turning Zeus pro and aim it
to your private area you can secure your
wireless network from unwanted guests
Zeus Pro also increases your Wi-Fi
connection speed by reducing
interferences that block the Wi-Fi
signal and for the gamers between us it
reduces lags and disconnections
the charity solar aid challenged us to
design an LED lantern for Africa but we
ended up designing a radical new form of
lighting I'm Jim and this is gravity
light we set out to design a light that
could replace the ubiquitous and
damaging kerosene lamps widely used in
remote areas of Africa the line was to
contain a battery and be recharged from
a solar panel the further the project
progressed though the more we fell there
was an opportunity for a more radical
approach which better answered the
problem we have created a lamp which
will cost villages less than ten dollars
to buy with no running costs the
villages investment is returned within
three months of being freed from the
cost of kerosene from then on it saves
them money our new light is powered by
gravity a seconds it takes to lift a
weight creates enough energy for half an
hour of light whenever it's needed it
has no batteries to run out replace or
dispose of we have designed gravity
light to power other things as well such
as a reading light a radio or simply to
recharge batteries
the brightness of the light can be
adjusted up for a task light or down for
a gentle glow which lasts over half an
hour it is delivered in a durable fabric
bag which when filled with rocks sand or
earth provides the weight to power it we
are passionate to take this idea forward
and we know that with further R&amp;amp;D
funding we can double its efficiency and
real this into an even cheaper optimized
mark too so we hope you like our idea
it's taken a lot of work to get it this
one but now we really need you I offer
to make it real when your funds to tool
manufacture and trial a thousand units
which will give two villages in the
developing world will gain valuable
insights into how they use them our
daily basis these insights will help us
refine our design with production
volumes we can get price down and
efficiency up meaning that in the future
villagers can purchase a gravity life
for less than five dollars control the
revolution in Iowa
their first is always the winner the
second is the first loser after
launching the first control I web
products the control one we receive so
many repress from the crowd standing
community for a new design with a full
frame and a new color and there it is

the disability plays a big role in every
sport and specially mountain biking
there's a new I work and really make the
difference I mainly riding rough terrain

you don't see shit you have to break
fast and you can't really do anything
with the normal I way sir I'm really
interesting about this product using the
automatic mode makes me really feel like
I'm more in control I really feel safe
that going downhill with it with high
speed and entering tunnel is forests or
any danger coming up control I wear uses
