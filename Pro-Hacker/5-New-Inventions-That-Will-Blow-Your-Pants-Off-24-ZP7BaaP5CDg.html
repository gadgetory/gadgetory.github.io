okay what if the photograph could come
to life in your hands but if you could
print a GoPro video or an apple live
photo what if you could instantly send
your friends a magical photograph from
your surfing trip or photo from the
concert of the century or what life
print you can so there's basically three
major things that make life print really
great the first is our ability to give
you easy access to all of your special
moments by integrating your social media
and video into our app we seamlessly
integrate with GoPro with Apple live
photos with Instagram with Facebook
would bind with Twitter and then we also
integrate your iOS camera roll and
Android camera right basically the point
is is that we're giving you super easy
access to any photo or video you might
want to print next what we do is we can
add an augmented reality video
experience embedded into any photo you
have this is called hyper photo which is
really cool it's like magic or something
and then we can portably print and share
these hyper photos to anyone in the
world within our network and of course
you can print all of your regular still
photos to the augmented reality piece
just add something extra only if you
really want the third thing that makes
us special is our social network back in
this allows you to share your photos all
over the world now this is actually
something that we're really proud of
because when you take a photo you
probably want to share that moment with
someone not just keep it for yourself
think of us like a physical version of
Instagram I'll also say that when you
send someone a photo they have
permission to accept the print or not
they're not forced to keep printing
photos of your aunt's cats over and over
again and we design life print to be
incredibly high quality we designed it
with long-lasting materials in a
minimalist design language and we've
intentionally made it to be lightweight
and small enough to fit in your pocket
and portability is really key here
because it allows you to share these
moments in person so you can bring your
life print.printer to parties or on
camping trips and then share these
moments with your friends and we even
have a sticky back film so you can slap
it on the bottom of your skateboard or
on your fridge or wherever you want and
for our GoPro users we've designed a
really special ruggedized case that
protects the printer so you can feel
safe when you take it out with you in
the field and we require no ink toner to
print we have a partnership with Z which
means you won't ever need to buy ink for
this product it's another great feature
so today we're offering you a better
Richard experience for your photos by
integrating augmented reality we're
giving you a chance to share real photos
with your friends and family and we're
giving you the opportunity to put all
your photos and videos into one place
within our app so you can easily free
them in the prison's of their digital
screens we do this to capture the magic
of holding something real in your hands
so if that sounds like the kind of thing
you're interested in we have all sorts
of amazing pledges for you and be sure
to share a project to be because we're
giving away free film when you share
this and tag us on Facebook and Twitter
so don't miss out on that you can just
check out the referral section below so
thanks for watching all the way to the
end of the video and we appreciate your
support
right here we go and we did can we
design life why am I saying that
language hahahaha we design we design
hey the Osmo design studio from munich
and the creative team behind the cosmos
pan as designers we were looking for the
perfect pen for a very long time but we
never found one we realized pen
manufacturers are not willing to take
the risk to try something new so we
decided to make it on our own without
for over a year on every detail of the
pen invented a whole new mechanism
crafted different prototypes to now come
up with a product and we believe is
perfect the story behind the design of
the cosmos pen is simple the beauty of
nature was inspiring us through the
whole process it was very interesting to
discover all the similarities in our
universe there is a close connection
from small plants up to giant galaxies a
universal pattern defines their
appearance the golden ratio which can be
observed in so many structures of nature
because humans it appears very beautiful
and harmonic we have put a lot of effort
to apply the golden ratio to every
visible part of the pen the result is
amazing it's so clean and minimalistic
the penance process from a solid block
of aluminum which was the most durable
alloy which is also used in aerospace
engineering to ensure long-lasting
product and comfortable writing
experience our newly invented mechanism
is based on magnetic forces a simple and
quick shift gets your pen ready for
writing also with only one hand the
characteristic gap gives you instant
visual feedback on the state of the pan
and after all it's just fun to play we
need your support to realize our first
production line please help us to bring
cosmos delight thank you
you
you
now along with awesome dimensioning
features of the light app will give you
pro app the fastest most affordable and
most portable way to scan 3d curves and
we're including five years pro for free
only on IndieGoGo my 3d peeps this one
is for you we're living in exciting
times learning so much more about what
our bodies need for rolling is emerging
as a self-care strategy of choice among
active people everywhere until now the
primary feature of most phone roles has
been a flat surface cylinder the problem
is our bodies aren't flat our bodies
have curves seeing so much room for
improvement I created something
completely new hi everyone I'm dr. K and
this is the Intel all the world's first
form-fitting foam roller Intel rolls
anatomic design contours to your natural
curves to reduce pain and increase
mobility in as little as 30 seconds in a
world increasingly dependent on
technology spinal problems have become
an epidemic because forward postures
cause chronic muscle strain and
accelerate degeneration the intelr
releases muscle tension and improve
spinal alignment in as little as 30
seconds it's also a great tool for post
exercise recovery but don't just take my
word for it here's what others have to
say my name is bas Rutten I'm an ex
mixed martial artist and it was actually
the first UFC heavyweight champion with
that profession a lot of injuries come I
have a bad neck I have that nice and
tell you all helps me perfect with both
problems my name is dr. Eric blom i love
the Intel or I've used it personally I
have my wife use it because it conforms
to my body it makes it easier and more
enjoyable for me to do the exercises and
to get the proper benefits from foam
rolling the vision of the intel cam to
me one day because I realized
traditional foam rollers would never
reach the area's I needed them to with
the help of my friend dawn and my father
hovik both engineers we began by car
coming out the spine zone we then
created concave surfaces we called the
body zones unlike traditional rollers
the spines own targets the muscles
surrounding the spine while protecting
the vertebrae perfect for your neck mid
and low back as our torsos and limbs
around the concave surface of the body's
own wrap around any part of your body
massaging more muscle area at every
moment of use with better control for
faster and more effective results the
story the intelligible needs I've always
been active and in the process of having
a lot of fun I've sustained quite a few
injuries particularly from surfing
during periods of recovery I became so
fascinated with a body that I chose a
career initially as a personal trainer
and then as a Doctor of Chiropractic
specializing in exercise rehab the
intellimouse a station of my 18 years of
clinical experience helping people just
like you move better and live better
we've been taking feedback for over two
years from people just like you we
learned that some like it harder and
some like it softer so we created the
Intel all firm and flex we enhance the
spine track added sensory bumps texture
for better grip and we selected the most
durable foam available to bring you the
highest quality self care tool on the
market today this is where you come in
help us bring the benefits of the Intel
all to you by supporting our campaign as
a reward to our backers we're offering
the Intel all at a significant pre
market value we have a wide range of
perks including early bird specials
combo packages and volume discounts for
resellers you can also help us by
sharing our campaign with your friends
and family I'm passionate about
self-care because it affords us the
freedom to participate in the activities
we love with the people we love join the
Intel remove minus find sustainable
self-care to help you move better and
live better
the barrister is finally here to
redesign your morning introducing a
whole new way to wake up and begin your
fresh new day promising to renew your
morning routine the barrister combines
ultimate convenience with a sensory
experience wake up to the invigorating
aroma of freshly brewed coffee or tea at
your chosen time before going to bed for
the blast boiling vessel with enough
water for your chosen morning drink
place the bung in the top of the boiling
vessel securely if you take milk with
your drink for the specially designed
milk vessel next we're ready for you to
add the good stuff to bring the freshly
ground coffee into the filter on the
sealed storage compartment set your
alarm time then set the brute um for
your drink before at the alarm or after
the barrister can be used for tea as
well as coffee charge your phone off the
USB port located in the base my research
was inspired by the psychology behind
sleep and relaxation I learned that
adopting a nightly routine can encourage
a more restful night's sleep whilst
gently stimulating one sensors can lead
to better awakening
another branch of my research was
looking at function versus aesthetic my
aim was to design a beautiful product
that people can proudly display in their
home but that also engages the user
physically the barrister uses induction
heating for maximum safety and
efficiency the induction coil induces an
electromagnetic currents but heats the
content of the vessel when the vessel
balls it creates steam which pushes the
water out and into the coffee simple
science however this hasn't been a
simple process it has taken a year of
hard work and dedication to get it right
the barrister has been endlessly refined
for manufacturing purposes the induction
heating element has been the biggest
challenge to overcome there are no
off-the-shelf parts that fit the
required specifications of the product I
have been working with an experienced
team of electrical engineers to design
code and build an induction heater that
produces the outfit required whilst
keeping it small enough to integrate it
into the product what we have refined
and developed a built-in pelletier
cooler to ensure milk is kept cool
overnight the filter arm has three
magnets to keep it in place for your
convenience we've redesigned a higher
quality filter for more efficient
brewing the boiling vessel has been
redeveloped with a stainless steel base
for improves connection to the induction
coil a max line has been integrated on
the boiling vessel
the LED display now includes a light
sensor to regulate the display
brightness adjusting to your environment
why we need you gearing up for
manufacture means huge resources and
financial support we are a self funded
startup and have funded as much as the
project ourselves as possible now we
need your support with the barrister
quality as our main concern and we
refuse to make any compromises we have
been working with the top safety experts
to ensure that we meet all the health
and safety requirements we have
world-class sourcing companies with
years of experience lined up who are
standing by to coordinate all stages of
production and logistics I cannot think
of anything better and see this product
becoming reality and have people all
over the world waking up to the
barrister I haven't come this far to
only get this far so please back the
barrister and join our mission for
better mornings
