camping and backpacking adventures but a
problem we face again and again is that
each trip calls for a specific tent
an ultralight shelter when it's just me
two persons hands on the body tiny pool
and something bigger for a group a
cotopaxi we set out to solve this
problem we're introducing the new NT 210
system offering you one streamlined
setup and adapts to your specific needs
our system is made up of a two-person
standalone 10 it's rain fly and a snap
in alcove that seamlessly integrates
with the tent
the Institute itself speaks to which is
a double wall construction and using
took three holes for students to setup
it has just the right blend of features
for your lightweight backpacking and
camping inventions
it's simple lightweight body and it's
perfect for one or two person
backpacking
and the included rain fly with dual
integrated vestibules lets you back down
the hatches when the weather turns
now the alcove also known as the tenth
guestroom it's a separate shelter that
seamlessly integrates with your env to
effectively doubling the space with two
extra people or added gear many other
tent makers use some type of vestibule
or awning and claim it adds living space
but only ours features a built in floor
to create more space that protects you
from the ground up just like the tennis
on xone the alcoves single prophetic and
multiple stakeout points needed serves
as an ultra-light minimal two-person
sandal and filters it can be set up from
two separate configuration lashes to a
tree or a larger opening or stake it
down with trekking poles with the in t2
tent system we're filling the gaps in
the market our system is made to adapt
to any camping situation 3:10 fling one
stream line system
from the initial concept to final design
in DC's interest in something we have
super excited
hence continue to get lighter and more
technical but overall design hasn't
really changed until now our system
solved the problem and we know it'll
help eliminate your tantrum to making
your time in the outdoors much more fun
and hassle-free but the final step of
our journey in getting the first batch
of indie to tent systems Purdue and Alta
market involve you if you in our
campaign and get your indie - and time
to enjoy the summer camping season
thanks for watching and please support
of everything is going to include the
outdoors is not just somewhere you pass
through to get from your apartment to
work there is no end to the adventures
we can have it's only we seek them with
our eyes wide open we weren't meant to
live and work in a world of cramped
spaces so croa
is here to help
me wherever

after our successful campaign last year
we listened to you and we have designed
the crew a hybrid for you you can order
yours now right here
we believed tents should be better now
they are
Oh
anyone who has ever used a tent is
familiar with three age-old problems
when it gets cold outside it's freezing
inside and as soon as temperatures rise
outside a conventional tent immediately
becomes sweltering like an oven you have
to get up and get out regardless of the
time of day or night this can be
particularly unsettling for kids thirdly
when we can't be large campsites there
is no noise barrier between us and the
outside world which means we might as
well invite everyone in from the
campsite into our cast again a big
problem when you're just trying to get a
good night's rest now this is bad enough
for us occasional campers just imagine
having to live with these problems every
day year after year while living in one
of the thousands of packed refugee camps
all over the world
well we're thermal tents have solved
these problems ours is the world's very
first correctly insulated tent thermal
tent eradicate the abrupt spikes and
temperature that occur in traditional
tents
it also helps muffle noise transfer in
and out our groundbreaking design has
applications in both camping tents and
disaster relief tents we will
revolutionize tenting all over the world
by incorporating an additional insulated
layer and this new design has been
proven to massively improve both thermal
and acoustic performances
once you discover thermo tent you'll see
camping in a whole new way hi everybody
I'm Derrick O'Sullivan CEO of thermo
tents
I was looking enough to grow up in a
beautiful little town land in the
southwest of Ireland perfect territory
for camping so I did I lost before
exciting things like mortgages took over
although I love camping I love the
outdoors I love everything about us
something used to really grace on me
about my various tents and these
problems have been echoed right across
the world now that's bad enough when you
have to deal with it for a weekend here
or a week there imagine having to deal
with these conditions and these problems
day after day month after month year
after year I have seen these overcrowded
refugee camps all over the world that
firsthand and believe me when I say that
these are real and practical problems
for the people who have been thrust into
this way of life through no fault of
their own thermo tent is going to offer
these people along with campers right
across the globe an unbelievable
increase in the level of comfort that
they would experience in their tents
hurricanes combine multi-layer design
and state of the art breathable
insulation solutions along with other
high quality materials to create an
insulated yet well ventilated and airy
sleeping environment our design has been
carefully tested to make sure that
optimum and face comfort levels are met
while limiting condensation risk thermo
tents which are just as easily erected
as existing tents of similar sizes will
be available in a range of design we are
also adapted quickly for organizations
such as disaster relief agencies and
large camp sites with our bespoke design
capability we have incorporated a simple
vacuum system to reduce the bulk of our
inner tent for your convenience and our
vacuum pump can be reversed and used to
inflate your camping mattresses will
also be branding and selling some
associated products such as this USB
charger which uses nothing but salt
water as fuel just add few water or mix
your own salt with water plug in your
phone or camera via USB and go don't
wait around for the Sun which might take
days to charge your device our charger
is another world's first for the thermal
detector and so Kickstarter's this is
where you come in we are a new company
and we have already invested heavily in
research and development to get our
products to launch stage now we need
your help to get thermo tents into
campsites all over the world we've also
developed a special product to satisfy
disaster relief needs we want to order
tents and increase brand awareness so we
can introduce thermo tent to the world
this year we are asking for your
contribution in exchange for some
fantastic rewards which you can find
listed on our page you could be one of
the first people in the world to
discover the magic of thermal tent
thank you very much for your help
hello and thank you for taking the time
to view our campaign video I'm Jason
hall director of m2c innovation with
inventors of the hugely successful
content brand that has taken the camping
world by storm over the last few years
pod changed the face of camping by
allowing tents to be connected together
and we are now ready for launch of quick
pitch modular camping version called Q
cube offers quick pitching times of less
than 2 minutes straight out the bag and
fully pitch unlike other quick pitching
tents in fact like many other tents in
the camping world you can stand up in
all of our variations for the two men
right through to the format the cube
isn't easy to pack away as it is to set
up and it means you won't need to be an
expert in origami to try and get it back
into the bag when you're ready to come
home one of the major issues with
standard sense is being woken up by the
Sun so with the cube tent
we've added a black lining to our
material and this blocks out the
sunlight our expensive ventilation
system means that a cool environment
inside our tents the material is pre-new
coated and rake it to our hydrostatic
head ratings of 4,000 meaning you'll be
nice and dry even under heavy rain
conditions a heavy duty 300d nylon
material link this tent is built to last
for many years to come the key to the
cube is that let D etre arete and they
offer your great space inside in
addition we have a few extras that we
think will make this 10 in a class of
its own unlike other tent you can
connect them together the universal
timing system means you can build your
own bespoke set up of interconnected
heads on every cube you can connect to
every corner mean the possibilities to
join are absolutely endless
just imagine the fun of who provides
could have connecting together these at
our festival
for instance securing your very own
party area as part of this campaign we
are offering a two man 3 man and poor
man versions of the tenants in blue red
and orange color options we are also
adding for Madam's offering you a solar
panel that can be fixed inside the
window of the cube to store power and a
thirteen thousand milliamp battery pack
this pack you've had has a huge capacity
why not use it to use one of our ultra
cool LED lighting strips we're offering
this LED light strip in white or if you
want to attend to be the party tent then
you can use the color-changing version
we've been developing the cubes for the
last six months and have finally signed
off a sample that we are happy meets all
of our strict quality controls and so
now we need your help to meet the
materials and production cost to bring
this project to life and with our
existing distribution network that
already covers the UK Europe and the USA
we know we'll get this product out to
you on time we put together some amazing
packages for you to play join and all we
need now is your help to bring our
vision for light with your pledge and
now you've seen it please share it so
it's use the hashtag cubit there's an
intent this is a rival one intended a
good solution to sleep in nature rhino
walls is an all-around incredible
solution that's just incredible
yeah we repeated the word incredible can
attend to this no it can't
oh and when you laid down to sleep in a
temple you need a sleeping bag and a
mattress you know what rhino wolf has to
say about that stupid tent and rhino
walk with a modular attachable are what
do I call it not a tent because it's so
much better than a tent it's a modular
attachable rider wall because there is
nothing like it
rhino wolf is amazingly built every seam
is precisely the fabric is the strongest
possible with extra thought the weight
with all those right materials and a
built-in sleeping bag and mattress rhino
wolf weighs only 5 pounds
that's at least 2 pounds less than
carrying a sleeping bag mattress and
tent separately and you also don't look
like a snail when carrying it ha look at
that smile man snail man rhino wolf also
weighs less than other all in 110 but
it's also better than them because it's
not a tense
it's a writable rhino wolf has a main
arch that gives the entire structure its
solid strength and allows for straight
sides which enables great airflow and a
fit for the human body you're human
right yeah you are rhino wolf can
withstand very low temperatures and
feels very cool in warm one of course
it's windproof rain proof and bug food
it's a rhino it's strong and yes it also
comes in pink and rhino wolf can pull
off any colour the setup Rhino will you
just use one pole yeah one that's less
than any other number just push the
poles through the sleeve and you're done
now thanks to the rhino wolf part you
can easily attach your incredible Rhino
to other incredible rivals and clean up
the pack of rhino walls get it a rhino
wolf pack take a look at the rhino wolf
sleeping bag that weighs less but keeps
you warmer
we took some feeling from the bottom
added it to the top and put an
insulating air mattress instead so you
sleep like in a bed not like you're
stuck in a cube like some two feeds or
something
you're not toothpaste you're human and
you deserve comfort Rhino wolf comfort
when you attach another Rhino wolf you
can also attach the blankets to create a
double bed for you know things you do in
a double bed need some privacy
just close your own Rhino and you've got
your own rule yup
a double bed with privacy is that better
than your home probably not
that's a stupid comparison fee we have a
vision
no more tents no more carrying extra
sleeping equipment just Rhine wolves
everywhere because a tent that's okay
Rhino wolf is incredible get one and be
happy it's simple
Rhino Oh what does a rhino wolf do
camping gives us amazing opportunity to
explore remote destinations climb new
heights make new friends and experience
epic festival
but there's always been a catch after
sunrise tents are often too hot or too
bright so many of us don't get enough
sleep now imagine the possibilities if
we had all the rest we needed we have
more energy to explore further be more
adventurous and have even more fun
that's why we created the siesta for a
revolutionary new tent engineered from
the ground up to give you the best
possible sleep outdoors even in blazing
sunshine when the Sun comes up our
game-changing ultra reflective fly
fabrics locks
infrareds visible and ultraviolet light
dramatically reducing the temperature
and brightness inside the tent
for extra comforts you can add our ultra
quiet 8-inch USB fan that zip right into
the custom vents drawing in fresh air
from outside the full-length fly
provides maximum protection from wind
and rain while the breathable inner tent
prevents condensation and closable mesh
keeps out dirt and cold drafts this
gives you incredible all-weather
versatility inspired by the cold night
and sweltering early mornings when
camping in the Australian outback we set
out to solve the problem of bright
overheating tents once and for all
and so the siesta was born we spent the
past year designing developing and
testing from fabrics to fans every
aspect of the tent has been meticulously
thought-out to ensure the highest
possible standards we've selected only
premium quality material and partnered
with one of the world's leading tent
manufacturers now with the prototypes
finished we're ready to launch but we
need your help to meet the factory
minimums so if you like what you've seen
please tell your friends and if you'd
like a seriously badass tent just back
