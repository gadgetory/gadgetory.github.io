excellent film we have to keep the
camera steady and smooth that's nobody
we hope to help videographer realize
their visions regardless whether or not
they have a huge improve with all the
equipment or just a one-man operation we
want to give creators freedom of
movement without losing quality or
stability so we created the kyln app the

3-axis stabilized pinball with it you

videographers to help them catch the

cumbersome equipment the kyln M Ellis
Nova's multi axis stabilization system

professional and clear it is all about
filming freedom we wanted the kind of em
to me an extension of the camera itself

new closed-loop control structure

milliseconds this results in a high
accuracy stabilization and smooth
controls we know that compose can be
heavy and recording on them for extended
amounts of time and get tiresome so we
designed the handle to rotate called set
up to be held in a low angle Canary
position
switching modes is easy and the
innovative design allows you to get your
shot no matter the situation Cullen M is
equipped with 83 watt our replaceable
battery and has at least 12 hours
runtime the kyln M is a universal mount
which can perfectly fit a variety of
lightweight cameras including mirrorless

handle allowing for multiple attachments
and with this aluminum body you can take
it anywhere without worry
zoom angle shutter controls or recording
can be controlled right from the handle

range of camera accessories on a handle
and gimbal is a port that can work with
anything from a transmitter for a remote
monitor of different types to our apps

view of your GoPro video wirelessly and
also allows you to control your camera
remotely combined with the touch
capabilities of the LCD BacPac
and makes so much easier to change the
settings on the go
with the remote view p1 economic design

completely freeze your motions to go to
the extra extreme

videography to new heights
literally meet birdie-birdie
is an aerodynamically shaped case for
popular action camps like the GoPro
once birdie reaches maximum altitude it
will steadily start a fall with a camera
facing downwards the resulting photos
are candid capturing authentic in the
moment expressions together let's make
birdie fly around the globe
GoPro videos are always shaky and
stabilizers out there are too complex
heavy and too big to be mounted anywhere
at nuam matter we wanted to create a
solution that was so convenient that it
would become part of your camera so we
developed Clark the world's smallest
waterproof stabilizer for your GoPro
that stabilizes your camera to keep it
leveled and create amazing cinematic
shots no matter what
Clark is so small that you don't need to
remove your camera anymore it becomes an
extension of it allowing you to mount it
on the camera mounts you already have
just turn it on with your camera and you
are ready to go
work is a lot more than a stabilizer
it's a real tool with built-in moving
time-lapse feature to brings a new way
of creating content and empowering you
to be more creative
developed by engineers and athletes we
went through many iterations of
prototypes to develop a product
optimized for your camera
together let's start a new era in
personal video making so we are now
ready to bring that product to market
but we need your help so focus today any
questions from the way you create
