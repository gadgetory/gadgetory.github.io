detects interference and switches from
two point four to five point eight
gigahertz transmission and take off
cutting through the noise for more
reliability the built-in monitor on the
phantom 4 pro is so bright I'm actually
able to see in direct sunlight and
that's really allowing me to compose my
shot and get what I really want to
capture active track has now been
expanded with three new intelligent
flight modes profile tracks your subject
horizontally from any side spotlight

reverse tap fly making it perfect for
aerial selfies
flying the phantom fourth row is even
more worryfree a set of rear visual
sensors has been added to existing
forward and downward sensors combined
with new infrared obstacle sensors on
its sides the Phantom 4 Pro has five
directions of sensing if image signal is
lost it returns home while dynamically
avoiding obstacles and even flies back
along its original flight path until
signal is regained every minute in the
air counts the new high-capacity battery
flight time has been increased to 30
minutes when it comes to speed the
Phantom 4 Pro is 10 miles per hour
faster with full support of its obstacle
sensing systems

always at your command control it with
your hands
remote controller mobile device or DJI
goggles using GPS spark knows where it

obstacles to avoid things in front of it
and come home safely

epic videos and share them instantly
spark your aerial creativity anywhere
all you need to do is seize the moment
you
it may sound crazy but you can do this
to all of it it's easy how do we know
because we've made it easy a DJI we
created the flying camera as you know it
and there's a good chance that the drone
videos you've seen online were shot with
one of our cameras this time we started
small so you can dream big we created
your first personal throne but we're
still squeezing in big power it
automatically follows you or whatever
you want without a bracelet or tracker
avoids obstacles and comes packed with a
4k stabilized camera 27 minute flight
time and a whole lot more this is the DJ
I'm addict row and this is the DJI Mavic
flow unfolded to make it this small we
have to rip out a ton of cool stuff
right now it's got 24 high performance
computing cores dual satellite
connectivity an all-new transmission
system with a 4.3 mile range for vision
sensors and more sound complicated it's
not it's easy
the Mavic knows where it takes off from
where it is in the air where it's going
and what is capturing when you take off
the MAV accuses 2 vision sensors and
connects with up to 20 satellites also
it can remember your location this means
the Mavic knows where home is so it can
return by itself precision landing
technology means it can land almost
exactly where you took off at the touch
of a button as you fly satellite systems
keep track of you working in harmony
with all four vision sensors telling it
what's below and what's in front whether
you are flying beside a cliff in a
forest or even indoors
just like you Mavic sees and thinks that
means it can avoid the things in its
path from trees to walls any good flying
camera needs stabilization the Maddox
expertly miniaturized gimble teach the
entire camera steady
unlike electronic stabilization you use
every pixel from the sensor and you
don't have the weight of a bulky add-on
camera shooting an epic tracking shot of
a friend is easy active track technology
needs it just takes a few taps not just
one kind of tracking shot either
it's got spotlight profile and trace or
use tap flight to tap and fly
Terrain follow mode keeps the Mavic at a
height you define as the ground Rises so
you can focus on your shot you're not
your height everything can be controlled
using a gamepad sized controller you can
keep in your pocket it opens up to clamp
around your phone and has been custom
engineered to give you more feedback and
more accuracy you will always feel in
control if you don't want to bother with
the controller fly using virtual
joysticks right from your phone over
Wi-Fi whether you fly with the remote
controller or just your phone active
track modes are ready to make you shoot
like a pro want to be on camera not
behind it it just takes a wave and a
gesture
then there's the new DJI goggle strap
these on to really feel like you're
flying combine them with sport mode to
get your pulse pumping while you fly at
an incredible 40 miles per hour once
you've got your shots edit everything
together in DJI go and share or even
stream your flight live to Facebook or
