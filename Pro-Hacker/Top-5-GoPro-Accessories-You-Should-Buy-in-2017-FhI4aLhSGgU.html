engineered solutions to really
everything in cycling I think you really
need to break it down to the simplest
form over the years have seen that so
many different accessories and how the
design has changed and how its moved
more towards more integrated solutions
it just seemed like computer mounts were
left behind there's been many times I
looked down at the computer in the
computer mount and I've just thought
there's got to be a better way to do
this while I'm looking at the four bolt
stem on my bike I realized that the
solution was just right in front of my
face I mean we have a mounting position
right there where I was using it having
some interest in product design and
development I thought well we'll just
make something I didn't want to appeal
to just the competitive cyclist I wanted
to offer a solution to anyone who rides
a bike and not only did I want something
that would fit multiple bikes multiple
stems but also multiple computers and
really put it in the optimal position
when you try to make a clean design a
simple design the complexity behind that
effort is huge you know the great thing
about the cycling community is that
there's people from all walks of life
and different professions and could
suddenly a great product engineer joiner
team last year which is the perfect
opportunity to collaborate on this idea
that I had so what we came up with
we call former address stem mount for
recycling computer I worked as a model
maker and design engineer at PDP the
challenge of making a direct stem out
was having to be adjustable and
adaptable to the multiple some kind of
market right now the four-mile is fully
adapted looks almost any sense that
distance between centers and there's
five positions for mounting it this is
one two by rotating the arm you get
three four and five in addition to
having five height adjustments the
format also has for an average of
stability this will accommodate
different sized computers it's
definitely an asset for commuters and
recreational writers especially if you
have a bell a foam mount a light and you
probably have a reflective mounted
somewhere on handlebars just get your
computer off the bars twist it down out
front frees up some bar space to me this
is the piece of art I just like the
sleekness of it to compact off of it so
the way it changes the whole school is
one out of the pipe over the course my
16 years here at PDT I've been involved
in thousands of construction projects
and from an engineering standpoint
little projects that I'm most proud of
this form out I think that keeping the
design simple is the most robust oil
we didn't want to just make a highly
functional model we also wanted it to be
beautiful and we know that the design we
come up with is simple and elegant and
checked all the boxes
these have transformed the way that we
record video I'm going to show you how
to take it to the next level introducing
victim a left kick changes the way you
record literally the same camera you use
every day will now be recording in 3d
this Irma is made to be durable and
lightweight so you can take it with you
anywhere
just put the lens on and that's it
you're good to go can you imagine
recording this and this and this all in
immersive 3d we can because we did
you might have seen someone with one of
these free-range but probably not
they're bulky and super expensive on top
of that need extra software just
recreate the 3d video system is
different it creates the same 3d effect
with just one camera and it's video is
ready to be watched
no software needed just upload and enjoy
how well you see just because you do I
may see things from slightly different
perspectives and your brain can find
them so you can see them don't believe
me well try guessing a ball when I close
mr mosz does the same thing it uses
mirrors to record to perspective the
videos end up looking like this when you
watch them in a viewer their 3d we're
actually going to start shipping
vegetable ends before the end of the
campaign that's right we're skipping the
lenses before the campaign even finishes
we came to IndieGoGo to find people who
wanted to change the way that we record
so let's introduce or is it climbing our
Capitan sir from the Gold Coast or just
turn your cat to superhero if you want
to be among the first to start recording
your life in 3d let's pick up a victim a
lens I will take recording to the next
level your GoPros stabilizer movement is
life every life has its own story and so
does yours
capture your footage smoothly and enjoy
it with your friends you stabilizer to
make better videos
you
stabilizers amps and minimizes your body
movement smooth and steady footage is
the results
the innovative patented construction
allows a compact lightweight and robust
design no batteries are needed the
stabilizer is always ready stabilizer is
compatible with every GoPro mount and is
100% waterproof
and everyone lovely
well okay not everyone I love sports and
videos I spend a lot of time screaming
my adventures with my job growth I was
not always happy with suicide so I
created a compact lightweight and easy
to use stabilizer for everyone
and my job is to keep it affordable for
you guys
be part of it
please support us back the project and
tears in your network your GoPro
stabilizer we all like to record video
on our phone from inspiration strength
but when we watch them back their shaky
history and they just go capture how we
remember the moment that's why we
created a new group now
professional-looking video is affordable
simple and pocket-sized you'll never
watch TV shaky video again movie is
super simple to use and unfolds in no
time because pop your phone is clear the
universal mouths and you're ready to go
anyone can eat them and if you take 30
everywhere it's like for all popular
smartphone and you can use it with your
GoPro to its full size will be always at
hand to capture all the special moments
pieces share forever from your family
friend and further advice or take it on
your next adventure be more creative
with your video get exciting shots you
can never reach the ball maybe put your
phone secure and feels natural to hold
the mobile this case even on a long time
lapse video it's versatile and to be
useful selfie mode you can always share
what you're up to you can complete the
films are like that in some of them
it's simple you can see one hand then
use your index finger to get more
controls and gooniac
here's the clever car heist movie the
revolutionary magnetic gimbal design
using powerful lightweight magnet keeps
offsetting no longer than then can
suckle the calluses is collapsed the
marker field fog or committee balances
itself compared to some larger
stabilizers nearly Excel as well for
greater control and freedom to move so
you can get the perfect shot
you
I am a professional photographer and
have been traveling with GoPro for years
the tradition of group of death it takes
a minute to relieve them tight in the
school to install and adjust the camera
which could slow down our trips and make
us miss pressures moment
hanging in during the intervening four
years I decided to design a new stem by
channel I saw an ancient field of which
floating stems were called on a
polyhedron so it inspired me to command
my newsstand so this world first
polyhedron support for copra thanks to
is three in one dot and polyhedron
bottom slope provides Kenda different
ways decision GoPro and it is even
smaller than a GoPro housing no tripod
is needed any longer let's provide the
arrival precision speed selector
supporting surface according to the
market angle insert or go into a slot
and you are all set if one direction is
in digression to over to the elevators
all I need to do is to cog MK which
could be finished in two seconds
so the Chinese heading to meet orany
then landscape features a portrait 1 and
for role they want to keep it flat on
the ground but be afraid of crashing
people we can use it this way low speeds
obviously we can use it almost
everywhere to their fears motifs of
temperance the whole world would be a
tripod look can also provide off a load
move on to the habits that avoid issues
like low quality audio recording Metzler
and overheating if you have to Google
you can utilize the slope side joint
from a fuel GoPro CD system slopes can
also benefit the post composition to
pictures shot where the thin bottom
surface could become a dated perfectly
due to the same view angle slope the Zen
and advanced GoPro better
the GoPro changed the way we capture
life's most epic moments from the sky to
the ground to beneath the weighed
however even the best GoPros are prone
to camera shake we wanted to be a part
of what makes ethic mate
unforgettable so we built Flik the
world's finest GoPro stabilizer clicks
senseless calculate the differences in
movement while moving over to rain then
autonomously repositions your camera
thanks to its remoter
eliminating camera shake
from the beginning we didn't believe
there has to be a trade-off between
mobility and stability click is more and
attaching to your existing GoPro mounts
you attach it to your helmet chest mount
or pole mount which is Sydney with your
camera then plug your GoPro on flick and
you're ready to ride with slick getting
some loose footage no longer needs to be
planned in advance the results are
always stable and amazing shaky GoPro
footage is one of the last remaining
problems with capturing action sports
and I think that sleek is really the
perfect solution it's light its durable
its completely weatherproof that's
something I've been dreaming up for the
last decade click will bring your GoPro
footage to the next level of white back
us today and join the new GoPro
experience human system announcer make
it even better that slick
the strap mount is a secure way to mount
your GoPro to any backpack or scuba bepd
constructed out of glass filled nylon
and stainless steel the strap mount will
withstand the harshest of conditions the
strap mount securely attaches to any
strap allowing you to quickly mount your
GoPro for hands-free filming the
quick-release system provides easy
access to your GoPro
don't be constrained by a chest heart
