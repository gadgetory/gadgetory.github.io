passion and focus on details it looks
great in any environment our electrical
and mechanical engineers that spend
countless hours on this project to test
and optimize our initial design again

prototype to tap with recipes including
an online store for the ingredients it's
not only our goal to create an excellent
product but also to find the best
recipes and create a platform for beer

excellent breweries and did a lot of
experiments for different recipes
handcrafted here 50th March for

everyone to brew their own beer place
your bid invite your friends and impress
your own hand we're apt to be cheers to
I go
to hear you Oh crazy but it's so cool oh
wow
a lot of it lark you know I told you I
used to do military stuff and I want to
hear your loss from my job and so this
is like a new new level of here and I'm
super here right now couple of friends
have like some hearing issues but
nothing like this this is this is kind
of this is nice
so plus the VA from usually pretty good
about covering stuff but if their
hearing isn't covered it's really
expensive for them to have to buy one of
these things I'm sure this is expensive
one in five Americans are disabled what
comes to mind when you hear the word
disability why hearing impairment so
accepted that we don't pick the source
of the problem a decent hearing aid
today cost around $2,000 or more people
don't wear hearing aid as a fashion
statement like they do glasses only
Union was founded to combat the to
impairment price and social perception
and eliminate hearing impairment how the
first barrier price here is how much a
decent hearing aids cost today
$4,400 and here's the breakdown cutting
down significantly on the material and
research expenses we don't use expensive
machines for testing and diagnostic we
kept our margins as low as possible and
after cutting out as many costs as we
could we were still at $500 the second
barrier is social perception we've
approached hearing aid from a totally
different design perspective not as a
medical device but as an accessory
we've designed the olives benchmarking
the latest earbud and Bluetooth ear
pitches over the past year we develop
the next generation hearing aid using a
smart sound algorithm a Bluetooth
technology we've also revolutionized the
hearing test and feeding process to make
it quick easy and acceptable we don't
get tapped on the only tab you can set
up a customized hearing profile with
sound frequencies optimized for your
ears you don't need a funky looking
medical device or amplifier to hear
better
we just need on all it but in order for
this to be truly accessible five hundred
dollars is still too high
our goal is to bring the olive you at
100 dollars flat this isn't just of
crowdfunding campaign is called R&amp;amp;D
campaign in order to reduce rnd code I
need all of you to help us therapists
the only and providers with proper
feedback so that we can create the best
hearing experience for everyone let's
hear the word together
hi everyone we're back since our first
campaign we should value the beauty to
people in places around the world we've
heard your feedback we've created
something three times more powerful than
the original
if you could take the wall outlet to go
what would you power share this campaign
with all your family and friends and
let's live life off the grid let's take
the wall outlet anywhere your back it
takes care of every move you make but
how do you take care of it
most of us sit for over nine hours every
single day and being honest it's hard to
avoid slouching eventually it results in
back pain stress affecting both
professional and personal life but don't
worry spino has got your back whether
you are sitting on the chair or floor
spino takes care of your posture it
provides constant support to the lower
back and let you sit comfortably for
hours spino
is pretty simple to use place the back
pad around the lower back knee pads
around your knees and adjust tension in
the belt that's it
automatically you will sit in the
perfect posture but the best thing it
can be attached to the chair as well we
keep the extensive product testing with
people from various backgrounds and here
is what they think about Steiner
actually feels pretty good my lower back
alright actually because that can be
complete pressure off the lower back
like as soon as you wrap it around using
like pull the stress like whoa I'm
sitting up straight now you don't really
notice it so you put it on then these
are pretty comfortable because of it I
don't even need the back part of this
chair I'm a cyclist so throughout the
day our spines are in danger basically
because we're always slouching so at the
end of the day I would love to just keep
this on for like a long period of time
yeah or even figure out you feel like
this
it's crazy I would totally use this wall
gaming
I mean I'd use it at work too it
definitely helped posture at work we
referred research materials from highly
credible sources like Herman Miller
worked closely with amazing designers
physiotherapists and yoga teachers to
create a simple solution for today's
on-the-go generation when your back
feels good everything is better you will
be more confident and healthier it's all
about the strength and confidence that
you carry in your posture life is not
about surviving a day anymore but to
enjoy every moment of it and now with
your support we can bring the spino in
reality
thank you so much
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
