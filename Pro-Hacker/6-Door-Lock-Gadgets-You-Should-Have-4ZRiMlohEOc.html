repair work himself either way I can
deal with the handyman so don't worry
about waiting around for him oh and you
can revoke his access when the jobs
finished but that was obvious right of
course I'll notify you whenever someone
opens your door so when the kids get
home from school you'll know that
they're safe and sound
