first of all I'm a singer I'm a
songwriter I'm a producer and what do we
do we like people to listen to our music
so in the past what I've been doing I've
been going through my phone looking for
songs and I've been going through my
emails trying to download songs I'll
have to do that anymore with the island
air it's wireless I can just connect to
it anybody else can connect to it and
we're there I've been using the island
air for about two months now and I
really enjoy the flexibility it gives me
to download my personal pictures and
have my business presentations all in
one device and it allows me to play it
on any device so thank you I've been
using the eye lunare for about three
months now and it's definitely improved
my workflow it allows me to transfer
documents and photos on the go because
I'm always on my smartphone I can never
get to my laptop my clients are happier
work is a lot easier I loon has
completely changed the way I do my
business what it does is I could pull it
up on my phone my whole Pro folio and my
client can look on their cell phone or
tablet or computer and we can all look
at the same thing from different devices
that way we're not crowding one folder
with the eye alone were able to take
dozens of maps and files that are much
too large for us to convert from our
phone and makes it easy to do our
presentations for our clients for the
distribution services that we use it for
that also creates a ability for us to do
some file sharing within our
organization because of not being
concerned about the data that we're
pulling from our phones it's been a
tremendous asset to our company the
island air has completely changed the
way I do business
when meeting with potential clients I'm
able to string my entire content
portfolio with them without having to
look online for YouTube points and
things of that nature
also in networking setting up my vendor
booth I'm able to stream content on
multiple devices all from the Iowan era
I am a senior at college I have been
using the island air for about a month
now
and it has helped me with my group
projects by easily being able to share
documents with my group members on
different devices so I would highly
recommend it
buddy who is looking to streamline the
process for their business so if you
don't have it you gotta go get it
wherever life takes you carry the
perfect backup plan

and it complies with current tsa
requirements for air travel the
australian designed engineered and
manufactured talon multi-tool by
tactical compact enough to carry every

lightweight enough not to weigh you down
heavy duty enough to get things done
talon in your hand enough said
two years ago we bought you tactic is
first crowdfunding campaign the one
bottle opener and now we have our latest
innovation ready for you Talon pushes
the limits with materials technology and
functionality its patent pending design
is made possible by using advanced
composite material this makes it super
strong and enables the unique unibody
design that increases strength and
hardness we've also created a dual
purpose storage compartment into the
design to function as a socket something
that hasn't been possible in a
multi-tool until now we make the Talon
in Melbourne Australia and over the past
few months our team has worked closely
to perfect the design for manufacture
it's great to be involved again with the
same factory that produces our popular
one bottle opener this kind of
collaborations make sure that everyone
involved has a deep understanding of the
project and the high standards we expect
having a local manufacturer also reduces
the risks usually associated with
overseas manufacture now waiting on
shipments faulty products or delivery
delays will be right there in front of
the Machine as they come off the line it
doesn't get any more personal than that
importantly tooling has already
commenced yes that's right we've made
the decision to launch straight into the
production process because we reckon
you're gonna want one or two in time for
Christmas we're tooling the mods now and
we'll be ready for full-scale production
well before Christmas thanks for the
support and look forward to getting a
talent in your hand soon
hello world I'm pre three years ago I
had this big idea I wanted to build the
nail pot the smartphone nail art printer
and after hard work and perseverance we
did the nail BOTS uses your phone to
print art directly onto your fingernails
and it's instant here's how it works
first prep your nail you have to
manually paint your nails with a light
colored base coat
we recommend white because it really
makes that art pop next personalize
choose the images you'd love to print
whether it's pictures from your camera
roll of your best friend's your dog your
cat or one of our three thousand free
emojis and icons and our mobile app and
eventually your own art designs finally
tap print and about five seconds that
art will appear
I'm a product manager here pre-madonna
I'm a coder but I'm also an artist and
in developing the nail BOTS we have
created a product that truly needs art
with engineers
it's fast it's simple I can print my
school mascot on my nails I can wear
them to all the football games all the
spirit weeks and all my friends today
how did you get that I said that I did
it I created it myself with the nail pot
so I'm in college and I'm really busy
and I'm always studying but I also want
to go out and have my nails look good
too so the nail bob just gets it done
for me in like five seconds like in and
out and I'm out the door and it's way
better than I could ever do thanks no
but the real MVP I'm brandy Olson I'm
Lauren Olson were from Palo Alto and we
love an ale bot I think the nail bot is
really awesome because it integrates
math science technology art and you can
print whatever you want on the nail pot
on your nails and that's just super
awesome I really idea
we built the nail BOTS for you for the
engineers the hackers the coders the
artists the maker girls so three percent
of this nail bot campaign will go
towards teaching the next generation the
tech behind the nail body you're a
partnership with maker girl our
ambassador program and our art and
coding tutorials if you want your nail
BOTS we need your help today
early backers will get a significantly
discounted price and access to beta test
our nail box the nail bot is powered by
smart and dynamic technologist
we call ourselves prima donnas and

embrace is designed to be a gorgeous
watch in a medical quality device it's
made of leather and metal it's very easy
to wear and it has a ring that
illuminates time but hours and minutes
in today's world the nonstop action is
tough to achieve the right balance
embrace makes it very easy to monitor
physiological stress arousal sleep and
physical activity you can see are you
doing at work while running during
dinner or sleep
you can sit embrace to give private
vibration alerts you can learn or to
reduce stress and feel better you can
also send an alert to a friend or a

embrace does even more
our device is designed to detect
unexpected seizures braces designed to
save lives for a lot of people with
epilepsy seizures can seriously hurt or
even kill people and we need an alert to
intervene one in 26 people in the US
will develop epilepsy at some point
during their lifetime everybody with
epilepsy should be able to have a device
that alerts a friend or a family member
to come help at the time that they might
need it
this device will measure both movement
and physiological signals the
combination is likely to be very
important for detecting potentially
life-threatening seizures these sensors
and algorithms were originally developed
here at the MIT Media Lab we learned
that combining the stress data we could
sense from the rest with the activity
data led to the most accurate seizure
detection
we have been working on a medical
quality wearable for many years our III
sensor is being used by the top
physicians and scientists in the world
to acquire clinical quality data for the
studies no other device on the market
today can do anything like this now we
are making a brace so that everyone can
benefit from our technology
we've done a lot of work with a truly
passionate team that believes in this
project many of you have asked for a
device like this and here we are also
thanks to IndieGoGo in the Epilepsy
Foundation but we need your help and
support to make this project a reality
together we can make the difference in
the lives of 3 million Americans and 65
million people worldwide
they live with epilepsy this is what
we'll do for every brace you buy will
donate one to a charlie suffers from
epilepsy and they cannot afford the
device so you get a gorgeous and useful
watch and a child gets a better life
