and together we're on a mission to
increase your quality of life those
around you we've solved the problem
that's been lingering since the
beginning of mankind embarrassing poop
odor we introduced to you the odorless
the eco-friendly fan that filters odor
directly from your toilet bowl so the
air in your bathroom stays fresh and
clean this revolutionary invention keeps
your bathroom odorless and it can be
installed on most toilets by anyone in a
matter of minutes after you remove your
tank top you'll remove the filler tube
from the vent pipe install the odorless
fan over it and reconnect the filler
tube to the fan housing after that
attach the power unit to the wall plug
it into the fan and replace the top now
you can enjoy a whole new bathroom
experience when you're ready to go the
motion sensor will turn the unit on then
off when you're done after 120 hours of
use it will remind you that it's time to
replace the filter and when the battery
runs low it will alert you
the odorless removes foul odor with a
special activated charcoal filter it
installs quickly and easily on just
about any toilet
it runs on a long-lasting rechargeable
battery so no outlet is needed
over the past decade nearly everything
in our home has been modernized yet the
product that makes us cringe the most
hasn't changed in a hundred years the
toilet brush is filthy it's covered in
bacteria drips on the floor and is a
nightmare for anyone with a toddler it
makes no sense that in order to clean
the toilet you end up with a filthy
brush sitting next to it the loo gun is
entirely different it's simple to use
requires no installation and cleans the
toilet using a powerful spray of clean
water the sleek design suits any
bathroom and as it never touches a
toilet it stays perfectly hygienic and
safe for children the powerful motor
delivers the perfect level of power to
clean above and below water it's
designed to ensure there is no splash
back while being easy enough for anyone
to use
the reservoir holds 300 milliliters of
clean water it attaches with a simple
click and is easily filled under any tap
in just a few seconds it comes with the
floor stand to sit neatly next to the
toilet and the four double A batteries
last up to nine months if used once a
day having fulfilled our Kickstarter
campaign and early pre-orders we have
just shipped our third production order
and have now sold blue guns in 56
countries around the world
water is one of the world's most
fundamental elements it makes them about
70% of the Earth's surface and a similar
percentage of our bodies each day we
have an intimate interaction with water
for most of us this starts with our
showers our showers are deeply personal
our lone time to wake up to think to
rejuvenate to unwind and Nebbia we set
out to see if we could make this
important part of our daily rituals
better in every way we started with a
nice Karlos one of our co-founders ran a
large Fitness Club company and was
deeply concerned about the high use of
water together with his father Emilio
they searched for a solution it turns
out showers are one of the highest
wasters of water and there hasn't been
any meaningful innovation over a century
nearly five years later dozens of
prototypes built we've had 500 people
try it and now we think we've built
something pretty special imagine being
totally embraced by water from the
moment you step into your shower imagine
an experience with water so moving you
never want to step out your skin feels
soft and hydrated
maybe is about experiencing water in a
way that you never have before to
innovate on the shower experience we had
to look outside of the current industry
and approach the engineering problem
from a completely new angle the last
half-century of nozzle technology has
completely changed what we can do with
droplet sizes and distributions
however this technology has only been
applied to very specialized fields like
rocket engines and medical devices we
use these same tools and technology to
develop nebula what we do is atomized
streams of water into millions of tiny
droplets by doing this we can achieve 10
times the surface area of water
compared to a regular shower while using
a fraction of the volume I just got out
of my first nevia shower it was a
totally unique experience and I loved it
I was getting hit with these little
water droplets I love the feeling all
the droplets hitting your skin it's like
you're being enveloped by water and as
an Airbnb host there are a lot of
showers going on in my place and this is
important you know this thing is not
only make the experience better for my
guests but it's a fee money well great
it was a really fun comfortable
experience the whole thing just felt
awesome I could take that shower every
day we put nebula to the test on average
Americans take about eight minutes to
shower for the normal shower that's over
20 gallons of water for the Nebbia it's
only six that's 70% less what we built
an Emmy to be easy to install you simply
unscrew your existing shower and screw
on Nebbia with a wrench
some plumbers tape and included adhesive
you don't have to call the plumber or
break tile in addition Nivea slides up
and down a couple of feet pivots at an
angle and includes a portable wand which
you can position wherever you choose
Nebbia provides a totally new and
refreshing shower experience we've
partnered with world-class design firm
box clever to create a design that is
both beautiful and intuitive yet offers
a totally new degree of adjustability on
top of that the water and energy savings
just makes sense we've set out to build
a company that will transform the way we
interact with water over the course of
the next few decades we've assembled a
team of thermal fluids experts to solve
some of the difficult engineering
challenges that have prevented
innovation in showers for a long time
and finally we're ready to bring that e
to the world and we've decided to start
with you the Kickstarter community our
us-based manufacturers are ready to go
and all we need is your initial support
Thank You Kickstarter
shaving us we know it is far from
perfect
it causes razor burn ingrown hair cuts
bleeding and even infection and if you
have sensitive skin or a skin condition
it's even more difficult the u.s. alone
throws out 2 billion raises a year most
can't be recycled because they pose a
health risk so they end up in garbage
dumps there must be a better way can we
create the eraser that does not cause
irritation a razor that shapes smoother
clothes a razor that helps reduce waste
this is why we created the scar
appraiser once working on lasers for
cosmetic and medical purposes I wondered
could I put this technology to better
use I wanted something that would
benefit every single one of us shaving
was the obvious answer the industry has
been looking for a laser shaver for home
use but discovering a viable technology
has eluded everyone until now
wavelengths of light have been to stop
at the cut through dark hair but not
light or gray hair
we wanted a laser that could cut all
hair many prototypes were built and of
the years of experimentation we had
found exactly what we were looking for
we identified molecules in the hair that
observe a particular wavelength these
are called carnivores this chroma
forests are the only continuous
structure in the hair they're shared by
every human regardless of age gender and
for race the scalp razor is for everyone
to use and it works great on any area
this is how it works
a traditional razor cuts the hair shaft
at an angle this is what causes your
skin to feel rough when the scalp reason
makes contact the laser melts through
the hair shot completely level to the
surface of the skin this leaves a
smoother softer finish the last longer
to the touch
we really need your support but the
skull crater into production we have
preliminary agreements with
manufacturers where we require capital
to begin orders we've spent many years
developing this razor because we believe
after five thousand years of using the
same technology it's time to make
shaving easier safer and greener help us
bring shave it into the 21st century</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
