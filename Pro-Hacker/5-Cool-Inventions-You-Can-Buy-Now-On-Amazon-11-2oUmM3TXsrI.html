this is the new canary home security
system they say it's a complete security
system packed into a single beautiful
device canary adapt to your home over
time and sends intelligent notifications
with HD video directly to your phone
let's dive in and give it a complete
review pricing is 249 on Amazon and I'll
give you a link to it in the description
below packaging is beautifully crafted
they put much care into the
Jeane design as they did in the product
itself in the box includes one canary
device a microUSB power cord AC power
adapter a secure set of cables and a
QuickStart guide the specs on the device
are rocking at 1080p camera 147Â°
wide-angle lens
night vision motion detection
temperature humidity and air quality
sensors a 90 plus decibel siren and a
whole lot more Shh they both the quick
set-up and they're somewhat accurate
first download the app available for
both iphone or android plug-in the
canary on a flat surface placed in a
central high-traffic location sign into
the app or create a new account
connected to your Wi-Fi be is a secure
setup cable and if you're using the
Android app I had an issue with the
volume step as the app wouldn't allow my
volume to be turned all the way up as it
required so instead I had to dive into
my settings the found in notifications
section and drag a media volume all the
way up which fixed that problem however
right after that I found a major glitch
canary apparently isn't set up to
override existing settings with a new
set up and since this unit was already
tied to an account it would keep
stalling out I kept keen errors and
found no way to hard reset advice
however pretending this is the first
time setup which went like a breeze
after your Wi-Fi settings are securely
transferred over from your phone to the
canary device you're set up and ready to
go there are three main modes armed
disarmed and privacy privacy mode means
everything is disabled no recording no
notifications
no ability to watch live video disarms
mode means it's recording video when it
senses motion but doesn't send you
notifications because it thinks you're
at home lastly when you leave the house
it auto switches to armed mode which is
just like disarms mode but sends you
notifications when activity is detected
in any mode other than privacy mode you
can launch the app and watch live video
and manually start recording the main
benefit of this product is it's pretty
thought free when you leave the house at
Auto arms itself when it detects
activity it begins recording night
vision is really great quality the video
is pretty high red it seems it's going
the trajectory of a learning product
like the mess
thermostat when activity is detected ask
you to help it learn by tagging what the
motion was sunlight reflection etc
overall the same simplicity that makes a
thought free system is what limits its
control and customization currently
there is no connectivity to other smart
home devices like the z-wave wink hub
etc there's no battery backup $250.00 is
kind of a lot of money for a one camera
system certainly feels like a beta
product I experienced video playback
hiccups slow servers seem to work well
most of the time but I'd imagine these
things will hopefully be screwed out in
the coming months it'd be really nice to
see some more controls in customization
for example give me the option for a
louder notification that would wake me
up at night between these set hours or
create custom monitoring zones like drop
cam integration with other smart home
servers if this mat recipes downloadable
video files
I feel the canary home security system
is a simple soft free solution it might
not be for tinker's or those who want
full access controls to do unlimited
amount of things but canary knows that
and maybe they're trying to balance out
the ease of use with the safety and
security of giving limited control to
the user it feels like there's possible
feature proofing built in and I'm
excited to see what the future holds of
the canary thanks for watching and let
me know what you think in the comments
