haha
you
you
hello we are exactly we have an evil
micro program to deliver an amazing
after a whole year of planning and
research countless trials and errors we

person robot under old become brilliant
reduced to life

hope to enjoy gated
here's a list of stuff from kind of
magical to unbelievably magical body
wash that's also shampoo Mentos and cola
things that fly with your help the
magical is about to get magical a week
shy a pilot an industrial designer and
an inventor he loves things that fly he
wants try to turn his car into an
airplane no success shy Olli said that
his dream was to bring the joy of flight
to everyone a few years ago he made a
breakthrough in the field of cool stuff
that flies he invented the power of the
first electric paper airplane but then a
friend of scheisse told him nice gadget
really but you can't make a
remote-controlled paper airplane so I
took a moment to think and said
challenge accepted two years of research
and 57 prototypes later he made it
happen
Meech eyes unbelievably magical
invention power of three the first ever
smartphone controlled paper airplane
using state-of-the-art technology power
up three turns your embarrassing paper
plane into a lean mean flying machine
just fold a piece of copy paper to a
plane attach power up three and install
the app now call your mom and tell your
pilot because it works out of the box in
the back of the module are a propeller
and a rudder that are in charge of
controlling the plane in the front
there's an advanced ship with powerful
Bluetooth smart technology for an
amazing 60 yards of controlled flight
and a tiny rechargeable battery to power
this amazing beast out of juice charge
the battery with any microUSB cable as I
learned in his career as a pilot planes
should be building or flying and for
crashing that's why all components of
the powerup 3 are super durable and
crash proof but here's where she made it
really cool
powerup threes smart shape is program to
optimize user happiness you don't need a
PhD in Aero now to be able to fly it the
prototype is fully functional and the
supercooled from magical power of three
is ready for production this is where
Shai need your magic beings if you helps
I get to 1400 backers you'll help him
bring the joy of flight to everyone and
obtain the privilege to look down on
regular paper planes for the rest of
your life so back power up three and
help make the magical magical
what is chronic provide is the coolest
thing ever
