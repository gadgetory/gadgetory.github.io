do you ever hear that saying moms have
eyes in the back of their heads as nice
as that would be I still couldn't get it
done without the help of Argus the
world's first wire free HD smart
security camera I mean with two kids and
a husband that can count as a third I
need eyes everywhere and at all times
something that can be my eyes and ears
when I'm away so I can virtually keep my
eyes here here and even here hello
please leave the package by the door
Thanks I'm pretty much the most powerful
being in the universe
I can even make cookies disappear now I
have a new arch-nemesis mom calls her
new futuristic sidekick Argus that first
serves just one now they've multiplied
and with the two-way audio capability
what are you doing it's officially
ruining my cover all I want is a better
sense of security for my family at home
is that too much to ask I just want my
family to be safe and secure
I'm not worried though they'll warm up
to it don't even think about it
and 14 now almost 15 I'm practically an
adult I'll be driving soon I never had
issues with sneaking out until my mom
got these stupid cameras I get caught
one time and now we have night-vision
cameras really mom I just want to go
with my friends and not have a curfew is
that too much to ask and now they can
see me in the dark
roundest why are they trying to ruin my
wife Oh everyone anybody's life here I'm
not a bad guy honest I swear my Nana's
grave we've all got a job to do right I
mean it's just business most cameras
they're easy to evade but I couldn't get
close cuz of the motion census I mean I
barely made it on the steps behind time
to go ready maybe you're not so bad
after all
Argus has become so much more than just
a wire free HD weatherproof night vision
piece of technology it's become a
functioning part of this family
providing security and protection
whenever and wherever I need it
