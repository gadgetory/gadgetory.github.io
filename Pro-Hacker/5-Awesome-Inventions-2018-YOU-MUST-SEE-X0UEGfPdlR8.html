hi I'm sorry gum and this is a
traditional French press it's been the
best way to make coffee for a really
long time even though this makes amazing
coffee it has its challenges one of the
biggest problems with French press is
cleanup which is also why most people
don't use it to solve the challenges of
a traditional French press I applied my
engineering and physics background to
develop the right press with the right
press when you press down on the plunger
it forces the grounds to our patented
removable bottom chamber it's a simple
twist off this makes cleanup really easy
the right press has other great tools
built in to ensure a consistent during
ritual water temperature is one of the
most important factors in brewing great
coffee that's why we built a thermometer
right here in the lid take it out and
put it into your water before you mix in
your coffee blue is too cold red is too
hot and green is perfect timing is
another critical part of the brewing
process we've built an hourglass into
the right press set for the exact amount
of time coffee should brew
when the hourglass is finished it's time
to plunge your perfect cup the whole
process is simple which is what your
morning ritual should be the right press
comes in stainless steel and matte black
it also comes in a half-liter option
please consider adding the right press
here morning ritual by supporting this
campaign because the most important part
of your day deserves to be perfected
