the Wi-Fi router is one of the most
important utilities in our lives that we
usually take for granted but many
routers are really difficult to set up
configure and maintain security for our
Wi-Fi shouldn't be taken lightly but we
usually don't want a password that's too
complicated and hard to remember we've
sacrificed security so the combination
is typical home routers are optimized
for just a few devices and nowadays each
of us owns multiple devices cheap
components equal a weak signal which
means we're sometimes left to do some
signal strength yoga we're gonna say it
a good Wi-Fi router is something that's
worth investing I'm going to show you
the greatest thing your eyes have ever
beheld
key Wi-Fi is designed to be simple
sophisticated and secure to set up key
Wi-Fi just plug it in and you're done
we've simplified it all to connect we've
patented a unique authentication
procedure that is simple and secure just
go to the Wi-Fi selection page tap qy5
and you're authenticated now you're able
to connect devices that aren't
authenticated simply can't join everyone
notices when the internet slows down
there are thousands of possible problems
that might have nothing to do with your
internet connection but something to do
with the connection between your modem
and your router or your router and your
devices we've designed something that's
so much more than a simple reset button
the Zen button it runs a self-diagnosis
the most common connectivity issues and
attempts to resolve them automatically
and you can also use key Wi-Fi as a
range extender for your existing routers
even configure multiple Wi-Fi networks
using either traditional passwords or
our proximity authentication procedure
your choice
so that's key Wi-Fi easy to set up and
use a new secure way to authenticate
devices and protect your information and
equipped with powerful enterprise-grade
hardware and software to provide a
strong stable signal for all your
devices</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
