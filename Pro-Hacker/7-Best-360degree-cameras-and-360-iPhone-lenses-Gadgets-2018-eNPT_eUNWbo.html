for everyone there are moments in life
that you never want to forget when you
take a picture you know the place the
people around you the landscape and the
details a couple of days later and you
will forget most of it a couple of years
later and you probably can't even
remember where the photo was taken your
memory is gone
wouldn't it be great to have a camera
that captures everything you experience
with your friends and family and that
lets you and your friends re-experience
those moments later when you spend time
with your mates and loved ones wouldn't
it be great to be able to relive the
atmosphere of that day when someone you
love creates something great wouldn't it
be nice to discover things that you
hadn't even noticed when you took a
photo
hi I'm Eunice creator of the panda know
camera a camera that can do exactly
these things it captures everything in
every direction all at once and it has a
super-high resolution of 72 megapixels
it uses 36 tiny but powerful cameras
that fire all at once you just throw
them to the air and at the highest point
when it is barely moving it captures a
fully spherical panoramic image
automatically to view the images you
simply point the smartphone or tablet in
the direction of the sea and move it
around it's amazing
he built the original prototype two
years ago back then it was called
throwable panoramic ball camera he put a
video of it on YouTube which was viewed
nearly three and a half million times we
got a lot of great press coverage but
most importantly we got thousands of
emails from people wanting to buy the
camera at that time and in that form it
was too expensive for mass production
so we sat down to develop a new camera
that a small affordable and useful
we booked out of the new design we call
it the pen or no camera the camera is
tough so you can throw it in the air and
even drop it on occasion
there are several easy ways to use it
firstly of course by throwing it but you
can also put it on the stick and hold it
in the air or simply hold it in your
hand and press a button to make a
picture all the panoramic images in this
video was shot with our prototype the
new design will have the same
functionality but is much smaller and
tougher I was very much impressed by the
360-degree concept you catch the moment
with all the things around you now
everybody can discover the whole
situation
I support the team to ensure a seamless
process from the original idea to the
finished series product we have a
working prototype and a great new design
and with your help we can finish the
development and manufacture of the
camera by September support us and be
one of the first to own a panono camera

my name is McKenzie I run Mendocino
magic it's a 600-acre campground where
we host a lot of outdoor weddings the 1
to 360 has been a really valuable
resource for us because it helps us to
create virtual tours of our property
with a Street View style approach and it
makes it a lot easier for potential
guests to see what they're getting into
before they get here being able to click
through the property was huge you know
looking at the 360 video tour just set
this place apart so much using virtual
tours in advance helps set us apart from
our competition in this industry I've
been playing Minecraft a lot for the
last several years and recently I got
one of the new Wonder 360 cameras to
help me with the in-game world design I
built myself a rig where I can just
strap it onto an old bike helmet pairs
really easily to my phone once I'm
connected I can just like take it
outside into any of the environments
that I'm finding interesting by the time
I get back the 3d point cloud is waiting
for me on my computer and I can turn
that file into a Minecraft world right
away the 103 16 has been really helpful
as a tool when we move into new builds
and construction putting the helmet on I
was able to walk around and make sure I
knew exactly what the designer and the
architect were going to see as well as
far as the space and what we were going
to be working with what was really great
about this project was the property
owner handing off a 360 capture where I
could see how my design will fit into
the pre-existing landscape I think that
it'll help a lot with other landowners
in the future for their builds and how
they can more sustainably interact with
their spaces and it'll make a huge
difference for us as we develop more of
this property my name is trevor i have a
travel blog and the product that is
enabling
to do what I love the most recently is
the Wonder 360 hey I'm Jack and I've
been riding with a helmet camera for a
couple of years now and I recently
switched from a one directional camera
to a 360 camera and with this I can see
in all directions everywhere I go I'm
such a Luddite when it comes to
technology especially cameras this
thing's amazing it's super easy I just
plop it down because it's 360 I can make
it follow her movements my name is that
I can acrobatics in parkour and I really
like the Wonder 360 because it makes it
really easy to bring the camera into
class set it down and it captures the
whole room no matter which way our
practice goes and that way I don't need
a whole camera crew in order to get
every part of my run as I go up and down
back and forth I love that I can live
shooting a Facebook and it stitches the
360 for me automatically it works with
all my old attachments and it's
waterproof love the cool filters
artificial bouquet tilt chip classic I'm
Creek I've been drinking for nine years
and I just started using the Wonder 360
the fact that the image comes out of
this camera is stabilized and I don't
have to modify the footage with the
computer is outstanding I've been
strapping the Wonder 360 to my dog
Shiloh she's got a huge following on
Instagram her followers really love the
perspective that this camera gives and
in the city where it's a little more
dangerous I've got a record of what
happens if I'm involved in a close call
I can prove it
I also love the Phantom flipper it
allows me to capture every part of
emotion and
we analyzed individual aspects of that
motion and really show the students
where they need to improve at practice I
love that I can view and edit the crooks
on my phone so if I'm on a nice ride in
the countryside I can come home and
recreate it and show it to all my
friends and the 3d mode is pretty cool
it's really easy to edit on my phone
directly from the app the video that I
actually want to share I love it
