good night good night
you
two years ago you guys really helped us
achieve the dream I never dreamed
possible start to be back at bringing
angel lifeline
engineer the live flight to be a
thousand lumens waterproof to 30 feet
half the size and a third the way we
want it to be the light that you take
with you anyway it's something that you
want to keep with you because you never
want to miss that moment a couple years
ago at my foundation event I was
introduced to the product and from that
point on I was very interested in Munich
you now we have the life light half the
size seventy percent of the light is
still there it's an amazing piece of
electronics you forget that it's in your
pocket cuz it's so small and so
compatible with everything
as the company grows it still listens to
its customers and that's what's so
amazing and seeing everybody work
together out of absolute love for what
we're doing and the solutions that were
created
doing something different whether it's
photography or surfing with the lights
at night this lights opened up a giant
opportunity for me I don't want to miss
one surf session after the Sun Goes Down
we're a software company with hardware
devices that solves problems in the
mobile imagery world there's great
companies out there that have created
great products but we're just that
perfect complement we realized that in
order to have the perfect image the
perfect memory you need the perfect
light I think LifeLight brings that to
you
it's cool to be partners with a company
that allows you to make the product look
sick but to also have fun I believe
that's what YouTube is all about is
having fun and trying to light up things
you normally want to be able to wherever
I am or whatever we're doing confining
that we're using the life life for so
many more things than we ever intended
the light waterproof is so small if it
allows us to do things that we weren't
able to do before and yeah people night
circlet not what lights this bright not
what the technology of cameras these
days we're capturing things that were
never really imaginable this is so
different to anything else that's ever
been shot and surfing like this I'm just
stoked to be a part of this movement
just cool that you can take life light
and put it in the ocean film Jamie
O'Brien and then you know you can take
it to some skate spot with me and films
an incredible scenery shot we need to
take you to the snowboarding guys we
have to take it everywhere that's what's
great about life light is that it's
bringing all these different athletes
together because now we can do unique
things that we weren't able to do before
because you couldn't see I'm stoked to
be with the Loom cute family it's
allowed me to do some insane things
light it up have fun

we got
I'm confident with team around us we'll
continue to bring the most innovative
products to market

light to your life
inadequate sleep has become a common
issue for modern people do you wake up
on refreshed in the morning or do you
lack concentration or have a bad memory
we are not satisfied with the usual
sleep aids that only use white noise or
intelligent alarms it impelled us to
develop somnus a comprehensive solution
for sleep deprivation the sambas package
includes somnus Saturn and the app it is
the first ever complete sleep aid in the
world to offer such a full range of
functions including lighting sound music
and an intelligent alarm plus other fine
features such as negative ions and an
essential oil diffuser our concept
involves moving the sleeper through the
sleep cycle with each of our functions
when you're about to sleep we help you
to sleep easily somnus releases red
light which stimulates melatonin
production along with white noise and
essential oils helping our bodies switch
to sleeping mode based on the research
of the National Sleep Foundation
essential oils can relax your body and
help you get better sleep while you are
sleeping we help you sleep well and
sleep deeply the most significant
function of somnos is that it sends out
more than 4 million negative ions into
the air
you'll feel like there's a waterfall in
your room negative ions absorb the dirt
pollen and terms in the air somnus
collects details about your environment
such as temperature humidity light
pollution and noise that influences the
quality of your sleep moreover our
vibration sensor can attach to your body
or your pillow it will record how many
hours you've slept and how frequently
you wake up during sleep you can easily
observe and improve your sleep
efficiency through your mobile phone
saamne starts to wake you up with blue
light or music 30 minutes before your
wake-up time to help prepare your body
for waking up wake up full of energy and
feeling fresh a fresh day begins sleep
well and live better
