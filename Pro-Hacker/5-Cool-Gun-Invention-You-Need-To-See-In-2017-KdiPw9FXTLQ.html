gun you must always be prepared have to
be trained you are your gun freak when
it's not on you you want to know it's
secure and accessible safes are not
always accessible or easy to open
especially in the dark and locks are a
nuisance to operate as for smart guns
what smart guns are a dangerous concept
taking an unreliable technology and
embedding it into your gun is not a
smart decision our mission is to bring
you the perfect solution introducing
zorax the new generation of guns so are
you
zorax if caliber specific has two modes
the first mode is awareness if someone
tries to tamper with your gun you're
immediately alerted and when you need
your gun charging it will e-jets or X
and chamber a fresh round the second
mode is when your gun is locked when
Zoar is locked
no one can charge your gun if someone
tries to charge your gun the locking
mechanism will immediately expand
preventing the gun from being loaded
special polymers and the locking
mechanism prevent any damage to the
barrel
szura's developed a revolutionary
unlocking mechanism rapid dial rapid
dial is a simple mechanism which counts
clicks while you turn it you don't need
to start from a specific point even the
direction that you turn the lock doesn't
matter these two factors allow you to
unlock your weapon without looking at it
even in the dark you can choose a simple
code or any length code you wish you
won't believe how fast and simple it is
until you try you can also opens or ax
from your phone but you can only lock it
by physically pressing the lock button
zorax normally communicates with your
phone directly through bluetooth it also
comes with a zorb bridge a Bluetooth to
Wi-Fi router and plugged into the wall
near your gun you'll be made aware from
anywhere in the world if your gun is
being tampered with now if your home is
your safe and you don't lock your gun
but you still want alerts we have a
solution
there's our watchdog the door watchdog
is not a lock but rather a notification
device its sole purpose is to notify you
if your weapon is tampered with
zorax with ascension by veterans of
elite IDF technological in combat units
the worked on it for two years reading
its perfection suresh allows you to be
ready aware and safe more than ever
before
join the zuhr revolution own your gun
alright Jason just fill it we have a gun
that shoots pellets full of pepper spray
there's no way this ends well because
when you pitched it to me
you're like oh it's like a paintball gun
but it does pepper spray and I'm
thinking Oh pepper spray we've been
there before yeah then we open this
thing and it's Robocop's gun are you
kidding me with this in co2 cartridges
and then I open up these pellets it's
like getting shot with a jawbreaker in
his automatic you got that yeah so this
is from the salt supply company says
from my nightmares is where it's from
for some of the practice rounds but
they're very hard and they're filled
with military-grade pepper spray this is
home defense yeah this is get someone
the hell out of your house but it's also
non-lethal I'll tell you I mean this is
gonna do damage though I guess we rode
the practice rounds practice rounds yeah
all of them no let's do have them okay
alright seven ball mag oh wow it's
really busy loads just like a like a
paintball gun
well no no like we like bullets and then
I guess we have to pressurize this yes
all right we'll get eye protection as
well and then you pull it out and it
screws all the way out and you load this
guy in
at this point we got the co2 in there
right here we go
oh it just put it just oh that was co2
that was the co2 cartridge ours God all
right we'll just shoot it into the trees
and his live holy are you feeling scared
sick fire is so freakin bad you don't
need to arc it it just write down the
site yeah now we need to kick it up a
notch and go with live rounds all right
look here we go
so moment that puff I want to get you in
there I'll pop up all right here we go
all right it's live coming at your face
and three two oh oh no oh oh stop stop

stood up I couldn't see Wow now it's
your turn all those years of duck hunt
finally paid off
no miss oh hey I'm breathing it now ah
right get the water I get some water
that's no good okay quickly
ah I'm a racist as highly effective
unless somebody has put together
cardboard body armor and is wearing I
protect Paulo
very effective okay well done salt
supply company I gave zero credibility
to this as an actual home defense weapon
until we did this test and now there's
no question a single person in a hallway
coming at you it's over
even if you miss them that stuff it's
floating on the walls next to them you
cannot walk into that and die instantly
I immediately blinded nobody can go into

hi my name is Kirk Kjellberg and I'm the
inventor of the ideal concealed pistol
also known as the cellphone pistol and
that's because it takes the shape of an
ordinary smartphone and allows a pistol
to hide in plain sight
the mission and ideal conceal was to
make a pistol that could be carried the
same as a traditional smartphone this
would be the ideal conceal in its
holster basically to use it you open it
depress the safety what's the handle
will deploy and then it's actually ready
to be used to reload it or low it you
simply open it that way place two
shelves in there close it latch it
this youth gun also has hard sights on
it which some of the other very small
pistols did not have we wanted to have
people have a way to cite it in the
future
this area here will be able to carry a
small laser so we're doing all the
things that are necessary to make a
really great pistol but also to conceal
it very easily you should invest an
ideal conceal because it will
essentially help to get this product out
on a worldwide basis very quickly and
our goal here is to help people protect
themselves so we invented the ideal
concealed pistol so that you can carry a
pistol for self-defense and not have to
have it be difficult on you ideal
conceal carry the revolution
you
you
