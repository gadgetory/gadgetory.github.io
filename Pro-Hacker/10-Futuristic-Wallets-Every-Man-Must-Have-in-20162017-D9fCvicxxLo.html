your wallet it's getting crowded credit
cards debit cards gift cards gym cards
you get the idea what if you could
safely store all of those cards on your
phone and then access them from one card
introducing Stratus your Bluetooth
connected card goodbye clutter Stratus
not only stores all of your cards it
also helps you find the one you need
based on your location just tap your
card twice and Stratus gives you options
right on your phone's lock screen gas
card perfect and Stratus is also safer
than the cards in your wallet that's
because it uses bank level encryption
and never displays your card numbers and
since it's Bluetooth connected you can
have Stratus locked down if you ever
leave it somewhere no more drama from a
lost or stolen credit card another cool
thing when you go to pay Stratus remind
you about that gift card you got last
month and now you actually have it with
you when you need it
but let's be honest you've got your
favorites
that's why Stratus has touch sensors
right on the card for quick access
no phone needed so you never have to
slow down I think you're getting the
picture time to trade in your eight
pound wallet and
hello to simplicity and security on a
smarter car that is accepted everywhere
strattice your cards connected
hey everyone thanks for checking out our
project my name is Sean and my name is
James we're the co-founders of a mossy
and spent the past twelve months
designing the n1 wallet so Sean and I
really want to create a wallet that was
more than your average wallet something
that was durable multifunctional and at
the same time so some of our everyday
issues we really wanted to make sure
it's an experience from the moment you
open the box the m1 is cut from a solid
block of aluminium making it super
durable and securely holds six to eight
cards as well as banknotes and with the
growing rise of RFID fraud one of our
main objectives was to keep your card
safe so your n1 comes with an aluminium
shield that works with the aluminium
central divider another issue many of us
face is card clash and one of the great
things about the n1 is that the
aluminium central divider prevents this
just simply keep your contactless bank
cards on one side and your Oyster card
or keyless entry card on the other when
it came to the look and feel of their
one we really wanted to deliver a
product that felt premium in your hand
and with its smooth finish and
lightweight design it really does give
you that feeling of a premium product
and one useful feature we've integrated
into the design is a bottle opener
another added feature is the ability to
change the look of your n1 by changing
the colored straps which is really
simple to do your n1 also comes with a
lanyard so you can attach it to yourself
so that it never gets lost we've been
told that it's slim and minimal design
makes it one of the most comfortable
wallets out there thank you for watching
everyone
we hope you'll back our project to be
part of our journey thank you thank you
our examples were the world's most
stylish and handy wallets
we added exquisite operating
characteristics and a practical design a
via door is not just a practical and
beautiful accessory but also a
multifunctional device with a set of
absolutely unique features it's a
totally new kind of accessory that you
have never seen before the trekking
option will prevent you from losing
sight of your wallet and losing your
money and valuable information the
connection works both ways not only can
you find your wallet using your mobile
phone which you can also find your
mobile phone using your wallet ah
Theodore can tell you when your wallet
is being opened
you don't need to worry about your
wallet in your mobile phone you'd better
take care of yourself in case of a
dangerous event you can calmly give the
mugger your wallet after you break one
of its corners this panic button will
activate the SOS regime immediately
showing the location of the mugger this
data could be used to help the police to
notify your relatives or for your own
personal use that's not all one of the
while its features is a built-in NFC
chip which means that you can pay for
your purchases provide personal
information from your business card and
so on check out the NFC options a via
door is also equipped to be used as an
electronic key we designed the wallet
with you in mind and we didn't forget
your information storage needs a via
door has an 8 gigabyte memory card
built-in we are sure this will be the
most original and useful present for a
person you care about a present that
shows you have an amazing sense of style
when designing the wallet we paid
particular attention to the quality the
wallet is handmade we use cold aletter
leather which is perhaps the finest
leather in the world we apply rigorous
quality standards to the metal part of
the wallet that contains the digital
information of the device and the memory
card this will make your wallet truly
unique durable and very stylish IV adore
your chance to speed up the future
you
we set out to create the sexiest easiest
to use minimalist wallet in the old
world and I think we've done just that
but it's time to find out for yourself
we don't like leather wallets do we kit
so we don't map so we made this
the Micra wallet was conceived as a
joint appreciation of minimalist design
as we grew frustrated with traditional
leather wallets only lasting several
months instead of several years as
designers we knew we could do better we
set ourselves a pretty challenging brief
to design a minimalist wallet that was
not only aesthetically beautiful but
functionally superior to anything else
on the market our years of industry
experience enabled us to quickly
evaluate our designs taking them from
initial concept through to sourcing
manufacturing partners mass production
our use of PVD coating would rival most
high-end watches this provides an
extremely high scratch resistant finish
we had concerns about our product
strengths so we decided to test it ready
kick
we fitted our wallet with a low-friction
TPU strap this prevents it from sticking
to your clothes
holding audio cards securely you no
longer have to remove them to make a
payment one of our proudest achievements
is full functionality of a regular
wallet without the bulk believe it or
not we've even managed to find space for
your change we've sourced the suppliers
we've manufactured our prototypes we've
tested them to their limits and this is
where we need your help
the Kickstarter community to help fund
this campaign and make the first
production run at the Micra walnut huge
success
thank you fortune thank you nowadays
almost everything is code encrypted your
phone your iPad your Wi-Fi your suitcase
the door of your building and of course
your credit card has a digit code for
sure it's better to be safe by the way
how safe is your wallet in your own home
for example have you ever realized you
were missing some cash or is it safe in
your own bedroom your credit card number
never ended up on the internet without
your consent
at the office are you really sure nobody
can sneak in your wallet and violate
your privacy then we realized there was
one item that we don't secure enough our
wallets this is why we created and are
proud to present the many safe wallet
the first code encrypted pocket-sized
vault including a locking system with a
thousand different combination
possibilities and a choose your own
system it's amazing how much progress
has been made in terms of tracking
systems lately that's why we propose the
option to embed your wallet with a
tracking system to ensure you never lose
it again it's also guarded with RFID
blocking technology your contactless
cards will be kept safe and protected
from electronic pickpockets the lock is
made out of metal for maximum
reliability
it is extremely handy thanks to its fan
shape interior giving easy access to all
your cards which are stored and well
sorted it can hold US dollars and euros
and fit up to twelve cards we've been
working on this idea for the past two
years with professional engineers to
reinvent and develop the locking system
to adapt it to a wallet it's very light
and strong thanks to its conception and
high quality materials we've also been
working with the designer Eric Bertus
and his design agency in Paris to make
this wallet aesthetically beautiful and
practical in its use so if you think
this is a great product for yourself
your friends or relatives we would love
to have you on board as a backer and
don't forget together to be safe
you
you
you
you
hey we've got another lost wallet over

of lost wallets all we can know for
