friend we want to introduce you to man's
new best friend meet chip our cheapest a
robotic dog that's much more than just a
new gadget chip is an interactive pillow
that's there to greet you at the door
with the smartband chip recognizes who
his owner is hey how do you see my other
slipper have you seen my other slipper
and shows affection to them one near
chip is obedient and can follow commands
but he also learns new things so you can
teach him tricks and the smarter chip
becomes the more badges yearns when you
like what you see
just press the like button on the band
which can encourage him to behave or be
a little mischievous your choices change
chips behavior and choose his
personality so that no two chips are
ever alike chip is a connected
experience he has a translator what is a
chip so you can understand his thoughts
he comes with his own smartphone so you
can play fetch and stay active together
and he also a sensors so you can
maneuver around obstacles with ease and
with the mobile lab you can feature what
shows you care and that's important
because when you're in need no matter it
big or small he's there for you
this is Pekin sense technology chip is
fully aware of the surroundings
seriously no one seen it this is like
the fifth time he even knows how to
return to his bed when it's time for a
charge hmm so he never runs out of
energy chip is a smart device chip is a
robot chip is a dog
but most importantly chip is
right Oh best time how do you learn
about robotics well the best way is with
a robot we like to introduce you to
Marty a fully programmable and
customizable walking robot for kids for
makers and for educators Marty's not
your standard smart toy he's designed by
roboticists to be a real robot that you
can do some really cool stuff with while
being as fun as a toy you can use Marty
to learn about robotics programming
electronics and mechanics or you can
build your own stuff with a walking
robot that will hold a Raspberry Pi and
which you can customize with 3d printed
parts Marty's not like other walking
robots his unique three motor and spring
leg design lowers costs but also makes
him easier to use and his battery lasts
longer he can walk turn kick a ball and
of course do funky dances marty is Wi-Fi
enabled so you can remote control or
program him from your phone or computer
you can also download apps or games
other users have made
robot app store Marty lets you learn
real programming on a real robot start
off with scratch where the coding is as
simple as clicking and dragging blocks
you can make a dance routine or start
interacting in the environment when
you're ready you can move into Python a
powerful but easy to use programming
language but robotics is way more than
just programming Marty lets you learn
about all kinds of things motor control
balance sensors mechanical design and
more Marty is really customizable and
upgradable the electronics make it easy
to add all kinds of sensors and motors
and they'll even support a whole
computer like the Raspberry Pi add a
camera and you could even program him to
play football all the parts are 3d
printable so you can make whatever you
can imagine Marty started out as a side
project during my PhD I've got nieces
and nephews who are starting to get to
the age where they can play with robots
but I couldn't see a walking robot toy
that was more than a novelty or at least
not one I could afford so I made one we
could actually use Marty to help teach
robotics at the University but this is
easy to use as any other toy also as a
maker I wanted a walking robot that I
could use as a base to build cool stuff
with I've spent the last year and a half
working on this little guy and now we're
ready to go from functional prototype
into a real kit that you can buy we've
spoken to manufacturers and we know how
to do it
but we need your help to make it happen
please help us make Marty a reality
like I'm cypher the designer vortex
vortex is a revolutionary product for
children it is a smart and responsive
robot that kids can play with and
program using the vortex and apps kids
can play different games learn about
robotics and even create their own
playing with vortex is incredibly fun
and easy thanks to its unified system
and intuitive app for example the
bumping fight is a sumo-style party game
suitable for multiple players the
computer inside vortex has sensors to
detect motions like hitting spinning or
being still vortex embraces new
technologies and allows users to
experience them the fugitive is a unique
game with augmented reality and motion
tracking technology children already
love playing with our vortex prototypes
and we can't wait for kids everywhere to
get their own vortex vortex is
compatible with both iOS and Android
devices and comes with an open SDK
anyone who wants to develop a game for
vortex is empowered to do so because
every vortex is a dev kit you only
limits your imagination vortexes app
allows kids to learn to program their
robots in a fun simple and educational
environment by abstracting complicated
actions and visualizing the process the
app teaches the basics of programming
without any coding or advanced skill
learning by doing has never been easier
just drag drop and hit upload that's
simple
we wanted to make a great product and to
do it we gathered the best people from
industrial design user experience
hardware software and game development
for the past two years
vortex has undergone countless revisions
and improvements and we know that only
through this process can we create a
product that won't disappoint our future
inventors
vortex is built on arduino an
open-source hardware platform it can see
and speak by using infrared grayscale
and sound speakers vortex can find its
way around obstacles detect lines and
report back to you we pre install the
program and done the assembling vortex
is fun right out of the box just open
the app switch it on and start exploring
vortex is also designed to be highly
customizable with colorful parts
stickers and maps
we've come a long way in creating vortex
and now we need your help to make it
real thank you
hey honey time to sleep the night to
Arctic's good night Julie
meet i do'
what can I do for you today
I'd only good morning
he's an intelligent capable and
affordable companion he can do just
about anything
the help you have always wanted a
handyman
a teacher
a friend he's perfect in every way he
can be just about anyone
a terror
a homemaker
he's a personal Butler who's trustworthy
you
he is whatever you want him to be
I started off as an idea to make
cutting-edge robotics friendly and
useful to the home while being
affordable I have been overwhelmed by
all the love and recognition I've
received so far now I need your help and
support to make me really great adopt me
as your new companion at home I'm Tommy
and this is this is someone really
special
and very close to me even though he's
from far away like the distance from
here to the sky boat on Drive in the
faraway galaxy but he's an amazing
station collided with an asteroid and
ended up broken into pieces
luckily he managed to survive we're
trying to put it together somehow for
the time being
Burton is staying with and I have become
his friend I'm showing him what's what
how we live here that's what friends are
for at first couldn't even move now he's
running around like an adult and he
keeps developing looks an obstacle we
got that covered already Photon
quickly figured out but we little people
love playing the most sometimes we like
to make mess
and we don't necessarily like cleaning
up as much not there are other beings
living with us and by the way he's
really happy what he's able
oh how do we communicate programming
controlling commands in photonic
language but it's a great companion when
we play and even better when we party
thanks to him I know that there are no
black light bulbs I keep working on
these and we're getting better photon is
amazed by the amount of Technology in
our world now we're learning about it
together all of us because you have to
know that my friends got to befriend
photon as well Sophie loves to light up
his eyes and keep stressing him up Ethan
keeps on wanting to take them everywhere
and Oliver to teaching new stuff even
our kindergarten teacher says that
photon absorbed going to land on earth
really soon let's learn coding together
support us on Kickstarter meet photon
calm
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
