here comes a new concept for your home
the world's first smart
touchless faucet adapter techo auto
water white can sometimes get messy
techo auto water teaches children
hand-washing habits and helps your visit
household get rid of germs it has two
powerful sensors for on and off with the
time-out protection that stops the water
automatically the bottom sensor is for
quick use
there's no need to replace your old taps
simply make them work better with our
six different connector sizes it fits
easily with most bathroom and kitchen
faucets techo Auto water is made with
the highest quality materials including
brushed aluminum as well as cutting edge
technology for a minimum of charge
combined with the reliable durability
choose between seven colors and get
water during the night without turning
the main light on thanks to our motion
sensors night life
techo auto water helps control and
reduces household water usage and
consumption by up to 65% help us bring
our green technology to millions of
homes around the world
techo auto water use only the water you
need without wasting a drop
the true
you
people around the world are drinking
more and more bottled water as they
don't like the taste of tap water and
worry about the potential health impact
this year alone 480 billion bottles will
be consumed and less than 7% of these
get recycled the rest end up in
landfills nature rivers and eventually
the oceans this is catastrophic for our
environment and a waste of money for
consumers at tap water we decided there
has to be a better way so we spent three
years researching existing water
filtering technologies and we came up
with tap a revolutionary water filter
system for the kitchen tap last year we
launched the first generation tap one
and since then we've been working hard
to come up with a completely redesigned
tap - it takes only 15 seconds to
install and after this you can forget
about carrying heavy expensive bottles
just turn on your tap and drink healthy
great tasting water anytime you want tap
2 uses the latest carbon block
technology made of 100% coconut shells
which removes over 80 contaminants
including chlorine pesticides and heavy
metals while letting the good minerals
remain it connects with your phone to
give you updates on when the cartridges
need to be changed and how much money
you've saved in the environmental impact
and it is the first biodegradable water
filter so once the cartridge is used it
can be composted so no plastic waste
ends up in our nature and oceans
during the development of the first
version tap one we tested over 50
existing filters and filtering
technologies our goal was to create a
much better product we succeeded and
have already shipped over 5,000 filters
and helping people in more than 20
countries but we knew we could do much
better
tap 2 is our next generation of water
filters it's connected smarter better
filtering and sustainable so we need
your help to achieve our mission we'd
have to to reduce plastic waste by 1
billion bottles by 2020 thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
