just to get plenty of help you out with
something using a few words or a simple
gesture cling cube will get it down
instantly and respond to you with easy
to understand body language and other
visual feedback thank you is model robot
it is an expansive protocol we plan to
publish api's and 3d models so everyone
can be created
our dream is to see is from around of
the wall Rosa also playing - I'm very
excited about this project
let's create great youth together
dear analog photographers we are proud
to introduce you lab box the easiest and
quickest tool to develop your own films
lab box is a new multi format tank you
can use with 35 millimeter and medium
format films simply by using the 120
module okay let's start loading our film
no you don't need to be in the dark
anymore turn on the light
yes lab box is a new day loading tank
you can do everything in full light
let's start to develop your films
wherever you want lab box is the perfect
tool for anyone approaching or studying
analog photography it can be used by
teachers and schools to demonstrate the
film developing process directly in
class without the need to load films in
the dark
students can see and learn all passages
in the life and develop their films as a
group getting to examine the negatives
very quickly
lebackes can really be used everywhere
you can share it with your friends even
outdoors to develop the film you just
shop and discover right away the results
land box also meets the needs of
professional photographers who want to
quickly develop their test shots and
even experiment with color processing
film photography is growing and
especially new generations are
rediscovering the analog process to
create pictures with their own hands
laughs box simplifies the work allowing
everybody to easily develop their own
films and share the moment with people
they love once the negative is ready you
can scan it and immediately see the
pictures you took enjoying the look of
film photography flat box is very
compact and can be carried anywhere it's
a perfect travel companion to develop
and check once photos while on the go
you can also use it with medium format
films easily loading them in full light
land box can be used with the mono path
an easy single solution which quickly
develops and fixes at the same time in
just a few minutes processing your own
films has never been this easy with LAN
box hi Kickstarter I'm Alessandra and
this is our scimago
the company where lightbox project was
born two years ago we have worked with
analog photography for many years and
our mission is to keep it alive
encouraging everybody to enjoy film
photography this is why we created a new
tool that allows anybody to develop
their own films we started this project
along with farmer cosa makerspace where
lead box has been designed and tested
through many prototypes realize with 3d
printing technology but now we need you
to make it real and develop film in the
light help us to realize this project
sure on film and enjoy
hello photography it feels like we all
have these different patterns and
rhythms throughout our day and we all
experience time differently well time
for many of us is something we only
experience using our mobile devices and
they're kept hid in our pockets it
doesn't really help us visualize where
we've been or where we're going there's
a whole history in the art and science
of measuring time that horologist went
into great detail when they designed
clocks I think because they were meant
to be appreciated and looked at for a
very long time what I find very
interesting about the ancient
civilizations that use the sky as a
clock is that they were able to very
accurately predict sunrise and sunset
and see time in the greater perspective
of things the fascination for space
began many years ago when we launched a
balloon to the stratosphere and on that
balloon we attached a 360-degree camera
so that people could have an immersive
experience of space so I think story
ties in deeply to the notion of space
and planetary movement it's sort of
bringing the physical experience of
space and time to people's homes or
offices so I hope story will allow
people to experience time differently
and step into that moment that we all
have access to and that's the present
moment the levitating ball for me
symbolizes that moment of suspension
which is the present moment so what I
hope you get out of story is the ability
to perceive time in a different way hi
hi I'm Fred I'm a software engineer and
together with Excel we developed a new
kind of digital clock and we called it
alert hey I think I found a new way to
solve the Rubik's Cube it's so easy look
at all these color combinations isn't it
fantastic isn't it a copycat
please exactly that's the point let me
explain this a virtual device that can
help children and everyone else to
experience learning in a playful way you
know that read the time you have to
calculate the hours and the minutes all
the calculation are completely random
and change every minute hey guys we
think some attention please here we
believe in the positive influence of
Technology in our daily life and Albert
is our very first attempt at reading a
new kind of smart object that will
change your mind
William calculus are intelligent
we live in a busy world and it's only
getting busier with tablets smartphones
countless apps and online tools we are
surrounded by technology even with
notifications and multiple cloud
calendars synced across all of our
devices we still seem to miss things
sometimes a complex world beats a simple
product hi my name is Igor and I'm a
founder of what watch we wanted to
create a product to make your life
easier we combined the watch and a
calendar so meet calendar watch modern
beautifully designed and intuitively
perceptive your daily calendar in a
digital form that is always visible
complemented by stylish analogue
features this is it no buttons or
unnecessary functionality something new
and completely different this is a new
way to look at time okay so here's how
it works
the watch is synced with your favorite
digital calendar through the app dark
segments are scheduled meetings while
the light ones mean free time the watch
dynamically shows you the next 12 hours
leaving with you and clearing your
meetings as they happen you can see
further ahead by double tapping on the
watch's glass the watch allows you to
discreetly check what's coming up and
alerts you with vibration and visual
indicators and of course it keeps time
automatically even when you change time
zones as well as all this the calendar
watch is not one more thing to charge
daily the battery lasts for weeks and
keeps your schedule with you even when
your smartphone
now you can see your day at a glance
knowing when you'll be busy and when
you'll be free all by looking at your
wrist the calendar watch saves time
grants you peace of mind and helps to
free you from your phone not a bad thing
in today's world above all we wanted to
create an elegant and durable timepiece
using the best materials stainless steel
body
genuine leather straps and domes
sapphire glass together with a
traditional movement we've extended the
lugs to travel through the sides of the
watch giving a very distinctive look and
we've also made them interchangeable
allowing you to swap in differently
colored locks enabling you to create a
unique timepiece we're launching the
calendar watch in three different colors
polar white aqua blue and this special
edition gunmetal black so we are a truly
international team from Brooklyn to
Russia and we know how to build watches
now we need your help to go from
prototypes to manufacturing so if you
also believe we can do a totally new
type of a watch join us in that effort
you
