night good night sleep tight more than
40% of our lives are spent in habit for
most of us that time is wasted the
secret to transformation is not to try
harder it's to replace bad habits with
the habits of excellence if you wanted
to transform yourself how would you
start first identify the habits that
hold you back paired them with a
negative stimulus like electric shock
each surge of voltage trains your brain
and weakens the neural connection until
the bad habit is severed next replace
the bad habit with a positive one reward
yourself when you complete your daily
goal commit to a penalty if you fail the
fear of loss stimulates your basal
ganglia while the chance of reward
motivates your prefrontal cortex in
fewer than 30 days the action becomes a
habit
padlock is the first system designed to
help you build good habit and break bad
ones earn rewards when you succeed pay
the price when you fail and experience
the electric shock that keeps you on
track
