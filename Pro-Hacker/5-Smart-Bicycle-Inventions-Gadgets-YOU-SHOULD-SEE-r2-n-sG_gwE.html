hi I'm Kristin this is my sister Joey
we're in Copenhagen in Denmark and we
are on a mission to make the perfect
bike for any given situation biking is a
huge part of our culture so we know what
fighting is all about and how it should
feel to write we also love technology
and thought of a way of how to combine
these two things and still keep cool
functionality in mind after many
prototypes thousands of powers we're
happy to finally say we created what we
believe is the perfect bike
let us introduce mate mate is no
ordinary bike it's an electric foldable
and affordable bike made for any journey
any rider any situation but enough with
the talking let's take it for a spin
mate is our answer to bring people on a
bike again it makes distances shorter
and Hills more flat so you can focus on
what's important to you like your
friends we design mate to be your
everyday companion for better easier
faster and funnier personal
transportation it can ride up to 50
miles on a single charge
it is built with the finest components
has a six speed computer and comes in a
variety of cool colors
it will never let you down and allows
you to charge any mobile device thanks
to its built-in USB port
we build made with an integrated
carrying handle so you can lift it
easily on your way up like down the
stairs
and thanks to its all-terrain tires and
shock absorbing suspensions hot paved
roads will feel gentle and smooth
made it is great when you want to beat
the traffic and go places path without
breaking a sweat
but if you want to exercise choose the
level of assist you want with the six
speed settings on the computer the
choice is yours go further or go harder
MAPE comes with smart disc brakes for
quick and effective stopping power
we also edit front and back suspension
so you don't have to worry about
obstacles along the way it spills
durable so give it your best shot it is
always a fun and easy experience for all
ages and riding styles for adventure
Alysha you can use the pedal assist or
you can go full electric just sit back
relax and enjoy the scenery at 20 miles
per hour there might be times where you
won't need your mate
so it's great to be able to fold it for
storage or transportation knowing you
can always take it out when you feel the
urge
we're just at the beginning our dream is
to kick-start the biking evolution and
you can be a part of it once we get made
funded we can start production and
together we can rethink what a bike
should be able to do
this bike can do virtually anything they
mate pick up Julie oh well we're not
quite there yet but together we can make
it happen we're tagging a family by
company for the last seven years we've
been creating bike strollers that are
loved and enjoyed all around the globe
this is our latest project and we do not
hesitate when we say this is the next
step in the evolution of family bikes
see three years ago we searched for our
next project we turn to a lot of people
and ask them what they would want in a
family life some answers were strange
and you make it fly somewhere
eye-opening young babies should be
facing their parents and some were just
adorable we listened and set out to
create the ultimate family bike for two
years we made sketches prototypes
studied materials carried out
experiments and explored every aspect of
family bike should have basically we
reinvented the family life this is the
taiga 2.0 the most comfortable safe easy
to ride practical and just all-around
coolest family bike you couldn't
possibly imagine the targa 2 has
everything our customers wanted and much
more
safety first Tonga has three wheels so
it's inherently stable the cargo box
materials are super strong plastics with
a metal frame inside that makes the
seating area durable and resistant to
impact the child seats themselves have
endless features and options Tonga can
take one or two kids facing forwards
backwards or facing each other or a
boatload of laps to keep it versatile in
seconds target 2 turns from a family
bike into a lockable cargo bike with
extra load space on top we use disc
brakes and a Shimano gear and you can
always easily turn it into an electric
light for effortless long distance rides
now for the fun part
apart from the wind in their hair we
wanted the kids to have a truly
enjoyable adventure on our bikes so we
added the accessory bar to which you can
attach a variety of fun add-ons yes
there's also a water gun and when it
rains or if the kids just want some
privacy
there's the royal canopy let's see what
else no it can't fly yet but it can all
be taken apart to fit in your car truck
oh and the seats come in a variety of
colors because you know the personal
touch transforms our own ultimate bike
into your own Ultimate Fighter last but
certainly not least the price while
creating the target ooh we never forgot
the one thing everyone asked make it
affordable make it affordable so we did
because to turn the family bike trend
into a real revolution we had to make it
accessible for everyone whether you use
it for a weekend trip a drop-off for
shopping or to carry your loyal friends
bottarga to is an ideal solution our
company has a proven track record so
this is one of those projects you can
back safely we need your help to make
this piece of family fun a reality so
backed agha and help us make the
ultimate family bond taga
