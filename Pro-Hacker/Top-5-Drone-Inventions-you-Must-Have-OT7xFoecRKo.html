first fully portable 4k flying camera
lots of kwacha decent quality video but
they all forced to make the same
frustrating choice tiny toy model
digital-only stabilization forces you
compromise on video quality flight time
and wind performance or heavy duty model
the big bulky carrying case I mean we
want to go hiking with this until now
you need a dangerous open blades in
order to get good one performance but
got a hard tough phone with a big flying
lawnmower nearby
never try that open bladed model at one
recommend it that's what we built the
safest 4k fly on camera it fits in the
smallest backpack so you can take it
anywhere capture the moments get
important to you the best camera is
always the one you have with you at 500
grams it's less a 20-minute flight time
and packs the gimbal stabilized 4k
camera we made a flying camera for
capturing the best stories of adventures
the best stories usually have people in
them and people
sometimes make mistakes that would have
been a bloody mess with any other flying
camera out there what they messes are
any fun we think flying camera should be
fun flying snap with your smartphone
means you always have your controller
with you the smarts of your smartphone
lets us make a lot of the hard things
easy like one of those dramatic shots
when the camera pulls back and orbits
around you we've worked with a team of
directors and videographers to define
those amazing cinematic shots and make
it easy for you to recreate them without
being a professional director
snap knows exactly where you are which
lets it automatically track you fly
around you and come back to you snap
works with iOS and Android phones to
stick dsm controllers or bluetooth game
controllers whatever suits your style or
you cannot pilot snap at all and let it
do the work for you it's amazing to have
the freedom to see anything and anyone
any perspective any time without having
to think or worry just have fun and this
is just a start
we've got modules coming for obstacle
avoidance wildly fast flight speed and
unlimited range with a cellular modem we
spent over two years booked an extremely
talented team of engineers designers and
programmers developing the technology to
make this possible we want to show the
world just how easy a mind-blowing
aerial video can be snap is ready for
pre-order now we can't wait to see what
you're gonna do with it
here we go
Dondre sink is first person view client
will first drone pilot sees what the
drone sees as it twice controlling the
aircraft the multi it can be sporty
phrasing at race drag of freestyle if
you pull the notion and enjoy the
freedom of flight drone racing became in
a new entertainment and sport
effectively growing community in the
narration room is always a compromise in
high strength long wait but this typical
racing drone design is based on
lightweight and strong material carbon
fiber here elite is an open frame made
of number of red carbon fiber details
connected with bolts and mass obviously
open electronic components are affected
by rain wire then built water drops such
a setup can be easily broken down during
collision crash - water a drone pilot
often has to bring two or more drones to
the races and spend a lot of time
repairing our understanding these
shortcomings we are making a new step
over future of race and road design the
name of the step is Nimbus the basic
idea behind inflow weight and high
strength comes from features of a shell
a structural element with geometry the
thickness is very small compared with
other dimensions the first prototype was
made in January 2016 after extensive
flight tests 20 units were delivered to
pylons feedback was collected and used
in this release version we make the
frame for Nimbus drone with a special
technology or mini carbon fiber from the
inside the cavity mold with special
blood which is pressurized to fare as a
result we are getting similar structure
and fundamental increase of strength
keep in the very long way it is very
efficient use of carbon fiber
all electronic components of drone
camera and battery are placed in there
and closed body and protected from the
environment now we can enjoy your flight
even more the world here of time and
money consumed in affairs not wasting
time waiting for replacement parts or
just annoying cleaning nimbus drunk has
extremes then of course it will not
teach you to fly but it will give you
much more confidence and pliant
aerodynamics it can be ignored when we
are talking about flying at high speeds
Nimbus drone has streamlined form and
very good aerodynamic properties Nimbus
drone will be available as prime only
foreign ready to fly package with the
fastest flight controller well-proven
electronic components and powerful
motors our campaign is aimed to raise
funds for establishment of specialized
high quality production of full carbon
fiber forms we are starting with our
first product Nimbus drone which will be
ready for shipments in March 2017 if you
are interested to push race and drone
design to a new level or you are looking
for new ideas please let us know and
support our project
you
