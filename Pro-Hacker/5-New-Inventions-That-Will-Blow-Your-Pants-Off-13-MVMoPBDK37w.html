Lucy I'm home welcome home and messages
mm-hmm please tell Margaret home now
okay i am sending mark a message was you
the game tonight yes your calendar shows
a game at nine tonight okay the reserve
a spot for me either tap house at eight
thirty will do all those either kind of
rain no the low pressure front is
passing to the north of us because I
don't know what am I umbrellas Lucy I
wish you could make me a drink still
working on it
hello Kickstarter's what is your biggest
problem and clean is it cars computers
in your household or do we have a
different problem area we have something
to show you each of us nosy and each of
us 80 plus its most annoying and sour
convenient in our daily lives it's not
attractive makes us sick it's often hard
to remove there are many differently and
products available today but they all
have their limits and are often not too
terrible to be used in certain areas
dust brush is the universal we're
competing attachment that knows no
limits the principle is easy as a senior
Justin with a brush to choose a word
flexible and fit perfectly on to all
even services it doesn't matter if it is
a small proof inner corners or delicate
items this attachment boxes or cases
were small parts like toys swing needles
or screws can be cleaned in no time at
all it used to be very time-consuming to
clean them in the future using the
ZBrush all kinds of boxers holding small
parts can be simply waking doubt nothing
will be sucked away and no small part
will get lost the boxes and contents
will be quickly and easily clean with
little afford in the car are also
similar difficult areas to clean
colorless you know this when delighted
periods see drags trace seat cushions
all these areas can be cleaned the
father's Lee with testicles dust brush
sucks the dirt from deep within Greg's
and riches and fits perfectly between
the seat cushions the small area between
the window and the door fittings will be
effectively clean
even the dirty areas between the seat
tracks into the small snacks and
crannies can be easily cleaned some of
the biggest dust collectors are electric
equipment especially computers dust
collects on them they overhead and do
not perform well in combination with the
anti-static are we can use that steep
rush to remove the dust without
compressed air or special equipment
difficult to reach areas will be easily
freed from dust even cables and
sensitive electronics can be cleaned
this way with no problems at the same
time no dust gets out into the
surrounding areas your PC would thank
you even our best friends are also
blessed with the dust occurs over time
lose hair and that skin cells met up the
food dust brush can wake him the hair
and skin cells simply out of the firm
the tubes act like a brush and comb the
Fuhrer at the same time after several
usages the fur fits much smoother
there's enough suctioning when used in
the fur clothing direction to wake him
up the dead skin cells without dust
approach attaching itself to the skin
the tube to move lowes hair from your
pet before it can squeeze into the room
instead it gets sacked directly into the
way conclusion
that is really great customer opens up
new possibilities this is our daily blog
hog means you can use in every area
that's the brush is constructed tested
and perfect well up in Germany and
reducing de las casas del for one
hundred percent
firmly believed us confidence in early
also we want your ideas and suggestions
and at all father has need your help the
case letters please have a screen
Dustbuster lives help us to make your
home Tina and healthy thank you hello
IndieGoGo we are onion as makers we use
development boards to build all sorts of
cool stuff but most development boards
on the market fell short of our
expectations they are bulky confusing
the set up and over complicated we
usually spend far more time reading the
documentation than actually using them
to build things today we're changing
that say hello to the omega to the
world's simplest development work the
omega 2 is tiny at less than a quarter
of the size of your credit card it can
easily fit into any project but don't be
fooled by its size the omega 2 is
powerful it is a full linux computer
that's right this tiny purple thing runs
the same operating system that power
some of the world's most mission
critical infrastructure the omega 2
works out of the box it comes with
built-in Wi-Fi and onboard storage so it
comes to life the moment you power it on
the omega 2 is familiar you control it
with apps just like your regular
computer we even have an app store so
you can discover apps created by the
community the omega 2 is easy to program
in fact you don't even have to write any
code it supports node-red a graphical
tool that you can use to create programs
by simple drag-and-drop
but if you are into writing code the
omega 2 supports many programming
languages pick one you're already
familiar with and start building the
omega 2 is called connected so we can
remote controller securely from anywhere
in the world the omega 2 is expandable
we have created many plug-and-play
expansions so adding new features to
your project will look something like
this the omega 2 is affordable starting
at only five dollars yep five it is
cheaper than this Frappuccino we want to
lower the barrier to entry so everyone
can join the maker movement so you see
guys the problem is that the tools for
building amazing hardware are just not
accessible for everyone and that is why
here at onion we have worked so hard to
make the omega 2 really easy to use but
we need your help to make it affordable
as well so please back our campaign and
tell all your friends we can't wait to
see what amazing things you'll come up
with thank you
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
