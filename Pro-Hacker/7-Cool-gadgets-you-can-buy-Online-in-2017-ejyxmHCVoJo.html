smart pillbox that helps you organize
your pills and seconds and remind you
when to take them I need to take certain
vitamins every single day in order to
stay healthy
I always forget to take them with le
grid I just receive reminders when it's
time to take my vitamins and I don't
even need to think about it because the
life tell me which ones to take and how
many we designed le grid to make life
easy for people that take vitamin
supplements or medication
this is my grandfather he's usually
always having a good time however last
year I walked into his apartment and
found him shivering unable to speak or
move so I grabbed a blanket wrapped him
up when I was finally able to find out
what happened he told me he hadn't taken
his medication in three days he said it
was because it takes him so long to
organise his medication in his weekly
container and he sometimes doesn't do it
and as a result he doesn't take them so
we designed an le grid with le grid each
compartment contains one type of
medication so whenever you're running
low you can simply take your pill bottle
and pour in more now it takes my
grandfather 30 seconds to organize all
of his pills instead of 30 minutes which
means he actually does it I'm going to
be honest my mom she's not the best of
technology which is why it's so great
that I can set up a really good forward
all I have to do is tap on the rectangle
for them information about what
medication she's supposed to take and
when and it's saved right there on the
device I don't have to mess with the app
again the other two she I can know that
it can mine here take your medication in
the matter how far away I am my dad and
I with nearly 4,000 miles
away from each other so it can be hard
to keep in touch with him let alone keep
track this general health and well-being
but thanks to elegance onboard sensors I
can receive notifications when he
doesn't take his medicine so I don't
have to keep guessing I could reach out
to my dad whenever he's struggling to
make sure that he's okay
stories like these are not uncommon
which is why we've been developing le
Road for the past year we've gone
through a series of tests and prototypes
to make sure the la grid looks and feels
great and literally easier than ever
the product is come a long way and now
the technology is ready to put into the
hands of every person to do so we can't
do without you if you can help us reach
our funding goal by pre-ordering and
Ella grant and supporting us in any way
we can provide this product to you and
those who need it the most so what is
Ella grid worth to you or better yet who
is worth it to you
sound sound is everywhere there is no
accurate count for how many sounds an
average person hears in a get a day
adhirata audio we understand that sound
is what inspires us motivates us to
rides us and connects us introducing the
Apollo 7
the world's most compact true Wireless
year we just wanted to make something
that just made sense we wanted to create
an earphone a completely wireless
earphone that delivered incredible sound
the Apollo 7 earphones come in a sleek
aluminum case with a built-in lithium
battery that makes it easy and
convenient to store as well as charge on
the go see you'll never run out of power
no matter where your day takes you these
earphones are ready to go they're coated
with a nano waterproofing technology
that makes them perfect for any
situation as an athlete I absolutely
love the Apollo 7 not only are they
waterproof
they're Wireless true Wireless meaning
no wires involved at all and they're
very small and compact and they fit in
the air
incredibly comfortably and I've done
product for monster and beep and the
Apollo 7 is truly innovative
well-thought-out design and excellent
execution a lot of times you get a
wireless Bluetooth headset and you still
haven't an outside box and there's wires
all over the place I can't stand wires
I've gone through like I said several
pairs of headphones are just like
garbage the Bluetooth like it just
doesn't doesn't sound good at all you're
sacrificing a lot usually when you go to
a small earbud and these just sound
awesome it sounded really really good
that's my favorite part about them well
it's brilliant
you have the carrying case has wireless
charging essentially when you drop the
earpieces in and then there's a battery
in the case you don't have to find an
outlet to plug it in and charge it so
this is an all-day solution
we wanted to keep the Apollo 7 easy in
intuitive with its single button
features you'll be able to take a call
skip tracks control volume activate
Google now or even talk to Siri we also
built an omnidirectional microphone for
the Apollo 7 because we know how
important it is to have a crisp
hands-free solution for taking calls on
the go support us now and be one of the
first to experience true wireless audio
the way it should be
Apollo 7 by errata audio stylus take
