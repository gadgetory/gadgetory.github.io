or my name is dr. ken Baylor I've been
in cybersecurity for the last 21 years
and my last key roles have been chief
security officer at Symantec and head of
compliance worldwide for uber in the
next three years is going to be 60
billion IOT devices in people homes
that's 50 devices per individual home
every one of them will be running a
different version of firmware will be
cameras all sorts of things and most of
them will not have security built in but
they're on your network under capable of
interacting with your private data and
stealing your information so imagine if
you could have one box that you didn't
even have to understand you could just
plug it into your network would monitor
every single one of those devices check
on them make sure they're doing the
right thing and nothing suspicious is
going on
that's Aikido it's privacy security
simplicity smart home devices have made
our lives more comfortable but comfort
comes at a price in fact last year alone
there was a 45 percent rise in cyber
attacks on smartphones and in April of
2016 a cyber attack was carried out that
brought the Internet to its knees how do
they do it through smart home devices
this is Akita the smartest watchdog for
your smartphone why do you need it
because of this yep
you're very new excellent home security
camera that you purchased after a lot of
research it's a great camera
unfortunately it's connected to the
Internet which means it can be hacked
and once the camera is hacked you're not
going to be the only one looking through
it and it's not just your camera every
IOT device in your smart home can be
hacked your thermostat can tell the
hackers if someone is in the house and
your friendly smart home hub might be
listening even when you're not asking it
to once those devices are hacked well
your computers a hackers playground and
once they're inside your computer they
can see everything you want to keep
private
that's where akita comes in Akita
provides the most advanced home
protection and it requires you to do
just one thing nothing
Akita constantly scans and monitors your
home network checking that only devices
with IPS you've allowed to use your home
network are the ones actually using it
and once Akita finds out that one of
your lovely devices has been hacked it
immediately blocks the hack by
extracting at that specific device from
your network it also notifies you
through a notification on the Akita app
then if you want further assistance on
how to handle the hack you'll need to do
just one more thing press this button it
will contact the Akita team immediately
and they'll answer any question you
might have they're there for you 24/7

my name is Bradley Devine and I do
travel and lifestyle photography and
videography my name is Jessica janae and
I'm an international wedding and fashion
photographer I'm in DL and I'm a
destination wedding photographer my name
is Erin Brimhall and I am an outdoor
lifestyle / automotive photographer well
I love about the universal lens count is
I love how it grabs onto the lens and
the only way it's gonna come off is if I
pull it off and I love that it does
fully pertain to protect what's most
important about my lens and the glass
and I feel like and it's something that
should have existed a long time ago my
favorite thing about the universal lens
cap is when I have the lens cap on I'm
shooting something a wedding I I bump
against something doesn't just fall off
so I like that these really grip your
lens it's super hard and so no matter
what happens it doesn't fall off which
is glorious and nothing kick it in it I
feel like even if I'm shooting in sand
and dirt and dust and nothing can get in
there into the cracks water anything
it's very protected I love that it's
Universal because I can put it on both
ends of every single one of my lenses
and it's so much nicer for travel so I
don't have to like pack every single
little type of lens cap for each
specific lens
I keep way better track of them and it
keeps my lenses protected throwing them
in and out of bags and stuff like that
well I like about this the most is you
mean you can put it in your pocket you
know whenever you need to it's not like
in there as like a big old fold I like
how its stretchy so it can fit on anyway
any type of wounds you have you know
fits on the 7250 all my wives like this
even like mighty Sigma's that have the
design I'm already you just stretch them
over it's nice and then if it's on the
back so you don't have a calf anymore I
feel like it's something that should
have existed a long time ago and lenses
have existed like this is something
that's definitely going to protect
what's most important to Cameron that's
the glass and lens so I really like it
you
