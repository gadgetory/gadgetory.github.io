world
it's like magic and has a certain
feeling to it we all love technology but
what was life like before it it was an
era where people had time to enjoy the
outdoors and soak up Earth's natural
goodness today we live in a world
overflowing with technology that
benefits mankind but what about its
dangers from pollution to radiation to
electromagnetic waves technology affects
the way we think feel and even sleep but
what if there's a way to enjoy your
cellphones tablets and televisions
without the harmful effects introducing
Zen cube
the healthiest land ever inspired by the
purest places on earth
we used our expertise to create and
build something pure that we would be
proud of the branded benefits of the
outdoors and to where we spend the most
time our homes and offices being in a
waterfall or the beach or in the
countryside gives off lots of negative
ions which is what the body needs to
feel great technology does the opposite
gives off lots of positive ions which
make us feel tired stressed and agitated
Himalayan salt is one of the Earth's
riches substances Zen q harnesses for us
to bring the benefits of the outdoors to
you it chemically and physically
transforms a room that has unique
healing effects the Zen cube was
designed to admit negative ions which
cleans and deodorizes the air reducing
allergies of coughing reduces radiation
the neutralizes electromagnetic waves
emitted by technology this also reduces
static in the air increases energy
levels improve mood and concentration
increases blood and oxygen supply to the
brain resulting in better sleep patterns
Himalayan salt lamps are not new they
traditionally come with their own
problems it often notes they are hot to
the touch
these are lots of electricity and can be
messy not to mention they didn't always
look the best Zen cube stays cool it
does not melt his long-lasting not to
mention its style we wanted it to look
stunning they had to inspire relaxation
a sense of Zen the shape had to be
original they had to be big enough to
exude the right amount of goodness
remind a single block of pink salt
crystal all the way from the Himalayan
mountains we encase it in over a bust
and sleek outer shell we fitted it with
an RGB LED light source to have the
perfect glow with amazing efficiency the
RGB bulb is controlled by an app turn it
on or off change the color or intensity
while setting comfortably on your couch
nature isn't just about the way it looks
but how it feels and smells we also
fitted in an essential oil compartment
so you can smell a pleasant fragrance
every day looks and functionality
weren't enough the materials had to be
top-notch as well the plastic is made of
premium polycarbonate and robust buta
thing so it'll last in even the toughest
conditions
the salt exposed on each side is made
from the best and pure Himalayan crystal
we wanted everyone to have the ability
to add a personal touch so starting from
day one you can choose the color to
match your room we've put our heart and
soul into bringing you the Zen cube to
be able to produce it and make it
available we need your support together
we can make this happen make this your
next plan

our hands move which is why a static
stationary wrist support can only get in
the way and cause more problems than it
solves
but what if wrist support was like a cat
that could chase down the computer mouse
touchpad or keyboard what if it was so
evolved that it moves just like we do
freeing us to make all of those
keystrokes gestures motions and
movements while providing the comfort
and support we need to protect our
wrists well this is exactly what we've
done and after two years and more than
100 prototypes we've developed the
ultimate wrist support for all computer
users especially coders gamers designers
and office workers who spend all day
with their hand attached to a mouse
touchpad or keyboard and it's called
wrist accad the first and only wrist
support with magnetic levitation
suspending your hand with a therapeutic
magnetic barrier that eliminates
friction and resistance while absorbing
the repetitive stress that can harm your
wrist wrist ekkada navels fluid cat-like
movement across your entire desktop
while keeping your wrist straight and
resting comfortably and a specially
designed support cradle that continually
flexes adapts and conforms to gently
support your every movement so whether
you click a mouse tap a keyboard gesture
on a touchpad or spend time gaming wrist
account was created to be your hands
best friend
Rishta cats ready for production with
everything in place to begin
manufacturing right here in the USA the
only thing standing between arista cat
and your desktop are the substantial
production costs and include tooling
manufacturing and materials so that we
can make ristic at affordable for
everyone we need your help to reach our
funding goal and spreading the word on
social media about our mission to
reinvent Chris support with the Rishta
cat hitting our stretch goals will open
up color options and other incentives
but the true reward will come the first
time you slip your hand into the
comfortable therapeutic embrace of the
Rishta cat and feel exactly why it's
your hands best friend we've put a lot
of time and energy passion and
dedication into making ristic at the
ultimate risk support for all computer
users we want it to be the best wrist
support ever made but we can't do it
without your help thanks for supporting
our campaign by letting Rishta cat
support you

hi guys I'd like to introduce you to
wake up a capsule it is compatible with
Nespresso system in stainless steel or
chargeable affordable and eco-friendly
because of its unique characteristics
wake up represents a whole new way of
drinking espresso in the comfort of your
home have you ever thought about how
much the coffee in disposable capsules
cost up to 100 euros per kilo for a
product you don't even know the original
thanks to wake up your savings are huge
for the price of 10 disposable capsules
you can make cut to 100 cups of espresso
interesting right
but there's more I'm going to talk to
you about the capsules environmental
sustainability in fact wake up solves
the problem of having to throw away
disposable capsules insofar as they're
infinitely recyclable
the only waste product the coffee grinds
which can be recycled in different ways
especially in the home for example as
compost think it's a good idea there's
more
I'm going to talk about the third
advantage of wake up capsule the return
of choice
wake up capsules let you revive past
relations and apply them to the new
technologies the effect the capsule
works with any blend on the market from
the roster down the street to the
supermarket from the organic food shop
to your favorite coffee shop wakeup is
also very practical our manual dispenser
allows for quick loading leaving no
residue it takes 30 seconds just enough
time for the machine to warm up the
manual dispenser can also be used as a
current case allowing to prepare the
capsules comfortably at home and take
them with you everywhere for example at
office wakeup is the result of more than
a year of meticulous planning and
testing the capsules are entirely made
in Italy and every single piece is
checked by the expert hands of
passionate professionals the unique
fissure system allows for perfect
extraction and leader enhancing taste
flavor intensity and creaminess in short
a real Italian espresso alone breathe
according to your taste ecologically and
cost-effectively
three fundamental factors in perfect
equilibrium like the members of a jazz
trio who are perfectly in tune

I travel a lot I I think I was out of
town 200 days last year I take a lot of
short trips I never want to check bags I
never want to wait that the carousel I
try as much as possible as I know a lot
of people do to travel just with carry
on carry on just wasn't good enough the
bag was impossible you couldn't walk
with the bag over anything other than
just a perfectly flat surface and the
world is not perfectly flat we all
travel as commuters we travel more often
on shorter trips like many others I
realized that something was missing a
new type of traveler was evolving this
new traveler was not being taken care of
by any part of the industry this is
where Jo comes in
the first thing I realized was that we
would need a large diameter wheel to
meet the needs of today's commuters and
travelers
what are big wheels good for for one
they put the center of gravity closer to
the rotation axis and that makes the bag
feel dramatically lighter these large
axis wheels strengthen the sides of the
bag and they're so slim that they won't
take any additional space from the
interior of the bag and they run over
everything after endless hours of
drawing and modeling
I finally got my dream wheel a
game-changing technology the wheel was
done but the bag wasn't quite there yet
more winning features needed to be added
to make 0 the best possible bag for
commuters we gathered a talented team of
designers and together we begun to
develop and design more and more
features that have made 0 even more
durable economic and functional we began
work on a carrion companion that would
meet international airline standards we
design different compartments one to
hold your personal items and one to keep
your work items like your 15-inch laptop
and an easy access pocket for carry-on
liquids we developed a very long strong
economic handle instead of weighing
every bag down with features someone
might not need we developed an optional
electronic module it includes a
proximity detector location tracker 2
USB ports international power outlet for
your laptop and a battery strong enough
to charge your smartphone up to 10 times
step-by-step we created our dream bag a
bag that's unbelievably maneuverable and
tough without added weight a bag with
all-terrain wheels and features to help
you comfortably get to where you're
going regardless of where that is
this is the first really disruptive bag
that has come to market in 25 years
turning ideas to reality is an expensive
process we've completed the design and
have sourced the manufacturers and we
are ready to make the toolings and go to
production in order to bring 0-2
commuters and travelers around the world
we need your support to produce zero at
an industrial scale
