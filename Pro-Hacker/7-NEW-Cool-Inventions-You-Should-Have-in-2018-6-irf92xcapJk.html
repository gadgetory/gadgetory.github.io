but this small device solves some very
large problems we live in a time where
everything you do online is monitored
tracked or censored just because you
don't have anything to hide doesn't mean
you don't deserve privacy finding a way
to stay private and secure is not such
an easy task services are fragmented and
none provide coverage on multiple
devices making it a hassle to stay
protected we created filter in order to
make privacy and security more
accessible and easier to use filter
provides VPN support ad blocking
capability and Tor anonymity and all the
devices in your home this is especially
important for devices that don't
normally support these applications like
gaming consoles Smart TVs and media
players those who not only protects you
from unwanted ad targeting but to
prevents companies government's and
internet providers from seeing more
personal information like your web
activity searches and even physical
location in VPN mode filter uses
enterprise grade encryption to protect
all the devices in your home
simultaneously this level of security
keeps all incoming and outgoing web
traffic private VPN mode also allows
access to geo restricted content or
censorship simply by switching regions
within the app filters app is incredibly
easy to use
select the VPN setting the region you'd
like to connect to or automatic for the
Speedy's connection you can switch
between VPN mode and tor or configure
more advanced settings
folds are also just a job of blocking
advertisements dangers websites trackers
and malware infected advertising is a
huge threat and annoyance with filter
you'll never have to see my let's just
add again to stay ahead of threats all
security features and lists are kept
up-to-date automatically you can choose
what you want to have updated or turn
this off at any time filter has a lot of
capabilities but setup couldn't be
easier on all of your network traffic
through filters simply by connecting it
between any modem and router filter will
start working automatically and can be
configured within the app filter can be
used as a regular router which you can
connect your devices to via Wi-Fi or
Ethernet filter is ultra portable and
can even be powered off an external
battery even if you're in a public area
you don't have to worry about staying
secure and finding power we have a great
idea

yours again
in your pocket is one of the most
revolutionary cameras ever made but how
do you turn amateur footage into a
cinematic masterpiece the answer is
movement introducing in motion it's a
fully automatic slider that lets you do
hollywood-style camera moves at the push
of a button it has custom modes for any
situation
and it works with all smartphones GoPros
and mirrorless cameras it comes with 15
inch rails that can be extended to
double the sun's yet it easily breaks
down to fit in your bag using an
integrated panning mechanism it
automatically creates a parallax
movement as it slides it's great for
products us interviews or anytime you
want a cinematic look reverse the camera
and the parallax becomes a panning slide
giving you a 36 degree wider viewing
angle than regular sliders for vloggers
in motion lets you forget about the
camera and focus on your content using
our motion tracking algorithms face
following intelligently keeps you in
frame as you move around and with the
live streaming inside the app building a
following is easier than ever before for
photographers in motion lets you create
motion time lapses right on your phone
just to customize your settings in the
app and hit start
the motion unit can also be removed for
flawless panoramic shots or panning
time-lapses for night shots time lapses
captured more light and maximize your
video quality after this you select one
of the many precent links then via cloud
computing your files will be color
graded automatically for action sports
there's motion trigger using two
Bluetooth sensors you can set up a
trigger for subjects that are up to 30
feet away when activated in motion can
start recording immediately or give you
some lead time for a smoother transition
in motion was built five filmmakers for
filmmakers you can build a full rig
thanks to its three-quarter inch
mounting points and it even has a
built-in USB fast charging port in the
app you have full control of the camera
and slider to create the exact look you
want from a slow track that reveals a
key plot detail to slow cushions for
dramatic effect in motion gives you a
cinematic shot every time hiking
standard I am suave ik and my team and I
need your support to bring in motion to
the market we're a diverse team with

guessing on a confusing software with
its hand whole teaching feature
you can input coordinates in the fastest
and most intuitive way
do bottom one is programmable via the
integrated api's you can use official or
self built developing environment or use
this visualized programming interface
making things a lot easier but we don't
stop here do bot m1 is highly extendable
there are no limits to your imagination
on it the maximum reach of do bottom one
is 400 millimeters which is enough for
most of the situations but why don't we
think bigger

left off the portable affordable and fun
drone you finally deserve thanks for
watching over the past few years the
smartphone has become the single most
important communication device that we
use on a daily basis no matter where we
are we need it to stay in contact with
those around us
however smartphones are entirely
dependent on a communication
infrastructure that they use what
happens when this infrastructure becomes
unreliable or
is non-existent for instance when we are
out in the wild traveling abroad when
there are too many users congesting the
network or when a natural disaster
knocks down existing cellular towers
that's why we created this sonic a
wireless communication of ice that
enables your smartphone to send the
instant messages voice recordings image
data and GPS locations even when there
is no internet access or cellular
coverage how does it work
simply connect your smartphone to the
Wi-Fi access point on the sonnet and it
will transmit the data sent from your
phone to other sonnet users via
long-range radio frequency no cellular
data no satellite service and no monthly
subscription the typical range for
point-to-point communication with the
sonnet is approximately five kilometres
for three miles
it also supports mesh networking that
can dramatically increase its effective
range by securely relaying data through
other SONET devices in the area
the sonnet is designed specifically for
use in the outdoors it is rated ip66
meaning that it's dust tight and water
resistant the sonnet is powered by a
four thousand milliamp hour battery that
allows you to use it continuously for up
to 24 hours as a built-in USB port so
that you can even charge your phone with
it on the software side is the sonnet
app an intuitive instant messenger that
draws upon the familiar user experience
in addition the sonnet app comes with
useful features such as offline maps and
real-time location sharing so that you
always know where you are in relation to
your friends in the case of an emergency
the sonnet app has a panic button which
will activate the SOS mode broadcasting
your distress call and your current GPS
location to any sonnet users in range
we've been developing the sonnet for
over a year now and we are super excited
but as possibilities our prototypes are
now complete
and we're ready to move in a full
production that's where you come in
we're looking for your support to bring
this form of decentralized communication
into the mainstream
the sana is just the beginning and we're
so grateful for you to be a part of it
thank you for your help
you
