the best experiences life has to offer
but arriving at your destination without
getting enough sleep can be the absolute
worst finding a comfortable enough
position to sleep in can be a challenge
and some travel pillows on the market
just don't do the trick some of them can
be cumbersome others are simply
impractical and well yeah hi I'm Matt
Benedetto and I'm the inventor of the
voyage pillow after spending the past
year in development I am proud to
introduce the voyage pillow as the most
compact versatile and comfortable travel
pillow for your next trip adventure or
daily commute
my unique pillow design combines a micro
bead pillow with a multi-purpose poly
spandex band for amazing comfort and
versatility most travel pillows are made
for sleeping in one particular position
but the voyage pillow allows you to
customize the way you sleep you can use
it over your eyes around your neck
against the window around your hand the
possibilities are endless
Plus never worry about the pillow
falling out of place when you shift
positions or are on the move the voyage
pillows incredibly compact size will
save you precious space neither your
carry-on or check bags compared to a
traditional travel pillow focus on
packing the things you'll need to make
your trip memorable simply grab and go
the poly spandex fabric allows for just
the right amount of stretch for a
comfortable fit for all sizes the
interior features a smooth plush fabric
for a soft touch and feel when sleeping
finally thousands of microbeads adjust
perfectly to your unique sleeping
position and snap right back into place
choose your favorite color way from
midnight black sunrise red or ocean blue
getting the sleep I deserve is no longer
a dream even though flying on a private
plane might be
17:33 was doing at that time almost
marina baby number 52 the departure of
your area once again all customers
should be gate number 15 to the part of
your aircraft barn we're all fine we're
home
the dream light is a complete redesign
over the sleep mask can be
through careful control of light and
sound we aim to bring a more restful
sleep to aid sleep internal lights lead
you to doctor developed breathing
exercises melatonin regulating green
light slowly wakes you like an alarm
a pouch makes the dream light travel
friendly it can be charged like your
cell phone by calculating when to wake
you the dream light works to minimize
jet lag so you arrive rested and through
genetic testing companies the dream
light app provides the information you
need to maximize your sleep sleep aiding
white noise can be played to dream light
speakers and once asleep the dream light
records sleep quality through a sensor
embedded in the mosque it also employs
infrared light a popular wrinkle

people across the world we need your
support to make the dream light a
reality</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
