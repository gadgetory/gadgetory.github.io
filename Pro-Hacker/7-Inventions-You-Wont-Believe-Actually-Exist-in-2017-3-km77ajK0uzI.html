at Planet computers we are passionate
about typing writing being productive
creating on-the-go since the
introduction of touchscreen mobile
phones and tablets we feel that it is
very difficult to type on these types of
devices we decided to reinvent the palm
sized keyboard mobile device that will
benefit many who miss using the keyboard
on the move from ryoga's and creatives
that need to constantly write
professionals who need to read and write
email create and edit documents and
spreadsheets hi I'm Martin really fit
I'm a founder of the air 4 which is a
london-based design consultancy and we
in the past have made a reputation from
designing a lot of handheld electronic
equipments including scion PDAs PDAs are
personal digital assistants bizarrely
they've sort of dropped out of fashion
we have always been strong proponents
for this kind of device we feel it's
time to bring it to the market again
because so many people they say why
isn't there a product like this now
Planet computers introduces the Gemini a
modern clamshell based mobile device
with a palm-sized keyboard
fully integrated into the device its
sleep metal clamshell design both
protects the device and beautifully
tucks away the palm-sized QWERTY
keyboard and screen when closed
it fits into a pocket roughly the same
as today's mobile phone when open the
innovative clamshell also acts as a
support of the device the ultra wide 5.7
inch high-res touchscreen provides ample
space for creating on the go the full
tactile keyboard is recognized as the
world's smallest keyboard for finger
touch typing Gemini has a powerful 10
core processor a graphics coprocessor
and 64 gigabytes of storage it is fully
equipped with 4G Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
enabling both data communications and
mobile phone use it is designed to run
the latest Android OS and all your
favorite apps as well as Linux with a
dual boot option all below 400 grams of
weight the double sized battery provides
two weeks standby and 12 hours talktime
Gemini allows you to work in restricted
spaces comfortably on planes on trains
in coffee bars you can also hold the
device and use it with ease whilst in
the car standing up or on the bus I hope
you're interested in what we're trying
to do we think it's going to be a great
device thanks for watching please
support us amigo go

amanda is a maker a practitioner of tech
wizardry
and DIY magic and this maker just got a
new magic wand this is the new optimist
the optimist is a modular three-in-one
machine that includes a 3d printer a
laser and CNC mill it assembles into two
configurations and creates finished
products this machine can make anything
except waffles so we designed the
Optimus for people like Amanda she's
full cool ideas and wants to create
something new the way that it's been
though if you wanted to start making
you'd have to strike a deal with the
devil to finance a lot of machines and a
huge space to use them and unless you're
Tony Stark this situation is about as
convenient as a harpoon to the face not
convenient at all so we changed that and
created one flexible machine with three
essential tools that fits on your
desktop
this machine was forged in our small
team of makers engineers and designers
and we're driven by this idea that
making could be more fun easy and just a
better experience overall
so with that thinking we made the
Optimus simple to operate anything and
along with this machine we've created an
app to control it and also a simplified
3d design program so a man that can
start making fast while it's easy to use
this machine was built for professionals
who require top grade tools this is what
we're all about and with quality in mind
we built the Optimus with all metal
parts this ensures that it's going to be
reliable sturdy and that it could bring
your ideas to life year after year
the modular design enables the whole rig
to quickly transform back and forth in
just a few minutes and the modular
design means it's easy to manufacture
and transport and because you don't need
to buy three separate machines you'll
save money then maybe you can buy that
waffle maker too
we know firsthand about the excitement
of holding your own designs so while
others may not get while you make Tinker
or cosplay we do and we want to help you
make more stuff now you can bring the
optimist into full production we have
successfully built and tested 20
machines now the optimist is ready back
us and get your own three-in-one makers
dream machine or check out our Awards
made with the Optimus back the Optimus

while working on my PhD I realize that
sixty-second could change the world
that's because it only takes 60 second
of UV LED light to kill the germs that
have plagued humankind since the
beginning of time just 60 seconds under
developed immune systems are unable to
fight off deadly germs and viruses which
is why there is le the world's first
portable medical grade sterilizer just
place your baby's bottle pacifier or
teething ring into Ellie and in 60
seconds its germ-free UV light
particularly UVB particular type of UV
kills all sorts of germs including
viruses bacteria and fungi by damaging
their DNA or RNA Ellie runs on a
rechargeable battery and it's very
compact so you can take it anywhere and
while it's grateful bottles and binkies
le consider eyes anything that fits into
the chamber including water for mixing
formula small toys or even breast pump
accessories just put it into the Le and
in 60 seconds it's safe to use Ellie's
true violet UV digital technology kills
germs and viruses at the core by
breaking their DNA strand including
antibiotic-resistant superbugs
we clearly do need to have available
portable devices for when we're carrying
around food or other items such as baby
bottles or other types of things that
might become contaminated and
particularly with their more vulnerable
populations such as a very young child
true violet technology also has many
promising applications that address
global concerns such as air and water
sterilization especially in areas
without centralized water supply or
electricity and sixty seconds is all it
takes
thank you for your time
until now creating a stunning music
synchronized light show was difficult
and expensive current high-end options
could cost you up to thousands of
dollars in lighting gear and countless
hours learning and programming complex
DMX controllers mainstream budget
options includes sound activated LED
controllers with boring displays and
erratic flashing to random sounds we
didn't like any of these options so we
built our own the VV music LED
controller syncs to your music in real
time separating it into three ranges and
outputs them to addressable LEDs for a
stunning light show control your
experience through the mobile app and
choose from dozens of animations and
color options to make your own unique
performance hi I'm Matt and I'm Rajeev
we're a team of technology and music
enthusiasts who have seen firsthand how
light shows can set the mood and
complement the rhythm of music in any
environment our desire to recreate these
experiences pushed us to develop
unprecedented music reactive technology
that allows everyone to bring music to
light
we have completed development now we
need your help to get to the next stage
your pledges will help us get our first
run of production complete and help us
change LED lighting forever
please share with your friends and thank
you for your support
