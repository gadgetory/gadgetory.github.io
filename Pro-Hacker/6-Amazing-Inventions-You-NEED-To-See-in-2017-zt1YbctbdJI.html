talented team of developers and
engineers researching planning and
designing the ultimate product that will

we had a very complex engineering
challenge because we didn't want to
sacrifice size and convenience just

to say that we made it we managed to

reality for you be part of this amazing
journey back up and get I
this thing's cool have you had those
tables for your attic hi i'm derek from
promotion it's hard to capture smooth
video using your smartphone we've all
been there
the camera is so good that you can make
a Hollywood movies listing but your
phone is almost impossible to hold study
and that's why we have the vote for
motion one the world's most versatile
smartphone stabilizer developed by
engineers NASA it was made for everyone

you're not and enables you to capture
smooth cinematic videos and your smart

hold it together and fit it in your
pocket and one work even without the
grip allowing you to attach it to any
camera and go for Mountain
with the power of your smartphone one
becomes a lot more than just a
stabilizer in the promotion app we built
in advanced tracking technology which

how could you be a father if your last
name is Vader and his wife Mona
Skywalker oh hi this is no go ahead
mount display with image quality that
doesn't suck like other head mount
displays mogul turns your phone into a
big screen but unlike other head mount
display Mogo doesn't lose pixels the
magic of bogo is in the lenses they were
created by this guy Arthur Sze the
lenses of other head mount displays can
only see half the screen so the devices
cut the size of the original screen in
half then puts an even smaller image
side-by-side that allows you to watch 3d
movies but also creates pixelation so
even if you have a 2k phone you'll only
see 1/5 of the pixel and that's less
than HD I already with Mogo Arthur
created these special lenses each covers
the whole screen thus maintaining the
full quality if you used other head
mount devices you might have noticed
that your Isaac you can get dizzy and
sometimes even nauseous that's because
their lenses need to be perfectly
aligned and adjusted to the distance
between your eyes moguls lenses don't
need any adjusting so you can watch a
full-length movie without any side
effects and I feel so
logo has a lot of other advantages
unlike other devices mochou allows you
to see your peripheral environment so
you don't look like an idiot
to use muggles just put your phone in
that's it and Danny phones in and
there's also a foldable version logo
fits perfectly even with glasses and if
you want to pause the rewind just use
your finger mmm that's good rewinding oh
and as for drones you know when you use
them to shoot fancy high-resolution
video wouldn't you want to see the full
resolution of what you're shooting yeah
GameChanger what is that well that's a
man drowning we should call for help
logo also has an app that shows your
actual drone location on your phone
screen even when the drone is out of
sight now that's out of sight so if you
two want to watch contents in the best
quality or phone offers get mogul
it sucks when we need our phone the most
and it runs out of juice this is
preserved the world's most
energy-efficient mobile phone charger
and power bank combined the way it works

cable to preserve when charging once

electricity stops going to the phone and
starts preserving the energy in the
power bank magic preserve is not just a
power bank but also has a removable
battery that fits nicely into any wallet
