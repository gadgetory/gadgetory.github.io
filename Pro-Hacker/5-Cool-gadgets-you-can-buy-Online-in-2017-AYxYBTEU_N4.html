the pact one is designed to be the
ultimate travel bag for those that know
the benefits of traveling light and
avoiding airline headaches the design
combines the casual versatility of a
duffel with the organization of a
suitcase
the jet-setting sidekick features a dual
compartment design that allows you to
easily pack and neatly organize your
belongings each side has a zip around
divider to keep things in place one side
is mesh while the other is quilted with
a computer pocket there are top access
at bers to get to the contents of each
side quickly without opening the entire
bag the padded laptop pocket is located
in the centre so your bag remains well
balanced and your clothing adds further
protection from bumps quickly access
your laptop from the top zipper and
remove it for security there are four
mesh pockets to hold the included
laundry and tote bag as well as your
chargers vitamins or any other small
item the interior zipper pockets on each
side are a great place to tuck receipts
or personal items you want to stash out
of sight and we're out of the way once
you've got everything packed zip up your
well-organized bag like a suitcase on
the front of the bag there are two
zippered pockets to stow away things you
want to easily access while on the go on
the back there's a magazine pocket in
the newly added TSA pocket rather than
using the plastic bins to pass your
personal items through security simply
pull out the mesh TSA pocket and stow
them away once through security rather
than join the scramble of travelers
collecting their different belongings
simply grab your bag and head to a
comfortable spot to reorganize the red
label serves as a reminder to grab your
laptop or anything else that you had to
send through the x-ray separately we
also added several accessory loops on
the outside of the bag to clip your
water bottle or other travel items these
will also serve as attachment points for
future accessories from packed true to
our ethos and approach to design you
won't find any logos on the exterior of
the bag and those are the ins and outs
of the pack
pack it like a suitcase carry it like a
duffel and stash it in the last
remaining overhead space hi I'm Ryan and
I'm Elias we are part of the team behind
sonic soak sonic soak is a smartphone
sized device that uses ultrasound
technology to clean almost anything in
ways never before possible it clings to
the microscopic level beyond what any
laundry machine or cleaning spray can do
the inspiration for this device came
from the fact that we were frequent
travelers and cleaning our clothes while
on the go was always a hassle so we had
to set out to find a good solution it's
also quiet
and can be used to clean more than
clothes it can clean glasses jewelry
fruits razors baby bottles the products
that are tough to clean using sponges or
rags or your hands or soap and water
I think they get the idea is okay I just
want to be clear this is the best way to
clean pretty much anything sonic soak
works by generating ultrasonic sound
waves that create microscopic high
pressure bubbles to wash away dirt grime
and oils we had no idea at the time that
we'd come up with was a device that had
so many benefits outside of travelers
wanting an easy way to wash clothes
while on the go it's also simple to use
you simply place it water add some soap
turn on the built-in timer and walk away
minutes later your clothes are cleaner
than ever before
sonic Stoke is designed for travelers
moms neat freaks looking for a thorough
cleanse and not just on clothes by the
way but on fruits and vegetables to
folks with small loads of laundry
fashionistas that eat a better solution
for their gentle cycle or hand wash only
clothes folks that don't have the space
for a full sized laundry machine really
it's for anyone who wants a cleaner will
almost anything because sonic soak is
more than a great way to clean your
laundry it can clean just about anything
you can stick in the water with it so if
you like things clean free from all
those nasty things you can only see up
close
sonic soak is your solution sonic soap
is ready to be shipped just after our
campaign ends we just need you to help
make it happen which means you can have
a cleaner almost anything and
practically no time once we end this
campaign successfully so please help us
bring sonic soap to mass production and
experience clean like never before now

wherever you go
