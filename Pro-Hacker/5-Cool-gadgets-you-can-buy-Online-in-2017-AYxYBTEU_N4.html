comfortable spot to reorganize the red

send through the x-ray separately we
also added several accessory loops on
the outside of the bag to clip your

will also serve as attachment points for
future accessories from packed true to

won't find any logos on the exterior of
the bag and those are the ins and outs

duffel and stash it in the last
remaining overhead space hi I'm Ryan and
I'm Elias we are part of the team behind
sonic soak sonic soak is a smartphone
sized device that uses ultrasound
technology to clean almost anything in
ways never before possible it clings to
the microscopic level beyond what any
laundry machine or cleaning spray can do
the inspiration for this device came
from the fact that we were frequent
travelers and cleaning our clothes while
on the go was always a hassle so we had
to set out to find a good solution it's
also quiet
and can be used to clean more than
clothes it can clean glasses jewelry
fruits razors baby bottles the products
that are tough to clean using sponges or
rags or your hands or soap and water
I think they get the idea is okay I just
want to be clear this is the best way to
clean pretty much anything sonic soak
works by generating ultrasonic sound
waves that create microscopic high
pressure bubbles to wash away dirt grime
and oils we had no idea at the time that
we'd come up with was a device that had
so many benefits outside of travelers
wanting an easy way to wash clothes
while on the go it's also simple to use
you simply place it water add some soap
turn on the built-in timer and walk away
minutes later your clothes are cleaner
than ever before
sonic Stoke is designed for travelers
moms neat freaks looking for a thorough
cleanse and not just on clothes by the
way but on fruits and vegetables to
folks with small loads of laundry
fashionistas that eat a better solution
for their gentle cycle or hand wash only
clothes folks that don't have the space
for a full sized laundry machine really
it's for anyone who wants a cleaner will
almost anything because sonic soak is
more than a great way to clean your
laundry it can clean just about anything
you can stick in the water with it so if
you like things clean free from all
those nasty things you can only see up
close
sonic soak is your solution sonic soap
is ready to be shipped just after our
campaign ends we just need you to help
