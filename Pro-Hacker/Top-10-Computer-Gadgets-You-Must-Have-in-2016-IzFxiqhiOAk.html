we are
specialized after college we have been
doing this for over 10 years is my
pleasure to introduce the laser rotation
Mauston is a beaut prada under our own
brain odin's God warned ornithology when
all the apprenticeship is beer in his
head flashes of lightning strike the
land of mankind we cast aside our
existing appearance and limitations of a
traditional computer mouse and design
the world's first laser projection mouse
the cutting edge OD detects reflection
signals with infrared sensors instead of
traditional cameras so they're holding
have a higher resolution this makes our
laser projection mode suitable for
designers office workers or video gamers
Odin the honey breaks through
traditional limitations by small so
lightweight and can be useful
just plug it in and you'll be able to
use all the Engler 89 this name that

penis welcome to our only
thus for point Z is the world's first
Gaming Mouse that lets you pivot tilt
and roll while most mice live in the
level playing field of the x and y plane
this mouse
it's you left off under the z axis we've
also invented a brand new way of
clicking buttons it means you can access
dozens of different pattern actions
while barely moving your fingers and a Z
even knows how hard you click or tactile
feedback we built in an accelerometer
gyroscope linear actuator and pressure
sensors to unleash what we think will be
the biggest leap forward in Mouse
technology since it was first invented
50 years ago whether you're a gamer and
design or even a powered desktop user
the Z will let you interact with your
computer in a faster more precise and
highly intuitive way the Z is the first
Gaming Mouse that lets you pivot tilt
and roll it knows when it's on the table
and when it's in the air bringing a
whole new dimension of control to the
mouse with the mouse on the surface you
can tilt left and right for fast mode
changes without using your fingers you
can assign any action to tilt like
leaning crouching or reloading or use it
as a modifier key on the mouse buttons
and keyboard without actually having to
press a key when playing a game that
involves driving use tilt to take to
Rick analog control of the steering
wheel we've designed adjustable
replaceable feet that can make the tilt
easier or harder or set a large or small
tilt angle or you can lock out tilt
altogether the Z also knows when the
mouse is pivoting left or right this
gives you a huge competitive advantage
and many first or third person shooters
you can run straight ahead and at the
same time look left and right with
analog control
the same way as you would with a VR
headset it provides tactile feedback so
you know when you're facing forward or
looking to the side just like tilt you
can assign any action or modify to a
pivot everything is configurable for in
the ear gestures lift the mouse off the
surface now you have to wreck analog
control of pitch roll and yaw use this
for the ultimate control in flight Sims
or for direct camera controllers
spectator mode many mice pack in
additional buttons around the thumb grip
and all over the device but we figured
out a new way of clicking that means you
can have more buttons and they are
effortless to click no finger or thumb
contortions required we've created
something we call straight finger
clicking and our test users just love it
the Z has a new type of trigger button
that can be used by simply straightening
your fingers slightly and then clicking
all while you're still gripping the
mouse is normal with your fingers poised
on the main left and right click buttons
they are so easy to click that you can
use them for actions you do often like
reloading jumping or crouching we call
them trigger buttons because you can
actually pull them like a trigger as
well these two buttons are in effect
four buttons
we've also added adjustable fingertip
buttons that can be accessed with very
little finger movement
combined pivot and tilt with trigger and
fingertip buttons to effortlessly access
48 single click actions while barely
moving your fingers needless to say the
Z makes the ultimate in M own Mouse in a
game like World of Warcraft you can also
use - left or right to easily switch
between action bars and access different
skills the trigger buttons and fingertip
button positions are all tunable and the
Z even knows how hard you click we call
it deep click you can figure the amount
of force that suits you and the Z gives
you tactile feedback and that you know
it's activated you can also use deep
click in an analog mode to have direct
throttle control or speed when driving
flying or running in a first-person
shooter right click to bring up your
scope click deeper to zoom in then
deeper again to hold your breath and
steady your sights
now take the shot for games that have
light and heavy attacks use normal clip
for a light attack or click harder to
launch a heavy attack and we didn't stop
there
we also wanted to make the most organ on
the multifunctional Mouse in the world
we know that gamers don't want to worry
about batteries or wireless reliability
and latency so while we made it wired
we also eliminated the issue of cable
drag by building a brushed aluminum cube
into the mouse mat for perfect
positioning of the cord right off the
desk surface we wanted to make the Z the
easiest Mouse to configure we added an
OLED screen and as the Z knows its
orientation lifting it to look at the
screen automatically puts it into
configure mode to swiftly change
profiles or DPI we trialed hundreds of
prototypes to reach what we believe is
the best shape Mouse ever built the main
clip buttons have been flattened so that
when you click you are opposing the disk
surface with no chance of imagining the
mouse
and we've balanced the mouse so that
when you lift it the weight is evenly
distributed between your thumb ring and
little finger we've integrated the
latest state-of-the-art gaming sensor
the Pixar pmw 30 360 from 200 CPI to
12,000 CPI and max acceleration of 50g
and of course we have the glowing RGB
LED two years ago we launched the GT
mobile mouse on Kickstarter but thanks
to the amazing support from the
Kickstarter community we were able to
bring this revolutionary device to life
two years later the design of the Z is
now complete and the result has far
exceeded our expectations we are ready
for tooling and production and now we
just need your help to kick it off
everyday user testers come up with
radical new ways to use the Z we hope
you will join us on this journey I
wanted a good keyboard and there weren't
any out there I figured well how hard
could this be
and then we built the best keyboard we
possibly could it's not what you'd
expect from a keyboard but people love
it
creating a keyboard is kind of a weird
thing it's been in the obsession
hi I'm Jesse Vincent I'm co-founder and
CTO of keyboard EO I'm kaya Dekker I'm
the CEO of keyboard EO I'm also married
to Jesse
most people are typing eight plus hours
a day on uncomfortable flat plastic
boxes that are pretty much the same as
they were a hundred years ago you
deserve something better in a musician's
not like well just take the plastic
guitar off the shelf and it'll be fine
when I'm sticking my entire career and
my you know my professional everything
on this like they're really thinking
about it I found a bunch of research but
better keyboard layouts higher hands
work and what actually matters in
keyboard design and every keyboard
design in the last 20 years is flat-out
ignored it so we built a good keyboard
the model one is different it takes some
getting used to but it's worth it the
model one is that great sort of tool
that supports the way you want to work
and that gets out of the way unless you
do the kind of work that you couldn't
have done without it and I love the way
my fingertips kind of rest in the keys
and that's easy the keys are to reach
we're trying to build a keyboard you'll
enjoy using for years we have this
gorgeous maple wood enclosure you've
sculpted the key caps to guide your
fingers to the right keys and yeah it
lights up the LEDs that glow from under
each key are actually totally
customizable and programmable for
regionally the butterfly shape was an
accident but we love it it feels warm it
feels friendly I bring the key part out
in public and people look at it and say
can I touch it it's a keyboard you're
supposed to touch it that's the whole
point
up till now we've been designing and
designing and designing and testing and
testing and testing we've made dozens of
prototypes before we liked one enough to
call it the model one and now we're
going to make a few thousand
I spent most of my career building open
source software it was important to us
that we build an amazing product that
wasn't going to be locked down most
products get worse over time
open products get better because it's
open source hardware I know that I can
customize it to my needs and then share
those customizations with the community
you're gonna get firmware source code
you're going to get schematics of
electronics you're gonna get a
screwdriver even if you never touch a
line of code plenty of other type of
swill and their work will make your
keyboard better this is a tool that I
can use over the next 20 years of my
career because it's going to grow with
me and so now it's possible for us to
come to all of you and share with you
what we're making thank you for paying
attention it means a lot to us
