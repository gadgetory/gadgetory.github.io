no antennas no waiting and no hassles we
developed the Luna because we knew there
was a better solution than relying on
software to turn an iPad into a second
display software apps literally hack
your graphics card delivering a glitchy
and unreliable picture they trick your
Mac into thinking and displays attached
when in fact they get no benefit of
graphics acceleration or metal GPU
support
so unlike software apps oona harnesses
the raw power of your graphics card
giving you the full benefit of its
graphics acceleration delivering
stunning second monitor that's 100
percent wire free in addition to acting
as a second display Luna also acts as a
complete extension near Mac allowing you
to use it directly from your iPad with
full support using external keyboards
Apple pencil and Apple touch
interactions it literally allows you to
turn your math book or iMac into a
touchable device designed and developed
by the creators of Astra pad the
award-winning drawing app used by major
animation studios and product design
firms across the globe Luna carries the
same quality and performance that's been
delivered to their tens of thousands of
customers and for those of you who are
artists you compare Luna and Astro pad

finally a gaming mouse that puts full
control in the palm of your hand
LexA is a mouse specifically designed
for gamers of all levels so whether you
play in professional gaming tournaments
or you're just a weekend gamer lexif is
designed to be a versatile Mouse for
gamers everywhere Oh awesome the mouse
is super smooth and this is something a
lot of companies can't get the LexA
plows easily allows you to perform
complex tasks and multiple dimensions
with increased precision usually you'd
have to stop in order to switch through
your items in your inventory but when
you're using the joystick you can just
simply just scroll through your items so
it does genuinely give you an advantage
when you're playing your game like
Minecraft lexif provides six degrees of
freedom via two joysticks and one laser
glide sensor it works by tilting forward
backward and side-to-side the mouse
moves with your hand and it goes with it
that's a very big plus this mouse but
actually here a competitive advantage in
gameplay the laser sensor lets the user
control the mechanical gliding at very
high speeds while maintaining the best
accuracy the tilting allows you to have
more three-dimensional movement all
within the mouse itself so you can
combine multiple movements into your
Mouse seamlessly it has a joystick on
the side so if I'm playing and I want to
zoom in to shoot someone it
automatically goes into the zoom mode I
don't have to like double-click on the
mouse I'm kind of shot out are they
gonna give you I doubt that lexif safe
is designed in a way that buttons are
very accessible while still providing a
solid feeling the sides are covered in
the finest rubber enabling a strong grip
when needed that's comfortable it's
smooth I wasn't ready for it the lexif
gaming mouse also provides a separate
model specifically designed for
left-handed gamers what truly sets the
Lexx it mouse apart from its competitors
is it's conveniently positioned joystick
on the side of the mouse along with its
internal mechanical two axis joystick
which allows users to operate the mouse
to tilt or to use as a joystick offering
two options in one this mini joystick
features mechanical feedback forces that
only regular-sized joysticks used to
offer making
this the first of its kind the joystick
allows me to go through the entire map
which is actually really cool I mean
it's great it's gonna make a massive
difference in big games well yeah you
can use the joystick movement over here
lexis control panel allows you to
customize and configure the settings
specific to what you're comfortable with
providing you with various shortcuts and
once you configure the settings you
won't need to configure them again our
goal is to bring the lexa mouse to
gamers everywhere but we need your help
please support our campaign so that you
too can take advantage of the innovative
features our gaming mouse will offer you
elevate your gameplay with less
yeah
