and strong thanks to its conception and
high-quality materials we've also been
working with the designer Eric virtus
and his design agency in Paris to make
this wallet aesthetically beautiful and
practical in its use

best input device that was 2007 this is
2015 in 2015 we love our touchscreens we
take them everywhere we go and why

shaped objects and it also makes taking
measurements with one hand much easier

hello Andy go go my name is Peter
Treadway and I am CTO and co-founder at
Acton Acton is a company that designs
and manufactures personal transportation
we are introducing a longboard the likes
of which the world has never seen
carbon fiber pressure cast aluminum
extruded aluminum CNC cut we are using
for hub motors all wheel drive people
all wheel drive the one that will get
you up
most of the steepest hills in America
and around the world
but wait there's more if you're looking
for something a little more affordable
we got you we have two more models what
we call the blink s and the bleep s -
it's a different construction than the
Quattro it's a native wood but it has
aluminum extrusion along the bottom and
the lumen employed on top to kind of
sandwich the batteries inside of the
deck so there's actually a hole that
goes clear through it the s2 version of
this board is a little bit longer than
the s and that's because it has the
extra motor and it goes a little faster
and just needs to be a little longer for
more stability
so you get to choose from three boards
you get the cuatro or the blink s or the
blink s2
now we're releasing three products at
the same time here so of course this is
why we're on IndieGoGo but we have
finished the development on these and we
have of course factory minimums that we
need to meet and that's why we're here
and that's why we need your help help us
out and get yourself onto an active
board and glide uphill into the future
of personal transportation thank you
