supporting our campaign thank you
hi this is ex-fighter ex-fighter can go
where you can't under the desk around
furniture and more ex-fighter is as
powerful as it is beautiful it can be
programmed easily to perform all sorts
of robotic tasks point-and-click it an
object on screen and see ex-fighter
navigate to it automatically we've
open-sourced all of the ex-fighter 3d
models you can easily modify and improve
your X later in 3d print anyone not only
connects phyto reprogram it could also
be trained thanks to the powerful neural
network inside Intel Curie
you can make ex-fighter even cooler at a
hat patent our paint the case
imagination is the limit with ex-fighter
hello everybody
this is Max and very happy to introduce
yourself Singh we have been working on
for the past nine months is powerful and
a beautiful robot is like spider but
before we get into the details we'd like
to show you the team behind the direct
spider and the how it goes the idea to
start with project ex-fighter was
created by the rebel if team the Robo if
team is passionate about making robots
most of the team members came from team
water one of the top college robot teams
in China we won four championships in
RoboCup one of the top robotic
competitions for college students in
November 2015 we got the team back
together to create a robot that is as
beautiful as an anime figure and
deserving to be put on display it also
has to be powerful just like a program
with no competition order for nine
months we worked hard and went through
dozens of designs and hundreds of 3d
printed parts for testing we made
several iterations that spider
we published them on Facebook we got
such a good response that we got invited
to different shows and worms we went
back to refining and improving our ideas
again and again going through more than
26 redesigns 100 manuscripts and over
500 3d models proves our passion and
persistence for robotics and our
ex-fighter project to make it available
for more people we need your help a
crowdfunding campaign has been launched
Go Go
so now you can make pre-order from
website we are so grateful for all the
expert friends that is supported and
they encouraged us thank you all that
has been amazing
our mini cart is the smallest RC car in
the world with propotional steering
it even has working headlights brake
lights and turn signals use your
smartphone to drive this car easy app
controls including tip to stare and
touch swing concludes that let you drive
with a car light position race your
friends or construct an obstacle first
to crack through
my name is Edward and I'm from
California I've always been crazy about
technology and design my name is Nathan
I'm an electrical engineer from Taiwan
and I love intellectual challenges we
co-founded want out with a dream that we
could use technology and design to
connect people we have helped our
customers start their businesses with
creative and competitive products
Dominica is only two inches long this
Bluetooth 4.1 has a 15 meter wrench
comes in three different designs and has
three different sensor packages I looked
all over for a very small very precise
model car and I found a few high-grade
models in Germany Japan but for very
high privacy even then we found that
playability was limited by the available
control as we developed a micro
Bluetooth module for customers we
realize the answer was right in front of
us
Bluetooth 4.1 gives us long range uses
low-power and has nearly unlimited
inputs and outputs please support our
vision so we can bring more
sophisticated technology to micro scale
models thank you
surf the streets of Gotham or shred the
mountains of Metropolis on the
revolutionary surf wheel su an electric
skateboard with technology fit for a
superhero top engineers at CUFI
development spent over two years
researching and developing a unique

assisted stabilization technology that
allows you to step out your front door
and feel the rush of flying down away
we're soaring down the mountain with
advanced gyroscopic sensors that keep
the deck perfectly level under the rider
speed the surf wheel intuitively senses
weight shifts mimicking the experience
of surfing on land the surf wheel su is
equipped with a full-spectrum LED light
enabling you to enter night mode and
show off your every move
ride for over 15 kilometers on a single
charge and extend your ride even further

developed a proprietary technology
capable of accurately discerning RP
signals in your body RP signals are
electrical impulses generated by our
heart when the nervous system tells it
to contract this is the only truly
accurate way to measure a heart beat
traditional wearable technologies track
pulse waves using optical sensors on a
scale of seconds sense tracks are Peaks
every 4 milliseconds making it up to 250
times more precise and 30 percent more
accurate than what's out there now you
can see why sense is the only wearable

years experience working at the largest
corporations in the field of life
sciences fleshes actually Novartis gens
our heart sharpened dawn and poison the
sense team is young motivated and
professional as an example of their
dedication to scientific rigor they
analyzed over 22,000 comprehensive ECG
check ups performed by doctors these
checkups use medical grade equipment
that has been used to take our peak
readings for many decades the sense team
is using this data to build the
algorithms in the sense app sense huh to
bring you a wearable with medical grade

in today's fast-paced world we hardly
have time to get ready in the morning
let alone brew a fresh cup of coffee in
the comfort of our home buying our cup
to go on the way to work or to school
has become a staple of our daily routine
unfortunately instead of enjoying the
unique flavors of our favorite blends
we're often forced to race through our
cups before they cool meet lava clan a
coffee Walmart that is going to reinvent
the coffee experience light portable and
rechargeable lava cleff is a coffee
woman that simply clips to the bottom of
your cup and goes with you wherever your
coffee goes no more racing again it's
time no more cold coffee simply clip and
go it's that simple
existing beverage warmers offer
variations of a flat based heating
element but with the elevated basic
paper cups how does the coffee stay warm
llama clips unique clipping mechanism
adjusts to fit and secure to the bottom
of most paper cups of different brands
and sizes by creating a space for the
base of the cup to sit in the heating
element is always in full contact with
the base of the copy maximizing heat
transfer keeping your coffee warm
designs to suit students and
professionals lava clip uses a standard
USB port to recharge on whichever power
sources most convenient whether that's
your computer at work or an outlet at
home our team of engineers and designers
have spent countless hours developing a
product that isn't just functional but
is also eye-catching among all the
tested prototypes we were finally able
to implement a clipping mechanism that
firmly secures to the bottom of most
paper cups served at coffee shops
without compromising ease-of-use or
design lava clip is equipped with a
world-class heating element that is not
only energy efficient but is also
waterproof
help us make lava clip a reality so we
can all enjoy our cup of coffee one sip
at a time
