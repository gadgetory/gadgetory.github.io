hi this is X Fighter X fighter can go
where you can't under the desk around
furniture and more ex-fighter is
powerful as it is beautiful it can be
programmed easily to perform all sorts
of robotic tasks point and click it an
object on screen and CX fighter navigate
to it automatically we've open sourced
all of the X fighter 3d models you can
easily modify and improve your ex
fighter in 3d print anyone not only
connects fight or reprogram it could
also be trained thanks to the powerful
neural network inside Intel Curie
you can make ex-fighter even cooler at a
hat add an art paint the case
imagination is the limit with ex-fighter
hello everybody this is Max and very
happy to introduce yourself sing we have
been working on for the past nine months
it's powerful and a beautiful robot is
like spider but before we get into the
details we'd like to show you the team
behind the dike spider and the how it
goes to the idea to start with Project X
fighter was created by the relief team
the Robo Eve team is passionate about
making robots most of the team members
came from Team water one of the top
college robot teams in China we won four
championships in RoboCup one of the top
robotic competitions for college
students in November 2015 we got the
team back together to create a robot
that is as beautiful as an anime figure
and deserving to be put on display it
also has to be powerful just like a
program of competition over for nine
months we worked hard and went through
dozens of designs and hundreds of 3d
printed parts for testing we made
several iterations of X fighter and
publish them on facebook we got such a
good response that we got invited to
different shows and worms we went back
to refining and improving our ideas
going through more than 26 redesigns 100
manuscripts and over 500 3d models
Prince our passion and persistence for
robotics and our ex-fighter project to
make it available for more people we
need your help a crowdfunding campaign
has been launched an indiegogo so now
you can make pre-order from website we
are so grateful for all the expander
friends that is supported and encouraged
us thank you all that has been amazing
our mini car is the smallest RC car in
the world with promotional staring it
even has working headlines brake lights
and turn signals use your smartphone to
drive this car easy app controls
including tip to stare and touch swing
includes that let you drive with a car
like position race your friends or
construct an obstacle first to crash
through
you
my name is Edward and I'm from
California I've always been crazy about
technology and design my name is Nathan
I'm an electrical engineer from Taiwan
and I love intellectual challenges we
co-founded want out with a dream that we
could use technology and design to
connect people we have helped our
customers start their businesses with
creative and competitive products
dominica is only two inches long use
bluetooth 4.1 as a 15 meter wrench comes
in three different designs and has three
different sensor packages I looked all
over for a very small very precise model
car and I found a few high-grade models
in Germany Japan but for very high price
even then we found that availability was
limited by the available control as we
developed in micro bluetooth module bar
customers we realize the answer was
right in front of us bluetooth 4.1 gives
us long range uses low power and is
nearly unlimited inputs and outputs
please support our vision so we can
bring more sophisticated technology to
micro scale models thank you
surf the streets of Gotham or shred the
mountains of Metropolis on the
revolutionary surf wheel su an electric
skateboard with technology fit for a
superhero top engineers at CUFI
development spent over two years
researching and developing a unique
patent-pending tire tread along with
assisted stabilization technology that
allows you to step out your front door
and feel the rush of flying down away
we're soaring down a mountain with
advanced gyroscopic sensors that keep
the deck perfectly level under the
writer speed the surf wheel intuitively
senses weight shifts mimicking the
experience of surfing on land the surf
wheel su is equipped with a
full-spectrum LED light enabling you to
enter night mode and show off your every
move ride for over 15 kilometers on a
single charge and extend your ride even
further with the support of a
replaceable battery the surf wheel gives
you the ability to explore your city
exercise and enjoy yourself in
superhuman ways so please give yourself
the gift of flight and supporting the
international team of engineers at goofy
development to continue to make
transportation more fun and exciting
with the surf wheel su meets sense a
revolutionary wearable capable of giving
us more insight into our bodies and
minds than we ever thought possible
sense is the next step in the evolution
of bodily and social awareness just put
it on and let it be your guide to
physical and emotional nirvana imagine

most accurate bio tracking smart
bracelet ever the sense team has
developed a proprietary technology
capable of accurately discerning our
peak signals in your body our peak
signals are electrical impulses
generated by our heart when the nervous
system tells it to contract this is the
only truly accurate way to measure a
heartbeat traditional wearable
technologies track pulse waves using
optical sensors on a scale of seconds
sense tracks are peaks every four
milliseconds making it up to 250 times
more precise and thirty percent more
accurate than what's out there now you
can see why sense is the only wearable

years experience working at the largest
corporations in the field of life
sciences such as activist Novartis Jen's
are mark sharp and dohme and poison the
sense team is young motivated and
professional as an example of their
dedication to scientific rigor they
analyzed over 22,000 comprehensive ECG
checkups performed by doctors these
checkups use medical grade equipment
that has been used to take our peak
readings from many deck
the sense team is using this data to
build the algorithms in the sense app
sense huh to bring you a wearable with
medical grade accuracy so what are you
waiting for support the campaign and
master your body give sense to a loved

your cup and goes with you wherever your
coffee goes no more racing again it's
time no more cold coffee simply clip and
go it's that simple existing beverage
warmers offer variations of a flat based
heating element but with the elevated
basic paper cups how does the coffee
stay warm lava cliffs unique flipping
mechanism adjust to fit and secure to
the bottom of most paper cups of
different brands and sizes by creating a
space for the base of the cup to sit in
the heating element is always in full
contact with the base of the copy
maximizing heat transfer keeping your
coffee warm
designs to suit students and
professionals lava clip uses a standard
USB port to recharge on whichever power
source is most convenient whether that's
your computer at work or an outlet at
home our team of engineers and designers
have spent countless hours developing a
product that isn't just functional but
is also eye-catching among all the
tested prototypes were finally able to
implement a clipping academy that firmly
secures to the bottom of most paper cups
served at coffee shops without
compromising ease of use or design lava
clip is equipped with a world-class
heating elements that is not only
energy-efficient but is also waterproof
help us make lava clip a reality so we
can all enjoy our cup of coffee one sip
at a time
