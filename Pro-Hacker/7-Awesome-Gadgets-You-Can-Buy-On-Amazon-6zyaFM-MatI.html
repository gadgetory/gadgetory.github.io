I think it's amazing how many people had
the same experience with their earbuds
it definitely is you know an earbud
problem you know they're falling out you
can tell people are kind of pushing them
back in or they're uncomfortable they
make your ears tender so we needed to
create a solution in that solution is it
your hooks when you're running you know
outside or when you're working on in the
gym you want something's gonna stay with
you as an active person you want to
achieve that focus where you can push
yourself to a limit that you've never
been before and why be distracted buying
your bud when you don't have to be and
we don't want you to think this is only
for athletes this problem of earbuds
falling out is so common so what we've
created with ear hooks is a universal
attachment that connects to almost all
in-ear circular earbuds that increases
their fit increases their comfort as far
as design goes we really looked at every
piece of ear hook and you can see we've
got a shark fin design on the top here
which we call the tip and this piece is
what dispersed is a lot of the weight of
the actual earbud you see you've got the
elastic tire here which stretches on and
off we did a lot of testing week
relentlessly tweaked and changed the
design we prototyped over 20 different
ear hooks throughout the process the
testing ranged from running cycling
swimming surfing we really tried to do
everything we could to make sure that
these ear hooks could endure and with
every environment that they would ever
see we were very thoughtful in our
design process each step of the way we
have redesigned and we've reproduced and
we've retested it and we know now that
we have a product that is passing all
those tests we have flying colors
the same way athletes push themselves to
be great at what they do
we've pushed ourselves to make your
hooks great at what they do
right now your hooks are something that
not too many people know about but the
people that do know about it have had a
great response we want to share this
product with the world and we can only
do that with your help we're hoping this
will be a collaboration hoping to learn
more about our products from all of you
willing to hear some stories from you
guys and you know really make this a
great product together when you talk
about listening to music it makes you
want to move and with your hooks you
finally can
life it's not made of routines or to-do
lists it's made of moments moments of
surprise of fun in messiness
of impulse and togetherness
of you
and playfulness
of mastery
and tastiness
of joy
and total and complete madness let's
capture these moments
let's capture life introducing the new
Polaroid snap fetch for the moments to
touch your life
the sky
sound of jump
you're gonna fit down fight it and as IQ
got it before
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
