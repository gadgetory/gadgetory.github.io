you need to capture sensational video
footage with the kind of stability
that's never been seen before and all in
glorious 4k detail this is the first
action cam to feature Sony's own
balanced optical steadyshot technology
allowing you to capture incredibly
stable footage even when shooting in 4k
quality with more effectiveness against
high amplitude camera shake from
activities such as running or riding on
a bike you can capture virtually
vibration-free footage in any situation
plus with a smaller body than previous
or K action cam models you'll hardly
even notice it's there the quality of
your footage is improved yet further
thanks to the new Exmor R image sensor
which has been designed and developed
specifically with 4k video in mind with
the same pixel size as the award-winning
a x53 handycam camcorder you can be
confident of maximum image quality in
all light conditions there's also a new
Zeiss Tessar lens which not only
complements the image sensor but has
approximately half the peripheral
Distortion for a more natural image the
brand new Live View remote is around 30%
smaller than its predecessor
and therefore much more flexible to use
when you're using the action cam while
out and about because the screen isn't
built into the back of the camera itself
it's easy to check the framing of what
you're shooting no matter how the camera
is mounted whether you're out on your
bike skateboarding in the park or simply
roaming the city the new Live View
remote is guaranteed to make it easier
to get the results you're after you even
get a watch attachment and tripod
adapter included so you're ready to use
the live view remote straight out of the
box with all of this and more the X 3000
our action cam has all of the tools you
need for incredible on-the-move footage
no matter the scenario
you
you
okay
how do we make for these frames per
second this time we used my h2 chip the
most advanced chip in the world
the newly supported raw picture capacity
will also give you more room for photo
editing as well we've reinvented a 4k
all over again with a hundred megabit
per second bitrate it made
professional-grade post-production
possible to everyone
the brand-new USB 3.0 type-c connection
increased transfer speed you'll see the
differences because 60 frames per second
and 30 frames per second no details will
be lost during high-speed movements
non-ordinary wispy clear pictures that
perfectly restores the wheel
electronic image stabilization for 4030
and it was clear and stable footage that
is normally subject to the ox and bucks
so keep doing what you're doing and let
the EIS take care of stabilizer your
footage Walberg be 4k plus comes with
the voice command feature just tell you
 what you want and you pocket
plus will do it for you
after countless tests the 4k plus can
now accurately understand you with live
streaming you can share your adventure
on most major streaming platforms before
they've even begun
hero six is a whole new game and it's a
whole new GoPro
the engine behind 0/6 is what we call GP
1:06 is going to give you double the
performance with 4k 60 1080p 240 video
you're gonna get this really buttery
smooth slow motion that doesn't drop a
frame every aspect of the shot is that
much more brilliant that much more
lifelike and when you combine it with
quick stories the experience is unlike
anything before quick stories is a way
to go from capturing a great experience
to the story that you can share your
GoPro will automatically copy any new
photos and videos over to your phone
where the GoPro app will edit that into
a video for you hero six is our smartest
camera yet we have algorithms for faces
and audio accelerometers GPS and we're
able to take that data and pull them
into your edit so we can create the most
compelling story for you
when you're able to capture something
and slow it down it really allows you to
appreciate the moment what was the water
doing what were you doing life happens
fast and using a GoPro helps you capture
your life slow it down and see it in a
whole new way hero 6 is stabilization is
far beyond anything we've ever
accomplished to go hero 6 can analyze
your footage and then adjust the
stabilization to take out any of the
shake take out the roll and really make
it look like your GoPro is mounted on a
stabilizer people are using their GoPros
to film everything and you can't always
get close to the action and now with
hero 6 and the built in touch zoom
capability you can with hero 6 you're
getting more voice commands you're going
to get this hands-free fluid experience
here six is going to give you the
richest biggest best image yet those
colors are gonna be brighter the moments
are gonna feel more authentic more
lively more evocative just as you
remember them live your life and share
your life through amazing video nothing
is like hero 6
