hey I'm Eric and I'm stoked to share
with you the Riptide r1 an electric
skateboard that blends massive power and
a compact design let's check it out
the riptides has dual belt-driven motors
at 1,800 watts of power you can fly up
the line and get it with the top speed
of 20 miles per hour in no time with all
that power riding up hills is no problem
the board is rated for eight miles of
range and it actually gets it once you
get your destination just grab it and go
more than anything I designed the
riptides out of my love for surfing
skating and snowboarding this board was
built by riders for riders which drove
some very key decisions first it had to
have a kick tail so I can tack it around
or kick it up then it had to be built to
shred so it can handle anything I throw
at it to ensure a smoother ride it has
wide trucks and some of the best long
boarding wheels on the market finally I
knew I'd want to bring it on all my
adventures so our battery pack is UN
approved and airline friendly I've
ridden almost every electric skateboard
on the market and I found the perfect
board for me doesn't exist so I designed
the riptides focusing on big-time power
and a small pad
at Riptide Electric we build a board
that blends massive power and a small
package if you can handle it you're
gonna love the way it rides
meet the B vibe rimming plug the first
buck plug to incorporate rotating beads
for a rimming sensation with powerful
vibration in the tip resulting an
exhilarating dual stimulation what's so
special about the rimming our bodies
contain a rainbow of pleasure potential
particularly located in the bum in fact
there's an abundance of tiny nerve
endings located directly at the entry
the rimming plugs rotating beads twirl
and tease the most sensitive nerve
endings located around the entry or rim
in addition to synthesis areas pleasure
from anal play occurs due to the shared
wall between the anus and the pee spot
or g-spot which brings us back to that
powerful vibration located in the tip
this vibration provides indirect
stimulation of those pleasure zones but
you already knew that right the rimming
plug can be used with or without the
wireless remote control the rotation and
vibration work together or independently
each motor has five intensity levels the
vibrating tip has six different modes
the remote works up to 30 feet away
which brings a whole new meaning to the
term couples play wink wink bee vibe
plugs are made with soft body safe
seamless silicone that means it's
hypoallergenic stay late free latex free
and non-porous it's waterproof shower
friendly and easy to clean
the rechargeable battery will run for
approximately 60 minutes on a single
charge the plug is USB rechargeable and
requires two hours to fully charge lucky
for you the battery level indicator
flashes when charging is required you'd
like to travel with your B vibe well
great news
the rimming plug arrives in a convenient
discreet travel case to avoid any
uncomfortable vibration accidents simply
activate the travel lock one last thing
we want you to know we got your back
covered in more ways than one
our warranty protects this product
against defects in material and
workmanship for one year thanks for
checking out the B vibe ribbing plug the
pleasure is yours
