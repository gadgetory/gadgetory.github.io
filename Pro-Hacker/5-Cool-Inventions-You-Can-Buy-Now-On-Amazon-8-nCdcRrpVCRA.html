Cujo now ladies and gentlemen flight
1427 to New York is now boarding at gate
3 please hurry so you can find a place
to stow your carry-on luggage assuming
you were even able to carry it on and
the airline didn't make you check it
because you pack too much hopefully you
all have a blue smart the world's first
smart carry-on suitcase introducing Blu
smart the first carry-on that connects
to your smartphone with revolutionary
features including a digital lock
proximity sensors location tracking trip
tracking information a built-in digital
scale and if that wasn't enough a built
in battery that can charge your phone
six times over designed for today's
sophisticated traveler
and even guys like this
pull the handle and the app will tell
you the exact weight of your carry-on so
that you never have to check it because
you pack too much god knows what a
suitcase has to go through
forget about keys or combinations
control the lock from the app and if for
any reason you need to part ways with
your blue smart Rinat it will
automatically lock itself life's too
short to fight for an outlet blue smart
will recharge your electronic devices
with our super powerful built-in battery
so relax blue smart will alert you if
you ever leave it behind or if it finds
a new friend and if it's ever lost
you'll be able to track its location you
will breeze through airport security
thanks to easy access to your electronic
devices with blue smart anyone can
travel smart
even this guy wait a minute is this even
possible who invented this
developing the technology behind smart
was a really fun challenge we have to
create new devices combining sensors the
two mechanical devices are never seen
connected to a microcomputer we needed
to come with the software also to
control form your phone beyond the
physical carry on we're super excited
about the features we're building into
that imagine blue smart singing to your
calendar and to travel services that you
use so that you know when and what to
pack imagine also being able to track
all your trips and see trends about your
travel habits all in one place the
suitcase becomes your personal travel
assistant and we think that's pretty
cool if you think about it suitcases
haven't seen much innovation for several
decades so we set out to reimagine how a
suitcase for this century should be blue
smart is a quantum leap for today's
travel we created a product that is
beautiful and powerful and yet
remarkably simple to use I am personally
super excited about blue smart because
it's a product that I would love to have
myself I travelled in the past and
because of problems with my luggage my
trips got ruined and I know that we put
smart are gonna be able to travel with
peace of mind so I'm super excited on
top of that my phone is never gonna run
out of battery anymore and that's pretty
cool thank you for watching and thank
you for a support let's make this
company
okay kids time to talk about our low Q
little Q plus you can tell me what's
special about you thank you plus mr.
cuddles excellent mr. cuddles class I
will keep at all occupies Oh me
fling it into a security camera solution
told 1080p AC power qu AR a go free
cloud storage and want to see the keys
in action check this out
Olsen's we notification when I will this

weight class dismissed
I love gadgets what else I left angry
lettuce badge of bones watches and smart
glasses what if there's a way you can
make your own smart watch your glasses
your own handheld video game tiny
screens of color display the size of
your phone which lets you add visuals to
almost anything it's a new extension to
the time you'd win a plan
a miniature Arduino compatible system
that works just like little electronic
Legos by stacking different modules
together you can easily create
electronic projects even with very
sophisticated features tiny screen is
less than an inch across has a
resolution of 96 by 64 pixels 16-bit
color depth in a softer controllable
backlight four push buttons are included
along the sides were things like menu
navigation or control in the game out of
the box tiny screen supports a number of
apps that require no software coding at
all
the smart ones have four tiny screen
allows for beautiful timekeeping and
supports communication with your Android
or Apple smartphone use our configurable
open source app the video app lets you
stream video in over 20 frames per
second to tiny screen from a microSD
card there's no limit to how long the
video can be an easy menu system lets
you navigate and select the video you
want to play the video game app lets you
play games like flappy birds and
asteroids and with the software library
open source and available to everyone we
look forward to all types of new games
for tiny screen being developed and
shared a lightning fast Arduino software
library has been created that makes it
simple for you to create your own tiny
screen projects to do whatever you want
and includes key components like fonts
menus graphics and gauges we've teamed
up with codebender
who've created the leading web-based
platform for the Arduino all the latest
tiny screen libraries examples as Stan
will announce will be on the site and
updating the software and your Chinese
screen is simple just plug it into the
USB and click a button on the web page
in uploads and seconds we got our start
two years ago thanks to Kickstarter we
launched the tiny do we know project in
the fall 2012 and hit our $10,000 goal
in only two days at the end of the month
we have blown away our goal by over one
thousand percent this led us fulfill our
dream of manufacturing locally in her
hometown of Akron Ohio we rented space
in a hundred-year-old rubber factory
balsam used electronics production
machinery and started building up the
product it took a few months in a lot of
long days we would got really good at
production and by the spring we're
shipping Kickstarter rewards out we
launched our webstore in June of 2013
and hit the road to spread the word
about the tiny do we know visiting 10
different maker fairs across the u.s. in
the last year alone we started to get
great traction won awards got featured
on major websites and magazines and got
picked up by over 15 different reseller
worldwide it's been a great two years
this Kickstarter but we're still a
startup and definitely need your
with your support we'll be able to buy
the OLED screens in volume to be able to
get these you at a great low price we
hope you'll join us and we look forward
to seeing with you when I near time
screw
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
