magical to unbelievably magical body
wash that's also shampoo Mentos and cola
things that fly with your help the
magical is about to get magical her meet
shy a pilot an industrial designer and
an inventor he loves things that fly he
wants try to turn his car into an
airplane no success shy always said that
his dream was to bring the joy of flight
to everyone few years ago he made a
breakthrough in the field of cool stuff
that flies he invented the power up the
first electric paper airplane but then a
friend of shai's told him nice gadget
really but you can't make a
remote-controlled paper airplane shy
took a moment to think and said
challenge accepted two years of research
and 57 prototypes later he made it
happen
Meech eyes unbelievably magical
invention power up three the first ever
smartphone controlled paper airplane
using state-of-the-art technology power
up three turns your embarrassing paper
plane into a lean mean flying machine
just fold a piece of copy paper to a
plane that's power up 3 and install the
app now call your mom and tell your
pilot because it works out of the box in
the back of the module are a propeller
and a rudder that are in charge of
controlling the plane in the front there
is an advanced ship with powerful
Bluetooth smart technology for an
amazing 60 yards of controlled flight
and a tiny rechargeable battery to power
this amazing beast out of juice charge
the battery with any microUSB cable as I
learned in his career as a pilot planes
should be billed when flying and for
crashing that's why all components of
the powerup 3 are super durable and
crash proof but here's where shy made it
really cool
powerup threes smart shape is programmed
to optimize user happiness you don't
need a PhD in Aero now text to be able
to fly it the prototype is fully
functional and the super ultra magical
power of three is ready for production
this is where shy need your magic beans
if you help shy get to 1,400 backers
you'll help him bring the joy of flight
to everyone and obtain the privilege to
look down on regular paper planes for
the rest of your life
so back power up 3 and help make the
magical magical earth
I once ate a whole box of Girl Scout
cookies Samoas or they're really good
and daddy takes a nap I'll eat as much
candy as I can
once I was watching a movie and at the
end I realized I ate a whole pint of ice
cream I love hot cheeto I love bacon I
love hot cheeto once ate 50 pieces of
bacon in a single day and obsessed with
hot cheetos I can't stop eating hot
cheeto help me I'm excited to introduce
you to the kitchen safe a fun and easy
way to control temptation the kitchen
safe is atomic container that puts you
in control let me show you how it works
first place an item in the container
next rotate the dial to set the timer
and finally press the dial to activate
the alarm once the container is locked
it cannot be opened until the timer
reaches zero it's that easy I came up
with the idea of the kitchen safe while
completing my graduate studies I was
looking for something fun and easy to
use and help me with my food cravings
lose a little weight and live a
healthier lifestyle all while still
being able to enjoy the occasional snack
to design a product that lives up to the
highest standards I work with Ryan sang
an engineer and classmate I met while
studying at MIT the kitchen safe is a
time lock containment that puts you in
charge you put an item in the container
and set the timer once the timer is set
and the button is pressed the container
locks and cannot be opened until the
timer reaches zero it is a simple
concept that produces powerful results
the goal when designing the kitchen safe
is to create a high quality product that
works well looks good and it's fun to
use
the product has a large clear display a
smooth dial sturdy lock and a clean look
that compares to the highest quality
containers available in stores the
design process took over a year we
investigated many options and with each
prototype we'll refine the design until
we ended with the great working product
the container base is made from four
millimeter thick acrylic for durability
and a clean look the LCD display was
custom developed to incorporate large
high contrast characters for easy
viewing the dial is specifically
selected for its smooth action time
could be set for short as one minute or
as long as 10 days the electronic
locking mechanism was designed to ensure
a strong seal we have tested the kitchen
safe and we're confident that it is a
great product there you have it the
kitchen safe we've worked hard to
develop a great product and I've lined
up a factory for production and this is
where we need your help
by ordering a kitchen safe and spreading
the words to your friends you can help
us turn it was just an idea into a
product that thousands of people can use
and enjoy from all of us at the kitchen
safe we thank you
everyday objects of our lives are
constantly evolving phones have become
handheld computers cars are smarter and
cleaner watches have turned into
personal assistants but what about our
shoes we spend most of our lives wearing
them but besides fashion designs they
have seen little evolution in the last
few decades we bend over to tie them to
untie them they come undone they get
stuck in our bike chain we leave the
laces tied all the time and damage our
shoes
sure we have velcro shoes and zippers
but you still have to bend over and they
don't fit nearly as firmly as good old
laces at power lace we wanted to figure
out a way to create shoes that fit
firmly and comfortably without ever
having to lace or unlace them we decided
to think differently and we found a
solution we are proud to introduce the
p1 our new Auto lacing system allows for
efficient hands-free shoelace time the
first time you wear them slide your foot
in adjust the tension once and you're
set you'll never have to bend over again
to take off the shoes use your other
foot to press down on the back lever
it's that simple it's a nice product
it's a very streamlined it's not bulky a
thin sole a lot of companies have big
bulky soles kevlar lace on any products
the definite advantage been working in
the street for 25 years to see two pairs
of pillars is broken power lace shoes
will simplify tasks of everyday life
allowing you to take advantage of a snug
shoe fit while on the go
in my 15 years in the footwear industry
I've never seen such a innovation they
are comfortable they are very stable too
so yeah I think it's amazing our shoes
are made of the very best materials and
combined proven shoe design with our
innovative technology we have working
prototypes and have met with
manufacturers we are ready to start
production
our very first men's shoe the p1 will
soon be available in many different
colors help us make Auto lacing shoes a
reality pre-order your pair today and
become a Power laser
imagine if you didn't have to get your
phone out for every little thing what if
there was a simpler way to interact with
your devices flick is a wireless button
that connects to your iOS or Android
device so instead of going through your
phone you simply press the button that's
better
I use the flick app to set it up and
then I can stick flick wherever I want
I can even share this flick with my
roommate so he can use it when I'm not
around
the flick isn't just for your house you
can stick your flicks anywhere like in
your car or on your bike
that's great
it's really cool
your destination is on the left
and you can clip your flakes it's great
for any situation where you need a quick
and discreet shortcut me me me me me
like now oh I'm so sorry I have to take
this but flight can be so much more than
just a shortcut to your phone it could
be integrated with lots of different
services beyond your devices check this
one out
take the old cabbie
and when I get home I want everything to
just take care of itself
Shh movies starting
another great feature of flick is that
it can be used as a safety device with
just a push of a button you can send
live updates of your location or even a
distress signal to your family and
friends first me and the Flik team all
right you guys ready yeah one two three
flick hi
we're Swedish team that's been working
for almost two years to create flick and
we're really excited to finally show it
to you we've gone through a hardware
incubator in San Francisco we traveled
all across Europe and China to finalize
design and to find the right partners we
have developed a flake app to be super
simple to set up
just open your app press the button and
select the function that you need we
also have an ISA software development
kit that allows other apps to work with
flaky
we already have some amazing apps that
will work with flick already from the
start and now we need your help to make
this all happen in order to bring flick
to the market and into your hands we
need to fund the tooling and
certifications that are needed in return
for your contribution will send you the
very first flakes ever made thank you
for watching hope you enjoyed the video
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
