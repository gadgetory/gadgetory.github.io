drink and this is both because this is
circled just pick your beverage like
mixed berries and twist the dial to
adjust the flavor and upgrade your water
circle sit enhance your water with
natural flavors rich vitamin
replenishing electrolytes or healthy
energy swap out cartridges to give your
taste bud something new to celebrate
with three categories to pick from you
can't go wrong
choose a life sip to simply enjoy a
refreshing beverage a fit sip to
replenish yourself during and after a
workout or a go step for a quick
pick-me-up the best part is a box of
eight cartridges is equivalent to 32
bottles that's about 75 cents per bottle
so you're saving money and staying
hydrated now that's refreshing
Wow Wow this is actually really good I
wasn't expecting that I like it packs a
punch in it is actually like a nice
sweetness to it but it's not actually to
overpower I've never really seen
anything like it
what is it it's like the perfect man to
drink right after workout so I can
definitely see myself using this at a
gym I would definitely drink this like
throughout the day I can use it daily I
can get my eight glasses of water
knowing you'll get the added benefits of
a sports drink with that quality like
added calories and sugar I'm too lazy to
always keep on flavoring all of my water
bottles and then you can get scared cuz
in the water in like flavor stays in the
water bottle I really like the design my
ship it's easy to hold you can't fit it
to my bag really easily so you can
adjust it are you serious I love the
fact that you can actually just go from
just normal water and and add a little
flavor just like that sometimes you want
to just drink pure water and it's gonna
do that for you and sometimes you want
to put the little flavor the flavor
actually can get really intense when you
put up the flavor really high and I mean
it could double as just a regular water
bottle because it will turn it off like
having something like this would
actually hopefully defeat those cravings
to drink something so sweet in a tent
how do I get it how do I have one of
these back us on IndieGoGo have water
your way waste when engulfed by mass
production accelerating consumption and
rampant materialism products are
designed to become obsolete then
discarded for the next big thing for the
pleating of natural resources at
astonishing rates or public polluters
and trash into the environment
developments and sustainability are
promising but they're not happening fast
enough and the solutions are still too
expensive and inaccessible what if we
can make a machines last longer run more
efficiently as of inclu instead of
supporting the high turnover consumerism
that we see today what if we had
solution here and now that's our mission
at try vertex
we're tackling the problem of waste by
creating the first of its kind
nanoparticles that actually repair
machines of increasing performance and
efficiency harnessing the power of
nanotechnology we came up with a small
solution to this big problem turbotech
nanoparticles has two faces one designed
I want less light the sticky side
reinforces and strengthens or the
slippery side reduces friction just like
carbon telling the diamonds in the
mantle of year
TurboTax self-aligned to a diamond like
lattice structure under the heat and
pressure of the engine unlike other
protective coatings this process
actually reverses engine wear particle
by particle resources were better than
new condition for initial focus was to
make lubricants safer among many
nanomaterials we worked on one unique
outlier reduced friction dramatically
down to super lubricity level with the
help of national labs and research
agencies we understood the mechanism and
developed proprietary production
products after years of research and
rigorous testing who are proud to
introduce car boss a safe and green
additive for your car by improves gas
mileage boost horsepower and extend the
life of your engine car boss comes in a
small recyclable applicator that you
inject into the oil fill of your car as
you drive turbo text nanoparticles are
forged into a diamond like armor around
engine components rejuvenating our daily
driver to become more efficient than
when it was new
a third of the gas that you put in your
car is wasted on inch encryption with
612 million cars on the road that waste
adds up running on car boss will use
less fuel reduce pollution and leave a
smaller carbon footprint we're ready to
go to market and we need your help back
our Kickstarter and be the first without
a revolutionary technology that will
make our world more efficient more
powerful and more successful
Cabo's by tribal tax as people
increasingly depend on their smartphones
to organize their personal lives it is
becoming evidence that the traditional
computer has been replaced by the
smartphone as the main servant of our
digital needs from a simple way to
communicate it became the one device
that is every device near access
introduces the mirror
the mirror book is helpful laptop and
the other house is in your pocket
it's just smartphone plug in your phone
and unleash its real power
you
instead of having a limited interface on
a small screen now you can be productive
in a 13-inch display with a keyboard and
a mouse pad the mobile first revolution
simplifies your life with only one
device to secure store your data and
access Internet
with its 24 hours battery and its slim
design you have the perfect combination
for mobility on-the-go
whether you need to make some research
work on your PowerPoint presentation or
just take notes
the mayor books is made for desktop
users
you can play with the millions of apps
available on your windows or Android
phone
hi I'm Nene and CEO and co-founder of
miracle of the past year we've been
working really hard on the new book
we've been to their Consumer Electronics
Show in Las Vegas the IFA in Berlin and
the mobile work on red in Barcelona all
of this to get feedback and bring you
the perfect new book this containing the
turn important and not something will
change our work thanks to you the Mira
team will grow and we were able to
finalize the motherboard and cross
manufacture the mirror book is part of
something much bigger and the mobile
first revolution will rise by the end of
the year with your help
little things in life that can make or
break your day I pay for wallet we
strive to provide you with the right
tools to keep your day running smoothly
skillfully designed with maximum
efficiency minimal bulk we strive to
find the perfect solution for you to
carry what you need and now we're taking
it one step further and designing
comfort for the most uncomfortable form
of money we researched existing
solutions tested materials and designed
dozens of prototypes to develop an easy
and comfortable way to handle coins and
that's not all we are proud to announce
that we have solved the mystery of that
tiny pocket in the pair of jeans you're
wearing right now the magic coin pouch
is the perfect solution to complete any
wallet a highly crafted true quality
super slim coin pouch made some tie back
an eco-friendly durable and
water-resistant smart material after the
great success of our last campaign we
want to offer you the perfect combo so
you can get your magic coin pouch and
wallet in the artwork of your choice we
need your help to get these designs into
production produce the collection and
get your favorite design directly to you
join up until your pockets with magic
my inspiration has been to combine the
best of our Swiss heritage in
traditional wedge making with the key
features of a smart wedge to persuade
the majority of consumers adopting our
wearable technology we wanted to create
a world without compromises a one that
is desirable and will be accepted and
word by majority of consumers Z time
we'll provide a 30 days battery on a
single charge and a water resistant up
to 30 meters when we first started
working on the design project we knew
from day one that the most critical
challenge for us would be to offer users
the opportunity to subtract of the daily
time without necessarily having to turn
on the display and therefore have some
battery life issues this has been
accomplished with the time the perfect
hybrid SmartWatch it combined the best
of both worlds stainless steel watch
case and mechanical hands of an elegant
traditional timepiece with a full-color
touchscreen that instantly shows
incoming calls smart phone notification
real time business activity accounting
calendar events daily reminders and much
more right from your wrist the best way
to deliver make any cold hands
experience with a SmartWatch was
actually to use real one but how and how
to make the background of the
traditional watch becoming smart while
drinking a hole into a TFT display was
the only solution we spent countless
hours with our engineering team an
inducible partner finding the right
solution to create a brand-new
touchscreen that could accept a
pass-through mechanical hand solution
and we finally did it over hundreds of
prototypes and design proposal by
combining a revolutionary TFT color
display together with the ultra precise
touch panel and a high-grade quality
glass we succeed to deliver the best of
both worlds an amazing SmartWatch that
can offer both doctoring experience
together with the traditional time
period what we didn't stop here
with our how noise we can trick the
lowest level features improve for our
conception in addition this house comes
with lots of Princeton applications and
a white sir it looks nice which basic
while using a traditional quartz
movement when we live into a brand new
smart work we were congenitally with
several partners to create what we call
the smart movement built around two
micro motors this movement is capable of
not only providing accurate time but it
can more importantly you can control by
the watch CPU - somatically adjust time
depending on times on where you are and
also move the ends where we need them to
be on a particular screen as a result no
fear having hands covering the text on
your emails or messages we can position
them the way we want to deliver the best
reading experience and they will go back
to the original position of the magnet
having orhan OS horrified to customize
our UX and the diverse as highest
developed compatibility for iOS and
Android users this time is also
embedding some of the most advanced
technologies like a three LED heart rate
monitoring solution delivering precise
and accurate measures of your kajuk
frequently throughout the day or at a
particular point in time when you need
it we also decided to replace the
traditional crown is a very advent smart
crown
helping user to enhance their navigation
experience inside of Polish and nicely
design user interface the experience
will be improved and enhanced week after
week with regular of those year update
offering new watch faces new
applications and photo new features the
time is with no doubt an amazing
timepiece that will for sure reset the
future of the SmartWatch industry when I
started in early 2013 people throw that
a wise man why would I start a smart
watch company in Switzerland in such a
challenging market
he turns out that my vision and passion
had paid off as our company has sold
nearly 2 million Smart Watch incidents
we have established strong foundations
in Europe and now we are willing to
expand worldwide
day we want consumer to embrace our
amazing joining with z-type and be the
first ones to get their hands on these
groundbreaking innovation as we are
heading soon to mass production like the
nice
