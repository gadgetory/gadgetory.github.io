every single day and because of the way
we're doing it ninety percent of us will
get back pain in our lives seriously
when we hunch and slump it affects our
mood our happiness even how optimistic
we feel look at yourself right now
how are you sitting how's your back and
your neck probably not too great huh hi
my name is Catherine and I started
working on my posture two and a half
years ago when I started having terrible
sciatica pain I have spent so much time
and money on doctors visits therapies
special pillows and all these ridiculous
products but I couldn't find anything
that just worked so for the past year
I've been creating a real solution with
the most amazing designers and
prototypers and dozens and dozens of
people with really bad back it was
important to create something small
enough I could fit in my purse and
something effortless so I could just
count on it working in five seconds flat
something reliable and something that
would help me improve my posture even
when I wasn't wearing it this is better
back it allows you to effortlessly fit
in perfect posture easing back pain and
training yourself how to sit use it when
you're sitting at your desk on an
airplane watching a game or even when
you meditate basically use at any time
you have to sit you don't have to go far
to find people with bad posture or back
pain a friends a parent someone you work
with or even people you meet product
testing around San Francisco every
Friday here's what people think about
better back Oh
Oh still left out of elaborate I feel
Ronnie still awesome it's so easy to
just sit up straight it was good sound
weird bagging like feel my my body you
know I can steal my hey my organs not
being squished I can feel that it's
right here but it's not like oh I have
all this on me it's just like I am just
like relieved pain-free I'm sitting
straight upright it's like it forces
your torso to stay upright where can I
get one of these can I have this one
simple it's easy I put it on and I feel
immediate relief so that's how it feels
and this is how it's actually helping
better back gives you better posture it
allows you to not fatigue the muscles
that you use when you're sitting down so
when you do stand up your posture is
literally changed good posture can
change who you are it affects your
attitude it affects your decision-making
good posture changes who you are
literally sitting correctly over time
does more than stops pumping stress on
your spine
it also retrained your body's natural
default posture so whether you're
standing or sitting without better back
your posture is greatly improved let me
show you how it works better bag zips
itself into a portable case throw it in
your bag and unpack it when you're ready
to sit wrap the back pad around your
back and the knee straps around your
knees all there's left to do is to pull
on the adjustable leg straps to stack
your spine into perfect posture so if
you're going to spend nine hours of your
day sitting you might as well be doing
it right when you're pain free and your
body is perfectly aligned you feel
happier more confident and you regain
your ability to focus on whatever it is
you want out of life
when we first launched the 3doodler we
asked the world to imagine a pen that
could literally draw in the air two
years on we've made the world's first 3d
printing pen even better with the new
and improved versions that slimmer
lighter quieter and even easier to use
the 3doodler heats then rapidly cools
plastic allowing instant 3d creation and
with no software or computers the
possibilities are limited only by your
imagination we've shipped over a hundred
and thirty thousand first generation
three doors and our community has used
them to create amazing things and
jewelry to RC planes fully three doodle
dresses architectural models and even
writing Braille it was because of the
support of this Kickstarter community
that we were able to make the 3doodler
dream the reality to say thank you we've
decided to bring 3doodler 2.0 to you
first completely redesign from top to
bottom and housed in a sleek aluminum
casing the new 3doodler is the result of
over two years of research and
development all aimed at giving you the
best 3 drilling experience possible the
new 3doodler is also packed with loads
of enhancements making it smoother
sleeker and easier to use than ever
before
we're also releasing exciting new
accessories including the jet pack a
portable power pack that gives you the
freedom to three doodle on the go to
help kick-start creativity in the
classroom we've created a special
educational bundle complete with pens
plastic accessories and curricular
materials which you can send to any
school library or makerspace of your
choosing if you can draw write or wave a
finger in the air you can create with
the freedom our community website has
hundreds of projects and stencils that

aquariums actually get pumped up to the
grow bed and broken down by the plants
