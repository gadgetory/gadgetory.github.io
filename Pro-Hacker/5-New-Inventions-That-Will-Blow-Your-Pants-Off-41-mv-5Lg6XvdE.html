with something we can be securely proud
of our mission is to help people so
better stories and make professional
videography available for everyone
anywhere at any time so back up today
and help open end too shaky videos
for the last year our team at here has
been developing a new technology like
one on you can see step in science
fiction today we invited our friend to
experience the magic behind you can hear
you for the first night alright well

the space and objects around you into a
set of magical remote computers with

an object or even in San air to control
any of your favorite devices and that's
it
wherever you live heyo connects the
space around you with you whenever you
want for whatever you need how would you
feel about the music right now last try
it out
seeing people discover the magic bein
here is an incredible feeling but this
is the beginning we are integrating new
feature on the first time hello will
world market we need your help to go to
the manufacturing place we want to
improve here and we want to bring into
your home lee jong
we are surrounded by technology it's
entering our homes and helping us
automate daily task but I find myself
thinking there has to be a more natural
and accessible way to control the
devices around us if the goal of
automation is to simplify our lives why
does it feel so complicated our goal is
a company is to solve this say hello to
naki naki is a small elegant device that
instantly transforms ordinary surfaces
in your environment and to remote
controls using naki couldn't be easier
simply take it out of the box pick a
place to put it select the surface to
attach it to and then define all the
things you'd like Nike to do naki can
control a wide variety of devices around
us but the true beauty of our technology
is that what it can do is only limited
by your imagination put one in your
living room for the kitchen or even your
bedroom I mean imagine rolling over in
the morning and capping a simple pattern
anywhere on your nightstand to smooth
your alarm and start the coffee maker
without even opening your eyes you just
bought ten more minutes and day and
you'll definitely want to put one in
your kids bedroom it's exciting to think
of how naki will spark their imagination
if they figure out all kinds of ways to
use it using Wi-Fi which is proven to be
far more reliable and would better reach
in Bluetooth you can enjoy using naki
from anywhere the number of devices and
software that naki interact with is
rapidly growing every day it currently
includes mess Phillips view live sex
smart things I ftpd and more but even if
you're new to the smart technology world
you can still use naki for simple
functions around your home
other technologies the rely on sound or
voice control can be unreliable and
confusing to use they can be triggered
accidentally and don't always work in
respect to our patent-pending technology
uses non acoustic sensors it's able to
distinguish deliberate tap or knock
patterns from random vibrations in the
environment the beauty of our product is
that it makes any regular environment
enjoy a user interface think about the
surfaces around you so many of them
serve one or two purposes add an oxy to
them and you instantly have a hub for
automation we carefully chose every
material and finish Funaki we've gone
through series of different tests and
prototypes to make sure that naki blends
in in your environment and also looks
beautiful unrestricted we're doing our
first production runs here in the USA
because it's important for our entire
team can be there on the ground for
ensuring that we're manufacturing best
possible product it's not some
far-fetched idea we have finalized our
design we have beautiful working
prototypes and we need to raise funds to
actually get it in a production and
immediately start shipping them to your
door we couldn't be more excited about
how this product is going to change life
bring joy to people everywhere nakia
accomplishes what technology is supposed
to do instead of taking over our life it
enhances it allowing you to put more
thought and effort into the things
that's building
tap into the world around you with the
magic of naki

height of your guitar spread that means
there will be absolutely no interference
with the strings or your hand as you
play fred zeppelin was engineered with
musicians in mind you picked a playing
style and fred zeppelin teaches you the
connections between each fret or on the
