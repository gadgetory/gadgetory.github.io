there's something about working out and
the way it makes you feel almost
everyone when tasked would like to have
more fitness in their lives but for most
of us it falls to the bottom of our
priority list so we developed the body
boss 2.0
we wanted a product it would empower
people to reach their goals where you'd
be able to exercise more often and
consistently we want a product that is
compact something that could do it all
with no restrictions this equipment is
something that anyone could use no
matter their fitness level a product
that takes all these concepts from the
gym and combines them into one solution
bringing the gym to you the platform is
strong the posts are spaced evenly apart
on both sides so you can simulate any
exercise movement and quickly adjust
difficulty the base is made wide enough
to stand comfortably during your workout
and we even added a layer of non-slip
material to assure you stay in place the
bands were customized for this concept
and can handle any height
there's even cloth in the band's to
protect you simply clip in to get
started
shorten the bands or add bands to
increase difficulty our most popular
exercise is squatting with the bar it's
like a workout bar you would see at the
gym but more portable it can unscrew and
it features grip padding for comfort the
ends of the bar spend a full 360 degrees
and are shaped to avoid the clips from
sliding providing you the most natural
feel possible through all of your
exercise motions adding or dropping
bands easily provides many resistance up
knees we added accessories to simulate
even more solutions such as handles that
will add weight adding bands are like
increasing your weight with a dumbbell
the wrist straps are double padded for
comfort and sweat resistant to stay in
place we even added a door anchor and
increase the workout the body boss is
lightweight made of high-grade injection
molding and capable of handling hundreds
of pounds of force the underside has
non-slip feet for safe use on any
surface the adjustable posts make for
easy storage starting from day one you
can choose your color green pink you can
choose your package and choose how you
want to follow workouts live replay
program all on your own
but by backing this IndieGoGo today you
can get it for a fraction of that price
empowering people just like you to reach
their goals body boss bringing the gym
to you music moves us it is the
heartbeat of our world and the stronger
that beat the more connected the more
grounded the more alive we feel that
beat should never be stifled that beat
should never be confined it should live
all around you wherever you are wherever
you go meet the solo a wireless hi-fi
speaker that offers 200 watts of
omnidirectional pure clean audio the
first secret two solos incredible sound
is our proprietary advanced wave sound
method during audio compression and
coding the audio can be stripped of as
much as 90% of its detail depth and
intricacy awesome restores a sound file
to its original pre compression state
after decoding and significantly
improved the efficiency of audio
processing in real time this means no
matter where you get your music from
you'll experience its fullest original
format the way it was intended the
second secret is our dual pressure air
compression super based technology DP AC
uses air compression and innovative
drivers to deliver a full range sound
with deep low end frequencies
it's astonishingly clear for an ultra
compact size the compressed air
molecules allow for sound waves to
travel faster and smoother without
losing accuracy or power so you get a
super powered ultra fidelity bass at a
fraction the size of a premium subwoofer
and the third secret unlike conventional
360-degree sound are enhanced 360-degree
optimized sound flows not only left to
right but top to bottom this creates an
omnidirectional spread with wide
directional waves that circulate
throughout the room giving the authentic
impression of a multi speaker
environment from a single speaker solo
is compatible with Bluetooth Wi-Fi HDMI
and auxiliary input
and comes with a built-in EQ and mode
selection immerse yourself in movie mode
with a 360-degree cinematic experience
or take your tactics to the next level
with gaming mode but best of all you can
unplug solo and take it with you with an
eight hour battery life and portable
power bank solo can bring hi-fi sound

hi I'm Lucy from echo if you're anything
like me you'll be fed up with wasting
money on uncertified cables that don't
work properly or cables that break
easily here at Echo we wanted to find
the simplest solution for this we have
created the strongest licensed cable at
the most affordable price hi I'm Andrea
from echo and this week we've launched
our pop up here in old Street Station
and it's been an amazing experience
we've gotten the chance to speak to
customers face-to-face and get to know
which products they love and you know
try and test out our new products which
is our our handy super-strong cable and
people are loving it you know a big
problem is that cables normally break
and echo has created this which means
that you will never have that problem
again
and we've had an amazing response it's
been excellent
so what's the deal after all the cable
isn't exactly a new product but this is
what we're calling a sales initiative
working exclusively with IndieGoGo we're
aiming to make the best cable we can for
bringing it to a virtually cost price to
achieve this we need to order 10,000
cables so let's make it happen
