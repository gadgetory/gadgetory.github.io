goal in mind
traditional readers have limited
functions and an aesthetic appearance
yes Margaret are too complicated useful
so we decide to create a ruler that is
simple to Elmo are user-friendly in by
Marvel order is it with it with sir
generation communication technology and
ours will establish its illusion after
completing two years of pilot end we
present you to the fly Marvel bringing
you maximum fireless signal strength and
coverage of course we show more concern
about health and secure invite

Oh
so this started about a year ago where
we have to measure the contours of an
organic surface and in fact that's a
very hard problem the only available
solution cost twenty thousand dollars
and that that's ridiculous
so we started to build around we looked
at what was available out there at the
intersection of computer vision and
service measurement and we couldn't find
a single solution that was compatible 3d
scanners they were precise force 10 mm
bolts and the one thing affordable one
professional today that cake
we're only just beginning to explore the
possibilities of capturing the world in
3d 3d printing is an amazing tool it
converts a digital file into a physical
object some call it an industrial
revolution the Iroquois chemists at the
exact opposite of 3d print it let
artists makers and designers captured
objects and surfaces and turn them into
high-quality 3d models and use them as
part of the creative product we knew we
had to use a smartphone model phones are
simply amazing we use them to take
pictures edit videos update social media
even for gala the eora 3d scanner is
powered entirely by your smart using it
as easy just open the app and press scan
it'll automatically adjust focus and
exposure and drive a green laser to scan
your object as it sweeps we take over
1,000 photos and analyze them in real
time to give you a 3d model a typical
scan takes three to five minutes and
gives you a full color mesh with up to
eight million points with a range of one
meter you can capture all this big as
one accurate to less than 100 microns
that's the thickness of a single sheet
of paper when engineering the scanner we
had one objective in mind
precision all that's possible thanks to
a design that's both beautiful and
functional machined from a solid block
of aluminium with over 35 mil operations
we've designed it to be both robust and
precise
the light ring gives you quick visual
feedback and the adjustable knob let's
just secure any model smartphone the
green laser lets you scan in any
lighting conditions as most cameras are
twice as sensitive to green than any
other color for water type models we
also design a Bluetooth current order it
will sync to your scanner and rotate
your object to make sure you get every
area we meticulously designed every
aspect of the hardware and they've
tested seven different prototypes
we've put together a great team and we
lined up several manufacturers now we
need you to help us put this together

essential part of what makes the house
