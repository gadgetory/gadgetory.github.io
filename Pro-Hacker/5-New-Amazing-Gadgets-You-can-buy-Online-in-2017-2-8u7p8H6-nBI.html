to just combine all that equipment into
this small and portable of a package
this is cam buddy Pro unlock your true
potential as a photographer our final
prototype is ready for production
support our campaign and help us deliver
this amazing product to everyone their
children's health and today we have so
much access to information parents can
track their children's health and lost
different ways from loss different
devices but the question is how do you
really hone in on what's most important
fever smart is a real-time smart
thermometer that allows parents to track
their children's temperature using their
smartphone Artemis of a lot of research
and studied what's currently available
on the market and there's number of key
problems with the current solution to
national thermometers to be difficult to
use uncomfortable for children and most
concerning they only provide a one time
temperature reading there have been so
many technological advancements but
thermometer technology hasn't changed in
hundreds of years which is crazy
considering that is the most basic
indicator of health we identified this
huge problem and knew that there had to
be a better solution so we created fever
smart fever Smart has some amazing
features it's wireless continuous
cloud-connected and most importantly
notifies parents through our alert
system fever smart is a preventive
solution that allows you to be proactive
and track your child's temperature as it
starts to rise so you can intervene
before there's a serious health problem
throughout the development process we
had children help us design the device
whenever we had a new generation of the
prototype developed we would send it out
to actual parents to see how feasible it
was in the real world when we came away
from our drawings with fever smart we
knew that it had to be non-invasive very
accurate and provide immediate real-time
data to the parents to provide them
peace of mind and to give them the
comfort that they needed here's how it
works
the fever smart system has three
components the reusable device the
disposable patch and the relay unit the
parent applies the device to the child's
underarm using a disposable patch next
the temperature data is transmitted via
bluetooth to the relay unit the relay
unit then forwards the data onto the
cloud now your child's temperature can
be accessed from anywhere around the
world using your smart device fever
smart is really great because it's so
easy to use right as you take it out of
the box it's ready to go
you just pop in the battery and connect
it to your smartphone not only can you
constantly monitor your children's
temperature but you can also track
trends over time as you track the data
with fever smart you can send the
information directly to your
pediatrician which means that they can
help you create better personalized
health care solutions for your children
our device is finalized and ready to go
after two years of hard work we have all
the necessary safety certifications and
we have a beautiful user interface on
our app with your help we can fund the
first round of manufacturing and bring
the first products to market by the end
of 2014 so join us join us join us join

getting into the office coffee is an
essential part of your day it's often at
these busiest times if you really use
that quality cup of coffee the options
for on-the-go brewing just can't keep up
good coffee presses aren't portable and
portable coffee presses compromise on
the quality of your brew
hi my name is Alan and I'd like to
introduce you to Pascal press a portable
coffee maker that doesn't compromise on

travel mug and pressure he uses a full
immersion and pressure brewing process

coffee in as little as a minute

travel French press where the coffee
remains in contact with the used coffee
grounds resulting in bitterness Pascal
pressed completely separates the coffee
from the coffee grounds the coffee you
press is a coffee you taste when you're
ready for your second cup the old
grounds can be easily removed
hassle-free

perfect my room but I was never able to
achieve the same quality coffee on the
go
pascale press started as an engineering
challenge I wanted to make the ultimate
travel for one that was fast made a
perfect cup of coffee and was easy to
clean I spent the past year developing
prototypes and tasting lots of coffee

coffee lovers

the world for us to be able to bring
