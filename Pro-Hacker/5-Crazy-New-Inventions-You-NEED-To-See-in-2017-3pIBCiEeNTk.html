 it's how we were always told
smart homes would work your coffeemaker
would prepare your coffee right as you
enter the door the lights would be set
just right that never happened
all we do have is a bunch of appliances
operated from our phone just makes it
offensive remote control the problem is
that there was never a sensor to sense
who's actually in the room does it mean
is it my wife well Rumi was about to
change that Bruni senses smartphones to
determine who's in the room and
personalize it accordingly not just for
me for everyone in the house when I walk
into a room Rumi senses my phone using
bluetooth technology and have justice
everything to my liking and when I leave
the room it turns everything off if
that's what I programmed it to do as
opposed to other indoor positioning
solutions Rumi senses when I'm actually
in the room and not in the room adjacent
to it and since it's not based on motion
detection it's not affected by other
non-phone carrying things when there's
more than one person in the room Rooney
allows you to prioritize whose settings
to say
you move your back to the center so
you're taking the attachment of Rumi is
easy and fits nicely in every room
no hubs are needed and there are no
security issues because Rumi connects to
your phone not the internet so yeah
thanks to Rumi that cool future is
finally here real automated IOT
personalized private
we are surrounded by technology it's
entering our homes and helping us
automate daily tasks but I find myself
thinking there has to be a more natural
and accessible way to control the
devices around us if the goal of
automation is to simplify our lives why
does it feel so complicated our goal as
a company is to solve this
say hello to knocky knocky is a small
elegant device that instantly transforms
ordinary surfaces in your environment
into remote controls using naki couldn't
be easier simply take it out of the box
pick a place to put it select a surface
to attach it to and then define all the
things you'd like Nike to do naki can
control a wide variety of devices around
us but the true beauty of our technology
is that what it can do is only limited
by your imagination
okay put one in your living room for the
kitchen or even your bedroom
I mean imagine rolling over in the
morning and tapping a simple pattern
anywhere on your nightstand to snooze
your alarm and start the coffeemaker
without even opening your eyes
you just bought ten more minutes in bed
and you'll definitely want to put one in
your kids bedroom it's exciting to think
of how naki will spark their imagination
as they figure out all kinds of ways to
use it using Wi-Fi which is proven to be
far more reliable and with better reach
than Bluetooth you can enjoy using naki
from anywhere the number of devices and
software that naki interact with is
rapidly growing every day
it currently includes nest Phillips you
lifx smartthings IFTTT and more but even
if you're new to the smart technology
world you can still use naki for simple
functions around your home
other technologies that rely on sound or
voice control can be unreliable and
confusing to use they can be triggered
accidentally and don't always work in
which spec fix our patent-pending
technology uses non acoustic sensors
it's able to distinguish deliberate tap
or knock patterns from random vibrations
in the environment the beauty of our
product is that it makes any regular
environment into a user interface think
about the surfaces around you so many of
them serve one or two purposes how to
knock you to them and you instantly have
a hub for automation we carefully chose
every material and finish for naki we've
gone through series of different tests
and prototypes to make sure that naki
blends in in your environment and also
looks beautiful on your surfaces we're
doing our first production runs here in
the USA because it's important for our
entire team to be there on the ground
floor ensuring that we're manufacturing
the best possible fada
it's not some far-fetched idea we have
finalized our designs we have beautiful
working prototype and we need to raise
funds to actually get it into production
and immediately start shipping them to
your door we couldn't be more excited
about how this product is going to
change lives and bring joy to people
everywhere naki accomplishes what
technology is supposed to do instead of
taking over our life it enhances it
allowing you to put more thought and
effort into the things that really
matter
tap into the world around you with the
magic of Nike
during the day we use our mobile phones
to text email make calls and connect to
the internet but it feels like just when
we need them the most they die this
doesn't have to happen anymore hi my
name is Jacob Adkins and I want to
introduce you to the slim jerk the
world's slimmest charger today the
problem with most portable chargers is
that they're bulky heavy and we always
have to carry them around with an extra
cable attached to them we have BlueTEC
industries found the need to design a
portable charger that can eliminate all
of those problems the slim sure has an
elegant thin and lightweight design
about the size and weight of an actual
credit card and has a built-in USB cable
no more annoying cables to carry around
with slim sure you can charge your
mobile device anytime anywhere and
without the need of any messy cables let
me show you how the slim sure works to
charge your slim jerk simply connect it
to any computer or power outlet to
charge your phone simply plug it in and
press the power button the slim sure is
designed to work with most mobile
devices with its built-in micro USB for
Android devices or built-in lightning
cable for iPhone slim sure will be
available in five colors silver gold
black blue and pink the slim sure is
only 0.17 inches thick and can easily
fit into your wallet so you can carry it
around with you everywhere
slim sure is patent pending
we've already produced five prototypes
of the slim juror but we need your help
to finish with the final production
we're excited about the support and
feedback we've received from well-known
publications and we encourage you to
back up our IndieGoGo so that we can get
slimmed you're out to the market as soon
as possible
Thanks
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
