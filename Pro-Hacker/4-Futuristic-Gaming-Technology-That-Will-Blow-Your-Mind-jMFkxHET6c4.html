first-person shooter we're sitting there
on the couch driving this Jeep I'm on
the back and I'm pounding away with the
gun and he's hitting the bumps and then
the thing explodes on the screen we go
flying but there's really nothing except
a little vibration what good is that
like is something missing here we
started thinking about wow you know that
would be great if we could kind of get
that feeling across not only do you feel
the impact but you feel the spread you
get the kick back and it's all there the
whole experience and that's when you
actually feel like you're totally
immersed and with air reg that's what
you get my name is Brody Stanfield I'm
the president co-founder of tech my name
is Michael Stanfield and I'm the vice
president and co-founder gaming today is
a two dimensional product experience is
limited to sight and sound and so we're
providing a new dimension it's a suit
it's a haptic product that provides
sensory stimulation taking the user into
the game whether it be sound sensations
of touch the idea of the impact Eric
will put you into that experience that
you've always wanted
there are three major components to this
suit there's the decoder the exoskeleton
and the sim skin the decoder is the
piece that attaches actually to your
console or platform takes information
then it brings that and sends it to the
exoskeleton the exoskeleton is now the
component that sort of has all the
pieces in airag that you're wearing from
the nervous system which is the feedback
to the control center which takes the
information from the decoder as well as
the power supply to make sure it's
wireless the sound that we're providing
is a patented sound it's quite a
different experience we want to make it
a surround sound feel so the idea is we
have six speakers two on the front on
this side two on that side and then on
the back one here and one here as well
as a subwoofer you're always in the
sweet spot no matter where you are
and as for like vibratory feedback right
now it's always been to the controller
so you feel a rumble in your hand now
we're actually getting it so it's
located on the specific parts your body
where it should be there are sixteen
points on the front eight points on the
side and sixteen points on the back
alright so first thing we're going to do
is I'm going to test have some
vibrational stuff so to start with I'm
just going to set a value here and I'm
gonna be top right you do that yeah all
right so let's switch that over to
bottom left and with you yeah switch is
awesome that's pretty much how vibration
works as for stems they're pretty much
focused on particular muscles it
contracts and muscles it can either give
a full contraction or it can be a slight
contraction once again same thing top
right so they just as a value okay
all right shut that off how you feeling
we can see it moving your shoulder
forward like that yeah nothing will wait
alright so that's pretty much it for the
basic fundamentals of what air I can
actually do so what do you think of it
it was pretty interesting and that
really experienced anything like that
yeah virtual world awareness you
actually inside the world that you're
playing in the last piece is the sim
skin so Sims kin is the look and feel
over top you can then have these front
piece plate so you put on or an armor on
the sides and that kind of stuff it
actually look like you're in the game
that you're actually envisioning
yourself in games already have sound
there do you have haptic feedback so we
take that information that's already
there and we implemented with Eric and
it's now a matter of the developers to
take on that role if they have a game
and they want to compete with a triple-a
game and they're only an indie company
well now you can it's not just about the
visuals anymore it's about how you can
how you can differentiate your product
we think that's going to be a big
difference
the ultimate goal of this campaign is to
create airag we want to be able to
create that product for you which fixed
our success we can actually ensure that
everyone who wants us can get it
the initial involvement of the community
will be through our our website and our
IT infrastructure we want to ensure that
the individuals who actually start the
kickstarter program and go through the
campaign with us are the individuals who
are going to be initially involved in
the development process and making
decisions with us not only do we want
you to be part of it the community part
of purchasing the product but we want
people to actually part of the
development process we want to bring
people in and actually get them to try
it out and show us what they actually
think is good we're gonna get people to
actually come here to our office and
work on it with us so the funding takes
into account the development it takes
into account the manufacturing kicked
into account some of the distribution
costs as well we take a look at it as a
whole so you we want you to help us
actually make this everything it can be
the process of this we want to make sure
that it's good from start to finish we
have engineering firm in place we have
the web infrastructure warehouse and
distribution in place we have all the
components necessary to actually go
through this process not only will the
product be ready and all your input be
in place but you actually get the part
on time the customer service section is
where we want to focus as well we
believe that that's one of the most
important aspects of the community it's
not only the thing that determines the
viability and whether this is successful
it's also what determines where we're
headed if you're gonna be part of this
campaign where we have an expectation
actually we talked about that those
people who want to be involved hey you
can see this come to fruition you'll be
part of the success of a new product out
there in the market you're gonna be part
of the group of people who actually
bring this to other households you
finally get to be that one of the
drivers in the gaming industry
let's take this product and move it
forward you be part of the first Legion
the only way is to get onboard
microsoft hololens brings holograms into
your real world
using transparent lenses spatial sound
and an understanding of your environment
Holograms look and sound like they're
actually part of the world around you
that is mixed reality with microsoft
hololens holograms are viewed through
the holographic frame centered in the
middle of your view this preserves your
peripheral vision so you can move freely
and connect and collaborate with people
around you holograms and mixed reality
don't block out what you can see in here
this enables you to engage with digital
content and tools alongside the objects
in your real world Holograms can be
world locked in a physical location so
you can walk around them or they can
travel with you you can even hear them
in 3d with spatial sound
microsoft hololens is the world's first
fully untethered self-contained
holographic computer with the mixed
reality experience of hololens you can
stay in the real world and interact with
real people as you simultaneously
explore 3d in 3d
Texas's building Tesla suit is our dream
initially we wanted to build something
for the VR gaming but while developing
this technology we've realized there's a
lot more potential to it and this is our
story
anyways really cool blow my mind
ah wow that is amazing Tesla suit is a
full-body haptic suit that lets you
touch and feel sensations and virtual
reality the haptic system uses mild
electrical impulses to transmit signals
through the skin and muscles the
technology is used widely in physical
therapy to help train muscle groups as
well as the pain relief we've adapted
back technology to help transmit signals
through virtual reality stimulating
massive potential everything changed
this is this is the real deal this is
not some fictional processor this is
definitely a future
nailed it this is worth developing for
the potential of the Tesla suit is
enormous I've always been a big fan of
we are and wanted to find something that
would make it's more real there wasn't
anything that let's why to interact with
virtual reality world beyond the visual
so we started developing this
it took us three prototypes to be able
to deliver pleasurable realistic
sensations the reason for our
Kickstarter campaign now was to get SDK
and Tesla suit in the hands of
developers and build communities that
will take project to the next level we
spent a lot of time developing tests as
you we designed our smart textile from
scratch it's durable washable and
comfortable - there we made two versions
pioneer which has 16 impact points and
Prodigy which has 52 impact points which
means more realistic experience the
onboard control unit connects wirelessly
to any device such as games consoles VR
headsets mobile phones and tablets PCs
and Macs taking the potential
applications of Tesla suit well beyond
gaming I think it'd be very interesting
with a repeating point of view and I'm
sure there are many other uses that
people come up with for it and I can
definitely see lots of different uses
uses for it right away from gaming to
medical to sports exercise in baby
obviously there's gaming applications
but I can imagine I would love to get up
to if there's been that and get
notifications on whether or if I've
missed an email from my girlfriend or my
boss or something as a subtle additional
cue that no one else would see first the
middling industry for pretty much every
industry as well and if we can start
this offer it be something exceptional
yeah with the game with with someone
shooting you I think a video variable
for a row of military training I enjoy
most about it is potential to be used in
any word in any industry from music to
health the re-education - a pleasure and
enjoyment we wanted to make something
that would showcase our passion for
virtual reality and games development
we've built we are digital paintball
game with the help of professional
paintballers it's a first online
multiplayer game that combines haptic
feedback and
reality our development kid is ready to
play and gives you full freedom to
create your own sensations software pack
includes the haptic editor studio an
easy-to-use SDK VR digital paint ball
game and a virtual meeting up the
virtual meeting app enables friends and
family to add tactile sensations to
video calling and messaging such as the
ability to send and receive real hugs
over the Internet
join the revolution make a pledge
