because I'm well smart I find all these
cool gadgets that plug into the internet
of things and have people saying hey why
didn't I think to use that duh is
because smart Bob thought of it first
here's my latest discovery no it's not a
shower
it's called even drop the first smart
Cheryl that helps you save water did you
know the average shower uses 17 gallons
of water of course you didn't even drop
you can cut that in half here let me
show you how it works
usually when you turn on the shower you
occupy yourself with other more
inventive ways to pass the time waiting
for that perfect temperature that is
until you realize you've been running
the water the entire time how much water
to have waste I wasn't even in the
shower yet but now with a drop I can
program the temperature I like and its
internal heat sensor detects when it
hits my desired temperature and cuts the
flow of water nor always the water way
away from the shower now when I welcome
to chapter on the water it's hot right
away no waiting that's not all
even drop into even more it uses its
proximity sensor system to automatically
adjust the flow of water depending on
where I am in the shower and what I'm
doing if I'm right under the shower head
rinsing shampoo from my hair I get 100%
flow right and I need it but if I step
back just so bub the water flow reduces
sipping water while still keeping me
comfortable and warm if I go even
further away to get soap or even shave
my legs
it reduces the flow of water even more
it's simple and automatic smooth even
jobs universal design fits any shower
any size and it's easily install between
a resisting showerhead and the wall but
what's really cool is the even drop app
all of this can be controlled and
tracked through the app so I can set
goals such as preferences switch between
largest small shower settings even see
how much more I'm saving each day so
take it from smart Bob get Eva drop it's
a smarter way to shower
unzip and untie attach the neck straps
stick it to the mirror start you need to
stop hanging the straps to the hooks all
done don't spill the trainings in the
trash repack and zip you are now the
king of your cars
beating responsibly fear the beard not
the mess we wake up each morning to a
brand new day a day of balance and
wellness we nourish our body with
healthy foods we physically stretch our
bodies in hopes of stretching our minds
everything we do goes back to our well
being but there is one piece we often
tend to neglect from the Wellness puzzle
introducing turbo a simple and effective
addition to your daily routine before
the 19th century toilets were
non-existent people used to squat to
release two thirds of the world actually
still do and for good reason as we
adopted the toilet into our lives we
unknowingly added tension and straining
during bowel movements
studies have shown us the perpendicular
posture brought on by the toilet creates
a kink in the colon which makes it
difficult to go it also makes us
susceptible to a number of other health
issues by elevating your feet that kink
disappears your muscles are able to
relax and your colon is open for quick
and efficient release and that's why we
invented turbo turbo is an elegant yet
affordable solution that makes a great
addition to any bathroom it's sleek
design allows for flexibility and
comfort the unique ramp design makes
using turbo easier for any person of any
size the lower toe area allows you to
easily load your feet then you can
position your feet forward or backward
on the ramp to adjust to a squat that's
just right for you and with turbo
squatting is only the beginning
turbo comes with in
changeable massage rollers to further
increase your comfort on the toilet not
only does it feel good but it can help
with constipation to your feet have
pressure points that can stimulate your
colon when it's time to go massaging
with turbo also helps with blood
circulation which can improve your
energy levels to get you through the day
we have come a long way and we are
almost there
the only thing missing is your support
introducing new blade a revolution in
toilet cleaning technology hi I'm here
to tell you about an invention of all
revolutionize a chore that we all love
to hate cleaning the toilet recognized
this the classic toilet brush design has
remained unchanged for decades the sad
fact is it's chameleons for purpose the
bristles clog up very easily meaning
they're extremely on hygienic and hard
to clean they retain water meaning they
drip everywhere and they're also
extremely inefficient you have to scrub
back and forth and they never clean
under the room two years ago I decided
to do something about it in 2013 Gary
brought together a team of product
designers engineers and material
specialists and went into the lab to
work on a new product that would help
change the way that toilets are cleaned
forever with its patented swipe clean
technology the silicon blades follow the
contours of the toilet bowl and reach
under the rim with ease swiping the
surface clean a silver based additive
kills germs both during and after
cleaning and helps cut down bleach use
the blades do not get clogged up like
bristles and have a hydrophobic coating
that shit's water and dries quickly a
hollow-point head feature also helps
clear blockages air flows freely through
the holder to quickly evaporate any
remaining moisture the let's look at how
Lou blade helps overcome the main
failings of the toilet brush
the bristles of a toilet brush quickly
become clogged which is hard to dislodge
especially after it has dried with leuh
blade the smooth flat surfaces are
easily kept clean and clear with just a
gentle shake after shaking look how much
potentially germ filled and smelly water
is still contained in the brush loon
glades hydrophobic coating ensures that
all water is almost immediately removed
the bristles of a brush only touch part
of the surface which is why you need to
scrub back and forth to get things clean
with continuous contact blue blade
swipes the surface clean in a single
pass introducing new blade a revolution
in toilet cleaning technology take
cleaning to the edge
early in the morning while everyone is
sleeping your dearest one wakes up
silently it has already preheated the
seat and water temperature using its
heating system and has been waiting for
