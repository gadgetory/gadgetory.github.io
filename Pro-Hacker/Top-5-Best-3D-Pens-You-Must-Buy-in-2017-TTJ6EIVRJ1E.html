life what we place on that page where
would our minds lead us what masterpiece
would we create
introducing for the first time the first
ever double nozzle three-deep in 3d
scribbler duo now easier than ever to
build bigger and better 3d creations
bring your imagination to life as your
own creation literally comes off the
page create your own world your own art
it is the first 3d pen with two nozzles
allowing you to feed two different
colors at the same time
no more endless back-and-forth just to
build up your creation
you don't need to be a professional
artist the 3d scribbler duo is easy and
fun to use for everyone
with the 3d scribbler duo your
imagination is your only limitation
yeah
the min 3d professional printing ton
puts the power of 3d printing in your
hand our 3d pen is perfect for drafting
and prototypes creating detailed 3d art
and just having fun to help you get
acquainted with this new medium of 3d
drawing here are some tips for success
first your work surface it's important
that your filament sticks to an anchor
point so that you have proper resistance
to form and pull the lines of your
design paper and polycarbonate work well
or if you're using a piece of glass or
plexi you may want to swipe a glue stick
over your surface for better stickiness
secondly when creating a specific design
the use of a printed or pencil sketch
template can assist you with your design
lastly spend a little time practicing
drawing vertical lines getting a feel
for holding tension and the brief
hardening time
now let's walk through a fun beginner
project a flower be sure to check your
speed you want it on a very slow speed
for maximum control as you get
comfortable with your 3d printing pen
start by drawing flat two-dimensional
petals and filling them in remove the
puddle from your surface and add more
filament to the end portion of the petal
away from where you're holding this will
warm the area making it pliable once
you've created multiple petals start
assembling the flower using the 3d pen
to attach the petals at the bottom tips
repeat with one petal at a time and
there you have it
mint 3d brings your ideas to a new
dimension</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
