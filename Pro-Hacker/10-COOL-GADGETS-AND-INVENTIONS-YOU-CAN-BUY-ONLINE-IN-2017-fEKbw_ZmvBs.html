made a while back it's like magic has a
certain feeling to it it was an era when
people had time to pay attention to
every detail and things were made to
last
inspired by the bolts headlights we've
collected over the years we combined our
skills to create something useful really
amazing we would be proud of having
around
we wanted it to have a personality
the stance had to inspire confidence
just like a superhero stance the
footprint is large enough to keep it
balanced the size was chosen so it will
be tall enough to provide light for the
entire office that has rotates in any
direction and at any angle even large
enough to be used as a headphone stand
we fitted it with two LED light sources
to have the perfect light for any
situation a career one for reading as
you could easily turn on or off and set
the intensity just by touch and an RGB
one controlled by mobile turn it on or
off change the color or intensity while
sitting comfortably on the couch this
light can even be synced to music so we
will flash to the beat when you're
having a party
look some functionality weren't enough
the materials had to be top-notch as
well the head is made out of old tractor
headlight it's all metal and glass
weather sealed so it would last even in
the toughest conditions the neck the
only exposed part is made from aluminum
so it won't rust body is made from
recycled polyurethane to help the
environment a bit we wanted everyone to
be able to add a personal touch to it so
starting from day one you can choose a
color to match your room
biometric personality logo to give it
more of a superhero look given letters
so would have any two initials paint
right on it to have full body coverage
each lamp store will have two layers of
non-toxic water-based paint the two
basic layers of clear coat to protect
the paint job from wear and scratch over
time we've put our heart and soul into
designing a lamps they're making the
first prototypes to be able to produce
it and make it available we'll need your
support together we can make this happen
make this your next landing share the
video with a friend
go ahead

four top motors all wheel drive people
all wheel drive
the ones that will get you up
most of the steepest hills in America
and around the world
but wait there's more
if you're looking for something a little
more affordable we got you we have two
more models what we call the blink s and
the Blake s - it's a different
construction than the Quattro it's made
of wood but it has an aluminum extrusion
along the bottom and aluminum plate on
top to kind of sandwich the batteries
inside of the deck so there's actually a
hole that goes clear through it the s2
version of this board is a little bit
longer than the s and that's because it
has the extra motor it goes a little
faster and just needs to be a little
longer before facility
so you get to choose from three boards
you get the cuatro or the blink s or the
blink

the same time here so of course this is
