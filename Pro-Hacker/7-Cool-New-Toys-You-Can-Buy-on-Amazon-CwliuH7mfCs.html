along that changes the course of mankind
a modern marvel of science and
engineering allow me to introduce

streaming video keeps us in on the
action did that just come from those
mouths bad spot is on me okay those are
control it's safe to say we have a clear
winner
uncle overdrive uses robotics and AI
create a product experience that feels
like magic but what do we mean when we
say the cars have artificial
intelligence it comes down to three
important systems positioning reasoning
and execution you can think of
positioning as how the cars know where
they are on a track in Anki overdrive
every car is equipped with a dedicated
processor and an infrared camera 500
times a second the cars adjust their
steering and power to stay on course
scanning patterns and coded in the track
and sending that data to the players
device the supercars now have a complete
understanding of their environment so
they can start planning their next move
the sophisticated AI engine infuses each
commander's personality into every
aspect of the game it then simulates
thousands of possible driving actions
taking into account virtual upgrades as
well as the physical properties of the
cars and track once it identifies the
best course of action it moves on to the
next phase execution the players device
sends the final instruction to the AI
car in this case the AI decides to hit
the gas pull ahead of ground shock in a
typical game our AI can consider well
over 50,000 possible actions
think you can outsmart it
you

radioactive spider the socially
