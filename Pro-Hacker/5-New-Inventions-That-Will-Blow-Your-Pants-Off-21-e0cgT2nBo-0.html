Bradley whether you're feeling a bit
thirsty
big fuss a bit fancy quick fast
hey guys three years ago we had an idea
a simple idea
we developed a keyholder to solve our
own frustration with traditional key
chain we love the concept but we didn't
know if others would feel the same way
too so we introduced it to the
crowdfunding community and to our
surprise we gratefully had 5000
supporters that believed in our vision
to revolutionize the king caring
experience soon after we delivered the
first release of products we were
thrilled to see our hard work pay off
with such an overwhelming positive
feedback and even more wonderful
although with the praise came down all
constructive feedback on how we can make
all the key better we'll listen
attentively to you our regional
supporters and our customers and we have
taken your feedback on board to help
shape the uber key is now even more
comfortable for you to use the overall
thickness of the fasteners has been
reduced by 40 percent so that fits
perfect in your pocket the forum has
been simplified so that the surface is
smoother and your thumb sits nicely into
the concave divot it's also more
compatible than ever the screw diameter
is thinner so that is able to
accommodate a larger variety of keys and
the coin slot has also been enlarged to
allow the bigger coins the new wave
washer which provides the tension for
your keys automatically captures the
fastener making it easier to assemble
unlike its aluminium brother the new
over key is made from stainless steel to
improve durability for the leather
version we're introducing a premium
d-ring where the edges have been
softened and curved so that is friendly
on the leather band we're also really
excited to do see a new lineup of band
choices this time around we are
replacing the old flat leather band with
a cushion leather band making them
stronger and more sophisticated than
ever the newest addition to our line is
the canvas band which is light and
durable and secure leaf stitch to
prevent fraying
last but not least we have enhanced our
line of accessories we now have the USB
3.0 which runs up to 10 times faster
than our previous USB Drive
bro so introducing the multi tool which
allows you to have seven handy tools in
a very compact form
all of the design development and the
grunt work has been done and we're ready
to go into production now we just need
your help to raise $30,000 so that we
can go ahead with new tooling and
production process required to bring it
to life if you believe in our vision and
support what we do we'll be so grateful
if you could come and join our
ever-growing community and help support
this next important stage and from the
entire team it'll be key we sincerely
appreciate the support and we want you
to know how privileged we feel to be a
part of this
