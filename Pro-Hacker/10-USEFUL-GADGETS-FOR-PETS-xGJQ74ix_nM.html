concerned

Dorothy can check up on Kim's daily
activities all data is automatically
synchronized with the application as
soon as he comes into range this means
you can adapt the ideal amount of food

users make sure your champion stays

rubbish at hidin sake even the clone
spotted you anyway no more hide and seek
with Kenneth it the application
automatically synchronizes with the
pendant and locates the fugitive

technology which gives the battery in
eight months life but you know what
Donnelly is really fond of that she can
match Kenneth it with the colour of her
purse or figure that one out your vet
can also access your pets profile and
adapt treatments and food advice
accordingly

hi grizzly dog and best friend I love
walks I mean who doesn't right
you can see this and this and this and
now I can take photos of all these
things

my heartbeat then sends it to a case
that holds one of their cameras
so every time I see something that
excites me and my heartbeat goes up it
snaps a photo
walks are even better now because I can
show people what I like what I saw today
what I did where I went what I smelled
who I made friends with I can show the
world who I am through my photos and
