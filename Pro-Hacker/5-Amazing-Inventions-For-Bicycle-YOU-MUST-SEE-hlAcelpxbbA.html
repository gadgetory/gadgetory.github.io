hello hey hey not much just hanging out
oh you want to meet up with our yeah I
can treat your attacks all right

or got annoyed with your bike lock so
what if you didn't need a key to use
your bike lock right you've seen that
before
but what if you actually didn't have to
do anything at all and your bike would
still be safe with I'd lock it we
created the world's first fully
automatic bike lock that does exactly
that I lock it automatically unlocks
your bike when you're in close proximity
so you can just get on it and ride and
once you leave your bike I lock it and
make sure it's safe all of this is fully
automatic so you don't have to press any
buttons or struggle with your bulky bike
lock with I lock it you can worry less
and enjoy more because that's what bike
riding should be about I locket is built
with strong and durable materials and
can be easily attached to most bikes and
e bikes and if your smartphone runs out
of battery you can easily open I lock it
with your custom click code also if you
don't want to take your smartphone with
you you can simply use the ID lock it
key fob instead to give you a higher
security I lock it not only locks your
bike but with its integrated sensors
also sets off an alarm in case anybody
tries to break it or tries to carry away
your bike so you will receive a
notification that someone is tampering
with your bike and the bike thief gets
scared away

long time simply add our additional
cable to secure your bike with a fixed
object no need to carry an additional
lock of course all I lock it functions
can be easily configured with the I
locket smartphone app for example you
can change the proximity for locking and
unlocking the eye locket app also allows
you to easily and securely share your
bike with friends and family with just a
couple of clicks sharing your bike has
never been easier
two years ago my girlfriend asked me to
give em all by so she could ride it to
work which I did and then I got scared
it scared because large cities are not
always a safe place to ride a bike you
have to slalom you a between potholes
the size of a truck and urban drivers
are not always the most patient or
diplomat citizens so what started asking
myself how could I make this better for
her and I made a list of all the basic
specifications that a perfect urban
mobility system would need to eat you
need maneuverability which means a short
wheelbase and a steep head to to reduce
your turning radius so you can manage
extremely tight corners a large front
wheel to overcome any obstacle the city
puts in your way a small motorized rear
wheel to increase acceleration and climb
steeper roads you should be standing in
an upright position
because there is a lot going on in the
city you need to keep an eye on your
surroundings and be able to get on and
off very easily it needs to be simple
easy to use intuitive and almost
maintenance-free
after months of brainstorming the basic
idea of the sneaky bike was boring a
vintage concept with a modern twist a
lot of sweat and tears later with many
talented people who joined the project
we ended up with an amazing product and
now the sneaky bike could be a
game-changer
