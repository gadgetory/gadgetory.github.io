here we go
amanda is a maker a practitioner of tech
wizardry and DIY magic and this maker
just got a new magic wand this is the
new optimist the optimist is a modular
three-in-one machine that includes a 3d
printer a laser and CNC mill it
assembles into two configurations and
creates finished products this machine
can make anything except waffles so we
designed the Optimus for people like
Amanda she's full cool ideas and wants
to create something new the way that
it's been though if you wanted to start
making you'd have to strike a deal with
a devil to finance a lot of machines and
a huge space to use them and unless
you're Tony Stark this situation is
about as convenient as a harpoon to the
face not convenient at all so we changed
that and created one flexible machine
with three essential tools that fits on
your desktop
this machine was forged in our small
team of makers engineers and designers
and we're driven by this idea that
making could be more fun easy and just a
better experience overall
so with that thinking we made the
Optimus simple to operate and maintain
and along with this machine we've
created an app to control it and also a
simplified 3d design program so Amanda
could start making fast while it's easy
to use this machine was built for
professionals who require top grade
tools this is what we're all about and
with quality in mind we built the
Optimus with all metal parts this
ensures that it's going to be reliable
sturdy and that it can bring your ideas
to life year after year
the modular design enables the whole rig
to quickly transform back and forth in
just a few minutes and the modular
design means it's easy to manufacture
and transport and because you don't need
to buy three separate machines you'll
save money then maybe you can buy that
waffle maker too
we know firsthand about the excitement
of holding your own designs so while
others may not get while you make tinker
or cosplay we do and we want to help you
make more stuff now you can bring the
optimist into full production we have
successfully built and tested 20
machines now the optimist is ready back
us and get your own three-in-one makers
