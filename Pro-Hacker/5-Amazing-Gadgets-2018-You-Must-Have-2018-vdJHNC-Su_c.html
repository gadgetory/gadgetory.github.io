partly cloudy 16 degrees how long to get
to work you should leave in 15 minutes
add a bottle of milk to make grocery
list a bottle of milk has been added to
your shopping list play my favorite song
now show me your chocolate egg recipe
video call mom hi boys
you made it of course it's us yes it's
us Wow wonderful
and who's coming home
policemen started latest episode and
turned out lights
switch to night mode
okay closing the shutters and lowering
their temperature
the appendant to doing an ultrasound
right now in any emergency department is
really access to the machine itself
that's been that the barrier that we've
always had is do we have access to the
technology when we need it to be able to
make a difference but having the machine
in your pocket and having it be any one
of the three transducers there's really
no more excuses you can use one single
transducer to look at structures that
are in the near field and then
structures that are deeper in the body
if I was going to do the rush protocol
where it involves multiple different
body areas multiple different
applications I can do that much quicker
with a butterfly Tobias versus a
standard part basis I no longer need to
change transducers that blows up the
entire ultrasound playing field that's a
big deal do it all with one probe is
amazing and I'd have to switch I could
really picture you're just carrying this
with you instead of a stethoscope
there's kidney it's really sharp in that
image qualities great I get to see what
I want to see I get to get the answers
that I need to get answered found my
vein and the resolution is is really
very nice for a handheld device it's
smaller but on as good a quality as the
that's the big machines I think it's
beautiful
yeah it sure is so I did the parasternal
long and then the subxiphoid and I have
never found it on paranal long so fast
right when they went into the right
place it was super clear so I was kind
of
from a point-of-care standpoint this
certainly answers most of the questions
which I'm looking for so I'm able to
assess the function of the heart I'm
able to look at the right heart the
interface you have with the patient now
it's kind of changed where it's not a
big scary procedure it's kind of like
here's what let's see your body that's
looking so this actually is great I
think I can just sneak this in and get a
quick exam and then get out of the way
of other people who are doing stuff and
the fact that you can control the gain
with your thumb so you can you know
while you're in there you're not trying
to hustle with knobs if I had it in my
pocket I would not have to search for it
and then I would be able to use it while
I was at the bedside of the patient on
my initial examination of the patient
getting IVs in other nurses gave me just
so much easier to see when you're trying
to place an IV so many applications it's
beyond just the traditional things we
think of ultrasound being used but in
other areas as well that we really have
never even explored before because we
haven't had the technology that allows
us to do it I would just carry it in my
pocket and use it a lot more than I
currently use my machine it will
absolutely revolutionize how we think
about ultrasound I scan with it
especially going from phase two linear
to curve I almost had to sit down they
explained to me the way that this matrix
this chip is you can steer the B me any
way you need to and it started to like
all of a sudden make a ton of sense to
me and of course we should be able to do
this and of course in the future there's
only be one transducer that just needed
to happen and it finally happened I just
had to kind of take a moment and process
that that was very exciting
you
introducing the Simtek smart sensor
reinventing security for the things that
you care about it's a small light motion
detector that alerts you when someone
gets into your things every day millions
of guns and other valuables are
supposedly secure in things like closets
jewelry boxes gun safes and storage
units but who's watching your stuff when
you're not around and how do you truly
know it's safe every year up to six
hundred thousand guns are stolen and
many are used in suicide accidents and
crimes despite the growing popularity of
gun safes here are the problems colonel
arms are designed for houses and not
saves gun owners don't want smart
technology that could restrict the use
of their firearms I decided to change
that and that's why I developed Simtek a
simple and effective way to monitor any
enclosed space like your gun save the
moment your safe is opened Simtek sends
you a text alert over a cellular
connection which is more reliable than
Bluetooth or Wi-Fi it's an extra layer
of security for the things that you care
about it's sleek and portable and it
uses infrared motion and light so there
are no false positives a common problem
for other sensors the battery can last a
full year on a single charge and because
it uses cellular connection you can take
it anywhere in the world without
additional setup I created sim tech to
help people understand what's going on
with their guns and their valuables
someone close to me almost took their
life with a gun and as an alumni of
Virginia Tech I understand all too well
what can happen when guns get into the
wrong hands my gun running friends tell
me that there's no easy way to reliably
monitor their saves but nobody wants a
product that could potentially restrict
the use of their guns and that's why I
developed sim tech a smart sensor that
can be used anywhere in anything to help
keep you and your things safe gun owners
around the country have been testing sim
tech and we've received great feedback
Engineering and design are complete and
we're ready for mass production
so back us today and know when your
belongings are accessed wherever they're
stored
