the go who want their babies protected
warm and secure without the hassle of
bulky baby clothes or thick onesies on
frozen winter mornings or chilly summer
evenings the cozy cover keeps your baby
protected from the elements in ultra
soft comfort cozy covers are universally
engineered with a shower cap design to
fit all standard baby carriers each cozy
cover also features dual zippers for
easy access and seals your baby into
durable weatherproof protection
cozy covers do not interfere with any of
the child safety straps and keep your
baby snuggled and warmth on cold winter
mornings while your car is still in that
deep freeze you might need that jacket
but your baby doesn't just zip up your
baby's cozy cover and off you go with
lots of color options available you can
keep your baby carrier looking
fashionable all the time the cozy cover
making your baby's carrier his or her
favorite place to be while you're on the
go
being a new parent is exhilarating and
exhausting it's full of wonder and worry
you know you never know what to do with
a newborn when you bring them home this
whole experience about being a mom is
unlike anything anybody can prepare you
for we developed the smart changing pad
to make it easy to track your baby's
weight feedings diaper changes all the
information syncs to your phone so you
can see how your baby is growing tell
how much your baby nurses during a
feeding and keep track of how much your
baby's sleeping I was really anxious
about whether I was making enough milk
but after using the smart changing pad
it showed me that I was actually
producing more milk nursing that I was
pumping I was so relieved
checking my baby's weight as part of our
regular routine gives me comfort that my
baby's okay
since my babies were born I tracked
pretty much everything diaper changes
how long they slept how much they ate
and what's great about the hatch baby
app is it keeps it all in one place I
just went back to work and I was really
worried about the transition but then
when I got a notification at work it
made me feel connected to him again
you'll know your baby's growing you'll
know your baby's healthy
and that means more time for the good
stuff the smart changing pad from hatch
you
