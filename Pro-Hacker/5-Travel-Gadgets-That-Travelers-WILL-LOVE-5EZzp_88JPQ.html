being outdoors is a big deal for me it
doesn't matter if I'm in the park next
door on the boat trip with my friends or
at the peak of the mountain on the other
side of the world in the end I think
it's all about chasing these rare
moments when you're totally at ease with
yourself I find these moments in nature
and quite frequently
he might be loved hammock honestly is
there a way not to be laid-back while
floating between two palm trees as a
matter of fact there is
mosquitoes for example experts in mood
for even worse falling coconuts and of
course rain the ark enemy of hammock
lovers around the globe said were true
Emig lava sometimes do live an
uncomfortable and dangerous life in
order to change that we have created the
flying tent it's a complete redesign of
what a hammock can be you can use it
with the mosquito net if it starts
raining sip up the rain cover and you
will find yourself relaxing in a
waterproof floating tent you can also
set it up on the ground as a BB tent or

product that exceeds all our initial
expectations for the last step of this
