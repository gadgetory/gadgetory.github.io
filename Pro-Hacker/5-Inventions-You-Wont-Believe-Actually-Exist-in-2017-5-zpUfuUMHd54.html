you
about six months ago we decided to make
the m3 D Pro based on getting feedback
from our existing users so we've already
gone through three iterations of design
prototypes and we're almost completely
done the engineering three months ago we
proved a lot of the important concepts
like making a heated bed that uses less
power proving that it can move a lot
faster proving the benefits of higher
quality and higher precision metal part
and right now we're going through the
final phases of proving the feedback
system and finishing the next steps in
programming our goal with the mm3d pro
is to make the most reliable 3d printer
in history and the way we're going to do
it is by combining a full suite of
sensors we call our sensor network with
precision metal parts the combination
allows the printer to become more
self-aware and it can correct for errors
that are common in all 3d printers a
cheap one vent expensive poems things
such as filament to Nags printhead
crashes even power outages first time I
ever heard about 3d printing was one of
my friends printed a ninja warrior
training hold and I thought it was
really cool the unique thing that you're
getting with em 3d throw that we have
not yet seen in this industry is that
ability for the printer to send many
different things within itself it has
the ability to sense position
has the ability to sense speed has the
ability to sense temperature in five
different places and if there's a
problem it can be self diagnosed and in
almost all cases can be felt corrected
ultimately that gives you more time in
the creative process with 3d printing I
have right on my desk or my
granddaughter's head right on their desk
if they get an idea they can try to make
that idea on a 3d printer right there
they can turn their ideas into reality
this I didn't have when I was a kid
really the greatest advancements of 3d
printing could accomplish at any point
in the future is ease of use making it
so that anybody can just go from an idea
to creating that idea within an
afternoon we've introduced this new
thing we call tutorial mode cool we got
from our feedback from original backers
was that they wanted more detailed
guides so they can grow into becoming a
expert user rather than having start as
an extra user the thing I think that
needs to happen for educators is speed
is an issue how fast we can turn around
so with mca pro you have the ability to
print a single prototype with extreme
accuracy and high quality but you also
have the ability to take that prototype
and print it in quantity cover the
entire print bed with multiples of your
model and enter these fitted volume i am
so excited to put the future not only
for me my daughter to grow up being able
to use her mind to create anything she
wants to thanks to the 3d pen I've been
fascinated with just the whole idea of
3d printing for quite a while now
focusing on just simple things that I
could print for around the house or you
know toys that I could print to play
with my kids really just the idea that I
could create something myself so the
answer a pro is already successfully
funded and is the largest crowdfunding
screen printed this year
due to popular demand we're opening up
pre-orders using the
go go in demand play and what m3d is
doing I think many people are going to
see is extremely innovative and they're
going to want to be first to support it
and to help nurture where the technology
is going to go
they just also happen to get a printer
as one of their rewards very early and
at a deep discount
we all want to live in a smart home but
sometimes the life just takes us away
from home
most of our smart home gadgets are not
portable it's 2016 we should live in the
future so let's do something about it
this is Yas wit it enables you to turn
anywhere your smart home it's a portable
smart home gadget that allows you to
remote-control the air-conditioner TV
and DVD player no matter where you are
now let me show you how I use use with
Tudor my apartment into a smart home by
taking out the yos wit from my pocket I
can always cool down my living room turn
on the TV and lighting with the app
sometimes I feel really tired after
parties or dinner gatherings I usually
bring my yo Sloot with me when I need to
take a nap in my bedroom
by pressing one button and I can enjoy a
deep sleep at my preferable temperature
and go so it will automatically adapt
and to life and the seasons change if
you want to pre cool the room while
you're away you can also use the
patented mob mob hub solution for the
outdoor remote control
no hub or router is needed with the O's
wet I can make anywhere smart
apart from putting yos would at home you
can bring it along with you and make
your life smarter when you're on the go
with yos with inside your luggage you
can find a place to sit down and enjoy
while others are waiting Yost will
promptly immediately when your luggage
arrived sometimes you can't watch
yourself as closely as you like to leave
yours within your bags will alert you
when your stuff go wandering off when
you can't find your phone after
packaging luggage just press the button
to find your phone with your favorite
great challenge ok looks like there is
one button but really there are five and
you can customize them to fit your need
deals we can recharge anything with the
USB charger that come with the
rechargeable three eight batteries which
helps to keep your phone juiced up
longer hello you go go this is the yoke
wiki
let's develop yo three for over a year
we need your support to bring the idea
to real life and take your suite to mass
production
