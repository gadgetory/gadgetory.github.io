you
damn that's me
it's really just the fact that you can
just throw a camera in between these
little spots and cracks you've never
been able to do before it's the same
prices really hi I'm Andrea from Barrow
where we aim to make the impossible film
shop hostile introducing the next
generation table camp we enable easy
filming in places even drones can't go
this is the viral life the first ever
portable and easy to use cable cam the
light kit is the perfect extension to
your existing camera setup the viral
light is foldable making it easy to
carry with you in a backpack and with
the intuitive mounting system it can be
set up in less than three minutes we
wanted to create something that will
make people go wow how did they do that
when they saw the video going through
windows from cars really Packwood's
or other places where you would never
imagine flying a camera but at the same
time keep it so simple that anyone can
use it
even though it's the first time
operating a cable cam you would
definitely be successful
the viral light goes fast enough to
follow the action of high speed and slow
enough to capture that perfect
time-lapse shot and the battery will it
last up to three hours with lights
indicating how much you have left
that is so cool exactly the tool is that
we need it in the sport it takes less
than a minute set up and your way to go
get the bangin shots just like the pros
with our background from arranging and
filming extreme sport events and
festivals we have seen that more and
more filmmakers from beginner to pro
level are seeking new angles when
capturing their most extreme and
memorable moments on video that's why we
wanted to make viral light available for
everyone and compatible with any camera
and stabilizer up to three point three
pounds
have to admit first few times I used it
I got a little bit carried away of the
speed and it finger was gonna go as fast
as it did which is pretty damn far I
always came back up and kept asking for
more even shooting films professionally
for about seven years and I've never
seen a product that can do that
with our strong team of engineers
filmmakers and athletes we're bringing
this product to life here on Kickstarter
we've iterated and tested the product
with lead users from all over the world
and the product is now ready for
manufacturing but we need your help to
press play on production back us today
and you can start to be creative with
your filmmakers and to make that
impossible shot possible

significant discount pledge not
does this situation look familiar you're
flipping your pillow at night
desperately trying to fall asleep noona
is a unique device that understands your
sleeping pattern and regulates your head
temperature to help you get the best
possible sleep Munna will help you to
start your day feeling fully recovered
and energetic keep well live well hi I'm
David and this is Colleen and we're the
founders of Munna for years it took me
hours every night to fall asleep so we
decided to do something about it
together we developed a product that not
only gets you to sleep faster but also
helps you get the best sleep until it's
time for you to wake up so how do we do
that
with temperature
temperature is the key to good sleep to
fall asleep our body needs to cool down
and know where temperatures help us get
a better sleep quality when we wake up
it is the opposite our body needs to
warm up and our head plays a critical
role in this temperature regulation
that's why munna improves your sleep by
regulating your pillow temperature
simply place the device on your bedside
table insert the pad into your
pillowcase and use the app to set the
wake up time the temperature of the pad
is regulated through a water circulation
system which cools down as you lay in
bed to help you fall asleep faster sleep
and environment sensors combined with
machine learning help understand your
perfect sleeping pattern and regulate
the temperature accordingly when it's
time Munna will gently warm up and wake
you can actually with the app you will
get key insights on your sleep and how
to improve it further we believe that is
not about how long you sleep but how
well you sleep so by improving your
night Munna also improves your day body
temperature is very important for sleep
quality
so Munna is one of the best sleep
technology to improve sleep we've done
more than 200 user tests and have an
ongoing clinical study we have spent the
last four months in Shenzhen China
working closely with manufacturers to
make sure we have a great design and can
ship a quality product on time to our
backers we've been working on this
project for nearly two years now and
we're finally ready for production we
want to bring you better sleep now all
we need is your support thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
