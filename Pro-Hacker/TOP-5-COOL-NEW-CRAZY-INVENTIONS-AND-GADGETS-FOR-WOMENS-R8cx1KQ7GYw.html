basal body temperature is a key
indicator fertility basal temperature is
the lowest temperature your body reaches
while resting and the differences over
the course of the ovarian cycle reveal
when you're most fertile in the past
tracking your basal temperature has been
a challenge many women find it
frustrating and tiring we want it to
make the process of tracking BBT data
seamless so we created Yo no Yo no is a
revolutionary patent-pending wearable
thermometer it measures and records your
core body temperature while you sleep
giving your true basal temperature
meaning that the data is more accurate
than any other method
unlike underarm sensors which can easily
be affected by ambient temperature and
other external factors
Yano creates an enclosed and controlled
environment in the ear canal preventing
external factors from affecting the
measurement it's designed by top human
factor designers but comfort in mind
soft silicone surrounds the exterior so
the device will fit snugly in your ear
without feeling invasive Yano doesn't
transmit data during your sleep to
protect you from emissions in the
morning the data will conveniently sync
with your phone with a user-friendly
Yano app we'll keep a running log of
your ovulation calendar you don't even
need to think about it the app and
algorithm interprets your ovulation
cycle and predicts when you're most
likely to conceive with yo no tracking
your fertility is as natural as your
desire to be a mother
women find it very challenging to
measure their basal body temperature
they have to measure it exactly the same
time every day you know is a very
convenient device you simply place the
device in your ear you go to sleep you
wake up and you take it out all the data
is automatically
did in the cloud for you the you know
product has many benefits you can not
only use it to detect your basal body
temperature and predict your ovulation
but you can also use it to understand
your hormonal health and use it for
family planning
Yano is a company that is founded by
female entrepreneurs these women know
and really care about female health when
I was trying to get pregnant a couple of
years ago I found the process very
stressful and I found collecting basal
temperature data is very difficult and
frustrating so I thought about
leveraging the latest most innovative
wearable technology to make the process
easier and more convenient take the next
step towards building your family and
have Yano start tracking your fertility
