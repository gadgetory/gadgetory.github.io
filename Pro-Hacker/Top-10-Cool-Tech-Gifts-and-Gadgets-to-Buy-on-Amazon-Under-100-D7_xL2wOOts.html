hi I'm Dave I like to make things for
the longest time I've been looking for a
building system that's strong yet
convenient and affordable problem is I
just couldn't find what I was looking
for so I created makeup light it's
simple affordable easy to use system of
connectors that pairs with inexpensive
electrical conduit the result is a
building platform with endless
possibilities it's a smart elegant way
to create what you love let me tell you
the things you can make with it are
infinite so if you're like John and need
to support your leisurely hobbies Cheers
or if you go for something a little bit
more on the extreme side let's see what
you got
what I'm saying is mega pipe is fun the
only limit to what you can use it for is
your imagination our desire was not only
to make something endlessly creative but
also affordable which we did and here's
how electrical condo is an extremely
inexpensive type of metal pipe that
electricians use all the time you can
find it at almost any hardware store the
maker pipe connector system turns that
conduit into one of the most versatile
and cost-effective building materials
you can find but not only is maker pipe
easy to build and adjust it's completely
reusable so build something you love and
if you get tired of it turn it into
something else and when you get tired of
that well you get the picture
transforming it from one thing to the
next or even breaking it down to move it
is as easy as turning a hex bolt making
it extremely portable but this
portability doesn't mean you have to
sacrifice the integrity of your bills
maker pipe is super strong and durable
to demonstrate we have the biggest guy
we know stand on it and then we gave
them an engine yes yes thank you thank
you mr. president we've all received
some great feedback on these connectors
makers love it students and educators
love it
robotics teams love it hackerspaces love
it
and we know that once you get your hands
on it you're going to love it too with
your help we can put these connectors
into mass production and start you on
your way to making your very own designs
of reality so check out the building
kits we have available through our
Kickstarter and join our maker community
back maker pipe today so we can make
these connectors and you can make well
anything you want
hi everyone my name is Dan
I was pen pal technology founded in 1991
we specialize in the back intelligent
human machine interface technology we
are bringing the technology in to the
next level by designing a plan scanner
what else can X that work with
smartphone wirelessly computers with
this scanner user can actually test
sentence and the Cumberland Index
Angus number by integrating with this
debt water scan s can also turn your
smartphone into an electronic chest
look Sam
you
sinusoidal
during the drafting process without made
great effort and overcome a lot of
difficulty we go through dynamic appear
by optimizing the transmission
especially life also our stage also
showing method to ensure we get a
passing for higher retention hundreds
now we are almost there and we need your
help to bridge this project and then the
action is
good thank you
introducing the world's first magnetic
connector for iPhone 7 because Apple is
combine the audio jack and the power
jack into one connector on the iPhone 7
we are now able to give you a magnetic
connector that connects your data audio
and fast charging in a single click it's
never been working these magnetic
connectors are vastly superior to
mechanical connection not only are they
way more convenient to use
they're also far more resistant to dust
water and other contaminants all this
added reliability to greatly improve
your peace of mind our engineering team
has worked very hard to make this
connector as small as possible we have
also developed the two-in-one connector
that works with Android and Apple device
if you've already successfully completed
a pilot manufacturing run of over 1,000
units we have done extensive testing to
ensure their reliability over extended
me if you're interested please contact
us now for our early review
please support us and make this a
reality we cannot do it without you
I never really thought it was a problem
I'd always suspected those around me had
seen my incessant pen clicking me
shaking and desk tapping but I had no
idea how bad they got
I just figured it all the time with
anything I could get my hands on didn't
matter what a bubble wrap
Oh a bubble wrap the way a pop pop pop
I just couldn't get enough that was
probably wrong
thankfully my Kickstarter community
from the people that brought you to ad
comes over the counter fidget cube
fidget cube is a final desk toy designed
to satisfy any urges to click roll spin
and other common fidgety impulses
without driving your colleagues and
loved ones away
the GQ is a cube that you fit with
studies have suggested that fidgeting
increases focus and improves
productivity side effects may include a
sudden ability to cope with boring
meetings pay attention in class power
through Netflix marathons budget cube is
designed to allow discrete visioning in
any setting do not news widget cube if
you have an aversion to rectangular
prisms digicube lets me satisfy my
fidgeting without endlessly annoying
those around me I thought I could stop
at any time and now I realize I don't
want to fidget cube can help take the
first step to fidget in freedom today
okay so in all seriousness we make joke
about fidgeting we give our friends and
coworkers a hard time for the pen
clicking and the nail biting but what if
there aren't simple what opinion is a
coping mechanism a way for us to sleep
focused and more present in the moment
sometimes is smarter than us believe
that we have this thing called floating
attentions which makes it hard for us to
focus in certain circumstances okay hey
Mark yeah yeah and actually fidgety has
been shown to be able to help keep that
floating attention occupied which helps
you better focus on the task at hand
what's maybe even a little crazier is
that some recent studies have suggested
that students who use fidgeting as a
mechanism during testing tend to perform
better on those tests and when they're
Arts itself fidget cube has been a
project we've dreamt about for almost 4
years now and we're excited to finally
be bringing it to you it's been a long
road with a lot of prototypes but we
think we're going
when designing fidgets cube we wanted to
ensure two things first the
functionality needed to truly satisfy
fidgeting needs it needed to be an
entire toolbox of fidgety options while
staying small and compact which leads us
to our second and equally important
priority we wanted fidget cube to be a
premium desk toy that could be
discretely used in any situation from a
classroom to a boardroom the fidget cube
of course has six sides
Oh
we really think vegek youth has so many
different applications and we're so
looking forward to you trying out
lockers thank you so much for your
support
we love music especially live music but
experts agree that long exposure to
levels of sound over 85 decibels can
cause hearing loss most clubs and
concerts are over 100 decibels the
maximum save time without protection at
that level is around 15 minutes if you
enjoy attending clubs concerts or other
loud events you need to protect your
hearing but traditional earplugs usually
have some color and stick out of your
ear which makes you look funny that's
why we created ear dial the comfortable
and discreet hearing protection
specially designed for loud music
environments ear dial is perfect for
music lovers partygoers DJs musicians
bartenders bouncers and anyone that
wants to hear clearly and safely in a
loud music event I started ear dial
because one day I came out of a
nightclub with my ears ringing so much
but it lasted for days
later I learned that that ringing means
percentage of hearing loss permanently
and once lost hearing cannot be restored
here dial has a high fidelity noise
filter that will block the harmful
frequencies without sacrificing sound
quality you will be able to enjoy the
music and chat with your friends while
protecting your hearing in fact our
earplugs will enhance the music
experience to most people because they
remove the ear pain factor from the loud
music our design is as discreet as
possible we made it low-profile so it
doesn't stick out of your ear but it is
still easy to put and remove we use a
high transparency color for both the
silicone and the filter so when you put
them in your ear
they take the tone of your skin and are
almost invisible we made them out of
hypoallergenic silicone so it will be
nice to your skin no matter how
sensitive it is the silicone is very
soft so you can wear them comfortably
for long hours the elasticity of the
silicone make your earplugs very
resistant and you'll be able to reuse
them for many years most likely forever
our exclusive earwax protection will
protect the precision filter so you'll
have your earplugs clean and with a
sound for longer you'll also get a
compact aluminum case with your earplugs
this case is small and with a strong
lobster clasp perfect to put in your
keychain or pocket and carry with you
comfortably at all times the aluminum
case has an easy to open and close cap
so you can use it even if you've had a
few drinks without the risk of stripping
the thread in the aluminum case there's
also a plastic storage tray that let you
store and take out your earplugs easy
and safely reducing the risk of losing
them in the middle of the dance floor we
developed a companion mobile app that
will tell you the approximate sound
level pressure you are currently exposed
to and it will tell you how long you can
stay at that level without risk of
hearing loss you can compare the results
if you're wearing ear dial earplugs or
not when you activate the ear dial
switch it will adjust the calculations
based on the ear dial attenuation levels
we're on a mission to bring awareness
and let people enjoy loud social events
while protecting our hearing against
noise induced hearing loss and tinnitus
we donate five percent of our profits to
charities like dangerous decibels and
action hearing loss when you support ear
dial you're also supporting a good cause
we have already a working prototype for
both the ear plugs and the app and if
this campaign is successful we will be
able to do the testing and certification
and place the book order to make this
product a reality join our cause enjoy
music safely and become one of the first
adopters of ear dial today
hi I'm Mitch I'm an industrial designer
at a small firm called human scope I've
been developing products now for about
10 years and one of the very first
products I worked on that went to market
was a night light night lights come in a
wide range of styles they all have the
same cheap materials lackluster
aesthetics and minimal functions with
all me we want to develop a nightlight
that has a wide range of functionality
that not only looks great in your home
but it's made and designed well
like most other night lights Oh me has
an LDR sensor in it which allows the
lights come on automatically when it
gets dark
however only also has fully adjustable
RGB LED lights which offer over 16
million color options via the MAF the
apple also let return only on or off dim
or brighten the light set timers and
more
unlike traditional night lights only is
better it has a built-in rechargeable
battery which means when the power goes
out
your only stays on it also means you can
take all me with you or put it on your
child's bedside table so when they wake
up in the middle of the night they can
take on little monsters and with the
folding prongs safe they're not grabbing
at it out of an outlet the team at human
scope and I are really excited about
this product we have a prototype now we
need your help to move into production
please check out our campaign below let
us know if you have any questions thank
you we put a lot of energy into our days
what if we could get some of that energy
back ampie is a wearable device that
captures the energy from your motion
throughout the day and turns it into
power for your phone your movement is
your power
and that's about it that's that's all
there is to it wait cut that's it yeah
you you move and you're plugging this is
supposed to be a three-minute video
you're killing me
tages Mike and I met during our
engineering PhDs at Northwestern we all
had the same problem our phones would
die before the end of the day so many
people have this problem over the past
year and a half we've refined the
technology inside NP we've optimized the
power generation components to the point
where you can still produce significant
power while maintaining a small
form-factor
you don't need to be an athlete any
motion will charge it we knew we were on
to something when MP kept winning crowd
favorite prizes of business competitions
everyone kept asking if they could get
one people loved the idea of taking
control over their charging habits it
frees them from the wall and motivates
them to get moving an P is designed to
just fit into your life its shape
matches the curves of your body and it's
easy to slip into your pocket or pop
into your purse if you live in a city
you probably walk enough to extend your
phone's battery life by three hours if
you also go on a run or maybe go cycling
you can extend it by six hours the more
you move the more power you get or you
can use an P to charge your wearable
devices or any other device the charges
via USB but you don't need to use the
power right away you can store it for
however long you want and use it when
your device is needed most now we know
that everyone's different and some
people move in some pretty creative ways
so we've designed an accessory kit that
lets you move just about any way you
want we can't wait to hear how you use
an v if you want to know how much power
you're getting out you can check the
companions marks on it that lets you
track the energy you've generated along
with the calories you burn with AM P
you're producing green energy
we've got fully functional prototypes
being tested by our pilot customer
and they love them we're continuously
collecting feedback and making
improvements but now we need your
support for the final step to move ampie
towards full-scale manufacturing we're
so excited about what's to come one day
our technology can be integrated
directly into smart watches fitness
trackers and other crazy wearables that
haven't been invented yet so you never
have to put them in but it all starts
now so join us help us bring ampie to
the world that better yeah can I get one
your home is your sanctuary worth
protecting but it's filled with smart
