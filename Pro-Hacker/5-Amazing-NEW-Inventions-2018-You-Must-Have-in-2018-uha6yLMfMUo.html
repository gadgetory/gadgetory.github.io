hi my name is y and I'm the designer
behind abhava home cam we're driven to
design experiences they are simple to
use beautiful to the eye and meaningful
on a daily basis and that's what we've
achieved with abhava home can after
extensive explorations and by reducing
all extraneous details we finally
arrived at a very simple spherical form
that elegantly captures all the
functions and features require a design
principle that carries through all
aspects of the Vava home cam experience
we invite you to join us on this project
there are two main things that make
fiddlestick different and in my opinion
better than all the other fidget toys
one and the most important being the
loop-the-loop opens up possibilities
that no other fidget toy has where you
can actually turn this into a
skill-based toy or just flick it around
like you would your keys I love flicking
my keys around when I create in my
office when I'm coming up with ideas or
I'm sitting down for a creative jam
session I found that the number one
thing I would do is twist my keys around
my finger there was something
therapeutic almost hypnotic about it
my name is Adam Wilber I'm an inventor
and a creator but I'm also a magician I
use my hands is my livelihood it's how I
feed my children so I really do have
something in my hands about 23 hours out
of every day and and that really pushed
me to realize I'm a fidgeter I think in
reality most people off
the fiddlestick is very much a fidget
toy it has all the fun buttons and dials
and tactile fixation tools that you
would want out of your fidget toy but it
does have a few added bonuses which
really takes it to another level right
up top the joystick in a perfect organ
on edge position got a tactile surface
that just feels great on the thumb light
switch for clicky buttons pinball wheel
and two gears on the right side the
worry stone and last but not least is
your slider which is set to the perfect
tension the other differentiator of the
fiddlestick is that it is a bit modulate
and what I mean by that is that you can
take it as a very slim minimalistic I'm
going out and about and I want to keep
kind of a low-key fidget or you can say
look I'm gonna party I want to be the
center of attention and you add on our
led attachment when you get a little bit
of work into this you go to a party it's
light or it's dark outside and you start
fiddling you will be the center of
attention whether you like it or not
with one successful Kickstarter already
under our belt we know we can make this
happen for the holidays the only thing
missing is you we would love to bring
the Kickstarter community into the final
stages of manufacturing let's have some
fun learn some moves give a gift or two
and join the fidgets revolution choose
