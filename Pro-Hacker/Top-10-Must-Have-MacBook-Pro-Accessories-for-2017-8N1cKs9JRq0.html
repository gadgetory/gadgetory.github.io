new devices featuring the powerful new
USB type-c port your entire computer's
power data transfer and output through a
single port it's the heights of
technological simplicity but what about
your stuff and when you need to
multitask how do you fit it all into a
single port your stuff needs marble the
first integrated system designed to work
with a USB C port
the marvel offers a single compact way
to connect your many devices to your new
MacBook it's got two USB ports two USB
sea ports an HDMI type a port a micro SD
card reader and a 60 watt AC Inlet to
power it all it's the only system made
to charge your new macbook while also
powering all of your devices
think of marble as your new supercharger
it gives you all the functionality of
having your devices nearby and connected
as though they were still plugged
straight into your computer and just
like the new MacBook marble is easy to
take with you no need to bring your Mac
adapter with you on the road
bring marble and you'll be able to power
your devices and your computer while
you're on the go
marble was designed to be relatively the
same size as your computer standard
power adapter and when you consider the
other mess that marble enables you to
leave at home
marble makes a whole lot of sense if you
constantly find yourself on the move
marble saves you space saves you weight
and has the ease-of-use you need
easily switch from working at the office
to home to your favorite cafe around the
corner use the micro SD card port to get
access to your videos and photos
instantly with marble you have the
versatility and portability you need to
work from anywhere and while you work
charge your phone your tablet and your
computer in the same place and have
access to all your files at once while
you're at it it's kind of like having
your entire office fit neatly in your
pocket depending on your needs marble
comes in two powerful options the DC s1
which features two USB 3.0 ports two USB
seaports one HDMI type-a port and the
micro SD reader while the DC s2 switches
the HDMI type a for an HDMI type D port
and throws in a mini DisplayPort for
your heavy duty needs like connecting
multiple external monitors when it's
time to get some serious work done at
the office there's no need to sacrifice
simplicity for the sake of extra power
run your monitors your hard drives even
your printers through the marble and
save yourself a headache or two marble
is super sleek super portable and most
importantly it's got the energy you need
to get the job done
and remember marble works with any
computer that supports USB see
technology systems like the Dell XPS 13
9350 and the huawei mate book among
others the potential of using the marble
4 USB C ported devices is continuing to
grow every day
get marbled and supercharge your life
it just doesn't make sense to me that in
this day and age were still forced to
fragment where we store our files so
this is tar disk it's what we built we
start with a solid unibody aluminum
enclosure we use the fastest mlc flash
memory modules paired with the fastest
4k flash controllers on the market would
take all that and we put it into a
package where the data is transferred
through 14-karat gold contacts and then
the cool part is what's happening on the
inside here's how it works
TARDIS pair seamlessly merges with your
macbook so instead of having two
separate drives during all your files
now you have two drives that are paired
working together as one the files that
you use most are prioritized to obtain
the same speeds you've come to expect
from your MacBook from there on it's
automatic nothing to manage nothing to
do it just works and it's really fast
TARDIS creates a new product category
and it's a true end-to-end solution for
anyone that's run out of storage space
on a modern macbook computer everything
is happening on the backend it happens
automatically
it happens seamlessly and it's fast
you
this is st. st. helps you be less
distracted by pressing the gorgeous st.
button on your desk you start a focused
work session this means the Saint
software
kicks into action and blocks distracting
apps and websites on your computer st.

your productivity in a fun and easy way

work and allows you to compete with

founder of the McAfee Antivirus company
since leaving the company I've become
part of bigger and better things this is
my new product every key give you places
all of my passwords and my keys with
this I can unlock my phone while I'm
around and my phone locks back down when
I'm away hello there I'm also John
McAfee but I don't need in every key I
keep all of my passwords on a secure
document see this replaces all of those
have nothing's perfect it's not just the
key to my phone it's also the key to my
laptop and my website accounts I use one
of these to unlock my house this is also
the key to my house and my car I can
carry it on one of these if I need hang
on I know it's one of these
sure that that sounds good till you lose
it if I lose it I can remotely freeze it
then use my old passwords until I find
it again show me another key that can do
that we are the revolution of access
control we are every key how many times
a day do you type in your password can
be both easy to remember and secure
enough to protect your computer well
choose a short and simple one and your
online security can be compromised
choose a long one and it's just not
convenient and we aren't talking just
one password here right how many do you
have one for your local account one for
the mail one for the Facebook don't you
just hate we need to memorize every
single one of them they may seem to be
necessary evil to ensure your privacy
but in reality all protection you need
isn't the tip of your finger fingerprint
identification is not a new technology
for years it has proven itself to be a
reliable method of securing valuable
things from military facilities to
smartphones but as of now in order to
use it you either need to buy an
expensive laptop with pre-installed
scanner or a separate scanning device
and all of them are just too big and
clunky they rely on old swipe technology
plus if you need to use your device you
have to plug in or connect USB cable and
then disconnect it and keep it
separately but here is another way I
present to you the I touch ID it's the
first fingerprint scanner that is secure
and efficient on the inside while being
small and compact on the outside yes I
touch ID the world's smallest USB
fingerprint scanner edge is six
millimeters thin is easily the world's
slimmest scanner it is incredibly thin
you can plug it in and keep it plugged
in forever the body of the device is
made out of a single piece of aircraft
aluminium with hard anodized finish and
laser-cut sapphire glass when creating I
touch
our priorities were security reliability
is a usage compact size and best quality
materials all these are parts of a new
philosophy of using a fingerprint
scanner for computers I touch ad has no
buttons or cables you just plug it in
and start using skinning of our
fingerprints takes only half a second
and the fingerprint data is stored
inside the eye touch ID security call
where it cannot be accessed by anyone as
I touch ID you'll be able to access your
computer's user account to your Facebook
Twitter Instagram or any other web site
online accounts that you previously
would lock onto the password and all of
it with just one touch you can use much
stronger and longer password 12 or more
symbols without any problems just put
your finger on the eye touch ID and
you're in you don't need to worry that
people around you your classmates
colleagues business partners buddies
your wife or husband would see your
password your private photos videos
documents and any other information will
always be protected even from hackers
from North Korea the eye touch ID is
compatible with both Windows and Mac
operating systems everybody has a unique
identifier which gives you the new level
of security and ability to encrypt your
data or communication with two level
authentications with just a touch of
your finger I touch ID is might
withstand both digital and physical
dangers the devices impact scratch and
water-resistant so it will always
maintain its functionality and outlook
we touch team truly believe that I touch
ID is the best alternative to passwords
and the best fingerprint scanner of its
kind but in order for it to become
reality we need your help by supporting
