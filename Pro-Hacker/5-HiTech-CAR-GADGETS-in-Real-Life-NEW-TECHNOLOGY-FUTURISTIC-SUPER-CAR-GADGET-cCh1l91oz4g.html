it's Monday are you going to the office
yes great
this will take 24 minutes please turn on
the radio playing kiss FM you have a new
whatsapp message from Sarah Rocca would
you like to hear it yes please
the message is meat for lunch today do
you want to reply yes send cool half
past 12:00 it's all I got
cool half past 12:00 at soul house
should I send this message yes please
done
Chris I'm running late please call Peter
you have three contacts with the name
Peter which Peter would you like to call
Peter Abraham Peter Maer Peter Wolf okay
calling Peter Wolf there's a traffic jam
ahead causing a 10-minute delay you can
save five minutes with an alternative
route okay please take the alternative
route okay please take the next left
turn
Chris please play the Spotify top 50
Brian we need to talk about your musical
taste
this is out of Herman compared to the
other car extinguishers he because up
the veteran track let's see what exactly
it can do generally speaking car fire
always secured firstly around the engine
usually the driver cannot that is in
time and the situation become more
serious
ten minutes past the situation will end
like this if you have out of Herman the
situation will be completely different
now I'm in saline and out of Herman in
the engine compartment these two magnets
will be attached to the engine
compartment the installation is within
30 seconds
not only the installation is fast but it
also can put out fire quickly when the
temperature in the engine compartment is
up to 600 Celsius
the pillion sensor will detect the high
temperature or up and higher it will
activate the auto extinguisher and it
start to release the extinguishing the
car fire can be put out within 30
seconds tired of cleaning that Severn
brake dust with sponges chemicals and
brushes that simply just don't work
introducing the brush hero the brush
hero easily cuts through dirt and brake
dust blasting through tight spaces
around lug nuts wheel spokes and grills
brush hero's patented technology is
created with high quality injection
molded plastic that never corrodes
requires no batteries or electricity and
provides strong water powered cleaning
and detailing for cars motorcycles bikes
furniture barbecue window screens pets
and more the brush hero has an amazing
amount of torque and is powered only by
your garden hose it's strong enough to
remove muck and grease but soft enough
to clean paint and car windows without
scratching use the interchangeable soft
brush for Chrome and the harder brush to
get stubborn grease off your grill or
caked on muck off your mountain bike
boat or garden tools simply push on a
brush flip the Handy on/off switch and
start cleaning get your brush hero today
and blast the grime away
you

waste when engulfed by mass production
accelerating consumption and rampant
materialism products are designed to
become obsolete when discarded for the
next big thing but a pleating our
natural resources at astonishing rates
or public pollutants and trash into the
environment developments and
sustainability are promising but they're
not happening fast enough and the
solutions are still too expensive and
inaccessible what if we can make a
machines last longer run more
efficiently and self-improve instead of
supporting the high turnover consumerism
that we see today what if we had
solution here and now that's our mission
at try boat X we're tackling the problem
of waste by creating the first of its
kind nanoparticles that actually repair
machines while increasing performance
and efficiency harnessing the power of
nanotechnology we came off a small
solution to this big problem private X
nanoparticles have two faces one
deadlines I want less slides a sticky
side reinforces and strengthens while
the slippery side reduces friction just
like carbon telling to diamond in a
mantle of the earth
TurboTax sulfa lies through a diamond
like lattice structure under the heat
and pressure of the engine unlike other
protective proteins this process
actually reverses engine where particle
by particle restores it to a better than
new condition or initial focus was to
make lubricants safer among many
nanomaterials we worked on one unique
outlier reduced friction dramatically
down to super lubricity level with the
help of national labs and research
agencies we understood the mechanism and
developed proprietary production
products after years of research and
rigorous testing were proud to introduce
car boss a safe and green additive for
your car by improves gas mileage boosts
host power and extends the life of your
engine car boss comes in a small
recyclable applicator that you inject
into the oil fill of your car
as you drive turbo text nanoparticles
are forged into a diamond like armor
around engine components rejuvenating a
daily driver to become more efficient
then when it was new
a third of the gas that you put in your
car is wasted on engine friction with
612 million cars on the road that waste
adds up running on car boss will use
less fuel reduce pollution and leave a
smaller carbon footprint we're ready to
go to market and we need your help back
our Kickstarter and be the first to
adopt a revolutionary technology
well make our world more efficient more
powerful and more sustainable car boss
