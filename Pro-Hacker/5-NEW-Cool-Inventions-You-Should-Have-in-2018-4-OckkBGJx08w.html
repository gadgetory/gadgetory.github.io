we live in a world dominated by an
outdated financial system that is no
longer serving us the system pressures
and subjects us to financial oppression
through time this pressure will
eventually give rise to many health
problems and today most hospital visits
are due to high levels of stress and
anxiety making it a very serious public
health concern many recent and ongoing
scientific studies demonstrate that
regular breathing yoga and meditation
exercise will help reduce stress levels
and naturally contributing to overall
health benefits the Zhen Val offers a
complete and unique solution for
interactive breathing yoga and
meditation practice yoga sessions start
off with the real-time biometric data
being captured from the user's posture
sensor inside the Zen Val sensor then
being relayed to a smartphone app in
order to validate the postures the
typical meditation session starts off
with the real-time biometric data being
captured from the user's respiratory
effort and being relayed to the lights
on the Zen Val meditation pad creating
an interactive and magical atmosphere
with each inhalation and exhalation
literally breathing in the light and
breathing out the darkness after you
finish each session you'll receive in
your digital wallet a small quantity of
a digital currency called Zen Val coins
similar to bitcoins the Zen Val
smartphone app has a built-in GPS
locator that allows users to schedule a
group practice in group practice all
users in the group are rewarded
multiples in Val coins before mankind
goes off and explores Mars and other
planets the Zen Val recommends we
explore our inner selves first
I hope you've enjoyed the video from the
product demo a lot of compassion and
effort was put into making it this is
actually what makes me get out of bed in
the morning the hope of possibilities
that we can actually still change the
world into a better place as I see it
the technology behind cryptocurrencies
give us the opportunities to start over
fresh for me the Zenvo is a fresh new
vision for the world and all its
inhabitants the project will be launched
in two phases in phase one we will
launch the Zen valve sensor and the
meditation pad and shortly after users
start receiving their rewards they can
spend them as they wish in Phase two we
would like to launch the Zenvo
meditation resource where users can have
access to clean water healthy organic
food and clean shelter all of this in
return for design bao rewards making it
a sustainable system if by any reason
our project does not succeed then it is
out of our hands and it's up to you to
come up with a better solution or
implementation in order to end the
current financial human slavery system
