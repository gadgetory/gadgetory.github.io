deep passion for uncompromised image
quality is the simple philosophy behind
the zenmuse x7 together with the inspire
- it marks the next evolution in DJ eyes
aerial imaging technology the inspire -
has become a standard aerial platform
used on film sets around the globe the
new Zen music 7 transforms it into the
world's first fully integrated aerial
platform featuring a super 35 millimeter
sensor for video recording the x7 offers
video resolution of up to 6 K high
resolution not only provides incredible
detail but also allows reframing
the raw and ProRes codex integrates
seamlessly into industry standard
post-production workflows 14 stops of
dynamic range enhanced grading
flexibility by preserving detail in
shadow and highlight areas the large
sensor also enables filming with a
cinematic shallow depth of field and low
image noise
and ISO range of 102 25600 makes it
suitable for use in all lighting
situations the new DJI cinema color
system consists of two parts an updated
dialogue curve for extended dynamic
range and a D gamut RGB color space for
preserving maximum color information
when I first took a look at this x7
footage there really has a color
fidelity there so the dynamic range of
colors that it can reproduce and I can
push the grades around pretty hard and I
still don't get noise with this camera
the superb picture quality of the Zen
music 7 is an asset on every film set a
new AI mode makes it easy to match with
different cameras used for TV series
commercials and documentaries as well as
for feature films DJI also proudly
introduces the world's first aerial lens
mount system the DL mount the ultra

lens design DJI offers for prime lens is
specifically built for the x7 with focal
lengths of 16 24 35 and 50 millimeters
made with carbon fiber they're
lightweight and durable the advanced
optical elements still have a brilliant
image quality
bx7 also captures stunning DNG RAW or
JPEG still pictures with a resolution of
24 megapixels with its sturdy build the
x7 was made for professional
cinematography and ambitious aerial
stills photographers it replaces large
and difficult to use aerial solutions
even on high-end film productions when I
think of the x7 I just think of just an
endless amount of possibilities that
cinematographers and directors can craft
their movie with shots that they may not
have even thought was possible before
the Zen music 7 is a top-of-the-line
professional filmmaking tool making it
possible for creators to focus on
capturing their unique vision of the
world a world that now looks better than
ever before
