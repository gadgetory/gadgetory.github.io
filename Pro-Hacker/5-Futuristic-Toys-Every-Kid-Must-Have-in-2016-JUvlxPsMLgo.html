really special
and very close to me even though he's
from far away like the distance from
here to the sky boat on right in the
faraway galaxy but his amazing station
collided with an asteroid and ended up
broken into pieces luckily he managed to
survive we're trying to put it together
somehow for the time being
photon is staying laughs and I have
become his friend from showing him
what's what how we live here that's what
friends are for at first he couldn't
even move now he's running around like
an adult and he keeps developing oops an
obstacle we got that covered already
Photon
quickly figured out but we little people
love playing the most sometimes we like
to make mess
and we don't necessarily like cleaning
up as much not there are other beings
living with us and by the way he's
really happy when he's able to help how
do we communicate programming
controlling commands in photonic
language photon is a great companion
when we play and even better when we
party thanks to him I know that there
are no black light bulbs I keep working
on these and we getting better photon is
amazed by the amount of technology in
our lab
now we're learning about it together all
of us because you have to know that my
friends got to befriend photon as well
Sophie loves to light up his eyes and
keeps dressing him up
Ethan keeps on wanting to take him
everywhere and all of her to teach you
new stuff even our kindergarten teacher
says that photon absorb and now he's a
smarty it would be great if there were
more of them feel that more photons are
going to land on earth really soon
we're including together support us on
Kickstarter meet photon comm meet
octopus the first icon-based watch that
teaches kids good habits and the concept
of time
one it's a watch that young kids can
read and understand - it's a scheduler
that fosters responsibility independence
and self-esteem
three it's an assistant that helps
parents to prioritize their expectations
and stay consistent with daily routines
no more power struggles enjoy family
life and focus on what really matters
octopus the training wheels for good
habits I have one boy he's about three
and a half years old getting to do
anything as part of routine like
brushing his teeth coloring his hair and
taking a bath is just one constant
negotiation process we've tried you know
different rewards and different tools
and basically they last for maybe two or
three days and then the effect wears off
hi Kickstarter my name is Sam and this
is octopus this cute leaner watch
entirely icon-based will empower your
kids they'll be more organized and
dependent and it will boost the
self-esteem it's really simple to use
and to set up you do it directly from
your smartphone it synchronizes over
Bluetooth and everything is stored
directly on the watch its robust
water-resistant and your kids will love
it hi Kickstarter my name is Omar
I am an engineer and co-founder at joy
joy has been selected by hacks the world
first and largest hardware startup
accelerator as part of the program we
spent three months in China and in China
we've built countless prototypes and
with tested Amala today we're finally
ready to ask you to help us help us by
backing us so we can purchase the tools
to manufacture our first product and run
our first production run thank you if
like us you believe success comes from
good habit bacchus thank you
you
since when was coding this cool
introducing the latest advancement in
the field of fun meet Cody bot designed
by make block this smart robot teaches
kids the basics in computer programming
using a simple graphic programming
language similar to MIT scratch you can
give the robot a series of commands but
then immediately see the magic happen
this provides a safe and easy
introduction of the language and mindset
of computer programmers in free play
mode you can just start playing every
spin grin dance and silly voice
naturally teaches coding skills you can
customize Cody BA in so many ways or
here - Cody bots together for battle
mode may the best Cody Botwin Cody bond
is an open platform to learn explore and
discover equip your child with the
fundamentals they need to thrive in the
age of Robotics with Cody body let's
program the fun hi I'm Jason founder and
the CEO of a make blog we've walked with
the Kickstarter community before and it
received a start screech inputs that we
have finally created a robot that has
found for everyone our mission is to
lower the energy barrier for making
things and to help and inspire people to
turn their ideas into reality robots are
very important the route to education if
you want to get kids into STEM subjects
then it has to be through some simple
enough cookies to be willing to learn
while playing there's nothing like
robots by backing us now you can join us
and they'll be one of the first to bring
Cody Boyd home since when was coding
this cool
here's a list of stuff from kind of
magical to unbelievably magical body
wash that's also shampoo Mentos and cola
things that fly with your help the
magical is about to get magical a meet
shy a pilot an industrial designer and
an inventor he loves things that fly he
wants to try to turn his car into an
airplane no success shy always said that
his dream was to bring the joy of flight
to everyone a few years ago he made a
breakthrough in the field of cool stuff
that flies he invented the power up the
first electric paper airplane but then a
friend of shai's told him nice gadget
really but you can't make a
remote-controlled paper airplane shy
took a moment to think and said
challenge accepted two years of research
and 57 prototypes later he made it
happen
Meech eyes unbelievably magical
invention power op 3 the first ever
smartphone controlled paper airplane
using state of the art technology power
up three turns your embarrassing paper
plane into a lean mean flying machine
just fold a piece of copy paper to a
plane that's power up 3 and install the
app now call your mom and tell your
pilot because it works out of the box in
the back of the module are a propeller
and a rudder that are in charge of
controlling the plane in the front
there's an advanced ship with powerful
Bluetooth smart technology for an
amazing 60 yards of controlled flight
and a tiny rechargeable battery to power
this amazing beast out of juice charge
the battery with any microUSB cable as I
learned in his career as a pilot planes
should be billed we're flying and for
crashing that's why all components of
the powerup 3 are super durable and
crash proof but here's where shy made it
really cool
powerup threes smart shape is programmed
to optimize user happiness you don't
need a PhD in aeronautics to be able to
fly it the prototype is fully functional
and the super ultra magical power of
three is ready for production this is
where shy needs your magic beans if you
help shy get to 1,400 backers you'll
help him bring the joy of flight to
everyone and obtain the privilege to
look down on regular paper planes for
the rest of your life
so back power up 3 and help make the
magical magical herb introducing Don
from wonder workshop Don is the brains
of a robot it's the best way for kids to
learn coding and robotics with hands-on
play right out of the box
Don is ready to play no assembly
required once you connect to our wonder
or blockly apps you can
hundreds of games using the built-in
tutorial challenges like making a light
sword or a fun magic dot ball wonder is
easy to learn because we include
hundreds of pre-loaded missions that
teach coding and an easy fun way you can
save your games and take dot anywhere
without your smartphone or tablet turned
on into a hot potato and go outside with
our wonder app dot can be any gadget or
gain a child can imagine dot is even
more fun with our - robot with our
blockly app your kids will invent
endless ways to play with the - dot is
the best introduction to coding and
robotics with hands-on play the wonder
app is available on phones and tablets
and blockly is available on tablets
