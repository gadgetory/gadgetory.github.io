achieve at a simple push of a button
technology brings endless possibilities
right to our fingertips making life more
comfortable in every aspect and helping
us prepare better for the future except
when it comes to a flat tire
right ere is the next generation of
effortless air pops and it works at the
push of a button just like you're used
to just as it should ride air is clean
simple and efficient it's designed to
help you in two common situations the
natural loss of air pressure that always
catches you off-guard and a flat tire
that stops you from getting on your bike
at all right air is the perfect quick
fix for bone lets you inflate your tires
with a single push of a button this way
you can take care of a flat after you
get to where you need to be ride air can
be refilled with an air compressor in
literally a second and it's built in
safety prevents air from leaking out we
worked on a slick and elegant design
that would fit perfectly on your bike so
that you're never caught without it just
to be on the safe side it has built-in
lock to keep your ride air where it
belongs and of course ride air isn't
just for riding you can also use it to
inflate lots of other things
you
quatrefoil is a sustainable electric
watercraft that promises a legendary
ride above the surface
that changes you forever if you're an
adventurer you know the anxiety that
comes with running out of water in the
middle of a tour the last thing you want
is dehydration when you're miles away
from home Pontus is a self doing water
bowl that allows you to plan your
adventures without having to worry about
heavy water loads or where to find the
next river or the next gas station hi
I'm Christopher and I'm the mentor of
Pontus I wanted to create a bottle that
would never run dry for me it's like
magic because out of thin air and Sun we
are bringing this bottle to fill itself
with drinkable world we created a
compact small and efficient technology
completely independent and easy to use
hi I'm Boehm I'm an electrical engineer
to develop a self-sufficient system
which uses a cooler to conveyance the
moisture from the air hi I'm Bryan in
charge of engineering and develop
fathers comes in two variations the
farthest ride is designed for bikers and
uses the air stream to press air into
the bottle
the fountas arrow is the second version
and is a standalone unit that does not
need to be in motion to function we've
been working on fountas for a couple of
years now here at the University of
Applied Arts in Vienna and our efforts
have been rewarded already with several
design awards we would like you to
become a part of this adventure and
support us so that we can continue with
the development of Pontus and be able to
prepare it for production
join us in making this vision come to
life thanks for believing in practice
you
if you think this is a lantern think
again we've designed a brighter diffuser
and a more compact versatile light that
can charge your phone mount to your bike
as a headlight and light up any space
lantern makes diffuse light simple and
easy with up to 1,000 lumens and a
700-foot beam Lantern comes with a
unique 360-degree bike mount
shock-resistant you can drop lantern
from six feet and it's IPX six
water-resistant lanterns started out as
a simple idea a paper cone cut out and
founder Corey's home workshop he was
amazed at the result and it was quickly
off to the 3d printer then finally into
the beautiful handmade prototype so how
could you use Lantern for backpacking
and camping perfect for roadside
emergencies lighting up a photo or video
shoot in the glove box when you really
need it
awesome for family time around the
campfire and staying up past your
bedtime Lantern can charge things on the
go for longer rides and is the perfect
hands-free light for around the house
you can clip Lantern to anything
anywhere and it's rugged enough for
industrial settings
don't get caught unprepared in a
blackout always keep a lantern nearby in
under a month we've received over 1,500
followers on Instagram and here's what
they've been saying about Lantern so
what's in the box
Lantern comes with a simple wrist strap
360-degree bike mount carabiner charging
cable beautiful Lantern diffuser and the
powerful Lantern flashlight here's the
founder of Lantern Corey Kriger I set
out nearly eight months ago to design a
better camping light and in that time
Lantern you become so much more it would
mean the world to me if you would
consider helping to bring my idea to
light by backing Lantern today thank you
so much thank you so much for watching
our Kickstarter video please back
Lantern today and if you love Lantern
share the project on social media

now that's cool
want to put these on the magnetic lid
for me dirty lifting handles too okay
honey I approve yep pretty much does
everything introducing the cool box the
world's most advanced tool box hi I'm
Mike and I'm Chris the history of the
modern tool box is over a hundred years
old
but today there have been very few truly
remarkable enhancements or improvements
made to this commonly used carrying case
that's what motivated us to develop the
cool box we've assembled the team of
some of the best product designers
engineers and business development
people in the industry the cool box
product combines many commonly used
tools and workshop items with some of
the most recent and popular
technological enhancements all for the
purpose of making projects easier and
more enjoyable we've created our first
two prototypes and are extremely
satisfied with how they turned out
our warehouse fulfillment center and
manufacturing facility are all set up
the cool box is ready to go now we need
your help indiegogo with your support we
can revolutionize the way you work on
any job thank you

the m1 is the easiest to use and most
intuitive electric skateboard ever
created this new emerging market
lightweight electric skates under 15
pounds is a pretty exciting new frontier
it transforms your errands in a
weekender running to this corner store
to pick up vegetables into an activity
that you look forward to you do all the
exact same things that you do on a
traditional longboard skateboard except
now you've got the power to go up a hill
at 20 miles an hour we've actually put a
motor inside the wheel of a skateboard
this has allowed us to create a powered
skateboard that feels smooth intuitive
and makes the em1 amazingly easy to use
yet powerful instead of having a motor
outside of the wheel that turns a belt
and then that belt turns a gear and then
that gear turns a wheel everything's
already been integrated inside the wheel
itself so one it looks really clean but
- because there's nothing that's binding
the wheel up once you hit your top speed
you just collide and you get that coast
the m1 is the first board on the market
the swappable battery packs and what
this means is that you essentially have
unlimited range as soon as you start to
run low on one battery you can just swap
out the old for the new in keeping with
imports future for product design we've
integrated LED lights into the nose and
the tail of the board these hyper bright
LEDs not only increase visibility for
the rider but also allow the rider to be
seen when skating busy city streets and
intersections
