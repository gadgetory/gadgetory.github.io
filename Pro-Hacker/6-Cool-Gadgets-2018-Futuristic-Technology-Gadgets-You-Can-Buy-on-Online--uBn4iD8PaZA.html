we use the internet to make plans
connect work and play together the
internet hosts our lives so why do we
entrust it to organisations who
typically don't have our best interests
at heart
most of our communications flow through
centralized web servers where
corporations control our online
experience they collect our information
limit our access to it and then sell it
to advertisers and because a centralized
internet concentrates power it's
vulnerable it can be censored hacked and
manipulated the internet is broken but
what if no one stood between you and
your data or dictated how you connect
with friends family and community if the
internet were free from central control
it would vastly expand humanity's
potential for creativity and
collaboration it would change the whole
game we know this world is possible
which is why we created polo polo is a
community rebuilding the internet by and
for the users rather than running
information through centralized
corporate servers like Amazon and Google
holo offers peer-to-peer web
applications that replace the middleman
with a spare computing power from our
own devices this creates a cloud run by
users like you and me holo gives you
back control of your data and online
relationships this isn't just file
hosting this is distributed crypto apps
small and large all the way up to
Facebook scale but we can't launch this
alone we need you to run a slice of this
new net and we don't want venture
capital to take
control of this space that's why we've
built all this without it and now we're
asking you and your friends to step up
get a hosting box and take back the
internet simply get a holo hosting box
enable yourself and others to access
distributed apps through a web browser
and get paid in our secure
cryptocurrency

chain an alternative to blockchain
technology that is massively faster more
energy efficient more scalable and
10,000 times cheaper holo chain

from a single smartphone that's great
news for developers who can build fast
applications that scale organically the
easiest way to help launch holo and
participate in its growth is to purchase
