the problem you never really know how
much sealant is left in your tire
depending on the tire the temperature
and many other factors the intervals
between the refills vary we were tired
of removing our tire to check the
sealant or filling in too much to be on
the safe side we decided to make things
easy and invented milk it
easily install the patented milky valves
into the rim they are compatible to
almost all rim types you can use milk it
with any tubeless sealants of your
choice simply add the desired amount of
sealant into the tire before mounting it
on the rim the milky valves keep the air
inside
even without the valve core which makes
fast inflation easier to measure the
remaining sealant unscrew the valve core
and push the applicator tube through the
valve until it reaches the bottom of the
tire slowly open the valve and let the
sealant flow into the syringe until you
see air bubbles detach the syringe from
the applicator and check the quality and
the quantity of the remaining sealant
add the necessary amount of sealant to
the syringe
reconnect the syringe to the applicator
and fill the sealant into the tire
with milk it tubeless systems become
easy to maintain plus no more dirty
hands just relax and enjoy a safe ride
it's Monday again isn't it
this is Annie who needs stress and
tension relief over the night but she
never gets what she deserves
many tried to fix the pillow problem but
they focused more on gimmicks like LEDs
speakers out materials and sleep
tracking devices inside the pillows
that's just silly as a doctor myself
seeing too many people suffering from an
insomnia and sleep disorders I thought I
had to do something about it and this is
my first big step for you
why tolerate poor sleep any longer we
wanted to take it back to the
fundamentals the core value of sleep
itself rest recharge and repeat the
better sleep starts with not having to
think about it
introducing the dual plus pillow
ergonomically designed for you to rest
recharge and repeat every night
first off rest whether you are a side
sleeper or a crazy sweeper don't worry
it supports and aligns the natural curve
of the cervical spine effortlessly in
every direction secondly recharge no
more waking up with the stiff neck and
shoulder recharge your energy with 12
hours of undisturbed sleep but I say 12
hours yes trust me even eight hours will
feel like long and your Monday will be
full of energy thirdly repeat it ensures
perfect sleep every night for many years
to come
all-night comfort how about durability
watch this don't think about the sleep
itself anymore leave that to us
with the dual plus pillow you will sleep
like a baby
rest recharge and repeat you are gonna
love it because we designed it with such
precision and love in mind when sleep is
solved everything gets better
even your mondays we can help that we
can promise
you
I have always been fascinated by
photography and I own you know expensive
DSLR cameras and lots of expensive
lenses you know even though I had all
this gear which would take phenomenal
pictures I found myself taking more and
more pictures with my cell phone because
it was there with me all the time that's
when it occurred to me that if he can
make a camera which has the same quality
and features as a DSLR camera but it
isn't a form factor that can fit in my
pocket and stay with me all the time
then I'd be taking much better pictures
all the time the big change in
photography of course is that it's
exploded globally in the last five years
we send billions of pictures as messages
every day as people have gotten drawn
into the fold it's created this
insatiable demand for better and better
photography who hasn't been at the
concert and they said oh let me get a
picture of the performer and there's a
grainy kind of nothing there right over
the last 150 years or so you know of
photography camera design and
architecture hasn't really evolved very
much what we're trying to do here now is
to capitalize on all of the innovation
that has resulted in very inexpensive
camera modules and inexpensive
high-quality lenses we're trying to
replace a big lens with multiple small
lenses and small sensors one of the
things we do to keep our cameras very
thin as something called folded optics
you have an aperture light comes in
through the aperture strikes a mirror
and then travels down the barrel of
lenses laid horizontally in the body we
are actually using 16 different camera
modules at three different focal lengths
the users can then simply pinch and zoom
the picture and depending upon what
field of view they finally end up
selecting ten of this 16 modules of fire
and take pictures and then we use
sophisticated computational imaging
algorithms to combine those ten pictures
to basically create one really high
quality picture our software can figure
out how to set the exposures differently
for different cameras to get great
low-light performance the other
incredible thing we offer is really
infinite depth of field control
everything's kind of in focus when they
compose it but I know I'm taking a
picture of you and it's a portrait and I
want
a nice blur in the background I can go
set that after the fact this isn't just
moonshot thinking we put some of the
best talent in Silicon Valley together
here at light our computational imaging
team and our hardware team had been
working for over two years to bring this
to reality now we partnered with the
world's leading contract manufacturers
to actually deliver a product to
consumers why I'm really excited about
this camera is that it puts the focus
back on create photography not just a
technology really the power of
photography is the ability to capture
the magic of every moment in every day
and you have to have something that's
portable enough and high enough quality
so that you really are capturing the
emotion of the moment not just the facts
that's what we're excited about
delivering to the market
