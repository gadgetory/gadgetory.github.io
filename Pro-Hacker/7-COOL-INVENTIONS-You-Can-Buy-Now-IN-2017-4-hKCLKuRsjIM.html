hello there hi are you good how are you
what are some of the ways that you okay
so it's a lot of ways it depends on
what's going on I mess with my hands a
lot I do that's a little snapping just
kind of like like that even though I
don't need to fix my hair it's like one
of those things like you know I'm not
trying to be stylish I'm just fitted me
I'll catch myself doing it and I'm like
whoa what's going on I was told it's
because my mind is just always racing I
think everybody said dude even if they
don't know they know I have not a digit
spinner like a salad spinner a few
people in my class up is a fidget cube
the Frederic is really cool because we
just don't even have to look we just
look just keep squeezing in like pulling
things okay something gold that's always
nice is looks different than their other
fidgets manners I've seen it's hard to
describe a heavier bottle opener maybe
oh it's kind of like a spinner and a
cube or something once is actually
really cool it's easier to balance just
like a Center and then it's got some
things as digit cubes I wonder what
these tabs are for I don't know this is
very strange
okay and makes a nice sound the clicking
helps if that was they like get some
tension out kind of like a stress ball
oh you could do it like that oh there we
go Oh like this ah that ring really so
much simple push I didn't think I needed
something like this but now that I've
been using it I could see this being
really useful
where years old
definitely in class everywhere you know
somebody has trouble paying attention
and would fidget in another way if I'm
visiting otherwise people would really
see here it's a secret I feel secure
with the weight just something to hold
on to and kind of play with them
something to do with my hands kind of
comfy

imagine how we interact with the world
but today we just mostly poke at the
screen fingers and hands are incredible
why are we so limited introducing vela
an innovative device that instantly
turns any surface into a smart interface
the world at your fingertips once
connected you will be able to control
different hardware devices or software
applications by using simple gestures
vela will make your life more convenient
use it to control music light
temperature or any other application you
have in your mind you are only limited
by your imagination and you only need
one valid device to control multiple
devices or applications you can use our
presets like letter so read your own
gestures according to your preference
simply assign gestures for different
scenarios and switch between them just
by moving your hands our human hand is
fantastic they can not only feel but
also may need to make things in a
versatile way the Korean smartphone
technologies are just putting everything
into small tiny screen which highly
limits and constrained the interactive
areas of our hands Vela works on any
surface so you can clip it anywhere you
like or even design your own control pad
unlike other devices Vela gives you
tracking and multiple text to action
features so you are not limited to just
one action but if different patterns to
assign for different actions it is super
easy to use and really works for
everyone if you are a developer you can
try new ideas and figure out different
customized applications with our
well-designed API to track the human
gestures Vella uses a special sonar
technology that is nowadays widely used
in military cars and drones it transmits
signal pulses collects the reflective
energy from your finger and then
translates it into the performed action
our team has been focused on sensing
techniques for
couple of years we are passionate about
making to us which is just human needs
by amplifying human capabilities turning
any surface around to into a remote
control enables many potential
possibilities in our daily lives where
between lots of products in the market
but we have not found any of them
capable to track and to recognize with
high probability
good Weller attracts your finger with
the finest precision and transform it
into customized action Weller brings
magic to your daily life
