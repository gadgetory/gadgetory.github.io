I'm helmet I think it's amazing how many
people had the same experience with
their earbuds it definitely is you know
an earbud problem you know they're
falling out you can tell people are kind
of pushing them back in or they're
uncomfortable they make your ears tender
so we needed to create a solution in
that solution is it your hooks when
you're running you know outside or when
you're working out in the gym you want
something's gonna stay with you as an
active person you want to achieve that
focus where you can push yourself to a
limit that you've never been before and
why be distracted by any of your bud
when you don't have to be and we don't
want you to think this is only for
athletes this problem of earbuds falling
out it's so common so what we've created
with ear hooks is a universal attachment
that connects to almost all in-ear
circular earbuds that increases their
fit increases their comfort as far as
design goes we really looked at every
piece of ear hook you can see we've got
a shark fin design on the top here which
we call the tip this piece is what
disperses a lot of the weight of the
actual earbud you see you've got the
elastic tire here which stretches on and
off we've done a lot of testing we
relentlessly tweaked and changed the
design we prototyped over 20 different
ear hooks throughout the process the
testing ranged from running cycling
swimming surfing we really try to do
everything we could to make sure that
these ear hooks
with every environment that they would
ever see we were very thoughtful in our
design process each step of the way
we've redesigned and we've reproduced
and we've retested and we know now that
we have a product that is passing all
those tests with flying colors the same
way athletes push themselves to be great
at what they do we've pushed ourselves
to make your hooks great at what they do
right now your hooks are something that
not too many people know about but the
people that do know about it have had a
great response we want to share this
product with the world and we can only
do that with your help we're hoping this
will be a collaboration hoping to learn
more about our product from all of you
willing to hear some stories from you
guys and you know really make this a
great product together when you talk
about listening to music it makes you
want to move and with your hooks you
finally can
meet the B vibe rimming plug the first
buck plug to incorporate rotating beads
for a rimming sensation with powerful
vibration in the tip resulting in
exhilarating dual stimulation what's so
special about the rimming our bodies
contain a rainbow of pleasure potential
particularly located in the bum in fact
there's an abundance of tiny nerve
endings located directly at the entry
the rimming plugs rotating beads twirl
and tease the most sensitive nerve
endings located around the entry or rim
in addition to synthesis areas pleasure
from anal play occurs due to the shared
wall between the anus and the pee spot
or g-spot which brings us back to that
powerful vibration located in the tip
this vibration provides indirect
stimulation of those pleasure zones but
you already knew that right be Vai
believes your anal play should be 100%
awesome we include a copy of our guy -
anal play with every plug the guide to
anal play provides expert guidance to
help create a truly pleasurable
experience the rimming plug can be used
with or without the wireless remote
control the rotation and vibration work
together or independently the vibrating
tip has six different modes and the
rotating beads have seven different
patterns the remote works up to 30 feet
away which brings a whole new meaning to
the term couples play wink wink
bee vibe plugs are made with soft body
safe seamless silicone that means it's
hypoallergenic stay late free latex free
and non-porous
it's splash proof shower friendly and
easy to clean
the rechargeable battery will run for
approximately 60 minutes on a single
charge the plug is USB rechargeable and
requires two hours to fully charge lucky
for you the battery level indicator
flashes when charging is required you'd
like to travel with your B vibe well
