truly smart car charger designed in
Germany Zeus has both brains and beauty
the elegance and license system provides
enhanced visibility and dark
environments and most importantly Zeus
is the only smart charger that can help
you find your car when you are at a loss
simply open the Zeus app and follow the
red arrow to find your car
Zeus also sports a powerful smart
chipset to deliver the swiftest charge
to any device charge to iPads at two
times the speed of normal car charges
Zeus is also the only charger to meet
u.s. military high temperature standard
another reason why Zeus is different two
times the speed two times smarter never
lose your car hey guys I'm Jeff hi guys
I'm helmet I think it's amazing how many
people had the same experience with
their earbuds it definitely is you know
an earbud problem you know they're
falling out you can tell people are kind
of pushing them back in or they're
uncomfortable they make your ears tender
so we needed to create a solution in
that solution is it your hooks when
you're running you know outside or when
you're working out in the gym you want
something's gonna stay with you as an
active person you want to achieve that
focus where you can push yourself to a
limit that you've never been before and
why be distracted by any of your bud
when you don't have to be and we don't
want you to think this is only for
athletes this problem of earbuds falling
out it's so common so what we've created
with ear hooks is a universal attachment
that connects to almost all in-ear
circular earbuds that increases their
fit increases their comfort as far as
design goes we really looked at every
piece of ear hook you can see we've got
a shark fin design on the top here which
we call the tip this piece is what
disperses a lot of the weight of the
actual earbud you see you've got the
elastic tire here which stretches on and
off we've done a lot of testing we
relentlessly tweaked and changed the
design we prototyped over 20 different
ear hooks throughout the process the
testing ranged from running cycling
swimming surfing we really try to do
everything we could to make sure that
these ear hooks
with every environment that they would
ever see we were very thoughtful in our
design process each step of the way
we've redesigned and we've reproduced
and we've retested and we know now that
we have a product that is passing all
those tests with flying colors the same
way athletes push themselves to be great
at what they do we've pushed ourselves
to make your hooks great at what they do
right now your hooks are something that
not too many people know about but the
people that do know about it have had a
great response we want to share this
product with the world and we can only
do that with your help we're hoping this
will be a collaboration hoping to learn
more about our product from all of you
willing to hear some stories from you
guys and you know really make this a
great product together when you talk
about listening to music it makes you
want to move and with your hooks you
finally can
meet the B vibe rimming plug the first
buck plug to incorporate rotating beads
for a rimming sensation with powerful
vibration in the tip resulting in
exhilarating dual stimulation what's so
special about the rimming our bodies
contain a rainbow of pleasure potential
particularly located in the bum in fact
there's an abundance of tiny nerve
endings located directly at the entry
the rimming plugs rotating beads twirl
and tease the most sensitive nerve
endings located around the entry or rim
in addition to synthesis areas pleasure
from anal play occurs due to the shared
wall between the anus and the pee spot
or g-spot which brings us back to that
powerful vibration located in the tip
this vibration provides indirect
stimulation of those pleasure zones but
you already knew that right be Vai
believes your anal play should be 100%
awesome we include a copy of our guy -
anal play with every plug the guide to
anal play provides expert guidance to
help create a truly pleasurable
experience the rimming plug can be used
with or without the wireless remote
control the rotation and vibration work
together or independently the vibrating
tip has six different modes and the
rotating beads have seven different
patterns the remote works up to 30 feet
away which brings a whole new meaning to
the term couples play wink wink
bee vibe plugs are made with soft body
safe seamless silicone that means it's
hypoallergenic stay late free latex free
and non-porous
it's splash proof shower friendly and
easy to clean
the rechargeable battery will run for
approximately 60 minutes on a single
charge the plug is USB rechargeable and
requires two hours to fully charge lucky
for you the battery level indicator
flashes when charging is required you'd
like to travel with your B vibe well
great news the rimming plug arrives in a
convenient discreet travel case to avoid
any uncomfortable vibration accidents
simply activate the travel lock one last
thing we want you to know we got your
back covered in more ways than one
our warranty protects this product
against defects in material and
workmanship for one year thanks for
checking out the B vibe ribbing plug may
the pleasure be yours
hi guys I'm Lorenzo
hi I'm Carlo everyday smartphones are
becoming smarter but the battery life
remains critical we'd like to use our
phones without the fear of running out
of battery
of course there are solutions such as
barrier cases and extra batteries
whether you they're not portable enough
or is to forget we designed a product so
compact that will follow you everywhere
a cable the size of an inch we call it
in charge it's a very simple product
it's so useful that we believe everybody
should own one that's why one of our
main goals was to keep it affordable
a tiny product at a tiny price
we spend an average 70% of our day next
to a USB port and every time it's a
chance to top-up for batteries there are
over five billion USB ports around the
world in charge will fit in your pocket
and you won't have to fight with tangle
cords ever again thanks to its
remarkably compact design you can snap
it onto your keyring
and there is no chance to forget it at
all we spent the last three months
designed the product and testing the
prototypes and now we are finally ready
to start the production in charger will
be available with both lightning
connector and micro USB so it's
compatible with most of the devices out
there we are really excited about this
and we hope you are too
