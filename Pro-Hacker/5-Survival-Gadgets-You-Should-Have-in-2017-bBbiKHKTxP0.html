treatment options have been access to
drinking water on the trail easier than
ever
however the products designed to be used
with them have proven to be cumbersome
and incomplete solutions
introducing the vecto container a
complete design solution for virtually
all likely water containing and
purifying needs hi I'm Lila and I've
invented a water container a problem
with existing solutions they are too big
and heavy unreliable or inefficient the
recto solves all these problems whether
your weekend warrior through hiya it's
just better than anything else going to
be available on the market
I wanted something that's easy to use
light simple and will work with as many
options as you can it can work where the
filters with chemical treatment UV
filters you name it it's just so simple
trick to the Andes the Alps New Zealand
all of the UK Israel and here in the US
through my experience I know firsthand
works and what doesn't out on the trail
and along with extensive trail testing
we're able to develop practical and
efficient solutions real backpackers
need vector is made from bpa-free
material it's safe to use for clean
water for dirty water it's really
versatile you can use it as a gravity
feed so you can fill it with dirty water
hang in on anything that you want and
just filter through you can very easily
clean it scrub it at home soap it keep
it open we're sticking the slider inside
and it dries completely and that's it
ready to use with anything that you want
we want to make the vector a reality
it's practical supremely useful and
solves a problem we all have to deal
with and good design means you need to
spend less time with a necessity
and more time enjoying the outdoors
through a Kickstarter you have the
opportunity to get your hands on a
discount vector container go out on a
fun adventure or many other options you
can have a look at please spread the
word for your fellow backpackers and
campers on Facebook Pinterest Instagram
Twitter or any social media that you
choose it really really helps us thank
you for your interest in support in our
mission to make the outdoors were
accessible and enjoyable over the past
few years the smartphone has become the
single most important communication
device that we use on a daily basis no
matter where we are we need it to stay
in contact with those around us however
smartphones are entirely dependent on a
communication infrastructure that they
use what happens when this
infrastructure becomes unreliable or is
non-existent for instance when we are
out in the wild
traveling abroad when there are too many
users congesting the network or when a
natural disaster knocks down existing
cellular towers that's why we created
this sonic a wireless communication of
ice that enables your smartphone to send
for instant messages voice recordings
image data and GPS locations even when
there is no internet access or cellular
coverage how does it work
simply connect your smartphone to the
Wi-Fi access point on the Sonnen and it
will transmit the data sent from your
phone to other SONET users via
long-range radio frequency no cellular
data no satellite service and no monthly
subscription the typical range for
point-to-point communication with the
SONET is approximately five kilometres
for three miles
it also supports mesh networking that
can dramatically increase its effective
range by securely relaying data to other
SONET devices in the area
the sonnet is designed specifically for
use in the outdoors it is rated ip66
meaning that it's dust tight and water
resistant the sonnet is powered by a
four thousand milliamp hour battery that
allows you to use it continuously for up
to 24 hours as a built-in USB port so
that you can even charge your phone with
it on the software side is the sonnet
app an intuitive instant messenger that
draws upon the familiar user experience
in addition the sonnet app comes with
useful features such as offline maps and
real-time location sharing so that you
always know where you are in relation to
your friends in the case of an emergency
the sonnet app has a panic button which
will activate the SOS mode broadcasting
your distress call and your current GPS
location to any sonnet users in range
we've been developing the sonnet for
over a year now and are super excited
but as possibilities our prototypes are
now complete
and we're ready to move in a full
production that's where you come in
we're looking for your support to bring
this form of decentralized communication
into the mainstream
the sana is just the beginning and we're
so grateful for you to be a part of it
thank you for your help
venturing out into the wilderness can
have its drawbacks like finding out
where you're going and sticking together
that's why we created goat le
goat Ellie is a GPS tracker using
long-range radio technology goat le
creates its own network goat le allows
you and whoever you're with to locate
communicate and stick together no matter
where you are goat le can run on its own
for up to two days on a single charge
and can be used on its own without the
need of any other device to record and
track your location down to one meter
accuracy when paired with a smartphone
you can use the app to view and track a
group up to 30 units go telly is able to
allow users to communicate by a text to
even send an SOS signal when in trouble
you give me you that peace of mind of
being able to be there when needed go
Telly's network is also able to be made
in your own home monitoring loved ones
and making sure they are safe within the
app you can also make an electronic
fence once a goat le device crosses this
invisible fence you will be alerted on
your smart device this can be helpful
but you need to be able to find and
track those who sometimes like to
venture off by themselves sometimes we
just need to know if someone is ok and
go tele makes it easy to venture out
with the security of always being able
to find your way back home get a goat le

an outdoor music festival or when you're
hiking camping in the woods you set up
base camp and put up our green balloon
