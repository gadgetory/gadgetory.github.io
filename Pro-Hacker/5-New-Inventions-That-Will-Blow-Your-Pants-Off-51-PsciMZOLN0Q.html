minutes on a specially designed
dark station that can fit the device and
all of you interchangeable backs there's
all the distractions and life on the go
it's so easy to forget a great idea
sandstone is a note pad built for your
busy everyday life it did the soil here
to build the first Ronald I now we need
your support to produce the first batch
introducing chameleon color tops for
simple seamless color to color blends
color tops just pop on top and transform
your chameleon pens into color to color
blenders a system that is so effortless
the pen literally does the blending for
you go dark to light light to dark
seamlessly blend similar colors or
completely opposite colors
chameleon color tops been amazing
addition to your community offense the
artistic possibilities are truly endless
does this feel familiar
how about now our phones often die at
the worst possible places at the most
inconvenient times but there's no great
alternatives for us to turn through our
devices have improved over the years but
the way we charge them the states say
this is wireless charging today
really they make wireless charging seem
like an oxymoron when your device is
still shackled to a product that means a
wire to use we're going to fix that
introducing the mother box the first and
only wireless charger that babysits your
phone for you it provides power on
demand so you always stay plugged in no
matter where you go or how your device
is moving setup is fast and simple
download the app and connect to your
mother box experience real wireless
charging the mother box mini keeps you
charged on-the-go and the mother box can
keep your device is powered while you
relax at home we've been developing this
technology for three years and can't
wait to share it with you be the first
to experience the mother box so you
never have to worry about charging your
device's again
here is the lava - camp and this is what
happens when you don't use it do it what
did I do
you just backed into me prove it no one
was
I saw your on the phone oh I saw it with
my own eyes
okay well organized
what do you mean witnesses know there
there was no witness might my car is all
scratched up tonight I expect my
insurance to cover what do you mean you
can't help me is this the life people
really lead to know that car accident
happens every three minutes every day
which is why we built the Volvo - you
just backed up into me he fit the Vava -
is smart with a built-in G sensor that
automatically detects where collisions
happen you'll always have the footage
you need no I wasn't on the phone can
you prove it
whether your car is on or off the Bava -
is there to protect when paired with a
Volvo charger the dash can automatically
record any unexpected activity when you
are away from the car how do you feel
leaving a car alone what if you could
see what's going on in your car while
you're not there
the vah vah - knows what happened and
now so will you videos can be captured
on the baba - mobile app and upload it
to Facebook or sent via email that's
amazing
hi my name is why I am the designer
behind it baba - we want to go beyond
the boxiness of traditional dash cams
and design a video camera that is easy
to install has great video quality and
has features that we thought were
missing we thought that it was important
to show the 360 capability of the camera
and which is why it's in a circular form
our cultural driven design process
delivers experiences that are simple to
use beautiful to the eye and meaningful
to the user on a daily basis we spent
the past year taking this from an idea
to building our first prototypes now we
need your help to bring it to life if
you care about a safer and better
driving experience back our project on
Kickstarter now thank you for your
support and together we can make safer
and better driving experience for
everyone thank you
my name is David Hansen I'm CEO of
Hanson robotics we brain robots to life
as animated characters with facial
expressions physical moving gestures
conversational interaction they can look
at you and be your friend that's our
goal
professor Einstein is just the start the
times right now to make an educational
consumer robot that is affordable that
everybody could have in the home your
own personal genius you have cloud
connectivity and this amazing software
that we built on this smart device he
has natural language speech processing
with the cloud he can trigger our
activities on the iPad like videos and
interactive games let's do the brain
firing we all know that the human beings
learn better the more senses you open up
in the human body we have this visual
communication between you and the robot
then we have the auditory one and then
while using your finger with the iPad
and interacting with him at the same
time it's opening up more areas of the
brain so you're much more adept to learn
one things that's really behind
everything we've done with Einstein is
edutainment education and entertainment
put into life when he teaches you he
teaches you everything with science fact
in a way that's digestible very easy to
understand if you ask him what the
weather is he'll tell you the weather
but with a scientific fact professor
what's the weather like in Charlotte
conditions and Charlotte are breezy the
current temperature outside is 70
degrees with a low of 41 degrees by the
way not to put myself out of a job but
you can tell the temperature by Counting
the chirps of the corrected he's always
trying to encourage you to learn to
reach to grow just like the real
Einstein he explains everything in very
simplistic terms he walks like Einstein
talks like Einstein has Einsteins facial
emotions most of all Einstein's
personality has heard you get jokes
lately
stop me if you've heard this one and I
on Newton Adam on the street and says he
has lost an electron
the atom asks are you sure the ion
replies I am positive the technology is
often now very cold and socially
isolating by bringing an animated
character into our physical world
we're humanizing the technology instead
of dehumanizing the humans professor
Einstein has an amazing set of facial
expressions he'll smile how frown a
fellow's forehead he'll stick his tongue
out it makes people want to interact
with it it makes people want to use it
it makes them feel friendly and
comfortable especially when you're
learning something if you're learning
something new having an emotional
connection with the robot is really
important tell me about the brain Norton
winning but 100 billion neurons the
human brain is pretty complex not bad
for something that looks like a big
wrinkly sponge it's hard to make
animated characters it's hard to make
robots and the two together require an
extra push and Kickstarter is the right
community we're crowdfunding professor
Einstein because we want to reach people
who know who care who are like us
dreamers and if you can get behind this
task that handsome robotics can change
the world
