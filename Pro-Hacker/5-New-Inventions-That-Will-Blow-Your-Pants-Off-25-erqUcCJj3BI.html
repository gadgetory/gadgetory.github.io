life hi I'm Rob co-founder of zinda tea
over the past 30 years I've brought
hundreds of tech products to market I
live in one of the coolest places on the
planet and spent a lot of time outdoors
and I don't always like to go in just
because the sun goes down there are
thousands of flashlights and headlamps
out there but none of them did what I
wanted I decided to create an entirely
new category of outdoor light so we
designed the world's first strap light
the symphony rock
we identified three things the light
needed first it had to be super bright
these lights you just see it all they're
awesome they're really bright you're lit
up so you're less likely to get attacked
you can get ride anywhere at night
second it had to light at the area
around you and matches a spot you know
it was great to have these lights so I
could really assess the entire area that
i was looking at and not just small
spots I liked how I can move my head and
the light still stays with these they
branch out they cover so much area to
even see everything around you she went
through the park on a run at night
people won't be able to miss her and
third it needed to be hands-free it's
easy to mount right through a backpack
with simple hook and loop ties
you can use the Deering strap to fasten
Ron in a wide variety of applications
father metal we build in 10 rare earth
magnets to allow quick attachment to any
first object the matching magnetic
backer makes it easy to securely
fastened onto your clothing
we've completed the prototypes we file
the pants and now we need your help
please support it some back is because
we are bringing some really cool
products to market okay cool
security isn't about a siren everyone
ignores security is about people it's
about knowing who should and shouldn't
be there so we feel safe and worry less
me cocoon smart little security device
that protects your whole home it learns
what's normal for you in your home
alerting if something unusual happens so
you can come and go as you please
without having to set anything oh and
cocoons pet-friendly so no false alarms
feeling safe shouldn't compromise your
privacy so we've designed cocoon to fit
in with your life without being
complicated or overbearing cocoon is
packed with high quality sensors these
work together to measure changes in your
home may indicate something isn't quite
right our unique sub sound technology
means cocoon consents activity in your
whole home not just the area can see
cocoon provides protection how and when
you need it so you can take action and
feel safe
whether you're traveling at work or just
heading to bed at night cocoon is
looking after what you care about most I
thought it was coming from the two
speakers and when you reveal what was
actually happening it was very surprised
it's quartz it's like kind of nothing
I'm really hurt before I was aghast and
I haven't been that in a lot of years
really extraordinary the core is the
most advanced wireless speaker system
ever developed five digital signal
processors allow us to render the audio
in a way that is totally revolutionary
you're getting stereo sound from this
one tiny little box the convention right
now is that for true high-end listening
you have to have two speakers the core
changes that you can have one and it
truly sounds like two for a little box
like this to create although imaging is
very present leveraging a combination of
wave field synthesis and beam forming
allows us to create an acoustic bubble
in the room so that the image stays
stable no matter where you're sitting
you can almost see each person in the
band in the room with you I can move my
head around and the location of the
sound source remains intact as if it was
a Down hologram there's no speaker that
can do anything like this everything is
smart but sound systems art and this is
the thing that we're doing at mass
fidelity is creating truly smart sound
systems if you have an NFC enabled phone
just touch the top of the core and
you're automatically connected
high-density battery gives the core a
solid 12 hour battery life the core is
built-in microphone allows you to
remotely answer calls without having to
touch your phone and if that phone is
about to die the corrs USB connector
will recharge it for you the chorus
control input makes it home automation
compatible
in fact the core has all the inputs
you'll ever need any smart device will
work instantly via bluetooth hook up
your Apple TV to add pristine sound
quality to all of your favorite music
and video streaming services you can
even connect your turntable and
regardless of where the music is coming
from you can broadcast it and up to
eight rooms at once for the past 18
months we've been developing the core
with engineers and factories to make
sure that we can deliver to you a
perfect audio product we're a small
company used to doing small production
runs the demand for the call has been
overwhelming we need your help to
accelerate the tooling that will allow
us to bring it to mop ability so join us
and you'll get a beautifully designed
wireless speaker that gives you true
stereo sound for any room in your house
the core will be the only wireless
speaker you'll ever need and the most
exciting audio product you've ever owned
there's something about working out and
the way it makes you feel
almost everyone went asked would like to
have more Fitness in their lives but for
most of us it falls to the bottom of our
priority list so we developed the body
boss to point out we wanted a product
that would empower people to reach their
goals where you'd be able to exercise
more often and consistently we want a
product that is compact something that
could do it all with no restrictions
this equipment is something that anyone
could use no matter their fitness level
a product it takes all these concepts
from the gym combines them into one
solution bring in the gym to you the
platform is strong the poster spaced
evenly apart on both sides so you can
simulate any exercise movement and
quickly adjust difficulty the base is
made wide enough to stand comfortably
during your workout and we even added a
layer of non-slip material to assure you
stay in place the bands were customized
for this concept and can handle any
height
there's even cloth in the bands to
protect you simply clip in to get
started shorten the bands or add bands
to increase difficulty our most popular
exercise is squatting with the bar it's
like a workout bar you would see at the
gym but more portable it can unscrew and
it features grip padding for comfort the
ends of the bar spin a full 360 degrees
and are shaped to avoid the clips from
sliding providing you the most natural
feel possible through all of your
exercise motions adding or dropping
bands easily provides many resistance
levels we added accessories to simulate
even more solutions such as handles that
will add weight adding bands are like
increasing your weight with a dumbbell
the wrist straps are double padded for
comfort and sweat resistant to stay in
place we even added a door anchor so you
can increase the workout the body boss
is lightweight made of high-grade
injection molding and capable of
handling hundreds of pounds of force the
underside has non-slip feet for safe use
on any surface the adjustable posts make
for easy storage starting from day one
you can choose your color green pink you
can choose your package
and choose how you want to follow
workouts live replay program all on your
own normally it cost of thousands of
dollars to buy or recreate all of this
equipment but by backing this
Kickstarter today you can get it for a
fraction of that price our hearts and
souls have developed the body boss 2

prototypes to be able to produce the
product and make it available we'll need
