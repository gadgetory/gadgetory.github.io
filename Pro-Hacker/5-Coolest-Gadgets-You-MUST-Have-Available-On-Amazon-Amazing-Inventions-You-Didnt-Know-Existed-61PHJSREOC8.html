entering our homes and helping us
automate daily tasks but I find myself
thinking there has to be a more natural
and accessible way to control the
devices around us if the goal of
automation is to simplify our lives why
does it feel so complicated our goal as
a company is to solve this
say hello to knocky knocky is a small
elegant device that instantly transforms
ordinary surfaces in your environment
into remote controls using naki couldn't
be easier simply take it out of the box
pick a place to put it select a surface
to attach it to and then define all the
things you'd like Nike to do Nike can
control a wide variety of devices around
us but the true beauty of our technology
is that what it can do is only limited
by your imagination
put one in your living room for the
kitchen or even your bedroom
I mean imagine rolling over in the
morning and tapping a simple pattern
anywhere on your nightstand to snooze
your alarm and start the coffeemaker
without even opening your eyes you just
bought 10 more minutes in bed and you'll
definitely want to put one in your kids
bedroom it's exciting to think of how
naki will spark their imagination as
they figure out all kinds of ways to use
it using Wi-Fi which is proven to be far
more reliable and would better reach
than bluetooth you can enjoy using naki
from anywhere the number of devices and
software that naki interact with is
rapidly growing every day
it currently includes nest Phillips you
lifx smartthings IFTTT and more but even
if you're new to the smart technology
world you can still use naki for simple
functions around your home
other technologies that rely on sound or
voice control can be unreliable and
confusing to use they can be triggered
accidentally and don't always work in
which spectryx our patent-pending
technology uses non acoustic sensors
it's able to distinguish deliberate tap
or knock patterns from random vibrations
in the environment the beauty of our
product is that it makes any regular
environment into a user interface think
about the surfaces around you so many of
them serve one or two purposes add a
knock you to them and you instantly have
a hub for automation we carefully chose
every material and finish Funaki we've
gone through a series of different tests
and prototypes to make sure that naki
blends in in your environment and also
looks beautiful on your surfaces we're
doing our first production runs here in
the USA because it's important for our
entire team to be there on the ground
floor ensuring that we're manufacturing
the best possible product it's not some
far-fetched idea we have finalized our
designs we have beautiful working
prototype and we need to raise funds to
actually get it into production and
immediately start shipping them to your
door we couldn't be more excited about
how this product is going to change
lives and bring joy to people everywhere
naki accomplishes what technology is
supposed to do instead of taking over
our life it enhances it allowing you to
put more thought and effort into the
things that really matter
happen to the world around you with the
magic of naki
we wake up each morning to a brand new
day a day of balance and wellness we
nourish our body with healthy foods we
physically stretch our bodies in hopes
of stretching our minds everything we do
goes back to our well being
but there is one piece we often tend to
neglect from the wellness puzzle
introducing turbo a simple and effective
addition to your daily routine before
the 19th century toilets were
non-existent people used to squat to
release two thirds of the world actually
still do and for good reason as we
adopted the toilet into our lives we
unknowingly added tension and straining
during bowel movements studies have
shown us the perpendicular posture
brought on by the toilet creates a kink
in the colon which makes it difficult to
go it also makes us susceptible to a
number of other health issues by
elevating your feet that kink disappears
your muscles are able to relax and your
colon is open for quick and efficient
release and that's why we invented turbo
turbo is an elegant yet affordable
solution that makes a great addition to
any bathroom it's sleek design allows
for flexibility and comfort the unique
ramp design makes using turbo easier for
any person of any size the lower toe
area allows you to easily load your feet
then you can position your feet forward
or backward on the ramp to adjust to a
squat that's just right for you and with
turbo squatting is only the beginning
turbo comes with interchangeable massage
rollers to further increase your comfort
on the toilet not only does it feel good
but it can help with constipation too
your feet have pressure points that can
stimulate your colon when it's time to
massaging with turbo also helps with
blood circulation which can improve your
energy levels to get you through the day
we have come a long way and we are
almost there the only thing missing is
your support
you
within this field of consumer health
we've seen these really interesting
activity trackers and at our company we
think that they're really powerful but
what we consume
you know our food our beverages that's
as important if not more important than
burning calories their exercise to solve
this problem we're introducing our first
product the best hi I'm Justin and I'm
the co-founder and CEO of mark one the
vessel automatically knows what's inside
and contract in real time the contents
of the beverage whether that's calories
sugar protein fat more because the
vessel knows what's inside it tracks
your real-time hydration which we call a
prime hydration most people think that
hydration is just about drinking eight
glasses of water a day truth is it's a
lot more complex than that prime allows
us to understand how well we're
hydrating throughout the day we
collaborated closely with these project
and in working together we wanted to
create something that was beautiful
functional durable but also something
that could live comfortably on tabletop
the lid owes almost a hold the product
in itself of course we needed it to be
spill proof we made that happen and what
we ultimately created was something that
was easy and delightful there are subtle
facets on one side of the vessel that
are designed to catch the light and
inform the other displays to activate
the display just pick up and tilt as you
use the vessel it's going to learn more
about you and your consumption have
and patterns but the main goal is to
actually help you make healthier and
more informed decisions in real time
little by little these decisions
translate to big changes over time so
much so it can transform your life the
vessel has been seven years in the
making and the team here at mark one has
been working so hard to create a product
that can really make an impact on your
life and this is just the beginning
