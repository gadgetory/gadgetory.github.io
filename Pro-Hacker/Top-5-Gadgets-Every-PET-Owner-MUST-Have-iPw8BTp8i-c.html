long time every day you have to go to
work but they shouldn't have to wait in
an uncomfortable condition so what is
the pet house is kind of controlled
introducing understand because we don't
trust their power we made it fully
automatic the crude oil hot ones when
it's cold it goes into energy savings
minutes while it is not occupied the
dimension is quiet when it cools instead
of using a conventional compressor you
can air conditioners and refrigerators
we are using thermoelectric module
because we understand that dog cat
ferrets and rabbits are all very sound
sensitive well as to their life a small
cozy space that makes them feel
protected again leaving them under a
tall ceiling designed for shearing could
raise anxiety let's talk about what they
feel we have specially formulated a soft
gel that transfers heat covered by
fabric so it can be cleaned easy it will
be available in a variety of colors and
textures to choose from that's what we
propose
much cooler than a cooling pad much
better control than a conventional pad
town so let's make it happen and make
your little friend happy
as pet owners we all know that one of
the most favorite things to do is get
dirty sometimes getting them clean can
be inconvenience expensive and stressful
for both pet and owner after many years
of wrestling our big dog into the tub
and chasing with a cold hose we knew
there had to be a better way we invented
fur dog the world's first and only
completely portable pet washing station
take it with you anywhere simply fill
the bottle with water before you head
out or from a water source on your
adventure
add your favorite shampoo or coke
treatment pump it up to pressurize and
your washing no any water or electricity
needed
turning the soap on and off is
enthusiast turning the dial rubber palm
and finger pads to provide a deep clean
all the while massaging improving
circulation and removing dead hair after
you're done washing just turn the water
off even our big boy Frank here can get
a good clean with less than 8 litres of
water we know we aren't the only pet
owners out there with a furry friend who
tends to get dirty from time to time and
we definitely know we aren't the only
ones out there who don't like that mess
in our vehicles homes or on our clothes
