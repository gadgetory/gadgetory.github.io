guide that will keep you organized
productive and motivated on your way to

on a unique system that will help you
set your goals be more organized and
increase your productivity everything
started two years ago where we felt
stuck in our day-to-day life
burdened by countless tasks that led us
nowhere close to our visions and dreams
we felt that our journey to the top was
going downhill the change became
necessary and that was the moment when
we decided to create the tool that would
set us back on the right track we
started by studying the materials from
the most successful and high-performing
people in the world we read tons of
books trying to figure out what we were
missing in our lives and thanks to our
research and our guides we have been
able to build the planner based on
proven methods we identified several key
elements that led a person to living a
successful and happier life
what separates us from the other
planners is that you can find everything
you need in one place while preserving a
minimalistic design awesome it's size
makes for easy portability Everest
planner combines the tools that will
help you set your goals and be more
productive we believe that you have a
huge reservoir of untapped potential to
achieve great things and we would like
to help you release this potential in
Everest planner if you are a student or
entrepreneur or just a person willing to
get more out of your life then this tool
is just the right thing for you our
vision is to help both you and the
planet earth we care about the
environment and about the future of our
children's children this is why we are
going to plant a tree for every planner
soul we commit to this not only over the
course of this Kickstarter campaign but
also for the future if you believe in
our mission let's take the next step
together make our project together on
Everest well the moment we hit the
funding goal we will issue a large order
to our manufacturer and we'll make sure
