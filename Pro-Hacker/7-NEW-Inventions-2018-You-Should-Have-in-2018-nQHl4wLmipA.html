said it looks like it's from another
planet well welcome back to the ones
that paved the way for us

a simple phone case that ignites the fun
and individuality of the iMac g3 and
embraces the things we've learned from
the past we wanted to capture the design
and style of the original it was
consciously designed a bear a nostalgic
look to the iconic iMac g3 with air
cushion technology in a dual layer to

hi I'm Lucas Switzerland but this is not
about cheese in sports you want to leave
as little as possible to chance you want
to optimize the way you train the way
you regenerate the way you eat the way
you drink then drinking has a massive
effect on your performance so why do we
settle for water that tastes bad
contaminated by a plastic bottle now a
metal bottle or a glass bottle might
give you a better taste but it's too
heavy it's too much of a distraction
when you have to unscrew it it slows you
down you want to keep your pace right
keep your focus also you see I'm a team
player and in every good team you share
your bottle but then it's very important
you can have contact less drinking for
hygienic reasons so you want to squeeze
the bottle to push the water out
Ã¡lvarez this amazing equipment
everything's high-tech but then we drink
from the cheap plastic bottles our water
deserves better we deserve better
many told me it's not possible but I
kept going looking for the right
technology looking for the right people
and here we are the world's first
squeezable metal bottle Kegel pour in
Switzerland designed in Vienna
produced in Denmark and that's where the
magic happens a groundbreaking layering
process makes it possible to create a
titanium that's super light extremely
durable and most of all flexible
by the way the company mastering this
process is also renowned for producing
accelerator parts for CERN now all we
need to keep going is your support to
buy the tools and the materials for a
first production run help us bring key
go to life help us build the first
squeezable metal puddle
