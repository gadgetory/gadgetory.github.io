hello I'm Chuck Martin general manager
of innovation here at Bissell if this
will we no pets and the message they
make around the home and when it's time
to bathe them the message they get even
bigger we focus on cleaning up the
messes that Life brings including the
pet messes now we're bringing these
insights to the dog bathing process the
Bissell bark that truly is the next
generation of bathing your dog a faster
easier and less messy way this will
strengths are really around
understanding the consumer in the needs
of the consumer especially the pet
parent and we know pets we know how pets
interact with the household and the
message that they make in a home
we realized that people are very
frustrated with the bathing process and
we took a look at that we thought well
if we're cleaning up after the dogs when
they come into the house and they leave
spots and stains on the carpet and
upholstery and when never really
addressing the animal itself that is
dirty we started taking a look at the
technology and the knowledge we had of
both pets and cleaning and we found this
great new idea and this new concept
about saving your animal anywhere in
your home so marrying the insights that
we have around the consumer experience
and around the consumer with the
engineering knowledge is a perfect match
as we know pets you know pet parents we
know messes we know dirt bark bath is
really important because it gives the
consumer a new way outside of their
traditional way of bathing to actually
bathe their dog anywhere in the home
that they want whenever they want but it
also allows people to do is clean more
frequently in ten minutes I can have all
three dogs just just a slight cleaning
and the smell goes away and everything I
mean it works great because you could
actually bathe your dog every other day
if you wanted to and it wouldn't be a
chore or wear before it was a charge of
a three dogs you can use it in your
kitchen and just within less than 10
minutes you can wash your dog this is
different because we're actually
changing the way that you wash the
animal normally you would wash from the
fur down and what we're doing is we're
painting from the skin up that's how we
can actually use less water because in
the traditional bathtub method of
washing your down you
about 19 gallons of water to wash an 80
pound dog we use less than 48 ounces of
water because we're much more efficient
at the process so our nohrin shampoo is
really unique because it doesn't have a
lot of the harsh chemicals that other
shampoos - and it's really safe and
effective on the animal are you going to
give yourself a ball it was perfect
there was no mess and that was about an
hour shorter than what it would have
taken me to give him a normal bath it
was great and he dried a lot faster
when I first saw the product I thought
that there was no way that this was
actually going to work on Oreo she's got
too much hair it really really worked
good it's better for the homeowner
because they'll use a lot less water
better for the homeowner because they
won't have to wrestle the dog to get
them in and out of the bathtub it really
delivers on the promise is supposed to
give to the pet parent which is we're
going to take care of your dog in a way
that's never been done it's easier for
you and easier for your dog
venturing out into the wilderness can
have its drawbacks like finding out
where you're going and sticking together
that's why we created go telly go telly
is a GPS tracker using long-range radio
technology go telly creates its own
Network go telly allows you and whoever
you're with to locate communicate and
stick together no matter where you are
go telly can run on its own for up to
two days on a single charge and can be
used on its own without the need of any
other device to record and track your
location down to one meter a cruise when
paired with a smartphone you can use the
app to view and track a group up in 30
units go telly is able to allow users to
communicate by attachment to others in
the group even send an SOS signal when
control giving you that peace of mind of
being able to be there when needed Hotel
ease network is also able to be made in
your own home monitoring loved ones and
making sure they are safe
within the app you can also make an
electronic fence once a goat le device
crosses this invisible fence you will be
alerted on your smart device this can be
helpful when you need to be able to find
and track those sometimes like the
venture off by themselves sometimes we
just need to know if someone is ok and
totally makes a feeling from the venture
outlet with the security of always being
able to find your way back home get a
goat le today

hi I'm dr. Jason Wirthlin founder and
head of performance development at the
Aragon but there again is for
chiropractors physical therapists
trainers and athletes and anyone that's
active the benefits of the faragon is it
increases blood flow decreases lactic
acid and interrupts the pain cycle in
the brain I've seen the most success
with a faragon in athletes within
minutes loosen up their muscles and go
out and perform the way they need to
we all have our own routines what we
like to eat to how we work out and the
best addition to my routine has been
faragon g1 whether it's a pre workout or
after a long trip on the road and I'm
just unwinding at home the g1 is
unmatched when it comes to recovery its
aggressive but it's not painful and I
feel as soon as when I use it or dr.
Jason used it on me I mean it's it's
immediate results and it's easy to use
it's not heavy it's lightweight you can
travel with it so I like that they're
going a lot better
the g1 is absolutely the real deal I
used on my quads calves hip flexor I use
it everywhere it helps create blood flow
where you have knots or scar juice the
ther gun is better than anything
currently in the market because it's
lightweight easy to use battery-operated
handheld mobile and go anywhere with you
with a really strong amplitude which is
the distance the head travels the
feedback on this Aragon has been
unanimously positive period
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
