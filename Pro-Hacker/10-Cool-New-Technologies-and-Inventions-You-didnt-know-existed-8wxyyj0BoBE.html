this planet someone is injured or killed
by a landmine removing them is very
time-consuming and dangerous millions of
landmines leathered landscapes of the
world turn countries around the world
my name is Massoud asani and I want to
change this our mission is to solve the
landmine problems within ten years in
2012 we have launched our first
Kickstarter campaign it is called
the mine kafon a low-cost wind power and
the landmine detonator it rolls along on
a desert when it hits a landmine it
blows itself up and storage the landmine
at the same time after three years of
hard work we brought our mission to the
next level
now we are very excited to introduce you
our newest robotic invention the manga
pondrom it is an airborne demanding
system which aims to reduce landmines in
less than 10 years globally mine kafon
drone flies above a dangerous area it
generates a 3d map then at the text
landmines with a metal detector and GPS
coordinates the drone has a robotic arm
which places detonators on top of a
landmine and blows them up from a safe
distance these three methodologies
combined makes the mine kafon drones up
to 20 times faster than the traditional
technologies at the saver and up to 200
times cheaper imagine if we could fly
with hundreds of microphone drones all
over the affected landscapes worldwide
and free the world from landmines
now it's our final goal to bring the
microphone drones to a pilot in order to
be able to test them on different
environments and weather conditions this
is needed to prove and show to the
demining organizations that the
microphon drone is faster cheaper and
safer than the existing technologies
with such a deceptive approach we could
save thousands of lives
we need your support to make this happen
please join our campaign and let's have
a landmine
free world because one less landmine
means one save life you're looking
forward to collaborate with you on this
project

there are moments in life that you never
want to forget when you take a picture
you know the place the people around you
the landscape and the details a couple
of days later and you will forget most
of it a couple of years later and you
probably can't even remember where the
photo was taken your memory is gone
wouldn't it be great to have a camera
that captures everything you experience
with your friends and family and that
lets you and your friends reacts
perience those moments later when you
spend time with your mates and loved
ones wouldn't it be great to be able to
relive the atmosphere of that day when
someone you love creates something great
wouldn't it be nice to discover things
that you hadn't even noticed when you
took a photo hi
I'm Eunice creator of the panono camera
a camera that can do exactly these
things it captures everything in every
direction or at once and it has a
super-high resolution of 72 megapixels
it uses 36 tiny but powerful cameras
that fire all at once you just throw
them to the air and at the highest point
when it is barely moving it captures a
fully spherical panoramic image
automatically to view the images you
simply point the smartphone or tablet in
the direction you want to see and move
it around
it's amazing that's absolutely
you built the original prototype two
years ago back then it was called
throwable panoramic ball camera you put
a video of it on YouTube which was
viewed nearly three and a half million
times we got a lot of great press
coverage but most importantly we got
thousands of emails from people wanting
to buy the camera at that time and in
that form it was too expensive for mass
production so we sat down to develop a
new camera that is small affordable and
possible
we booked out of the new design
we call it the panono camera the camera
is tough so you can throw it in the air
and even drop it on occasion
there are several easy ways to use it
firstly of course by throwing it but you
can also put it on a stick and hold it
in the air or simply hold it in your
hand and press a button to make a
picture all the panoramic images in this
video was shot with our prototype the
new design will have the same
functionality but is much smaller and
tougher I was very much impressed by the
360-degree concept you catch the moment
with all the things around you now
everybody can discover the whole
situation I support the team to ensure a
seamless process from the original idea
to the finished series product we have a
working prototype and a great new design
and with your help we can finish the
development and manufacture of the
camera by September support us and be
one of the first to own a panono camera

panoramas and memories

you
Raphael the founder of neo let's talk
about the things around us we have so
many different devices and each one has
their own remoter app you end up with so
many jumping from one remote to another
or when using an app finding your phone
unlocking it finding the right app and
waiting until the app is ready it's
cumbersome and inconvenient it would be
so much easier to control everything
from one place that's why we have
created neo neo is a smart system that
connects to all the devices in your home
and makes them available in one
easy-to-use app and for the ultimate
simplicity use the Neo remote
it recognizes you and lets you control
everything instantly so whether you're
watching a movie setting mood lighting
relaxing with your favorite music or
lowering the window shades neo makes it
effortless and trust us setting all of
this up is insanely simple to make near
absolutely amazing we assembled a team
with expertise in home automation
software hardware and consumer product
design we truly inspired each other to
create something really special after
year of research and development we have
perfected the remote you'll be delighted
with the results new has just the
buttons which are absolutely needed to
get that tactile feedback whether
cranking up the volume or flicking
through the channels new includes a
superb high density touchscreen display
surpassing even apple's hyper mattina
standard we embedded a hand detection
technology into new for which we have a
patent pending
the technology knows you and shows you
your favorites instantly the neo will
even help you set and manage parental
controls neo goes months without needing
to be charged and if you can't find it
use your phone to activate the SOS so
you know where it's hiding the rises

over 10,000 other major audio-visual
devices are supported right from the box
our driver team add some more devices
every day so even if you don't have the
latest devices Neil will just work we've
been spending a lot of time testing
devices and electronic stores and repair
shops and that's why it is insanely easy
to set up new we are currently producing
the first news if you order it now you
will belong to the first people to own
one thank you
whatever happened to the days in mobile
when companies were constantly pushing
the boundaries of innovation and design
putting out products so we're sometimes
even considered wacky
we needed to design a device that was
not only an incredible phone but also an
amazing wearable I used to repair a lot
of phones I had crack screens or water
damaged and did it quite frequently and
when I took apart a lot of these phones
I noticed that a lot of the brands
shared similar construction and design
techniques and oftentimes used materials
that were obsolete like screws and using
rigid and fragile materials like glass
and even steel and thought to myself
there had to be a better way we first
started with a lot of different types of
concepts and designs and after a lot of
iterations and testing and vetting we
really kind of narrowed it down to two
designs which was a large and a small
and before you knew that the portal was
born
we needed to ensure that it was not only
waterproof but also flexible
shatterproof and where we needed to
build a team of incredible people with a
wide range of skill sets who are all
unified to pursue our mission and break
the mold in the mobile market the
problem with the mobile market right now
is that the phones are all the same and
what little differentiation they have is
that some are less user-friendly and
some are less durable things like this
still happen so we're here to change
that with the vibrant pallets clean
typography and easy to understand icon
set the portal UI is experience it
cannot be missed while be stuck with the
same old design when you've got a new
refreshing interface to play with an
interface that helps you interact that
knows what you want and works with you
in the way that you want it to work the
portal not only has all the features you
would expect such as Wi-Fi Bluetooth and
NFC but also has a waterproof Kevlar
infuse polyurethane body a six inch
flexible display wireless charging and
unlock network and so much more

this is the lightest electric skateboard
in the world
starry you can use it as transportation
print along onto subways buses or even
car trunks to a further distance you can
write it to get breakfast or grocery a
few blocks away never need to worry
about parking or locking when entering a
restaurant with your board in fact you
can print to anywhere our brand of
electric skateboard a heavy clumsy
almost losing the real home skateboard
what we want is a revolution of electro
skateboards so we smashed two bounces
through batteries away who bails out
it's called on motors and redesign a
brand new ultralight electric skateboard
which is daring to achieve the same
inning impossible task we had to
redesign the motor to have it inside
wheels as well as putting gearbox and a
sensor inside we designed many versions
of remote-control awning for a better
user experience instead of the
short-lived belt we use the planetary
gears to provide unbeliev blaze drum
power sorry has perfect power systems to
support high speed up to 20 miles hour
and growing up here on a 30-degree slope
with a small remote in hand anyone even
with no experience can easily control
the board using our braking and
accelerating features staring is safe
and smooth to write for all users from
beginners to experts
our technical team has top talents in
black tree mechanic and software
engineering we want to change young
people's way of transportation and your
support is essential for thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
