let's put it that way that's what he's
been doing for the past 20 years and
he's becoming pretty damn good at it
well I wish this story was all fun and
games but sometimes you gotta take
action to preserve your body Mike's ears
are paying the price whenever he is
DJing and producing he feels fatigue
pain and lots of sensitivities but not
anymore now he uses D but a pleasant let
sound in and keeps noise out ha what is
this D but thing you ask D but is what
saved Mike from imminent silence
and can save a lot of other people
featuring a slider that allows you to
adjust to the amount of decibels you
want to filter out D but gives you a
clearer crisper and safer music
experience what's the difference between
D but and a regular ear plug you might
ask well here's some scientific
explanation your ear is designed to
naturally boost frequencies around 2 to
4 kilo Hertz like human speech most ear
plugs simply fill out your ear canal to
block sound problem is that they alter
your years resonance frequency causing
muffled unclear hearing as a result with
D buds you can speak feel listen
move do exactly what you're used to do
our acoustic mesh is designed to reduce
volume evenly for all frequencies
throughout the spectrum while the
acoustic or mechanically enhances
frequencies in the range of human speech
d-bus simply brings you clears a sound
for mic this was a decision that
dramatically changed the quality of his
life with a simple slide and he is
telling all his friends about it free
text slides it to pitch down the high
notes of joyful children and still be
able to talk to the parents agent all
slides it to tone down machine noise and
keep the creative juices flowing anna
slides it just so she can hear herself
think at the agency and still be aware
of the latest gossip samuel slides it to
maintain sanity and focus and make every
chance of small talk a prolific dialogue
after years of research prototyping and
testing we achieved a sleek design plug
with minimum visual impact perfect fit
and ease of use this means crisper
clearer hearing with reduced volume
every time we're ear lab and our mission
is to bring you a better and safer
listening experience no matter who you
are or what you do
help us make a difference for millions
of people around the world d bud let's
sound in keep noise out
flip deck is a handheld action toy we
set out to build a toy where anyone with
any skill level can throw some sick
tricks look it is fun to flip stuff
adults spread parents kids like to flip
stuff anybody can play having the toy
communicate with you that knows what
you're doing knows what tricks you're
attempting there's a precedent for a
handheld gaming big successful now in
2018 there's a technology available to
us to be able to build a toy where we
can throw something in the air catch it
and it tells us exactly what we did
I see people definitely playing it in
breweries all over the country it's a
great brewery bar drinking game right
now we have four colors our core color
is neon green and black it's made of a
foam bottle with a plastic faceplate on
it and we've got all the electronics and
buttons and all the sensors and stuff
and bent it inside of the toy we use
some 3d modeling software to come up
with a way to make the phone we could
throw it up in the air and whip it
around and it's not gonna hurt to catch
it it gives a shock absorption that way
the game is safe the components for the
flip deck speaker at the top there
display right under that three buttons
which you use to navigate the menu three
lights the green light in the middle
tells you when you're ready to do a
trick under the logo you have your two
batteries in your capacitor the center
of mass is where the gyroscope and /
accelerometer sensor is so how do you
play flip deck free play you just flip
it in the air and the flip deck will
tell you if you landed something or not
flips FL yps which is our equivalent of
horse solo ladder where you play by
yourself gives you a trick list starting
from easier and harder you climb the
ladder attempting tricks when you
actually land a trick and the game tells
you what you landed there's nothing like
it it's a fun game for everybody but
it's also a game of skill it takes
practice to be able to do
thing you don't land it flip deck Louie
there rtz a little bit or offer some
words of encouragement back when we were
growing up skateboarding we'd flip
anything to get our hands on the idea of
building something where you know we
don't have to argue on if that was a
trick or that was a trick you know the
actual toy would be the judge so why do
we need you and why we've done the
Kickstarter we think that flip deck is
awesome that everyone in the country and
eventually the world should have the
opportunity to play it well we're able
to build prototypes in the garage right
now afford to do it ourselves
the only way to get it in your hands is
to mass-produce it the main reason why
we went with the physical standalone toy
is it's way more fun to flip than your
phone a lot of people aren't going to
want to flip their eight hundred nine
hundred dollar phones nowadays so we
thought it'd be cool to get people
interacting again you know enjoying
themselves and each other playing a game
that's actually tangible and just
staring at a screen
we guarantee you that our outdoor gears
will be lighter and more potent
introduction helium is the best outdoor
lantern ever it is lighter more compact

member of our team is devoted to be true
outdoor enthusiasts to enjoy exciting
experience of closely contact with the
nature in June 2016 we launched our
first crowdfunding campaign an IndieGoGo
to crowdfund our first products max pump
and we made a great success over 19
thousand dollars was raised by 5000
backers within 60 days
our team has recently released its first
generation of outdoor camping light
Helio we have completed the design we
will start production and release on the
IndieGoGo for the whole world outdoor
enthusiasts
hi it's Lorenzo from balls motion last
year after our campaign on IndieGoGo we
shipped a load the first version of bolt
they were most portable electric
skateboard we learned a lot from that
experience and from your feedback you
really helped us building this product
today we are happy to show you how great
improvement about 2017 we reviewed every
single part and improved when needed as
a first thing we use a new battery
inside the board increasing range up to
14 kilometers the new battery is more
robust so it can resist under a lot of
stress
we redesign the board now it looks a lot
thinner and it's reinforced with glass
fiber so it's more robust as well
an invisible anti scratch protective
layer covers the wood that will stay
cleaner within the board we embedded
shock absorber to reduce vibrations we
now have a new robot controller more
compact and robust than the previous
generation it also has a dual speed mode
one for beginners and one for expert
that can release the full power and go
at the same speed of a bike even the
battery charger is now more compact so
it's easier to carry when you want to
charge your battery on-the-go and
another with addition inside the board
there is a Bluetooth module that lets
your bot communicate with your
smartphone with an app available for
both Android and iOS you can know
everything about your bolt and record
your writings
if your smartphone battery's running low
you can charge it with the USB port
under your boat
we added all of this while keeping what
makes both very portable a weight of
just four kilograms and the same size of
a penny
unlike a bicycle bolt it's a personal
vehicle you can carry anywhere even on
the bus and the Train
and use it just when you need it
Balt is perfect for urban mobility a
last-mile solution for commuters and
travelers it saves you times every day
with a lot of fun
Balt is um crafted here in italy and
it's available now on the Baltimore Sun
dot-com
hey here you go this is crazy
that's so cool oh wow oh wow that's
enlarged you know I told you I used to
be the military and stuff and I got a
lot of hearing loss from my job and so
this is like a new level of hearing
superhero right now
a couple my friends have like some
hearing issues but nothing like this
this is this is kind of this is nice so
plus the VA is usually pretty good about
covering stuff but if their hearing
isn't covered it's really expensive for
them to have to you know buy one of
these things I'm sure this is expensive
one in five Americans are disabled what
comes to mind when you hear the word
disability why is hearing impairment so
accepted then we don't fix the source of
the problem a decent hearing aid they
cost around two thousand dollars or more
people don't wear hearing aids as a
fashion statement like they do glasses
only Union was founded to combat the two
impairments price and social perception
and eliminate hearing impairment how the
first barrier price here's how much a
decent hearing aid cost today $4,400
and here's the breakdown cutting down
significantly on the materials and
research expenses we don't use expensive
machines for testing and diagnostics we
kept our margins as low as possible and
after cutting out as many costs as we
could we were still at $500 the second
barrier is social perception we
approached hearing aids from a totally
different design perspective not as a
medical device but as an accessory
we designed the Olive benchmarking the
latest earbuds and Bluetooth earpieces
over the past year we develop the next
generation hearing aid using a smart
sound algorithm and Bluetooth technology
we've also revolutionized the hearing
test and feeding process to make it
quick easy and accessible
we reviewed tabs on the only app you can
set up a customized hearing profile with
sound frequencies optimized for your
ears you don't need a funky looking
medical device or amplifier to hear
better
you just need on olive but in order for
this to be truly accessible $500 is
still too high our goal is to bring the
olive to you at $100 flap this isn't
just a crowdfunding campaign is crowd
R&amp;amp;D campaign in order to reduce R&amp;amp;D
costs I need all of you to help us
paratis the only and providers with the
proper feedback so that we can create
the best hearing experience for everyone
let's hear the world together
