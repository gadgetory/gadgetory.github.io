Christian we're the founders of mate
you might remember us in the first mate
campaign where more than 7,000 of you
support our mission to make the coolest
and best possible ebike ever your trust
and support helped us to kickstart a
biking revolution all over the world
today we're ready to push it even
further and you can be part of it after
more than a year of development
we're finally ready to introduce the
next generation of mate made X it's
bigger tougher more durable and the most
powerful made to date the battery is
longer-lasting the tyres the wider and
the motor is more powerful and we did
all this without compromising its weight
manner ability or designed
this mate is a great excuse to get out
of town and with the new easy shifting
gears you can tackle any obstacles
without breaking a sweat
latex has bigger more rounded and she
punctured tires for better grip and
better control
this gives you the freedom to go off
limits enjoy the scenery and make your
own fun
high-performance hydraulic disc brakes
guarantee you always be in control
any combination with the hydraulic full
suspension riding a maid has never been
smoother even in the roughest of
terrains whether you're into adventure
leisure but just need a bike to get to
work mate X guarantees a cool safe and
unique riding experience
let the bike do the work in crews at 20
miles per hour for up to 80 miles on a
single charge
and thanks to the built-in USB port
running out of juice will never be a
problem
may takes is still foldable so it's easy
to bring it along if you think you'll
need it
and may Texas longer-lasting battery
with more boats and more powerful motor
gives your acceleration and towing
capacity to power your daily adventure
it's been an amazing journey so far and
we're just getting started with Maddox
we can take it to the next level
help us put this bike in production the
more we get funded the better prices and
better upgrades we can make to the
existing bike
and I can promise you one thing we have
learned from our first campaign and we
have assembled the best possible team
from those experiences to get this bike
out and about as fast as possible with
Maddox we want everyone to experience
the feeling of ultimate freedom and to
show the world that biking can be so
much more join us and together let's
make it happen
the Brookstone brand just means fun to
me you get to go inside of a Brookstone
store and see all different types of on
an interesting products rover Landon C
is our next generation in our rover life
this is Rover Landon see he can drive on
grass asphalt any type of surface you
want you can handle and you can also go
in water people love taking this thing
to beach to their pool another great
feature that people like is how easy it
is to use on the app it's so simple and
it connects very quickly the camera
inside can actually rotate 90 degrees so
you can look straight ahead but you can
also control so you can look 90 degrees
downward you can get everyone swimming
in your pool you can get fish swimming
in your pond you get to see things that
you weren't normally able to see and
it's a crazy awesome point of view when
you look at this every little detail
from the wheels to the placement of the
speaker the antenna was was designed
with a purpose it's one of the most
versatile toys you will ever find if you
have a kid open this up as a gift it's
quite the experience it's just it's a
really awesome gift to receive and if
that kid has a dad good locks trying to
get it back
nowadays there is something wrong with
the market of climate equipment on the
one hand there are plenty of absolutely
inefficient small devices that don't
prevent suffering from heat on the other
hand there are overpriced bulky
solutions that consume tons of energy
they require complicated maintenance and
to be honest not always provide you with
desired level of comfort I don't know
about you but I would like to have a
device that combines portability of
desktop gadget with efficiency of modern
technology mid next generation of Evo
polar smart personal air-conditioner
this multifunctional device cools
humidifies and purifies the air and
creating a perfect microclimate around
yourself the report is easy to use as
1-2-3 fills the water tank
adjust the fan speed enjoy it if a polar
walks on power 40 of operation it
literally creates these natural
refreshing breeze one can feel as the
Seacoast and I found their dry hair and
skin of a polar produced moist air
taking care of your health and beauty
everybody has their own temperature of
comfort and optimal humidity level this
is definitely not something that central
air conditioning systems respect also
cooling effect spreads and evenly and
those who are close to an air
conditioner always feel too hot and
others always feel too cold during the
summer season fully air-conditioned
spaces become unbearable and regular
heat waves make it much worse even best
climate systems often can cope and he
needs some extra cooling power
Eva Poehler makes you feel comfortable
in any conditions improving your
productivity and helping you to achieve
more the core technology behind the
report is a breeze especially developed
operative metamaterial based on my novel
lot of photos
this allows a reporter to be both
compact and powerful
unlike traditional materials every
breeze doesn't contain any organic
elements this prevents bacteria and most
threat were over there is no free owner
any other toxic quality
this makes ever for technology
absolutely safe to use and eco-friendly
thank you ever polar is a truly smart
device it consumes less energy than life
saving bulbs significantly reducing your
bills with a variety of tools for
automation smart home integrations and
application control ever polar will
easily become a natural part of your
office a whole ecosystem we are founders
of ever polar here you go
we came to you with the idea of personal
and conditioner we are grateful for
support of solvent bakers who helped the
dream come true we didn't let you down
delivered product in a record time and
now we are ready for the next chapter of
our journey the most valuable thing for
us was your feedback it allowed us to
spread the boundaries of Climate
Technologies even wider in this new
advanced device we believe that climate
technologies are becoming personal and
we invite everybody to join this
revolution and once again thanks for
your support
