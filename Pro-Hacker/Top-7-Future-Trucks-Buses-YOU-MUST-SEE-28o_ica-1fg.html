power train which is made up of a micro
turbine a battery storage system and an
electric motor moving inside the cab
through the sliding drivers door you'll
see the key difference that allowed for
the more dramatic Aero design the driver
sits in the center of the console rather
than over to the left the dash is
electronic and therefore customizable to
the gauges and performance data that a
particular driver wants to monitor and
it's all finished off with a full-size
comfortable sleeper moving on to the
trailer not only is this the first time
a trailer has been made out of carbon
fibre but it's actually the first time
one piece 53 foot panels of carbon fiber
have been manufactured looking at the
front of the trailer you can see that
the nose is convex which increases the
aerodynamics of the entire package as
well as adding additional cargo space
inside the trailer

here it is
the future truck 2025 from Daimler
thanks to a so called highway pilot this
truck drives autonomously on the freeway
the concept vehicle gives a
technologically accurate idea about
commercial trucking of tomorrow the
aerodynamic design and modern LED
lighting that replaces conventional
headlights bring the face of this
concept vehicle to life it convincingly
combines functionality efficiency and
emotion comparable to an autopilot in a
plane that radar sensors and dual camera
system of the highway pilot makes
autonomous driving possible without
relying on other vehicles or any kind of
guiding infrastructure this highly
intelligent system relieves the driver
from tedious driving as he gains time
for other tasks and communication
the intelligent highway pilot reacts to
a wide range of traffic situations such
as moving over for approaching emergency
vehicle in spite of all the
sophisticated technology it is the
driver who remains in charge and in no
way will the highway pilot replace the
driver it simply makes this job easier
while increasing the overall safety
because this truck basically drives in
an environment where driving is boring
monotonous not very exciting highway
pilot takes over and it never gets tired
it's always a hundred percent sharp it's
never angry it's never destructed so
this is a much safer system due to this
increased safety lower fuel consumption
in overall reduction of costs the future
truck 2025 fundamentally changes
commercial traffic the job of the truck
driver and the business of commercial
truck
but the question remains when will you
see this truck on the road near you
obviously the biggest part for us is to
get legislation ready and get in a legal
environment and allows us to do that to
do so as you know in Europe it's right
now illegal to drive these vehicles and
in public routes and we have some states
united states that already allow that so
in u.s. we can in Arizona for example in
Nevada for example we can already drive
this truck today and it base comes up to
who is going to be first so wherever
we're going to have the legal
environment that we need we will
introduce that technology</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
