what a cooler can be first you've got
this 18 volt rechargeable blender and
what's a party without music the coolest
comes with a removable Bluetooth speaker
that connects to any smartphone to
wirelessly stream music from up to 30
feet away and since you've got that 18
volt battery for the blender why not get
the most out of it maybe your camera
battery's low recharge you're here
wherever you are with this waterproof
USB charger that's the sound of a cooler
coming down off the shelf it's the sound
of imminent fun so why haven't cooler
designs changed in almost 50 years
boring coolers are boring break easily
and our pain to get to and from your
destination
I wanted to cool it it was really well
built yet had so much fun built into it
that I would look for excuses to get
outside and enjoy so I created the
coolest
the coolest is a complete redesign of
what a cooler can be first you've got
this 18 volt rechargeable blender
you don't realize a number of places you
could really go for a blended cocktail
or smoothing until you've got a blender
built right into the lid you're already
carrying around a cooler full of ice and
tasty beverages why not blend them up
and become a summertime hero anytime
anywhere and what's the party without
music the coolest comes with a removable
Bluetooth speaker that connects to any
smartphone to wirelessly stream music
from up to 30 feet away it's amazing
where speaker technology has come in the
last few years
you can skip songs and adjust the volume
right from your phone and this little
box can really put out some sounds and
since you've got that 18 volt battery
for the blender why not get the most out
of it maybe your camera batteries run or
maybe you have an iPhone and want to use
it after 2:00 in the afternoon
recharge your gear wherever you are with
this waterproof USB charger the party
doesn't stop just because the Sun Goes
Down and you shouldn't have to freeze
your fingers searching endlessly for
your favorite drinks the coolest has
waterproof LED lights embedded in the
lids you can easily find what you're
looking for with the push of a button
one of the biggest hassles of outdoor
fun is hauling your gear back and forth
from the car and I've experimented with
various ways to solve the problem and
love coolers with wheels but I hate that
they refuse to help carry anything else
the coolest has you covered with locking
tie-down bungee you can carry all your
stuff in just one trip and what about
getting organized to go out in the first
place the coolest helps out almost like
a picnic basket to make sure you always
have a few key essentials with built-in
storage for reusable plate / cutting
boards and this awesome rust proof
ceramic knife plus the removable divider
gives you a whole new level of flexible
packing options you can pull the drain
plug on one side and your coolers can
stay dry and cool just like your
refrigerator say goodbye to soggy
sandwich regular cooler tires are flimsy
and sink right into the sand we design
the coolest wheels to be twice as wide
to roll twice as easily so how many
hours of your life and we lost looking
for a bottle opener my grandpa's cooler
had one so does it cool
I create products for a living and the
manufacture the coolest I've lined up a
world-class sourcing company with years
of experience making top-shelf products
and they're standing by to coordinate
all stages of production and logistics
this will make sure you not only get
your coolest on time but it's the
highest quality coolest you can possibly
make as you can see we have our design
finalized and ready for the big leagues
but to move to the next stage requires
expensive tooling to pay for all the
coolest parts and the capital to buy our
component at a volume discount if you
were to go out today and buy all the
gear we packaging the coolest it would
cost over $500 well by backing this
Kickstarter campaign for just $180 you
can be one of the first people in the
world with the cooler it's actually cool
you
and
you
