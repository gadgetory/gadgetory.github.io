who wakes up early dive straight into a
morning meditation is super productive
at work drinks those eight glasses of
water and always hits the gym but let's
be real living that life means building
better habits and our brains want to
follow the ones we already have not the
new ones we're trying to cram it but
sometimes all you need is the right
nudge hi I'm Kayla and meet moti a smart
companion for building better habits we
created moti with a distinct purpose to
empower people to take those small steps
that over time result in big impacts in
our health and happiness these more than
just a cute face Modi is designed in the
latest insights from both behavioral
science and social robotics when you
place Modi in your home or office every
time you walk by he becomes an instant
reminder to keep committed each time you
do your habit Modi is there to help you
track and celebrate your small wits
giving you that immediate gratification
the better you get the more excited 30
days but slack off and Modi might get
angry for SAP or stay purely encouraging
Modi knows what works best for you
because he's connected to the web he's
constantly analyzing and evolving so he
knows how you're progressing if you're
at risk of falling off and when to send
the right types of nudges specifically
for you compare all this to the same
daily push notification you keep
ignoring still how can something so
simple actually change your behavior to
tell you about how we form good habits
let's start with something that we're
all familiar with forming a bad habit
ooh cookie
fundamentally your brain needs three
things to form a habit a trigger a
routine and a reward when I saw that
plate of cookies I didn't even think
about grabbing one my brain immediately
triggered me and I knew that eating that
cookie would reward me with its sweet
doughy deliciousness your brain forms
good habits in just the same way by
completing this loop over and over again
moti works by seamlessly integrating
these three elements into your busy
lifestyle moti himself is a trigger more
specifically what's known as an
environmental cue and by using moti your
habit is already set up to be small
distinct and actionable finally movie
celebrations provide an immediate reward
he makes sure that you feel satisfied
and accomplished each and every time and
perhaps a bit guilty if you're not mone
is the outcome of over a year of human
centered design and engineering rigor we
discovered that triggers and rewards
driven by emotion are far more potent
than numbers lists or alarms now we're
finally ready to release movies straight
to you the only question is what
happened William Ford
when we can't help you magically climb
Mount Everest or run a marathon
overnight he's there to help you do
something more essential become a better
you one habit at a time but we need your
help please back us and be a part of

here at glutton technological
innovations we are currently developing
a wearable smartphone in the form of a
glove our main aim is to push the
boundaries of wearable
telecommunications and move into a new
area of a fully wearable world people
who are into sports or any other
physical activities often struggle to
carry and use their smartphone in its
fullest usable capacity glove these
aimed at people who engage in sports and
other demanding activities whatever the
situation glove D is right for you
both founders are sparring athletes and
faced a major problem while exercising
the difficulty to use and carry their
smartphones smartwatches and fitness
trackers did not work efficiently for
them the reason these devices was
prepared with an existing smartphone
while operating them multiple issues can
arise no feasible way to initiate a call
or send a text message take videos or
photos or even be able to use popular
applications on a small SmartWatch
display and that's how glovesy was born
a wearable smartphone in the form of a
glove can do so much more than just a
regular one we strongly believe that
glove D will exponentially increase the
quality of our lives not only in sports
but also in other activities of our
daily routine glove Z is not just a
product it's a platform aiming to close
the gap in emerging technologies in
Internet of Things
