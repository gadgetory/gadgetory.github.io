dangerous it's a chair it's this
supposed to be a chair do I look stupid
it's too light to be a chair this is a
chair we've found your secrets you mean
my bag you're not being straight with us
look at all these mechanical parts they
do not belong in a chair
Kevlar strap ballistic nylon seat the
core is made of carbon fiber but why
these are Special Forces materials to
make the slimmest and lightest portable
seat in the world we had to push the
materials and the technology to the
limit everything down to the smallest
screw is made to measure it's this
anodized aluminum great ice and it's
corrosion free as well as strong as it
gets
what's next you're gonna tell me that
boom thing can hold a grown man 300
pounds not a problem just try to unfold
actually really comfortable is designed
to strengthen your core and to avoid
back problems you can adjust the height
so it matches your specific needs so
you're telling me these are in foreign
spies using a cylinder to communicate of
course not
the setback is simply perfect for
multiple everyday normal occasions
hanging around golfing hunting just make
life so much easier and more convenient
it really is something special I mean
such craftsmanship only premium
materials how can we get it you can be
the first one to get the Sen if you
support our Kickstarter campaign every
dollar counts
sleep is important the value of the
sleep is something that you realize when
you lose it first you lose your focus
and then your good spirit but also it
will go to severe be healthy sues at the
end but upside here is that we can also
affect positively your health by
improving your sleep so we started
making studies to find the solution for
it I am proud to introduce why don't
sleep
this device is one of the kind there is
no other active noise-cancelling
earplugs but you could use for sleeping
there are the devices for the sleeping
purposes like perform earplugs the
problem with that is that they can't
fully cut the snoring sound there are
some devices which are creating more
noise meaning of this kind of masking
noise that you can hide the snoring but
then you need to listening the noise
what that device created so we are
making silence
the first product was already massive
hit it went all around the world and got
really really positive feedback from
different segments especially for the
frequent travelers but also the people
who are working in the noisy
environments but still we found some
room for the improvements especially for
the sleeping our new device is more it
is soft it is optimized for the snoring
sounds it's also have two modes there's
hearing mode and sleeping the great
feature of this device even though we
went really small that they're still
enough battery life so there's 20 hours
in a single charge
I'm privileged to work with this kind of
device which have the major impact on
people's lives since have been our
started an IndieGoGo go there and order
your own thank you for supporting us
