what if your dog started pooping golf
gold coin
or even liquid gold what if there were a
magic solution that could collect all
your dogs poop without any direct hand
contact because in reality your dog
doesn't owe gold introducing piccaboo a
thought parents dream bigger poo is made
up of two parts a rounded clip of soft
silicon cushions that secures
comfortably around your dog's tail and a
durable disposable collection bag that
hangs beneath they spit upon your dog's
tail before you go out for a walk
and when he is ready to poop all the
droppings fall directly into the
collection bag when your dog is finished
pooping you just unclip the bag and
throw it away with no mess and no
leakage in the real world
dog poop is not gold we love our dogs
but don't love cleaning up after them I
grew up having Doug I've always looked
for a better and easier way to pick up
after them but a product in the market
are just not ready for the past few
years my team and I have worked hard
testing and redesigning and testing you
can finally come up with the engine
every step of the process it's been
about making seeker put something that's
real dog owners can actually use we know
that most dog owners want something they
can intuitively use with only one hand
so we build that into Picabo - and it's
even small enough to fit in your pocket
we design Picabo so there never has to
be contact between the floor and your
hands or even on the ground
everything goes straight into the bag
and at those days after your dog ate
something you shouldn't have
pick up you can handle any basic
situations no matter what type of gold
comes out most importantly we wanted to
make sure the clicker pool with these
dog friendly we've given the picker food
to more than 100 dogs of different
breeds sizes and the feedback has been
incredible with your help sharing this
campaign with at least five friends
we're hoping to finally change the lives
of all those online by making our locks
easier or street cleaner in our hands
coping with piccaboo you will never need
to pick up dog poop again

hello I'm Chuck Martin general manager
of innovation here at Bissell at this
will we know pets and the message they
make around the home and when it's time
to bathe them the message they get even
bigger we focus on cleaning up the
message that life brings including the
pet messes now we're bringing these
insights to the dog bathing process but
this will bark that truly is the next
generation of bathing your dog a faster
easier and less messy way this will
strengths are really around
understanding the consumer in the needs
of the consumer especially the pet
parent when we know pets we know how
pets interact with the household and the
messages they make in a home
we realized that people are very
frustrated with the bathing process and
we took a look at that we thought well
if we're cleaning up after the dogs when
they come into the house and they leave
spots and things in the carpet and
upholstery and we're never really
addressing the animal itself that is
dirty we started taking a look at the
technology and the knowledge we had of
both pets and cleaning and we found this
great new idea and this new concept
about saving your animal anywhere in
your home so marrying the insights that
we have around the consumer experience
and around the consumer with the
engineering knowledge is the perfect
match as we know pet you know pet
parents we know message we know dirt
bark bath is really important because it
gives the consumer a new way outside of
their traditional way of bathing to
actually bathe their dog anywhere in
their home that they want whenever they
want what it also allows people to do is
clean more frequently in ten minutes I
can have all three dogs just just a
slight cleaning and the smell goes away
and everything I mean it works great
because you could actually bathe your
dog every other day if you wanted to and
it wouldn't be a chore or were before it
was a chore to bathe three dogs you can
use it in your kitchen and just within
less than 10 minutes you can wash your
dog this is different because we're
actually changing the way that you wash
the animal normally you would wash from
the fur down and what we're doing is
we're cleaning from the skin up that's
how we can actually use less water
because in the traditional bathtub
method of washing your dog you use about
19
of water to wash an 80-pound dog we use
less than 48 ounces of water because
we're much more efficient at the process
so our nohrin shampoo is really unique
because it doesn't have a lot of the
harsh chemicals that other champions -
and it's really safe and effective on
the animal are you going to give
yourself a ball it was perfect
there was no mess and that was about an
hour shorter than what it would have
taken me to give him a normal bath it
was great and he dried a lot faster yes
when I first saw the product I thought
there was no way that this was actually
going to work on Oreo she just got too
much hair it really really worked good
it's better for the homeowner because
they'll use a lot less water it's better
for the homeowner because they won't
have to wrestle the dog to get them in
out of the bathtub and really delivers
on the promise that it's supposed to
give to the pet parrot which is we're
going to take care of your dog in a way
that's never been done it's easier for
you and easier for your dog please join
us in this new adventure in caring for
your dog be one of the first to get your
bark bath order now and keep checking
back with us as we'll be posting new
videos and updates
you
