develop the device to help keep you safe
introducing the Zeus smart tire safety
monitors the next-generation technology
that puts you in control of your driving
safety safety has never looked so sexy
using the most advanced German sensors
Zeus monitors both tire pressure and
temperature in real-time and sends this
data to the app Zeus is the first ever
tire monitor to be able to detect slow
leaks with its advanced data mining
technology this proprietary algorithm
called accurate temp analyzes pressure
and temperature data over time and
alerts you to any slow leaks that other
tire monitoring systems would have
missed the app report clearly pinpoints
the exact tire and the rate of leakage
to make it even more versatile we've
designed it as an advice that anyone can
stealth install take it with you on your

innovations to our regret some of these
creations are fading out
one of them is MagSafe after
considerable time and effort in research
and development we resolved to resurrect
MagSafe a genius design by Steve Jobs

recaptures the comfort brought by Maxine
at the same time retaining the benefits
of USBC and Thunderbolt 3 for all your
USB C devices also on the team is a
renowned manufacturer whose expertise
was recognized in many other successful
Kickstarter projects such as pebble time
and Dropcam they help us ensure quality
and feasibility so why do we call
ourselves magazine maxi stands for magic
