inflated tire is three times more likely
to cause a crash so let's do some damage
thirty-eight psi a good tire deflating
it to 27 25 percent lower now it's three
times more dangerous now this one and
this one okay owner it's come here I
want to guess which front tire it's
under inflated this one lifts up a
little different cell it's the same yes
they do and this is the real danger you
can't tell by just looking that's how we
develop the device to help keep you safe
introducing the Zeus smart tire safety
monitors the next-generation technology
that puts you in control of your driving
safety safety has never looked so sexy
using the most advanced German sensors
Zeus monitors both tire pressure and
temperature in real-time and sends this
data to the app Zeus is the first ever
tire monitor to be able to detect slow
leaks with its advanced data mining
technology this proprietary algorithm
called accurate temp analyzes pressure
and temperature data over time and
alerts you to any slow leaks that other
tire monitoring systems would have
missed the app report clearly pinpoints
the exact tire and the rate of leakage
to make it even more versatile we've
designed it as an advice that anyone can
stealth install take it with you on your
next trip and easily install in just
three steps on your rental car
when it comes to protecting your family
everywhere you go to the next generation
in safety technology Zoo smart tire
safety monitor Binondo
today's technology for yesterday's call
back that's now on IndieGoGo take a good
look around you you will easily notice
creations that are crafted with
precision and perfection their design
connects intimately with our feelings
and body contour thus catering for our
desire and behavior among these
creations many are technological
innovations to our regret some of these
creations are fading out
one of them is MagSafe after
considerable time and effort in research
and development we resolved to resurrect
MagSafe a genius design by Steve Jobs
but we don't stop there we adapt
magazine to the functionality of modern
gadgets
making it the only design on the market
that encapsulates three technologies
MagSafe USBC and thunderbolt three
this means with only one connector and
one port
it can provide superfast data transfer
and high-resolution video updates it
recaptures the comfort brought by Maxine
at the same time retaining the benefits
of USBC and Thunderbolt 3 for all your
USB C devices also on the team is a
renowned manufacturer whose expertise
was recognized in many other successful
Kickstarter projects such as pebble time
and Dropcam they help us ensure quality
and feasibility so why do we call
ourselves magazine maxi stands for magic
continues it is our aspiration to bring
back the magic of Steve Jobs
and to continue his dedication in
empathetic and human focused designs we
hope to take our next step with you
support us in breathing new life in
MagSafe claim your discounted price by
clicking back this project make your
pledge now and we will see you on the
other side
