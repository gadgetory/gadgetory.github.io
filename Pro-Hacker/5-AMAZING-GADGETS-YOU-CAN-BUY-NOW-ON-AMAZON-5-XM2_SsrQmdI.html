encyclopedia it's intriguing to everyone
especially our children's curious minds
but it's difficult to control what they
see and so there needs to be a
gatekeeper something simple just plug
and play
a device that can restrict access to
irrelevant information that can protect
all our children's devices
and at the same time allow us to use our
own Wi-Fi
Ruby can easily find her way no matter
what device you go
and Jacobs can access his favorite
guitar lessons the kids can do their own
thing and we can see what they're up to
and if they need an exception no worries
then when we want to have family time we
have family time no distractions
order now at net.com more than 40% of
our lives are spent in habit for most of
us that time is wasted
the secret to transformation is not to
try harder it's to replace bad habits
with the habits of excellence if you
wanted to transform yourself how would
you start first identify the habits that
hold you back
paired them with a negative stimulus
like electric shock
each surge of voltage trains your brain
and weakens the neural connection until
the bad habit is severed next replace
the bad habit with a positive one reward
yourself when you complete your daily
goal commit to a penalty if you fail the
fear of loss stimulates your basal
ganglia while the chance of reward
motivates your prefrontal cortex in
fewer than 30 days the action becomes a
habit
Havelock is the first system designed to
help you build good habits and break bad
ones earn rewards when you succeed pay
the price when you fail and experience
the electric shock that keeps you on
track contribute to the crowdfunding
campaign today
hi I'm Annie shakey founder of padlock
now I know that electric shock sounds
crazy but sometimes crazy works like
many revolutionary ideas I always
started off just as a fun project but it
turned into something much more together
with my co-founder Jim Lynch we set out
to create
pavlok the world's first device that
doesn't just track what you do but
actually changes what you do here you
see pavlok in its wristband fold but at
its core padlock is a small module small
enough that it can stick anywhere on
your body
now padlock is able to vibrate beep and
even electrically shocked you on command
but what padlock can do is much more
instead of me telling you what padlock
and you let me show you what padlock is
already done
hi my name is David Goldstein I'm hoping
to use padlock to get me into a better
exercise routine I am a cancer survivor
at a heart attack I was in a wheelchair
for a while and I still have some
paralysis both legs as you can see I've
put on a great deal of weight and I'm
hoping that padlock and help me address
all of those issues I am at 65 days out
of the past 71 of using the padlock
system I am down seven pounds my arms
have got noticeably stronger and my legs
are actually the strongest they've been
since I was paralyzed in 2001 it will
put my kids more at the end of the day
it's now just part of who I am and what
I do you see most of us just don't know
what greatness feels like we assume that
we're going to do what we've always done
but users like David to tell a different
story
when they begin to fall back into the
old routine Cavazos them out of it in
those cases their older team can do a
place that he was in 30 day people are
already using pavlok to begin writing
everyday to learn new languages to
exercise the journal to begin to perform
and break dozens of your hat
in fact there's infinite capabilities
thanks to padlocks open developer API I
know firsthand how powerful small habit
changes can be I'm excited to share
pavlok with the world
that's where IndieGoGo supporters like
you come in we've built the padlock
prototypes we've begun testing on users
now we need your help begin setting up
manufacturing so we can deliver pavlok
and help it change the how does that
matter most to you yeah well I don't
really know where to start
Rango was probably the coolest cat on
the face of the planet he used to ride
up to work with me on my motorcycle he
used to go to cafes to get out there's a
pretty cool relationship and eventually
I came across a note stuck to a tree
saying that they had found this really
beautiful tabby cat dead on the side of
the road I decided if nobody else had
found a way of tracking cats and dogs
then I was certainly going to but this
is pod life it's the smallest and
lightest GPS tracker in market as an
interchangeable battery it's waterproof
it has bluetooth but the most important
thing is that this device can be
attached to your animals color and sync
to your phone allowing you to always
know where your animal is you never have
to worry about losing your phone again
we've spent a lot of time getting the
product design absolutely bang-on the
ergonomic design is really cool with no
sharp edges so it's as comfortable as
possible for the animal the app is a
really sleek user experience that's both
fun and functional for you and we've
squeezed as much as we can out of the
battery life getting up to a week's
usage I don't know you be inconsolable
kill off your dog not knowing where they
are or what they're doing or they're
alive or well
he's that type that tends to just wander
and then we rely on other people to
bring him back but we're always worried
that there'll be a time when we're
losing forever they're one of the most
amazing features that we've developed is
a pet League which is like a social
network for your animal this is going to
allow you to compare your animals
results across the world so you'll be
able to determine whether you put the
fastest dog in the park or the most
adventurous cat in the country the app
allows you to set safe zone alerts so
you can actually see when your animal
breaches the set perimeter through an
alert on your phone you know he just he
disappeared he goes on adventures it's
cool like that just to be able to see
what he's done
how far each dog ran and then we can
compare them to see what kinds of
Maggie's past so we're really excited
because they have confirmed orders from
some of the largest pet retailers in the
world we've finalized the design and
we're just about to go into the final
stages of production we really need some
help in production and that's why we'd
like you to support us in this campaign
and make sure that nobody ever has to go
through the pain of losing their animal
again like I did
by
you
