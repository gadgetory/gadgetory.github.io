today's world our phones tablets and
even watches require constant power you
could carry around a brick sized power
bank or be constantly on the lookout for
a power outlet but what if there was
something better a lighter smaller and
smarter option introducing tag by Sol
Pro sulfur was founded with one goal in
mind and that was to make renewable
energies very convenient ways and bring
them mainstream Sol protag is integrated
with highly efficient SunPower solar
cells that recharge the internal battery
in a matter of hours by connecting it to
anything that you have by just hooking
it into this these little bumpers and
hooking it on your backpack you're
charging just by walking outside you're
getting more energy into the battery and
then just the size and weight making it
so easy for anyone to use it anything
yeah the contrast of this to that size
blows me away
tag features a clean attractive design
that is water and dust resistant it
attaches neatly to any bag giving you
hassle-free solar charging capability
when you're out and about or on the go
something like this grabbing solar
energy charging up your phone
keeping your Bluetooth headset charged
can be done off of sunlight that you
don't even have to think about tag
weighs less than 2 ounces is the size of
about four credit cards stacked on each
other it can work with any existing USB
cable and can be recharged quickly from
any USB port or on-the-go by the Sun
with the built-in solar cell now we need
to do is we need to give this in many
hands as possible we want people to be
using this and that's why we partnered
with tracker the world's biggest network
of users for tracking devices around the
world the world's biggest lost-and-found
the same features and functionality the
tracker now in this you know trackers
helping about 2 million people a day
find lost items now we'll be helping
millions more with this featuring
tracker technology via the tracker app
you can locate tag in the event you lose
or misplace your bag briefcase or
backpack
or toss it in your luggage while
traveling to keep tabs on your things
tag works with Amazon Alexa Google home
and nest offering all the features and
functionality of a standard tracker
device
well tracker is so thrilled to be
partnering with industry leaders like
Sol pro to integrate a necessary
technology track of our important thing
but that's not it we've also partnered
with OtterBox to make the tag fully
compatible with the OtterBox universe
case system you slide it onto your case
and now you can give your phone half a
charge you can charge it with the solar
panel and it has tracking so if you lose
your phone you can use family share and
your roommate your spouse can help you
find your phone like that we want the
sole pro tag to be the most successful
product that we've made to date in order

campaign thank you
my name is Alan I am the founder and
creator of weight originally a physicist
and I'm a full-time product designer
wayafter smart high precision miniature
wireless weighing devices that have been
designed to weigh anything in the home
last year when I was armed
I wanted to weigh my luggage but I
couldn't find any scale that was capable
of wearing a large bag so I looked
around the house and I found that my
parents had a kitchen scale and office
scale even a bathroom scale but they
didn't have anything that could just
wait and a suitcase could weigh anything
so we decided to create a device that
could weigh anything in the home and
that's when we came up with the idea of
where
because it outputs to a smart device
that allows us to basically create
applications for our user that makes
their life a lot easier we can actually
weigh nutrient content of food rather
than just the food itself it's a lot
more accurate than normal dieting the
idea behind the waste very innovative
part of this is that it doesn't have any
surface so you can use any of your
platform in the house as a weighing
platform so for example you how you want
to weigh the suitcase
your suitcase could just become the
weighing platform quite often when
you're trying to weigh a baby or you're
trying to weigh attachments because that
pet needs care and is stressed or is ill
so the best thing that ways you can use
wherever they're happiest how's the
weighing scale so you can use the dogs
dead
you can even weigh them whether they're
sleeping or you can wait a baby while
it's asleep in its crib which ways you
can weigh in real time so no longer do
you have to pack your bag close it pick
it back up and put it back down you can
remove and add items as you see fit this
is so small that it fits in your pocket
so you can just kind of put in your
pocket when you're traveling or you're
you just go into a restaurant to one you
know have food you can just pick it up
put it on the plate on the table and
then weigh the food and stuff so I think
that's the whole idea how well it's fit
one of the big benefits of waste is that
we've designed to have a very very high
very very high precision and have a high
resolution across a wide range of ways
so you can use weigh it in the kitchen -
weight grams or spoons of ingredients
originally when we designed this way
there was it's like travel scale or a
kitchen scale but but the number of
people approached us with various things
like weighing bees and pets and rabbits
and weighing scrap metal and I think
that those are the things which we've
never thought about weighing is an
age-old problem and we've found a really
modern smart solution
we're way smarter
