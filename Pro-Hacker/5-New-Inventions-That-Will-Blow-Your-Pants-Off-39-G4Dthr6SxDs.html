thanks to bixie one move and they could
stop their alarm and that's just the
beginning they can also control all
kinds of connected devices with simple
gestures it's very useful when alex is
on his bike and can't focus on anything
but the road or when lisa is so busy
working doing stuff that she just can't
touch your devices just like them
anytime you want to do many things at
the same time Big C can help it's smart
seamless and easy well easier than
cooking apparently
no need to stop doing what you're doing
no need to reach the device you want to
interact with you can even switch from
one function to another from one device
to another with a simple gesture told
you it was smart and because fixie is
full of surprises it also lets you
control your environment believe me
that's something you will like well you
know almost everything now so what are
you waiting for
anything strange here
yeah quite unusual everyone is doing it
it appears and dissapears
very curious
what you probably didn't notice is the
most important thing everyone is sitting
straight up hello and welcome to posture
party this is our test group propose a
small silent and effective device that
buzzes when you slouch
simple and affordable
to show us when it triggers we asked our
participants to strike a funny pose
everytime they feel a buzz
otherwise we would never notice because
hose is so discreet and invisible from
the outside here it is pose a magic
button that works much better than
countless reminders to sit up straight
and straighten up remember those so how
does it work first no apps no charging
no complicated diagrams we want results
in the mirror not on the screen with
pose it's simple you wear it at home at
work in school and no one will ever know
will repeat that no one will know place
it underneath your collarbone straighten
up and press a button that's it
pose tracked your movement so if you
slouch for more than a minute it will
buzz pose also comes with an attachable
clip in case you find wearing it on your
clothes more comfortable start with 20
minutes a day and in three weeks you
will improve your posture here's why
in reality sitting up straight isn't
about you it's about your muscles they
need systematic and repetitive reminders
over time to memorize a new position and
get stronger pose does just that in a
gentle and discreet way a long time ago
Aristotle said we are what we repeatedly
do
excellence is not an act but a habit
we felt compelled to create a device
that will effortlessly get us into a new
healthy habit no matter for who you
order pose it will surely be one of the
most useful present you'll ever give the
best way to say sit-up is not saying it
at all join us now and let's make it
happen
strike us pose
you
