them for years but that hasn't really
improved the way that we drive them in
creating automatic we set out to unlock
our cars potential and redefine people's
relationship to driving making it safer
more efficient and fun we did this by
introducing your car to your smartphone
it all starts with the automatic link
just plug it in to your car's data port
and follow the simple instructions on
the screen
now your car and smartphone will connect
wirelessly whenever you drive most
people don't realize just how big an
impact their driving style can have on
fuel efficiency you can sit up to 1/3 on
gas with only a few adjustments to how
you drive an automatic helps you do that
without being a backseat driver it
learns about your driving style and
gives you subtle audio cues when you do
things that waste gas like accelerating
quickly the app shows your weekly Drive
score and trip timeline so you can track
your progress and see where to improve a
high score could save you hundreds on
gas every year when you drive automatic
monitors your car's health and more and
do something's wrong so if your check
engine light comes on you'll see a
description of the problem and possible
solutions you can even clear the light
yourself and save a trip to the mechanic
because automatic connected to your car
when you drive it always knows where you
parked your family can even access that
location for seamless car sharing
accidents happen and far too often there
isn't someone there to help if you're
ever in a crash automatic alerts 9-1-1
with your location you can even contact
your loved ones to let them know what's
happened and that help is on the way we
wanted to reimagine what driving could
be and I think we did that with
automatic we believe that cars should
live up to their potential and that
every driver can be a smarter driver
that's why we created automatic that's
smart driving a six
you see amazing isn't it this is the air
selfie the only portable flying camera
integrated into your mobile phone cover
micro and ultralight it comes with it's
very own device for storage and charging
with an easy one-hand control from its
own where did the idea come from
well I'll show you look at this what an
epic day out of bonafide selfie time as
they say just need to squeeze a teeny
bit no oh never mind ah more manageable
group just two guys actually they want
to take a selfie to remember this
wonderful place well I guess they can
just describe the view to their friends
back home right okay one more try this
time a good old barbecue outside on a
sunny day with lots of friends let's try
the selfie stick strategy still can't
fit everybody in annoying situations am
i right we've all been there buddy
that's how air selfie was born a perfect
team gathered together working in London
Milan and Shanghai to combine micro
flying technologies ultralight HD
cameras with in flight stability systems
our selfie can travel in a 20 meter
radius and hovers for up to three
minutes it's easily controllable from
both iOS or Android smartphone apps it's
only 52 grams and it's locked into its
phone cover and recharges so what if the
guys had an air selfie with them they
make it hover find the perfect angle and
leave the controls finally snap an
amazing photo with the selfie delay
timer mode while it is autonomously
flying and keeping its position in the
air
awesome what about the two explorers
they select the classic flying mode from
the three options available control
layer selfie through the app by holding
the phone horizontally and take both
memorable photos and videos and what
would have happened at the barbecue
enough with the squeezing just select
the selfie mode use only two buttons to
find the right distance to shoot and
take a great picture what about an
indoor location whatever it may be a
party at somebody's house for a night
out in a club there are no issues there
selfie fly's easily it's simple to
control and very safe
and once you shoot a great picture don't
keep it to yourself
it's so easy to share it right from your
phone as easy as grabbing the air selfie
safely while it's still hovering in the
air so this is air selfie the only
portable flying camera integrated into
your mobile phone cover ready to explore
new perspectives let's take a look at

its own custom phone cover a battery
