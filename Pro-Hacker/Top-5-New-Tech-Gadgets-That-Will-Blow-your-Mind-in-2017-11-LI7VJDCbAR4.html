and drinking clean water but what about
the air you breathe do you realize that
you actually ingest 12 times more air
than food and five times more than water
introducing the supremo personal air
monitor a keychain sized air monitor
that plugs into your iphone and lets you
see what you smells the app gives you
real-time readings of temperature
humidity and air quality based on
precision measurements of volatile
organic compounds a coloring number
scale tells you the quality of the air
around you opt into our community and
share your results and contribute to a
worldwide real-time air quality map we
are constantly surrounded by toxins in
the air around us from common products
like cleaners and dirty clothes to smog
pollution secondhand smoke paint and pet
waste the most obvious results are the 1
in 12 people who suffer from asthma or
the more than half of Americans who live
in areas with unhealthy air quality but
in reality almost everyone is subjected
to poor air quality at some point during
the day
screamo can monitor your air wherever
you are or confirm your suspicions so
you can do something about it
hello my name is dr. TJ Osborn you know
after 23 years in practice one of the
things that I have found out that it
separates sick people from healthy
people is that healthy people know their
numbers if you don't know your blood
pressure you're going to have heart
issues if you don't know the numbers
about what's in the air that you breathe
you're going to have breathing issues
that's why I find that a personal air
monitor is absolutely required for
people to be healthy supremo keeps you
informed whether you're at work home
school
outside a bar salon restaurant where the
airport supremo was founded by Ray combs
and Harold Hahn Ray has helped bring
about products like the palm pilot and
Amazon Kindle and is passionate about
improving indoor air quality to help his
son who has asthma Harold has been
studying chemistry for years at New York
University where he got his PhD and
hails from China where air pollution in
many cities makes it impossible to go
outside thus primo air monitor lets you
be fully aware of those deep breaths
you're taking me screamo is helping
people breathe easier
wow the air quality here is so great
today ok everyone let's take a deep
breath
you

hi my name is Rita suave and then
professional designer as a motorsport
enthusiast I spent many years selling
American sailboard challenge' concerning
every possible floating device that
exists back to the sea to life as a
designer I still dream about personal
smartboard that could fit any
environment and scale any waters to
fulfill this goal against a team of
professionals who all share same dream
and design purity and efficient
generation after 15 months of hard work
this is a time to enjoy Harbor High part
is a modular smartphone that can be
rapidly transformed from a kayak into a
rowing sailing or even solar powered
boat its innovative hull shape ensures
excellent speed and stability whilst the
groundbreaking folding design enables
instant transformation from a boat into
a backpack in less than three minutes
and thanks to its modest dimensions and
lightness high bar fits into any means
of transportation vehicle or location
Portability and storage have never been
so simple we rethink the concept of a
boat completely to conceive a unique
shape of the hull a perfectly
streamlined sleek elegant hull is
bordered by hard shines running from the
sharp wave piercing bow to the wide
Stern the shape is conceptualized around
two counterpoise hyperbolic paraboloids
hence the name hype art this form
resembles the water surface when pierced
by a moving object the angle and shape
of hype are matches with water wake
patterns thereby improving performance
by reducing drag optimizing stability
and enhancing control hype R is well
suited for several environments from
open sea to narrow streams Gale wind and
breaking waves of the ocean
metropolis waters and the most remote
corners of the planet are all open to

grade of advanced polypropylene material
a keyboard specifically adapted for
marine conditions and the unique design
of high par to conceive a sustainable

the environment hype R&amp;amp;D s Smith team
made sure that the material would be
100% recyclable with a lifelong
