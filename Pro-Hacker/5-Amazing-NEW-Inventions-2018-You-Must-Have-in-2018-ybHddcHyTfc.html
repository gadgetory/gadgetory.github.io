get your power bean now what if home
security was different what if it looked
different
what if it helped you remember stuff
what if it never nagged you for
passcodes
what if the measure of it working right
as we go was that you never had to think
about it
what if it could quietly take care of
things
what if it was so easy to use you've
actually used it you have three minutes
to exit
what if it gave you time
and what you really need from home
security a sense of security
Hey what are you doing here wondering
what that was that's pop beter it's your
own personal fear for watching movies on
your mobile device and comfort and
privacy people go to the theater not
only to watch the latest movies but for
the experience that comes with it
pop peter allows you to get that theater
experience wherever you are no longer
will you have to deal with your arm
getting sore home holding your phone up
and off musicians or your phone hitting
your face when you're holding it up now
you can subtly focus on what it is
you're watching up until now there
hasn't been an all-in-one solution that
keeps your body free while giving you
the privacy you deserve the theater
itself is the mean part of the product
it's built from a breathable polyester
material that both blocks off outside
light from entering and provides proper
temperature regulation well inside
inside pop theater a transparent plate
is stitched in near the top providing a
place for your device to rest at the
perfect distance from your eyes by the
way
pop features compatible with nearly any
size phone or tablet the custom
Bluetooth enabled remote allow that you
control your video while your device is
out of reach an included dual driver a
wireless speaker delivers high-quality
sound throughout the feeder that could
not be achieved with the device alone
the speaker also functions as a power
bank so you do not have to worry about
running out of battery while watching
your video the theater is held up by
four poles which are also able to fold
for easy storage
we know you're always on the go so we
designed the feeder to collapse down for
easy portability and storage to use pop
feeder first remove the components from
the carrying bag unfold the poles and
slide each one through the sleeves
located on the outside of the theater
and then fasten them in place insert the
flexible plastic board around the inside
walls of the theater for support connect
both the remote
speaker to your device via bluetooth and
open the movie or show you're going to
watch on your device make sure your
device's screen is in the correct
orientation before placing it under the
larger elastic strap we need a view from
below place the speaker under the
smaller of the two elastic straps
attached to the plate pop theater lets
you get the most out of your device
giving you the complete cinema
experience you can be at the park at
home or even at the movies and still use
pop theatres as long as you have a place
to lie down there's been nothing like
this previously that solves every issue
in an all-in-one solution hi my name is
Eli and this is my partner Samir pop
figure all began as a project in our
engineering class after numerous designs
and prototypes we've developed the
perfect solution to the long lived
problem of watching movies and shows on
mobile devices and discomfort we
currently have three manufacturers lined
up to produce each component of pop
theater but we need your help to
contribute to our campaign so we can get
the funds necessary to mass-produce our
product thank you
hi my name is John Barrera I'm the
founder of Rai bought the company behind
the RAI five Wi-Fi gives parents the
ability to control when their kids can
use their home Wi-Fi it's a hardware
device controlled by simple text
commands or an easy-to-use mobile app
today I'd like to show you how it works
one of our team's highest priorities in
designing Leifheit was to keep it simple
Wi-Fi is incredibly easy to set up and
even easier to use after plugging Wi-Fi
to a power outlet just connected to your
current internet source with a standard
cable the LED lights indicate that ryfi
has power and is connected to the
Internet
once Wi-Fi starts broadcasting it will
appear in the list of available networks
that you can connect your internet
devices to after installing the ryfi
mobile app you'll have control over this
new Wi-Fi network but they single tap on
the pause button the ryfi network turns
off tap again to turn it back on again
we've kept the design incredibly simple
the app even allows you to control Wi-Fi
using a timer in addition to the quick
on our feature you can set Wi-Fi to be
on or off for a certain amount of time
just select the amount of time and start
the timer
the ryfi app always shows you the
current state of the network including
how much time is left on any timer in
effect you can use the ryfi network just
as you would use the existing Wi-Fi in
your home connect any Wi-Fi device
phones tablets gaming consoles anything
you'd like to manage another feature
we're excited about is the ability to
control Wi-Fi using text messages
texting simple commands to Wi-Fi means
you don't even have to open up an app
Wi-Fi can pause schedule or give
internet status all through texting I
developed Wi-Fi to help teach my kids
time management in that there's life
beyond screen time I'm happy to say that
we have been using it successfully in
our home for several months now I'm John
Barrera
founder of Wi-Fi and I'm going to plug
myself now for
and head outside to play soccer with my
son thanks for watching
you
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
