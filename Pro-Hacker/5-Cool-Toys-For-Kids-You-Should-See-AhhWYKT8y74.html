shy a pilot an industrial designer and
an inventor he loves things that fly he
wants try to turn his car into an
airplane no success shy always said that
his dream was to bring the joy of flight
to everyone a few years ago he made a
breakthrough in the field of cool stuff
that flies he invented the power up the
first electric paper airplane but then a
friend of shai's told him nice gadget
really but you can't make a
remote-controlled paper airplane shy
took a moment to think and said
challenge accepted two years of research
and 57 prototypes later he made it
happen
Meech eyes unbelievably magical
invention power up three the first ever
smartphone controlled paper airplane
using state-of-the-art technology power
up three turns your embarrassing paper
plane into a lean mean flying machine
just hold a piece of copy paper to a
plane attach power up three and install
the app now call your mom and tell your
pilot because it works out of the box in
the back of the module are a propeller
and a rudder that are in charge of
controlling the plane in the front
there's an advanced ship with powerful
Bluetooth smart technology for an
amazing 60 yards of controlled flight
and a tiny rechargeable battery to power
this amazing beast out of juice charge
the battery with any microUSB cable as I
learned in his career as a pilot planes
should be building or flying and for
crashing that's why all components of
the powerup 3 are super durable and
crash proof but here's where shy made it
really cool power up threes smart chip
is programmed to optimize user happiness
you don't need a PhD in Aero now text to
be able to fly it the prototype is fully
functional and the super ultra magical
powerup 3 is ready for production this
is where shy need your magic beans if
you help shy get to 1,400 backers you'll
help him bring the joy of flight to
everyone and obtain the privilege to
look down on regular paper planes for
the rest of your life so back power up 3
and help make the magical magical herb
