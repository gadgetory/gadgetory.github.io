evaporative material it consists of
mineral nanofibers although it has a
simple look the inner structure is
complex this material allowed us to take
a fresh look on a conventional air
conditioner and exclude anything that

hi I'm Jack and I'm Davis we're two
brothers from Austin Texas who are
passionate about hydration
as athletes we've often needed to track
our water consumption but solving that
problem led us to a more important
question how much water should we be
drinking drinking too much or too little
can be dangerous and the reality is that
everyone's optimal level of hydration
depends on a bunch of different factors
that are unique to you your workout
schedule age gender location your sweat
rate and even the weather are all key to
the equation in the past only elite
athletes had access to the tools needed
to dial in optimal hydration that is
until now introducing Trago the world's
first connected smart water bottle
you
the Tago cap fits on any standard
widemouth water bottle and connects to
an app on your smartphone using
Bluetooth Low Energy
it runs on a commonly found replaceable
battery because the last thing you need
is another device to charge it uses
patent-pending
ultrasonic technology to measure how
much you drink with the Trago cap you
know exactly how much you should be
drinking each day more than that the app
automatically builds and adjusts your
profile by seamlessly connecting to
other wearable devices so there's no
extra work for you imagine recording a
long workout on another app or device
and then immediately understanding how
to hydrate for proper recovery or using
the app to note just how much water to
drink leading up to a marathon or
football game the toggle cap also allows
you to monitor teams groups and multiple
bottles coaches and trainers can keep an
eye on all their players because proper
hydration happens long before the game
starts with our experienced team we've
already solved most of the challenges
and bringing the Trago cap to reality
we're ready to take our product into
manufacturing but we need your help
please spread the word and help us
support our mission and changing the way
people think about hydration
