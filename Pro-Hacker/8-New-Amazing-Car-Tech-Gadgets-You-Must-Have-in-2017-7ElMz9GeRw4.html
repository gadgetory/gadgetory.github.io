founder of cluster accessories what we
are all about is creating an array of
simple quality versatile product the
first product we're going to launch in
because one day my dad and I were
driving in his car and his suction cup
phone holder fell from the windshield to
his feet and when you leaned down to
pick it up we almost crash into oncoming
traffic that's what inspired me to
create a better phone holder I like to
introduce to you the clutches this is
the safest hands-free phone holder
available clutch a magnetic phone holder

these anywhere that's not already of
metallic surface you can clutch it right
next to your computer while you're
working your office you could clutch it
right in front of you while you're
cooking reading your recipe you can
clutch it in front of the treadmills
while you run
you could clutch it in your garage while
you're working on your car this is for
social media
you just have to clutch it and shoot
your own selfie video hopefully you see
the value that this product can help you
make your life easier and I hope you are

worry you'll come back to find it's been
damaged broken into towed away or even
stolen are you ever concerned about your
loved ones while they're out on the road

the FBI in 2014 a car was stolen every
14 seconds along with a rise in
break-ins and assaults across the u.s.
what if you were able to receive an
instant notification on your smartphone
if any of those things were to happen
and at the same time receive a video of
the event as it's occurring now imagine
if you are able to prevent these things
from even happening what would that
peace of mind be worth to you

will save energy and money get go far in
your car and drive happiness I got sick
of stuffing snowboards and skis in the
bench in my car the time I wanted to hit
them out I wasn't very excited about new
axes and my kids and I didn't want to
pay five hundred plus for Iraq so we set
out to create high quality but
affordable rack that fits on every
vehicle allows you to haul whatever you
want when everyone
venture is always changing you want
effects like legroom or car space for
your gears so we created a rack that
name will be every day in the odium Star
Trek is to phonebloks
case and weatherproof canvas that sits
on any vehicle and in a tradition we
spend a ton of time developing and
testing this product it has anti slip
anti scratch rubbers designed to protect
your gear and the roof of your car there
are seven security loops for
customization it secure to the strap
that's as strong as a seatbelt and not
going to damage your car it's enclosed
in weatherproof canvas built to handle
the most extreme conditions
wastes were engulfed by mass production
accelerating consumption and rampant
materialism products are designed to
become obsolete when they started for
the next big thing for the policing of
natural resources at astonishing rate or
public polluters and trash in today
ryley
developments and sustainability are
promising but they're not happening fast
enough and the solutions are still too
expensive and inaccessible what if we
can make a machines last longer run more
efficiently and self-improve instead of
supporting the high turnover consumerism
that we pieces a what if we had solution
here and now that's our mission at try
rotecks
exactly in the problem of waste by
creating the first of its kind
nanoparticles that actually repair
machines of increasing performance and
efficiency harnessing the power of
nanotechnology we came of a small
solution to this big problem private X
nanoparticles has two faces one design I
want that's like the sticky side
reinforces and strengthens or the
slippery side reduces friction just like
carbon telling the diamond in the mantle
of the earth TurboTax self aligned to a
diamond like lattice structure under the
heat and pressure of the engine unlike
other protective proteins this process
actually reverses engine where particle
by particle resources were better than
new condition for initial focus was to
make lubricants paper
come on mania nanomaterials we worked on
one unique outlier reduced friction
dramatically down to super lubricity
level with the help of national labs and
research agencies we understood the
mechanism and developed proprietary
production process after years of
research and rigorous testing who are
proud to introduce car boss a safe and
green additive for your car by improves
gas mileage boost horsepower and extend
the life of your engine car boss comes
in a small recyclable applicator that
you inject it into the oil fill of your
car
as you drive turbotech nanoparticles are
forged into a diamond like armor around
engine components rejuvenating our daily
driver system more efficient than when
it was new a third of the gas that you
put in your car is wasted on engine
friction with 612 million cars on the
road that waste adds up running on
carbo's will use less fuel reduce
pollution and leave a smaller carbon
footprint we're ready to go to market
and we need your help back our
Kickstarter and be the first to adopt a
revolutionary technology that will make
our world more efficient more powerful
and more sucessful car bombs by tri
Rotax stuck in traffic chaos every day
the greatest hope is getting home safely
you always follow the rules but you know
there are people who don't so how do you
protect your family you do everything
you can to keep saying but when an
irresponsible driver causes an accident
how do you prove that it's not your
fault
introducing ultra doux oz2 their best
road buddy z2 is a smart dual lands dash
cam that records everything on the road

license plate number for those
professional drivers v2 helps you to
avoid troubles both inside and outside
of your vehicle

recording
you
a new and novel teapot z2 is bears
protective v2 will automatically store

which might steal it
in case of an accident or emergency stop
the recording of that time with
automatic detective you will never lose
