the are eating parsley we're eating our
yoga pants and we're eating our gym
clothes my name is Rachel Miller and
this problem I'm talking about is
microfiber solution
our clothes are breaking up into tiny
little pieces and flowing out our
washing machine into our public water
ways these pieces of microfiber are so
small smaller even than a red blood cell
that they're eaten by creatures of all
sizes and in all levels of the marine
food web and what they eat
weed everyone who wears in wash clothes
is part of this problem but don't be
overwhelmed we have a solution meet the
core of all the core of all is the first
microfiber catching laundry ball it's a
human scale consumer based solution to
the problem of microfiber pollution the
core of all is inspired by coral because
coral does what we need
coral allows water to flow and picks
little things out of that flowing water
the core of all is really really easy to
use you just throw or drop it in a
washing machine it works in any washing
machine you don't need a plumber there
are no installation costs and you don't
need extra space this is what Cora looks
like while doing her job once your
laundry is done
you clean coral like you clean a
hairbrush you just pick out the bits of
buzz and stir them in the trash bin
there is a big bonus the core ball
catches hair that is a big deal in this
household and I am only one-third of the
stories
our team has been working on this
solution for over a year
cord born out of our work on the water
this is a true social enterprise the
success of the core ball first and
foremost means a cleaner ocean secondly
proceeds support Rizal you projects work
cleaning and protecting the ocean and
developing and implementing more
solutions to the problem of marine
debris our backers are really important
to this project and to the team we've
already had the funding you order the
mold and files test so this Kickstarter
is all about production you will help us
get the car ball out into the world if
10 percent of us have fold music or
balls we can keep the plastic equivalent
of over 30 million water bottles out of
our public waterways every year that's a
big impact for promotion we hope you'll
help us get the car ball out into the
world so together we can make a
difference
I love to barbecue and I love to grill
there's just something about the taste
Hickory mesquite alder and cherry mmm
juiciness you get from a slow cooker now
I just use my finger ills wood pellet
grill I can smoke grill bakes brain
roast and barbecue all in one I have to
say it's my new secret weapon the grills
automatically moves wood pellets into
the electric burner at a consistent rate
for even heating the fire never touches
the food keeping it from unwanted
charring after plugging the grills in
just tell Dee Grylls whether you like to
smoke or cook providing that great wood
flavor with the ease and convenience for
the gas grill using a gas grill you just
don't get that natural wood flavor and
aroma charcoal grills are just too messy
it's difficult to control when you start
or stop cooking after my prep it
straight into the Z grills whose smoke
and cooks all in one place
besides the convenience of smoking and
grilling at the turn of a dial I can
also make this delicious wood fired
pizza z grouse digital temperature
control makes it easy for me to step
away for the more important well more
fun things now that you know all of my
grilling secrets get one for yourself at
an amazing price get yourself a Z grill
to lead 900 today
I don't care how old you are the zero
blaster smoke ring launcher is awesome
and it's even more awesome if you have a
friend to do battle with I'll be right
back
the zero blaster fires harmless smoke
Ling's made from a water-based non-toxic
super fluid the vortex rings range from
two to four inches in diameter and can
fire up to twelve there's a ray gun
sound feature you can turn on and off as
well as the function to adjust the speed
at which it fires waiver rings timeout
so how does this thing actually work the
zero blaster creates an area of low
pressure and when that area has air flow
surrounding it this smoky vortex forms
okay cover me I'm going in
