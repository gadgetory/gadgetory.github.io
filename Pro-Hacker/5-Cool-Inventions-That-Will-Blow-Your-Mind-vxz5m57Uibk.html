the way it makes you feel almost
everyone when tasked would like to have
more fitness in their lives but for most
of us it falls to the bottom of our
priority list so we developed the body
boss 2.0 we wanted a product that would
empower people to reach their goals
where you'd be able to exercise more
often and consistently we want a product
that is compact something that could do
it all with no restrictions this
equipment is something that anyone could
use no matter their fitness level a
product it takes all these concepts from
the gym and combines them into one
solution bring in the gym to you the
platform is strong the posts are spaced
evenly apart on both sides so you can
simulate any exercise movement and
quickly adjust difficulty the base is
made wide enough to stand comfortably
during your workout and we even added a
layer of non-slip material to assure you
stay in place the bands were customized
for this concept and can handle any
height
there's even cloth in the bands to
protect you simply clip in to get
started
shorten the bands or add bands to
increase difficulty our most popular
exercise is squatting with the bar it's
like a workout bar you would see at the
gym but more portable it can unscrew and
it features grip padding for comfort the
ends of the bar spend a full 360 degrees
and are shaped to avoid the clips from
slide providing you the most natural
feel possible through all of your
exercise motions adding or dropping
bands easily provides many resistance
uppers we added accessories to simulate
even more solutions such as handles that
will add weight adding bands are like
increasing your weight with a dumbbell
the wrist straps are double padded for
comfort and sweat resistant to stay in
place we even added a door anchor can
increase the workout the body boss is
lightweight made of high-grade injection
molding and capable of handling hundreds
of pounds of force the underside has
non-slip feet for safe use on any
surface the adjustable posts make for
easy storage starting from day one you
can choose your color green pink you can
choose your package and choose how you
want to follow workouts live replay
program all on your own but by backing
this IndieGoGo today you can get it for
a fraction of that price empowering
people just like you to reach their
goals body boss bringing the gym to you
hi my name is Paula I'm a certified
chiropractor posture doctor online
educator with a fellowship in the
physics of posture now you might think
you've got your neck covered by regular
exercises you do in a gym but that's
simply not true most of the exercises we
do in the gym fail to address the core
stabilizing neck muscles the ones that
matter most
that's where fit neck comes in fits neck
is a patent-pending unique and
innovative device designed to strengthen
your neck stabilizer muscles and correct
your posture the exercise can be done
sitting or standing which means it's
suitable for all kinds of users it's
also the most effective way to enhance
your posture strengthen your core neck
muscles and prevent neck injuries with
our modern lifestyle we are constantly
looking at phones and computers this is
creating extreme pressure on your neck
if its neck is based on academic
research and was developed in
collaboration with professional sports
teams and chiropractors in the United
States and Canada I don't like spending
a lot of time in the gym I like spending
time on my bike but there's some
strengths that are just critical and
your neck is one of them
that's why I like fit neck it's easy
it's simple it's quick and it does what
it's supposed to do having a strong neck
and proper posture doesn't require much
doing the chin tuck exercise has been
clinically proven to improve your neck
posture fit neck makes it easy all you
need is a two-minute exercise done four
times a week
done standing or sitting wherever
whenever it comes with adhesive mounts
and can be set up anywhere just set your
resistance and within two minutes you're
done when you strengthen your neck
muscles with fit neck your body
automatically pulls your head back in to
correct posture did you know that
anxiety fatigue and even allergies may
all be connected to our posture
explain our head is heavy roughly ten
pounds and if we carry it out in front
of us instead of over top of our
shoulders where it belongs the weight
increases dramatically the nerves are
put under great stress in tension in
this condition and because the central
nervous system runs your entire body we
begin to imagine that a stretch spinal
cord is a significant health risk over
time when we begin to use effective neck
exercise designed to realign our head
back over our shoulders where it belongs
we look more attractive feel way more
confident in the age better because our
health improves dramatically so please
support us with our project and help us
straighten up the world we live in
thanks for watching
you
these are everywhere you know that
feeling
we spent on average eight times more
time in our beds than in our cars but
for some reason our cars have climate
control and can now park and drive
themselves while our beds have stayed
the same for hundreds of years that
smart divan we believe it's time for our
beds to catch up to the 21st century
introducing the smart new bed breeze the
world's first dual zone climate control
cell making Benin wealth possibly the
single biggest innovation in our
bedrooms in the last 100 years in
addition to making the bed for you the
breeze lets you select your preferred
temperature for each side of the bed
independently using the smartphone app
avoiding all future arguments about room
temperature we were able to achieve both
climate control and self making bed
features through our patent-pending
inflatable sheep placed seamlessly
between your duvet and duvet cover
no more sweaty nights spent regulating
your body temperature by leaving a leg
out of the duvet it's time we give sleep
the attention it deserves we all know
that a good night's sleep will be much
happier healthier and more productive

introducing the first app controlled
south making man this year we wanted to
make smart duvet even better by doing
more than making the bed 40 we wanted to
improve your nights as well that's how
the smart duvet breeze was born you and
your partner can benefit from a better
night's sleep by individually adjusting
the temperature with your smartphone you

few minutes before sleep to enjoy the
perfect temperature when you get in bed

your energy consumption by heating and
cooling your body directly instead of
the entire house

room temperature or who will have to
make the bed keeping your sheets dry and
oxygenated will also eliminate potential
dust mites and germs from the bed truly
