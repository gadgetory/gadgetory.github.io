you to the kitchen state a fun and easy
way to control temptation the kitchen
safe is atomic container that puts you
in control let me show you how it works
first place an item in the container
next location does set the timer and
finally press the dial to activate the
alarm once the container is locked
cannot be open until the timer reaches
zero it's daddy
I came up with the idea of the kitchen
safe will consume I graduate studies I
was looking for something fun and easy
to use and help me with my food cravings
lose a little weight and live a
healthier lifestyle all still being able
to enjoy the occasional connect the
designer products that live up to the
highest standards I work with Ryan Feng
an engineer and classmate I met while
studying at MIT the kid is safe is a
time lock containment that puts you in
charge
you put an item in the container and set
the timer once the timer is set and the
button is pressed the container locks it
cannot be opened until the timer reaches
zero it is a simple concept that
produces powerful results the goal when
designing the kitchen safe is create a
high quality product that works well
looks good
to use the product has a large clear
display a smooth dial dirty lock and a
clean look to compare to the highest
quality containers available in storage
the design process took over a year we
investigated many options and with each
prototype we refine the design until we
ended with a great working product the
container base is made from four
millimeter thick acrylic for durability
and a clean look the LCD display was
custom developed to incorporate large
high contrast characters for easy
viewing the dial is specifically
selected for its smooth action time
could be set for short as one minute or
as long as 10 days the electronic
locking mechanism was designed to ensure
a strong appeal we have tested the
kitchen safe and we're confident that it
is a great product there you have it the
kitchen space we worked harder to
develop a great product and a plentiful
Factory for production and this is where
we need your help by ordering a kitchen
space and spreading the words to your
friends you can help us turn is just an
idea into a product of thousands of
people to use and enjoy from all of us
at the kitchen safe we plan to you
this is what's supposed to keep your
home safe from fire if you're nearby
you'll hear it but what if you aren't
nearby what happens then smoke detectors
aren't the source
don't know when you're there when you're
not and they certainly won't alert you
if you're not home
all they do is beep but now there's a
simple and easy way to make your smoke
alarm smarter Leo smart alert nightlight
Leo's a simple device plug it in and let
it go to work
Leo monitors your smoke and carbon
monoxide detectors if they go off real
years and alert you immediately see in
the same wherever you are and connect to
the fire department and if for some
reason you don't respond then we'll
contact your friends and neighbors as
well
