outside is for everyone to enjoy how
great would it be if navigation were
effortless together with Leto we've
created the hi-tech navigator
bringing together state-of-the-art
technologies it connects with the route
you entered in your special liitle app
on your smartphone wouldn't it be nice
to have a helping hand to help you
navigate through our wonderful world
one short vibration tells you which turn
to take navigation was never so easy
you'll find your way without having to
think about it and you won't miss any of
the beauty along the way
and if you feel too short vibrations
first on their right and then on the
left foot
you've taken a wrong turn and the app
automatically reboots your journey just
turn around and your shoes will tell you
where to go and if you feel an
increasing vibration in both shoes at
the same time you've reached your
destination navigation was never so easy
the high-tech navigator shows you the
way comfortable anywhere
imagine a world where you're going about
your day and instead of your phone dying
it stays on you can continue working
communicating playing games doing
whatever you want that's the world we
want to live in and that's why we
started soul power soul power is a power
generating shoe insole that charges
small portable electronics like cell
phones radios and GPS on the go it works
by taking the energy in a step and
converting it to usable electrical power
which is stored in a rechargeable
battery the battery can be plugged in to
any portable electronic device for
on-the-go charging this technology
really changes everything because for
the first time everyone can be
constantly on the go they can be
constantly mobile it's really just a
more convenient way to live with power
or authority soul power started as a
senior design project at Carnegie Mellon
we then gained business resources from
project Olympus I then entered into
alpha lab a local incubator here in
Pittsburgh where we were really pushed
to get out and talk to customers to
develop a product that they really
wanted our technology is very reliable
it generates power during both the swing
and the impact phases of your game it's
not dependent on the weather like Solar
Solutions and it's not dependent on
being stationary like crank flashlights
it's also really powerful our goal is to
fully charge an iPhone in two and a half
miles of walking which is the average
amount of walking a person does in a day
and so far we're on track to doing that
and we have a really dedicated team
along with our intern Adam we prototype
and build everything at TechShop in
Pittsburgh han and I've always wanted to
help people and solar power such a
simple solution and is here now that we
really wanted to take the opportunity to
do that there were six billion mobile
devices in the world today the majority
of which are in developing nations cell
phones and other portable electronics
are really a lifeline for people in
developing nations power needs to be a
readily available resource and sole
power can make this possible the core
what soul power really wants to do is
you
technology innovatively to solve
problems that people face on a regular
basis one of the ways we're going to do
this for developing nations is to have a
buy one send one program so somebody in
the US who buys two insoles might
actually get to send an insole to
someone in need in a foreign nation as
much as we want to help we have to be
profitable the funds raised there
Kickstarter will enable us to faster
enter our target market of the outdoor
enthusiasts once we enter this market we
can then build an aid program for the
developing nations for an outdoor
enthusiast after a long day's hike you
have enough power to charge your cell
phone and GPS and have a little bit of
power for lights later on that night
there's also applications in disaster
relief scenarios we're having access to
communication and technology can be
life-saving and finally so power will
address the military military personnel
need to carry over 20 pounds of
batteries for a single day mission soul
power helps alleviate this weight and
would create a less fatigue and more
effective soldier what you see here is
our first prototype the mechanisms
inside the insole are completed and our
electronics our breadboard in but some
of our custom components are expensive
we need your help to produce more of
these prototypes so we can do more
testing with real people and bring a
product that has the opportunity to
really improve the lives of people in
need plus you don't have to worry about
your phone dying anymore which is pretty
cool

I'm Valerie thanks for checking out the
Lubitz
we all of our shoots but don't the laces
present some challenges there's the time
the squeezing the floppy bows becoming
undone
the double nodding
and the untying to get them off
well with your support we think Subic
can help zooids
are small yet powerful magnetic fits
that you attach to your own shoelaces
making your shoes very easy to put on so
how do you really want to put your shoes
on
wouldn't it be great if there were no
laces at all I mean nothing to get in
the way
well this is what zubats are like when
separated Lubitz eliminate three rows of
laces so there is a huge mouth opening
to easily slide in
then just connect the magnets
and that's it
now go for a run
go to the playground
go to the gym
play some basketball sue that's hold
securely for most recreational
activities but sue bits are not just for
athletic sneakers they're for your
everyday casual shoes
with soup it's you have a clean looking
shoe no ugly bows and they'll never come
undone how do you really want to take
your shoes off let's face it most of us
do what we are not supposed to do we
step on our heel and squeeze out of our
shoes this wears down the heel and
leaves you with a knot to untie later
but with xub it's stepping out of your
shoes becomes the right way to do it the
magnets will split as you step out and
now your shoe is open and ready for the
next time you want to slip in Zubat sar
not ordinary magnets they've been
specially engineered to concentrate the
magnetic forces toward the face of the
magnets this gives them incredible
holding forces in a small size this also
means there's almost no magnetism on the
outside of the zoo bits where you don't
want
the zoo bits you can wear shoes tight
outdoors then wear them loose at home or
around the office
Lubitz are easy to install just thread
your laces through the Zubat insert your
foot and adjust the tightness to your
comfort level then knot or clip the
shoelace ends inside your shoe we will
provide some clips to help you secure
your laces
when you're ready cut your laces off
leave a little extra and you can adjust
the fit anytime
so the idea for Zubat was actually born
out of a desire to help our own kids get
their shoes on easier but along the way
we discovered everybody likes it kids
adults even the elderly we've developed
fully working prototypes we've taken it
this far but we really need your support
to make zubats happen we need the funds
to pay for manufacturing and production
pause so please back our project by
choosing a pledge amount
basically you're just buying some tunes
that would help us a lot
let's make Zubat app thanks
this is Rachel Kaiser with hiking boots
calm I'm here at summer o our 2014 with
David and hi-tech what do you have for
us today this is the altitude light what
are some of the key technologies of this
boot this boot is awesome it's got a
multi-directional traction outsole so
great for stability on the trail in evey
a midsole so extra comfort this is the
light boot so it has a lightweight nylon
fork shank which is great for torsional
rigidity lots of stability on the trail
has a suede and mesh upper very durable
with a protective rubber R and around
the toe has a shield which is a DWR
coating so it keeps the boot drier
cleaner for longer also a dry tech
waterproof liner so that means that your
foot is going to stay dry a ghillie
lacing system with rust proof Hardware
long lasting gusseted tongue so keeps
out the rocks you know that kind of
stuff on the inside it's a contoured
sock liner extremely comfortable you
know keep you going and what sort of
packs do you think would perform the
best when you're wearing this shoe I
mean this boot is great for a long hike
so you could do heavier packs as well
but I mean it's a lightweight boot so I
mean you could go up to 70 pounds I
would think and what sort of terrain do
you think the altitude light works best
on it's definitely a trail I mean trail
boot so anything where you're going to
be going over rocks it's a mid boot so a
lot of stability and support on your
ankle well thank you so much David and
this has been Rachel with hiking boots
