your dog provides unconditional love and
you provide everything your dog needs to
be happy but just like you they love a
good challenge and you know there's a
lot going on behind those eyes sit stay
and fetch these might keep your dog
entertained while you're home but what
about when you're away you know your
best friend deserves more and it's not
just dog lovers who think so we're
discovering almost everyday that dogs
can do much more than just play catch

body and mind get daily exercise clever
pet gives you a tool to activate your
dog's mind throughout the day with smart
puzzles you probably never knew they
could understand let alone solve that
way whether you're home or not your dog
always said something to do starting
with easy rewards and over weeks and
months providing trickier challenges

a training schedule review stats keep
tabs on their nutrition and to check out
new games that update automatically via
Wi-Fi
your dog makes you happy and with clever
pet you can help them do so much more
hyperadapt is a new concept that we've
been working on for about what ten years
yeah and I think it is really all about
the the notion that our shoes should be
smarter and should be able to adapt to
our activities and to the shape of our
feet as they change so when you open the
box you're gonna have two shoes you're
also gonna have your charger two pucks
one for each shoe they magnetically
stick to the bottom of the shoes to
check the battery level you press any
button and the last flash that the LED
has that indicates what your battery
level is if it's full it'll be blue if
it's half-full it'll be yellow and if
it's almost empty it'll be red usually a
charge on each shoe will last about over
two weeks it depends on your use how
many times you're tightening and
loosening and adjusting throughout the
day this shoe is this program to turn on
automatically when you put your heel
onto the foot bed so when you slide your
foot in and you press your heel back yep
there's no need to actually turn it on
it it's just always on it's smart enough
to be ready when you step into it
like tinker is saying automatically runs
the two buttons are marked with just two
little blue squares and the top button
this one tightens so you just press the
button and the laces will tighten to
loosen you just press the back button or
loosen button and they loosen say you
want it to go too much tighter so you
just adjust it to where you want it to
go I press and hold both buttons for two
seconds
and you hear the motor run that just
reset your preset so that every time you
get in the shootout it'll go to that
much tighter setting there is a
loosening button it's the lower button
of the two and you just press it for
basically about two seconds and it
loosens the shoe up automatically until
you can pull your foot out in case
you're having any trouble with it
whatsoever
you press and hold both buttons for 10
seconds and you'll see a rainbow of
colors go over the lights and that'll
let you know that you've reset the
system your preset won't change but the
system will just reset if that doesn't
work you can throw it on the charger for
about 30 seconds and it'll also do a
system reset in the end it's a
multi-purpose speaker you should just go
have fun and do anything you'd like to
do as Letta CLE or or casually we call
it 1.0 because it's just the first step
in better fit and comfort in an adaptive
way that then it improves athletes
