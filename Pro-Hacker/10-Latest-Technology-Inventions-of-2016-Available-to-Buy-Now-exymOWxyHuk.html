you had that a sweet girl our story
started years ago when I adopted a dog
from a local no-kill shelter I wanted to
make sure he was getting proper exercise
lots of socialization and sniffing a
variety of things so I built an activity
tracker and slapped it on him on a walks
around the city but looking at a sad
face every time I left for work I
realized he didn't need more tracking he
needed more time with his best friend I
can't be with him all the time but
playdate is the next best thing lady
isn't just another dog toy it's a great
new way for pet owners to stay connected
with their
best friends we're excited to bring a
playdate to the world but we need your
help if you believe as we do that
there's got to be a better way to stay
in touch with your pets when you're not
around then back this project and share
it with their favorite animal lovers as
well thanks thanks everyone
playing music is one of the most
rewarding experiences you can have
you've always wanted to do more than
just listen you wanted to give three
chords in the truth in your head a
chance to flow out through your fingers
you wanted to speak your mind without
using words you wanted to be part of the
invasion or the revolution or the crew
you wanted to create the same feelings
you experienced and you wanted to give
it away what got in the way of what you
wanted maybe you tried to do it yourself
and it didn't translate maybe your
instructor had style but it wasn't your
style maybe you didn't know what guitar
to get or if what you had was even a
guitar maybe that really cool guitar
shop didn't feel as cool once you were
inside
maybe scheduling lessons and practice
time didn't fit your lifestyle maybe
learning to play guitar doesn't have to
be like this the jam stick plus is the
easiest way to learn how to play the
guitar
period it comes with apps for your
iPhone or iPad to help you learn how to
play download Jam tutor on the App Store
and learn without having to guess where
to put your fingers jam stick plus never
needs tuning it uses your iPad iPhone or
Mac to generate sound and it already
works with more apps than we can keep
track of you can learn and practice on
your terms with the joystick plus we've
seen users start playing chords in
minutes with the jam stick and it's
portability can turn just about any
environment into a practice or lesson
studio the original Jam stick was
well-received to 2014 but we knew there
were improvements we wanted to get into
more users hands
we started by adding a magnetic pickup
to give the jams tick plus a more
traditional feel to your pick
and thanks to advancement in the
Bluetooth 4.0 technology we equipped the
Japs ik+ with wireless bluetooth
connectivity that works seamlessly with
Apple's new Bluetooth MIDI software the
chapstick plus is the same real guitar
strings and real frets just like the
original two fess match the experience
of putting your fingers mount a guitar
and yes the chapstick plus and a string
Bend and vibrato the jam stick plus
works with your iphone or ipad to get
great musical performance out of apps
like GarageBand iMovie and hundreds of
others the chapstick plus is also a
great MIDI controller for your Mac in
Yosemite you can play any sound
available in logic Ableton Live Pro
Tools and other di WS we believe that
crowdfunding hosts the biggest group of
movers and shakers on the planet it's
also for the jam stick originally found
in audience you to represent the future
of emerging technology and art and
that's the intersection we live in and
that's why we're here on Kickstarter we
want you to experience the jab stick
plus first hand and we're asking you to
help support this campaign slip together
we can bring more people closer to the
dream of playing music you know we've
seen magic in the eyes of people when
they play the first floor or they stir a
piano or they produce their first song
with the six trees of the jam stick and
we can't wait to see what the gem stick
Plus inspires in your hands thanks for

technology
elf Emmett is an active non-invasive
wearable technology that helps us face
the challenges of our stressful
lifestyle even when you're chronically
stressed elf Emmett will help you return
to a balanced state
with so many things going on it's hard
to keep a clear and focused mind so you
can effectively learn l Emmett will help
you focus and concentrate when you need
to
most people have struggled with
sleepless nights all the stress of the
day just keeps you from resting elf M it
will calm you down in the rock you into
a deep sleep
elf Emmett works in synergy with the
natural rhythm of your mind and body
waves when you're active and focused
your brain frequency is high when you're
resting it slows down
however because of our busy lifestyle
our brainwaves aren't always in tune
with what we need elf
Emmett uses pulsed electromagnetic
technology to non-invasively synchronize
your mind with the frequency of what you
want to do learn and concentrate while
feeling stressed improve the quality of
your sleep stay awake when feeling tired
relax after a hard day we designed the
technology around a beautiful light
headband that is powered by your
smartphone or tablet
and operated with a simple application
people have always used extremely low
frequencies to achieve altered states of
consciousness just think of meditating
to the rhythmic sound of drums Gong
therapy or the steady flashing light of
a fire things that take us into a state
of thoughtfulness even when the sound of
crane is
rhythms in music
ticking clock they all have an effect on
us we always adapt to an external
frequency our entire biological system
the brain and the earth itself work at
the same frequencies
mr. Nikola Tesla once said that if we
can influence those frequencies
electronically we can directly stimulate
the entire body and mental system of
humankind elf Emmet uses the same power
source as your headphones to generate a
weak electromagnetic pulse between two
coils to demonstrate we can connect the
coils to a speaker and actually hear the
frequency that the application transmits
it's music you can't hear the cerebellum
is the part of our brains that links the
brain and the heart depending on our
situation it suggests our performance
rhythm this is the spot that says slow
down there's no danger relax or it says
hurry up we have work to do
concentrate elf Emmet works directly on
the cerebellum and can influence the
whole system it tells both the
brainwaves and heartbeat to speed up or
slow down
