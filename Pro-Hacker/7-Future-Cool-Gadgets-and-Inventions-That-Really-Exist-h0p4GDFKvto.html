level of accuracy
there is amenities anything like it give
us a minute Mitch our audience tensor
including miniature laser we tend to
collimated beam to the surface the

internal reflections to visit emotion
similar in fact we invented the world's
smallest three-dimensional laser
interferometer that is truly amazing let
me take it from here
free is all about minimizing whatever
stands in the way of your creative
energy it's got a mini touch displays
and notifications that you reply

we're Dima and we've made the best shove
11 other shovels cracked bend and break
demos beats them all literally last year
we launched our kicker tool the spell
shovel on Kickstarter people loved it
but they all agreed on one thing they
wanted something bigger
battered and made for everyone so we
listened and gathered our team to make
the bestest toughest damn this shovel
ever and we did
introducing the alpha shovel mother
nature need dad
you wanted big oh it big over 20 inches
long and 12 inches the glorious
aircraft-grade aluminum
means you can shovel away the ice age or
your driveway
it's got serrated teeth to cut ice and
shovel gliders to protect your deck knee
so when we say it's cutting edge of we
mean it the alpha shovel is durable and
tough rain or shine
dirt or snow we built it to weather
through a lifetime of storms into storms
or any whether our collapsible shaft
makes it easy to pack and the built-in
strap holder makes it easy to carry and
we added a saw for good luck easy to cut
anything that might get in the way
choose between a D handle for better
grip or a T handle for better
compatibility best of all everything in
the Alpha shovel is interchangeable with
the rest of the demos family allowing
you to build a collection of
multi-purpose tool for life every job
every day for everyone
alpha shovel conditions be damned the
most of the collective of lifelong
innovators and adventures if we like to
go out and wreak face with nature and
come back and make the best products
ever we're born and raised in Jackson
Hole but our family goes far beyond town
and staplers this is a collaborative
effort not just between the team for wit
pro athletes action enthusiasts and most
importantly our community backyard
campaign today enjoying the demos
collective we thank you for all of your
support truly the most defined not by us
but by you our backgrounds
let's keep crushing it
our world has an ever-increasing thirst
for energy our machines vehicles and
factories all demanded yet most of the
energy we use is wasted over 30 trillion
watt hours of heat per year are wasted
by power plants alone enough to power
the entire world and our environment is
part of the collateral damage over 15
billion batteries are thrown away in
landfills every year at matrix we wanted
to create technology that makes the way
we use energy for more efficient and
more intimate we wanted to start with a
problem everyone has experienced
firsthand feeling frustrated when your
electronic device runs out of power when
you need it the most
there hasn't been any innovation to
solve this problem and that got us
excited solder using our thermoelectric
technology after five years and several
prototypes we're introducing our first
product the matrix power launched the
SmartWatch that's powered by you it
works by converting your own body heat
to electric power and the best part is
you never have to charge it the walk
comes alive because of power excite you
the human body at rest and it's 100 watt
edges similar to that of an incandescent
lightbulb when exercising that number
jumps to one kilowatt similar to the
average power we use in a
what's so cool about this watch is that
as you exercise and your skin gets
warmer the power walk generates more
power it's got a unique power meters
that shows how much electricity your
body has generated right on the face of
the wall we can do some exciting things
with this technology like accurately
measure the amount of calories you burn
our thermoelectric technology measures
the amount of speed you've generated
from the calories you consume it's also
packed with all the features you expect
in a SmartWatch it has sensors subtract
both activity and sleep quality we're
designing changeable watch spaces to
suit your mood which also built micro
applications so you can do more than
just tell the time and of course it
syncs with your phone and your account
in the cloud or into running
mountaineering trailblazing it works
even better when you're out and about
especially in cold weather since you
never have to charge it or replace the
batteries it's very well sealed and
water resistance 250 meters and if you
ever take it off they'll go to sleep and
throw all your data when you put it back
on
it comes back to life you've done most
of the artwork you have a few thousand
prototypes and a ton of data so we know
it's work the power wash has been vetted
and certified by arrow electronics we
brought on Andrea pond'rous a
world-class
SmartWatch designer our engineering and
manufacturing was headed up by Larry
size from Hong Kong who has helped
numerous wearable companies like fittest
ship millions of users
and to ensure it all comes together
we've brought on valve things as our
manufacturing directors he has over 20
years of manufacturing experience
bringing products to market now we're
ready to go to market and we're so close
to the finish line your funds will go
towards the final production tooling and
manufacture of the powerwall
join our campaign today so that we can
get this vlogs from keep your hands we'd
be thrilled to have you on this journey
so that we can harness the world's
wastage
