just simpler
remember those happier times when times
seemed to just pass a little slower
there really was something special about
getting await for days for a Dear John
letter but of course everything wasn't
so simple back then there was a time
when the products in your home made you
work for them instead of working for you
but luckily big blind companies saw an
opportunity for innovation and gave us
window coverings so smart so advanced so
state-of-the-art they could be
controlled on demand from the palm of
your hand and would you believe us if we
told you the development of window
coverings stopped there until now meet
my smart blinds the simplest smartest
solar-powered window coverings since
antennas and dial-up Alexa open my smart
blinds okay opening my smart blinds
[Laughter]
hold on let's see that again that right
there is my smart blinds patented smart
lock technology the only built-in blind
hardware that allows you to install your
blinds in seconds smart lock combines
friction adhesion and compression to
stay as tight as a pair of your high
school jeans in your window frame so
easy even your grandma could do it my
smart blinds will pay for themselves in
energy savings giving you extra cash to
spend on all your guilty pleasures fast
food online shopping and all that stuff
your friends are trying to sell you on
Facebook sound too good to be true well
it's not you see hidden up there inside
the motor are sensors that tell the
blinds when the room has had enough Sun
the blinds will automatically shut
protecting your floors and furniture and
keeping your home nice and cool saving
you money pretty smart with set it and
forget it scheduling you don't need a
clock or a smart phone or even a brain
for that matter my smart blinds do the
thinking for you set your schedule once
and forget about it
pretty smart
no more having to wonder whether you
really did remember to close your blinds
before jumping in the shower with my
smart blinds you can even secure your
home while you're away maintaining
privacy wherever you are the my smart
blinds hub brings Bluetooth control to
the cloud so you can be anywhere in the
world and have access to your home
pretty smart with Sun tracking my smart
blinds will maintain the light levels
you prefer year-round so if you like
waking up to sunlight and enjoying
privacy at sunset my smart blinds will
automatically change your tilting times
as the seasons change Plus with the help
of the my smart blinds solar panel your
blinds will stay charged year round
pretty smart and if you already have
blinds you can turn those retro non
intelligent low IQ blinds into smart
blinds no tools or diploma necessary
with our automation kit a big thanks to
our loyal Kickstarter backers that
helped us bring the kit to market in
2016 and don't miss us the spring when
we're back with my smart blinds for
roller shades honey where those photos
from our trip to Bora Bora
this is Jack Jack Anne's wife loved to
take vacations but vacations mean photos
and photos mean files lots of them put
that all together and you have a recipe
for disaster
in the Attic heat it up here
so do your files so like most people
Jack relies on free accounts from places
like Dropbox and Google Drive just to
stay afloat but what if there was a way
to offer truly endless file storage with
speeds never before seen with no monthly
subscription meet file gear file gear
lets you take your files from your hard
drives computers cloud drives and mobile
devices and puts them all together
finally giving you access to everything
you own in one convenient place once
you've connected a device file gear
automatically analyzes and organizes
each and every file into categories
allowing you to browse through your
photos videos music or documents by date
location content and more honey I found
it with file gear sharing things like
photos is a breeze you can share by
links email or by using the apps you
already know and love like Facebook
Instagram and Google+ file gear can be
used by other family members too so you
don't have to pay for multiple storage
accounts for each user now let's talk
about safety we already know that file
gear is way faster than the cloud but
it's also way more secure as well and
that's because your files live right
here at home hi I'm Doug founder of file
gear I needed a way to organize all of
my files without spending a ton of time
to get it done so I teamed up with some
of the world's greatest coders and
engineers and after two years of
development I'm very proud to introduce
you to file gear but we need your help
to prepare expensive tooling and place
volume orders for production so be one
of the first to own this groundbreaking
device and finally get a hold of your
digital life so great price incredible
speeds total security and no monthly
fees I'm sold where do I sign up
file here don't go in the attic today
most of us spend too much time indoors
and glued to one screen or another the
result is a growing population with poor
or degrading eyesight more children are
suffering from nearsightedness than ever

their ability to learn now there's an
easy fun way for you to take control of
your family's vision health with IQ
insight you can test visual acuity or
how close to 20/20 year vision is

family's eyes and monitor vision changes
in real-time from the comfort and
convenience of your home to get started

just follows the on-screen prompts hey
look in the goggles can you see me hello
out there and in a couple of minutes
you'll know who's seeing clearly or
whose vision may need to be corrected
with eyeglasses you can also test how
well your current classes are performing
and kids love to see more the animated
host and his rewards and now your new
sticker let's take a look
insight test results are automatically
captured and stored in the secure IQ
cloud so you can access your account
from anywhere this makes it easy to
track changes in your family's vision
and share that information with your eye
doctor IQ insight the most accurate
20/20 visual acuity test on your
smartphone a great way to make vision
care a priority for you and your family
you
hi this is Joel from vendor music we've
designed this that you can play with
friends to for
hey guys thanks for watching our video
we truly love the process of developing
an affordable electronic saxophone but
we can't make this reality without your
help we are launching a Kickstarter
campaign later this year
so please follow us on Facebook and
Twitter so you can stay up to date with
the latest vind or news bob is on a
mission to get serious about being
secure online but every solution out
there is either convenient or secure not
both only key is the solution for this
problem that provides the perfect
balance of both serious about security
and getting things done only key stores
accounts securely offline this means
that unlike software only key can
protect your information even if a hack
occurs if you lose only key no problem
its pin protected and useless without
the pin only one pin to remember for all
of your accounts plus only key supports
two-factor authentication
touch a button to login to online
accounts your computer or practically
anything if you can type the password
only key can type it for you it works
practically everywhere Windows Mac
Chromebook Linux Android and even iPhone
it's waterproof durable and about the
size of a house key that easily attaches
to a keychain
Bob's password drama is over now if he
could get serious about secure
communication all of his emails and chat
messages are unencrypted this means they
could be intercepted by a hacker or even
a government intelligence agency but
every solution out there is either
convenient or secure not both instead of
complicated solutions secure
communication is as simple as
highlighting the text to encrypt and
confirming on only key Bob just needs to
know Alice's Facebook Twitter or email
to look up Alice's key base account and
send a secure chat or email to Alice Bob
and Alice can keep using the email and
chat they like Facebook Messenger
slack Gmail and others Bob highlights
text to encrypt and confirms on only key
Alice confirms on only key to decrypt
it works practically everywhere with the
key safely offline on the only key now
Bob is making real progress but what
about the future is he ready for
whatever comes next
only he is ready with an adaptable
future ready framework crypto currencies
like Bitcoin and aetherium can be
secured with only key with quantum
computers current encryption may soon
become obsolete if we meet our stretch
goals only key will build cryptocurrency
support and be the first commercially
available post quantum crypto device
while other devices unable to adapt will
be left in the dust only key will be
ready to secure the future feel like a
smart fallback in here the environment
here light uniquely utilizes digital
sound language there is no need for
Bluetooth Wi-Fi for zippy
just scan a QR code or download the heel
light-pearl app peel light has 16
million RGB colors if can give you

created in my phonology micro novelty is
a complex craft ideas prototypes and
soda then to make them excellent and
successfully deliver in the past three
years
I start with several contingent and the
delivers of the first all of my backers
he light is a product from my friend
great
I reached their company and the factory
and take a long time to test the samples
so I can guarantee it's possible and it
can be delivered on time in case you
don't receive the product on time
our company is falling so why I see with
him
build on screen together with work and
enjoy delight think about your everyday
life if you like me you probably spend
most of your time indoors the lack of
sunlight dim rooms and poor quality
lighting all have harmful effects on our
well-being and it's frustrating this is
why we created loose the first light

the delight you receive is healthy or
unhealthy and this is why you need lose
my team and I have been working
intensely with leading software
developers hardware engineers scientists
doctors and designers to develop an
accurate affordable and user-friendly
product for you this kind of technology
has previously been used in scientific
research a highly specialized medical
products but never in everyday personal
use we're now bringing loose a light
measuring rabble to you and we think
you're gonna love it
earlier this year we tested a loose
prototype with over 100 test
participants across the world the
results were remarkable blues reminded
users to make simple improvements in the
daily routine from eating lunch by the
window to turning off bright lights at
night the data collected showed that the
average time to fall asleep went down
from 27 to 16 minutes just like the
users energy levels tripled and this was
just after 3:00
of using news with the use of feedback
in mind we made some final improvements
and adjustments we're now ready to bring
news to life and we need your help
Lucius a technically advanced project
which means that the tooling and
manufacturing costs are significant the
money we're raising goes directly into
moving from prototype to production our
world-class manufacturers are ready all
we need is your support to start so join
us today support our Kickstarter
campaign and together let's bring modern
living back in sync with nature

through evaporation condensation
and mineralization meter brings you
healthy water directly in your kitchen
healthy waters through things clean
purified water and enhanced with
minerals
mitr gets rid of everything bad and puts
a lot of good in it
MIT has been designed and tested going
through a thousand hours of 3d printing
for working prototypes just to arrive at
the final model and to make sure that
you get the healthiest water meters
proprietary purification technology
first rules all the contaminants like
bacterias and viruses even hormones and
nitrates water from it
is 60 times cleaner than from a picture
filter and three times cleaner than a
reverse osmosis system after
purification the waters and hands
through a mineral cartridge you can
personalize the water you want to drink
soft with low minerals crisp high
mineral water and alkaline with high pH
the result is always a perfectly
balanced mineralized water of your
choice maybe you're like Anna and she
wants what's best for children Mittal
helps her difficult the healthiest and
safest water she also cares about the
environment and meter allows her to get
rid of all plastic bottles
well like Katherine who cares deeply
about her health and well-being she's
obsessed with team and with meter she's
sure it will always be the perfect
temperature
or maybe in film or like Philip who's
passionate about his performance the
minerals and nutrients and the water
flow meter will help him with his diet
and this training he's also a technology
enthusiast with an app that tracks and
monitors the water quality and
automatically since new cartridges
whenever you need them this is what
mentor offers the right healthy water
for you
designed and engineered here in Berlin
Germany MIT is ready to give you access
to healthy water the way it's meant to
be I'm or it's the CEO of MIT and part
of this fantastic team from 13 different
countries we came together for one
simple goal to improve lives with
healthy water supporters and kick
started today and be the first to get
this beautiful machine at home together

how many times have you been outside the
waist we could pool along well let me
for you now you can time rob in this
event we serve together in the Rings and

variety of activities such as running
hiking biking working out and anything
else with a battery lasting four to
eight hours flow as easily rechargeable
with a microUSB it has three speeds and
is hands-free so you can multitask
and and I received numerous awards in
the Marines and now it seemed up with
the group of advisers and engineers that
specialized in manufacturing
