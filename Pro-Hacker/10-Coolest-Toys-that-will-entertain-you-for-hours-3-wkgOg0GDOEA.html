robotics
we've unlocked the power of advanced
mobile processors that enable us to run
cutting-edge AI algorithms on it with
this technology we created hover camera
which allows anyone to capture photos
and video from unique perspectives to
use however camera is very simple
powered on puts it open like this and
you can hold anywhere we let go it just
hovers automatically we have a camera
you can take 13 megapixel photos and 4k
video we replaced a traditional gimbal
with electronic image stabilization so
that your shots are always steady other
camera is the first truly autonomous
flying camera that anyone can use and is
powered by our groundbreaking embedded
AI technology we built a ton of
sophisticated AI algorithms into this
small circuit board it runs a powerful
vocalist snapdragon 2.3 gigahertz
quad-core processor this enables us to
run complex calculations locally without
the need for remote server the AI was
developed in such a way that it reduces
the learning curve so anyone can operate
it out of the box
that's why we've designed a
revolutionary user experience that
centers around hovering hovering is
actually more difficult than just flying
the reason it hovers so steadily is
because it's running optical flow on its
download viewing camera and visual slam
from the frog viewing camera that's how
it gauges its own speed and position at
all times
on top of that we're running advanced
apply control algorithms at one
kilohertz it's so intelligent that it
follows people automatically as they
move around it does this without GPS but
instead using real-time facials and body
recognition this is the most compact and
elegantly designed flying camera on the
market it is so small that it could
easily fit into a purse but you wanted
to make sure that this device is safe
we've cleaned it up with the suit of
armor
this entire protective enclosure is made
out of the most durable and lightweight
carbon fiber material the radical design
allows users to grab throw and catch
hover camera yet it lets just enough air
to flow through without sacrificing the
ability to hover or fly Tony and I they
both graduated from the Stanford
engineering ph.d program we have about
80 plus people now and a very diverse
background we're fortunate enough to be
surrounded by a team of passionate and
experienced adventurers who share our
vision we're setting new standards for
aerial robotics other cameras is always
around capturing those unique moments in
reaching your vision of the world in
some situations paper will always be
best for unleashing our creativity and
sometimes we just need technology
choosing between paper and computer is a
matter of context today we can have the
best of both world
the top is the first ever connected
pocket scanner it is mobile tiny
lightweight Wireless with a long lasting
battery the prop is very simple to use
thanks to a teammate button it is smart
it automatically takes care of every
step from sheet of paper to its
destination on the Internet
the pump allows you to stay comfortable
where you are without moving around you
don't need to worry about paper
dimensions anymore
your documents are automatically and
safely routed where you need them the
pop is so simple to use choose your
scenario put the laser to the pages and
press the button that's it your document
has just been transferred according to
your choice
so much works Madame Maldonado they
deserve to be saved and shared instantly
with your loved one the pup is always
ready to go it's incredibly fast and EBT
you the comet moving closer to the ones
you love the particle scan everything it
even works with books
it is smart and automatically fixes any
reflection or page curve issues the pump
comes with its own light and does not
rely on the ambient light you always get
a sharp image the pumper is your Nomad
companion it follows you everywhere it
takes care of everything then you focus
on what really matters to you the pups
will bring you new creative scenarios
every day certainly stay up to date with
your favorite networks Facebook
Pinterest Instagram they all be reached
in one click it even helps you import
your documents into Word and Excel we
are proud to include contest we've been
working for 18 months we've received
team of engineers and designers we work
hard we ask you to deliver to the site
you will for your unique experience and
made it and available to everyone thank
you for backing us on the Google
to make but jaffa really
every year millions of people will pick
up a skateboard for the first time all
of them want to start landing off and
trick if you land one your hook the
early tricks are very hard for most of
them just like any sport if the kids
don't see progress this way that's why I
created skatertrainers most tips tell
you to start on the crack or some grass
but it's not enough you don't land back
in the crack and the grass doesn't quite
feel the same there are a lot of great
how-to videos out there but many skaters
give up too soon on their skateboarding
dreams skater trainer is a simple tool
that you slip on the wheels of your
skateboard to keep it from rolling it's
an intermediate step to slow things down
so you can learn the moves and commit
the landing tricks like a nollie or a
kickflip
my name is Roger I'm an engineer an
adventurer and the creator of schedule
trainer I spent 25 years not skating and
then decided that I wanted to get back
into it easier said than done
it was tough I felt like a beginner all
over again only this time with a lot
more fear of falling and busting my 40
year old ass having spent the last
twenty years as an aerospace engineer my
mind instantly went into figuring out a
solution to this problem
I built the prototypes out of things I
had around the house and learned a few
tricks I knew I was on to something so I
made the $200 youtube video created a
manufacturable design and started
testing I was blown away by the response
I got
skaters across the world were sending in
their praise and skatertrainers I got
enough on Monday and I learned to kick
one hobby into Monday I think you got
your total on there
narrator they're totally worth it their
testimonials validated the concept but
they also highlighted some key issues
they were hard to get on with flip off
when use eventually wore out and we're
pretty ugly I took that feedback and
created version 2.0 scheduled treatment
its wager to install fits on almost any
skateboard wheel won't flip off is
lighter and more durable than the first
version the design is ready the
production prototypes worked great and
the manufacturer here in Oklahoma is
standing by the producer I've taken it
as far as I can on my own now I need
your help to finalize the tooling and
get the volume up on the first order our
shipping system is in place and we can
roll right into 2.0 we're ready to go we
just need your support
skatertrainers are the perfect gift to
help your favorite skater get some
tricks they really want have some fun
and stay excited about skateboarding
I see the sport
yeah I really like inliner you know
waiting hair my favorite songs
the freedom
well except for those heavy shoes I've
got a hole in my backpack hmm and what
about hiking sure I love like it being
out in nature is where I can unwind and
get new ideas this is really a drag
lugging around those heavy boots all day
and why don't we use Skinner what is the
dinner it is the most ultra portable
foot there in the world awesome I mean
they're like super cool citizen light
it's very durable they fit in here
pocket
don't flip and have a cooling effect and
that's evolved seriously yep you can
throw them in the washer
dinner's were designed to be worn
anywhere anytime like at our wedding
okay
Wow almost any time if you're tired of
carrying an extra pair of shoes with you
all the time
try Skinner they're lightweight portable
comfort simply put its footwear soon
chipper Connie I chose it so I can have
Skinner's with me all the time like when
we take a trip to Japan again
hey quickly that's right you can say
them pretty much anywhere hi Kickstarter
I'm Peter and here at Skinner's we spend
a lot 18 months developing a better
alternative you're heavy context is
where many of us were willing travel or
exercise well we on an easy way both for
you and your team our patent-pending
technology that goodbye to grooving
theme that can fall apart over time
scanners are manufactured in Europe
using the finest Swedish materials with
a dual coding of extra durable anti
abrasive polymer and we've tested them
all over the world in all kinds of
conditions to make sure they can keep up
with you wherever you go and even have
guys running marathons in them long
story short very excited with how
scanners turn out and the way they feel
and perfect your feet and people are
surprised to see how something so simple
can be so durable the next step is to
give more people to chance to experience
skinners for themselves
and to do that we need your help since
winners are designed to be small to
functional if you are
basically a very compact PC to play
games on it's a really nice concept it
is very different it's a good idea and
explain
I don't like us there's huge amount of
games and you can play games like from
back from nineteen nineties up to the
newest triple-a game laptop mister it's
still pretty heavy you need to suffer
back and this you can just quit fooling
around I come from cold in the hand is
not happy if you thinking you can plug
in the housing people do it with a USB
hub that's pretty nice
yeah like a really much it looks very
promising
it seems rather powerful it's really a
promising solution for mobile gaming
with the real PC experience using steam
you can just take the same things with
you and play along
hi I'm Nick I'm the founder of those
awesome guys and a developer on board I
is basically a portable steam box which
is an amazing yes that's me
it looks like a really interesting
product and so that will be have a look
into it again the Snipes are game
developer strategies because you get why
you build that I made for PC this thing
is awesome you have all the power in the
PC in your hand pretty cool
it's like a no-brainer taking all your
Steam games with yours
pretty awesome and it's pretty
unbelievable to be able to hold a
Windows machine in your hands that
actually works so I'm super excited to
see this as a finished project I really
love to device I head in my hands and
just felt really great you know the
controls hot set and it was really
exceeding my expectations so yeah I'm
really really looking forward to getting
it
Oh
this is the world's first land where you

LEDs so you can choose between warm and
cool wine warm light to relax cool light
the tasks such as reading because it
helps you concentrate when you leave the
room it turns itself on to save your
money and the environs
when you enter the room the lamp uses
presence detection and smart algorithm
to predict which life scene is best
suited creating a new light scene is
easy just pick a color and start
painting your life once you are
satisfied save the setting as a new
lighting
with the colors in direct light you can
create the perfect mood for any
situation where you want to cut your
color but the lamp gives you much more

lighting from you troubles
this is Welsh
not much different from yourself
you
this is how it's different from your
belt buckle up smart well you know
sometimes being a kid isn't as easy as
you might think
I mean you have the ideas we have the
motivation and we have all the potential
in the world but sometimes we just don't
have the tools we need that's why we've
decided time to make our own tools week
rainy ha the only three printer designs
us keep in mind we made it easy to use
or 100% safe for kids it's controlled
directly by its cloud system either
online or do this expertly design app so
there's no need for manually adjusting
anything can create unique and original
design pixel-by-pixel enough or you can
choose we're always growing library of
more than 2000 ready to print toys all
you need to do is pick your color press
print and Neha just arrived it's fully
enclosed by a safety door so there's
absolutely no Daniel when the machine is
printed if the door opens or the machine
is tilted or anything else goes wrong
the machine will automatically stop
printing and we practice novel new are
is sleek compact and see-through all
around just allows us to see our gears
come to us from any angle all four
elements are eco-friendly and non-toxic
and they come in 12 different colors we
wanted to make sure that yee-haw allowed
kids to explore their creativity in
whole new ways which we innovative in
our problem-solving we could dream up
new and exciting world we can help each
other learn grow and achieve our
potential and don't worry they may get
facebook owner to camp
support us on IndieGoGo and share our
campaign with family and friends mija
