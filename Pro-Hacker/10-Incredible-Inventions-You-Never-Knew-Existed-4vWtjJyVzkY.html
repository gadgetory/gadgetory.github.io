people care about the immediate
environment around them information the
current weather apps cannot provide what
if everyone could have a personalized
weather station that's why we decided to
create one so we set a goal develop the
idea assembled a great team conducted
breakthrough research talk to a lot of
experts and made several prototypes we
collaborated with the best engineers and
have begun manufacturing to provide a
one-of-a-kind device this is Q temp a

matter to you hi I'm John and I invented
my phone the grab and go booster seat
this is a regular car booster seat and
this is my fold my fold is the most
advanced compact and portable booster
seat in the world it's more than ten
times smaller than a regular booster and
it's just as safe how's that possible
well a regular booster seat lifts a
child to be in the position of an adult
my fold does the exact opposite instead
of lifting the child up it holds the
seat belt down it's that simple my fold
is engineered to protect children from
the age of four all the way up to 12 the
patented design takes the seatbelt off
the stomach and the neck making it
comfortable safe and easy to use car
loads of kids and parents already tried
and they love it when it comes to car
seats for children safety is the number
one priority it's crucial for us to meet
the highest regulatory standards and
we've crash tested prototypes
successfully in testing facilities all
around the world now people often ask me
John where did the idea come from so let
me tell you some stories about when my
four kids were little guys come on when
you were little thank you
carpooling was a big part of our lives
we always had boosters for our own kids
but not for the extras that came along
my fold is so small that kids can keep
one with them
all the time when my parents visited we
always have to juggle bulky booster
seats from car to car my fold is so
compact you can store one almost
anywhere and my fold is narrow so you
can easily put three in a row even in
the smallest cars do you live in a big
city how often do you jump in a taxi
they never have a booster seat and
that's not safe and hey by the way that
is not a taxi thank you last time you
rented a car you probably paid an
additional $40 to rent the booster
that's more than my fault costs and ours
isn't covered in another kid's dinner or
worse my fault easy to keep clean you
can even put it in the dishwasher so I
thought if I could make a booster that's
mighty small and mighty strong when you
could take with you everywhere then
children could always be safe no matter
whose car they're in using super tough
plastic polymers an aircraft grade
aluminium top designers engineers and
industry experts together we've created
my fold the most advanced compact and
portable safety seats ever invented and
we can't wait to start getting my fold
into the hands and the bags of children
all over the world pre-order your my
fold now at my fold calm soon we'll all
be ready to grab and go thank you
you
let us introduce charges the world's
most advanced universal travel adapter
that also charges your mobile devices
without any additional chargers it works
in the USA UK Europe Australia and over
150 other countries the idea was born
out of the everyday struggle of people
on the go every time I go on holiday I
want to focus on what to wear but I also
have to carry around a lot of devices
that I don't want to think about but I
can't live without or when I am on an
important business trip abroad and I
want less luggage but I need my smart
gadgets all these devices require many
chargers that take up half of my space
and don't forget the countless number of
adapters around the world yeah I always
get those confused and there are never
enough outlets in hotel rooms to charge
all my devices at once that never
happens anymore because we have charges
charges conforms to plug standards in
the USA UK Europe Australia and 150
countries around the world
you can plug the device in any outlet
worldwide with all the bugs conveniently
stored inside charges saves you space
and the trouble of forgetting or losing
your Chargers the height of the pins is
adjustable to fit any mobile case or
protector now you can charge your smart
phones and tablets at the same time
using the two integrated pins without
carrying any additional Chargers charges
supports micro USB lightning and USB C
standards covering the full range of
mobile devices and smart gadgets great
now we can charge my iPhone and your
Samsung at the same time it also works
with other devices sharing the same
charging standards
char jest also has three additional USB
ports to make it the most convenient
Universal travel adapter and you still
have the outlet ready to use in addition
we created the charges Bank it's a power
bank that charges my phone up to three
times and has a USB port for any other
device it's been a great journey so far
we beta tested our ideas and pack them
into an awesome compact design we built
the PCB and model the design then we 3d
printed and tested some more this led to
the final working prototype that we sent
out to ten people to test for two weeks
we got their feedback and now we are
ready to go into mass production I love
to travel the world but I always find
difficulties in the outlet standards of
each new country now I visit yeah I
found charges and solved that problem
for ever I mean it is so compact and
handy I taken everywhere with me
my wife and I used to argue over who is
that we use the phone charger every
night yeah the chargers solve that
problem with its dual charging station
and we don't argue anymore forget the
old chargers go charge us back us now on
IndieGoGo
this is a hand now it can do more
whoa
and of course
and also
not now
sleep wake up okay time to go
hi Kickstarter my name is Alfredo this
is my hand and this is Aria with Aria
finger movements directs your SmartWatch
today's devices are awesome the way we
control them is not especially for
wearables buttons very vintage
touchscreen tiny that user experience
voice control
from this high-tech devices on the
market I would expect a super engaging
experience then I discover that with a
bunch of sensors I could see this
everyone's dreamed about controlling
things with their minds and that's how
we started the next step was to
transform this into a product and that's
why we applied with Hawks and came to
Shenzhen China the manufacturing capital
of the world here we build and build and
build until area area is a tiny gesture
controller designs very specifically for
smartwatches
you wear it you calibrate it and then
you use it with your favorite SmartWatch
you scroll through the menu and launch
the application you want you can play
some music or check email or ciao mama
we work closely with a series of
smartwatches
in order to guarantee the best user
experience possible aria is a Bluetooth
compatible device so it can be connected
to most of the electronics you always
use we're starting with a set of
essential apps to cover the main needs
and we're developing more we're also
releasing an SDK for all the developers
who want to create apps for Aria we
develop this technology and now we need
your support to start the production
please back us and help us to bring aya

hi I'm Nikki and I'd like to introduce
you to hideaway the bottle you'll always
reach for because it's always within
reach so as a freelance product designer
I'm traveling a lot visiting clients
visiting factories going to trade shows
I was looking for a water bottle that
would not take up a lot of space in my
carry-on and I started looking around
for a product that would work that would
still be functional and it wasn't out
there as I'm going through airports I'm
seeing so many travelers probably with
the same problem and I figured this is a
problem I could solve myself you know
once I had a solution for business
travel I realized this had great
application my personal life especially
in the outdoors going backpacking or
just on hikes I could bring water with
me and when the bottle was empty it it
collapses and goes away and takes no
extra space in my pack yeah it fits an
active lifestyle weather in the winter
when you're skiing and you can fill up
the hideaway in the lodge or in the
summer when you're backpacking or hiking
it collapses in your backpack and takes
no extra space no one loves buying
disposable water bottles it's it's
merely out of convenience and the
Hideaway makes a reusable bottle more
convenient in fact in some places
disposable water bottles are are being
banned so we're all gonna move towards
the reusable water bottle model and
that's why I feel like this is kind of
the next generation and hydration this
gives you an option to have a water
bottle all the time without having to
throw anything away The Hideaway is an
innovative collapsible water bottle made
from flexible sturdy food grade silicone
when compressed it fits just about
anywhere in your life and when it's
expanded it resists tips and spills
while still fitting in most cupholders
the hideaway bottle comes in two sizes
21 ounce and 12 ounce which is great for
kids and both are watertight
