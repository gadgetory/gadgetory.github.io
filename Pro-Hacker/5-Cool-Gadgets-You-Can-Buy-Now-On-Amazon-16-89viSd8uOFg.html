lives better and nowhere is that more
important than when it comes to our
health just imagine what we could do if
we knew where illness was spreading in
our local community before it affected
our friends event individuals could take
action to avoid getting ill parents
would know at their child's first sign
or symptom how to respond physicians
would better care for patients and
society would finally have the tool it
needs to track and stop the spread of
illness at kinsa we're applying design
and technology to give you that
information
I started Kent's after five years
running part of the Clinton Foundation's
international health program I will
always be proud of the work there but I
was struck by how little we knew about
where and when disease was spreading
there's a parent of young children I
know that the most important thing to me
is their health unfortunately they do
get sick a lot usually from something
they pick up in a neighborhood or at
school and as technologists I find it
remarkable that there's almost no
information available to me as to what
is going around together we assembled a
dream team and thought carefully about
how to gather this information because
fever is often the first sign of an
illness it allows us to know right when
someone is first feeling sick before
they've even visited the doctor the
solution will sound simple and it is but
we think it's the basis of a revolution
in health it starts with a device that's
probably already in your home we've just
made it simpler and smarter by
connecting it to your phone this is the
world's smartest thermometer it tells
you how to avoid getting ill or get
better faster if you are we've designed
the kinsa smart thermometer to be faster
and more accurate
Harold Nathan isn't feeling well so I'm
going to take his temperature by using
the power of your smartphone we've
minimized the electronics inside there
are no batteries processor or LCD this
allows it to be thin flexible and
comfortable to use especially for
children reading complete Nathan's
temperatures okay but he's been
complaining of a sore throat with a few
simple taps I can track his symptoms
over time and share them with our
pediatrician and since he probably got
sick from one of his friends I'm
checking the health of his school to see
what he might have here I can see the
private groups that I joined with other
parents from Nathan's class five out of
24 kids are sick and strep throat is
going around so he doesn't have a fever
I'm a bit nervous so I look for the
nearest urgent care facility with an
opening to make sure that you have
everything you need to keep your family
healthy we're adding features like
OneTouch call nurse and an illness
forecast so you know when you're
contagious and when you're likely to get
better even if you haven't joined a
private group you can still check your
local health situation here it is on a
map we combine our data with data from
others to give you what we like to call
the health weather you can see the
contagiousness level and what illnesses
or symptoms are circulating in real time
we've built the software and of working
prototypes of the thermometer and now we
need your help
funds you provide will be used to
manufacture the product and scale up
production making it even more
affordable but Ken says about more than
just a thermometer it's about an idea an
idea that our health is linked directly
to the health of those around us your
support will start a movement to share
the information we need to keep our
families and our neighborhoods healthy
you will send a signal to the world that
you want to be part of that movement
join us and together let's revolutionize
health
introducing suits the world's first
truly smart car charger designed in
Germany Zeus has both brains and beauty
the elegance and license system provides
enhanced visibility and dark
environments and most importantly Zeus
is the only smart charger that can help
you find your car when you are at a loss

red arrow to find your car
Zeus also sports a powerful smart
chipset to deliver the swiftest charge

another reason why Zeus is different two
times the speed two times smarter never
