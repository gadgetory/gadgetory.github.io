I was born in the pastoral countryside
of heaven on earth it was a peaceful and
beautiful land as a child I was orphaned
early on and at the end of the day I lay
down to sleep in our porch under a
canopy of stars sparkling and twinkling
until the break of the morning today I'm
able to bring to the world the beauty of
my everlasting evening sky through star
sailor it's only through my never-ending
dedication that I'm now able to bring
everyone the chance to sleep with the
stars of the night to the moment that we
drift off to rest our mind and our body

strongest and lightest outdoor solar
panel sunny bed life is all around you
sleep it's one of the most important
things to our lives a lot of wearables
track sleep but tracking sleep doesn't
necessarily mean improved sleep but what
if we could change that what if we could
create a wearable which not only tracked
your sleep but improved your sleep at
the same time at them we're doing just
that and we want to work with you the
Kickstarter community to bring this
project to life we sleep for one third
of our lives but it affects us around
the clock the benefit of falling asleep
faster is that you can get more out of
every day I think the most exciting
thing is that we can change people's
lives them helps you to fall asleep
quicker and this will ultimately to more
sleep across the night the development
of film is really based on a lot of
excellent university research that has
shown a better way of improving sleep
but for the first time now them allows
this to be translated into the home
environment start by placing them on any
of your fingers before you go to bed
Bhim will then accurately determine when
you fall asleep to the nearest minute
the algorithm then implements a
retraining program to allow people to
fall asleep more quickly that has been
used by researchers for the last 10
years this is a simple behavioral
approach to improve your sleep but for
the first time then allows this to be
carried out in your own home this is a
way to teach people to sleep better and
from our own research we know that it
works them is about more than helping
you to get to sleep quicker tim can also
help you take the perfect power nap
research from nasa found that their
astronauts performed 34% better having
taken power naps the secret to a perfect
power nap is sleeping for exactly 10
minutes five minutes won't do much for
you and sleeping for 20 minutes will
leave you feeling groggy once you wake
up the incredible accuracy of thim of
knowing when you fall asleep to the
minute allows you to take the perfect
power nap for the first time them also
collects your sleep data and provide you
a sleep score so that over time you can
see how your sleep is improving Europe
damnit we've been heads down building
for some time we're a team of
researchers designers and engineers we
collectively have built products that
people around the world use and love and
most recent invention was the retime ER
which received worldwide acclaim at them
we've reinvented the wearable for sleep
our research is based on a peer review
evidence base this is more than a step
forward this is a quantum leap for how
we use sleep technologies we wanted our
design to represent the ability to
disconnect and dream we wanted to
engineer something that you forgot
you're wearing we've done just that
fitting the components into such a small
and light package has been a challenge
we've gone through hundreds of
iterations we've given our 3d printer a
serious workout with every iteration
we've learned something new and it's
definitely improved our design the
journey so far has been thoroughly
rewarding I'm really looking forward to
seeing what's to come we would love to
work with the Kickstarter community as
we go through final design
considerations for this wearable this is
your chance to be part of something
where we change the face of wearable
technologies forever we'd love you to be
part of it and you can do that by
clicking the grand button
