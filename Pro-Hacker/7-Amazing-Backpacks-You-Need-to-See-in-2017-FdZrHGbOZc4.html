there
the tools we use has evolved but how we
carry them hasn't kept up until now
introducing slim fold slim packs a
minimal modular and modern commuter
backpack those for today's tools and
lifestyle a highly technical custom-made
soft shell material truly sets the slim
pack apart from existing bag it's
manufactured by a mill which produces
material such brands as North base and
gore-tex combined with high-end
weatherproof dippers the packs will
protect its contents from splashes and
rain without an additional cover while
traditional backpacks are like to PVC
dragged around the slim pack is a sports
card that hugs your body hi I'm Dave
from flint fold introduce the world's
thinnest laws with my first Kickstarter
now I've applied my design approach to
reimagine the backpack backpacks are way
too big for what people carry these days
they're still made for these we all you
really need to work is one of these my
surveyed previous backers about what I
should make next a minimal backpack was
the number one request I've been working
for the past two years to bring this
perfect pack to life just like I
designed a minimal wallet around modern
everyday carry
I designed the slim pack around today's
work tool the main pocket suspends a
15-inch MacBook Pro and the front pocket
gives the footprint of an iPad the
patent-pending geometry of the slim pack
gives you complete visibility and access
to what's inside
this pack is smaller and lighter than
traditional backpack but makes no
compromises with a shoulder shop they
have an ergonomic shape are padded
vented and feature a pivot strap that
adapts with you as you move want to
leave your laptop behind take out the
padded divider inspired by professional
camera bags the interior can be
configured exactly according to what you
carry I've completed two Kickstarter
campaign and delivered the rewards for
each of them on time now I'm asking for
your support to help bring this one back
to life so being an early backer I'll
pass along the savings to you and you'll

introducing
you
our lives have become more mobile we
carry our work tools everywhere and
that's why more than ever we need a bag
but from our own experience most bags
out there are not made for the modern
lifestyle so to end our own frustration
we decided to design a backpack from
scratch
after endless testings we are now ready
to show you our creation the bird back
path and with over ten noteworthy
features we believe that this is one of
the best everyday backpacks ever let me
tell you about it
it's made of a new and innovative
material that makes it scratch proof cut
proof and water repellent
we wanted the bird backpack to be steps
group so we designed a unique hidden
zipper place up against your back you
can turn your bag against anyone with
ease of mind to have less pressure on
your back we prioritize weight balance
with a laptop compartment placed firmly
against your back the weight is
distributed more evenly and it feels
dramatically lighter a remarkable
difference from traditional backpacks
the back panels are made of breathable
material to bring extra comfort from the
outside there are two easy to access
pockets one big on the back for the
passport or wallet and a pocket on the
side that is big enough to hold an
iPhone 6 plus is easy to reach with only
one hand
let's look at the inside there are
protective sleeves for a laptop and
tablet three big pockets for a charger
or camera gift or anything
there is a place for your pen a zipper
pocket in the top for the stuff you
don't want to fall out you can also plug
in your smartphone from your power bank
in the bag while you go and an elastic
strap for your gym clothes or jacket
you can very easily reach your laptop
and tablet from the protective sleeve
with traditional backpacks you have to
dig from the top to find what you need
in the bottom we made it possible to
open all the way so you always feel
organized we were tired of the black
linen that you see in most bags so we
made it red so it looks and feels like
the inside of a nice suit now we need
your help making the bird backpack a
reality we already have deals with
manufacturing companies with years of
experience in making top-class products
and they are standing by to take care of
production and logistics this makes sure
that you get your backpack on time and
in the best quality on the market
