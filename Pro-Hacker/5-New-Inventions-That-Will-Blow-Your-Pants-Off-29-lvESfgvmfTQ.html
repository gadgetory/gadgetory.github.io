ever wonder what you noticed most people
driving a luxury car around town what
people notice the most is the head-up
display inside of these high-end cars
you know those futuristic little screens
that show your speed navigation and your
field of vision not only are they super
cool but they actually make your ride
safer and more comfortable the problem
is you have to shell out thousands if
not tens of thousands of dollars for a
car installed but what if there is a way
to get that high-end experience but note
the high-end price tag introducing utter
 it's a simple automotive accessory
you put on your dashboard that uses a
smartphone you already own to turn it
into affordable heads-up display utter
fireworks with literally any car just
place it on your dashboard download our
sister out NAB me place it on the cradle
and start driving having a special
coating means you can use it in any
light any time of day you can keep your
eyes on the road at all times
thanks to nab me how'd if I protect a
beautiful UI with full voice guided
turn-by-turn navigation and up to the
second route recalculations a speeding
tickets so do we have your current speed
and speed limit of the road you're
currently driving on projecting in front
of your eyes making it way easier to
avoid those pests
and your Hut if I automatically alerts
you when the red light cameras coming up
unlike maps on your phone you can even
download a whole country about ahead of
time and navigate a hundred percent
offline using satellite no internet
signal required so you can always count
on it no matter where you go and if you
want to use another navigation app you
can modify supports any HUD design map
we think everyone should have the
opportunity to have a safer driving
experience that's why we are making it
available to the Kickstarter community
by getting everyone to pledge and bulk
upfront we can get a volume discount and
invest in better production which means
a better product for everyone this
ultimate means that we can offer it for
less than $50 to our kickstart backers
and you can have a safe and futuristic
navigation experience so what are you
waiting for let's head up I your car
hi my name is dice and this is guy we
already found as of innovation in motion
the started behind slide I came up with
the idea for slide when I was looking
for a solution to automate my curtains I
like the idea of waking up the sunlight
and being able to leave my house without
exposing it to burglars existing
solutions I found were very complex
I'd have to install on the system with
special mounting mechanisms
besides that these systems were very
expensive guy and I are both excited
about smart home solutions together
we've developed a slide the world's
first retrofit smart curtain system
slide is not just about automating the
opening or closing of your curtains it's
about adding a whole new set of
functionalities you didn't have before
many of these functionalities will be
available right from the slide up on
your phone but to unleash its full
potential were integrating slide into
the if they spend a platform through AI
F triple T the possibilities are endless
including using a smart button like
flick and voice support for Google home
and Amazon echo installation of slide is
easy it only takes a few minutes and no
technical expertise is required once you
attach it either to the rod the rails or
curtains themselves you won't even
notice it's there anymore because it's
retrofit slide is designed to work on
virtually all existing horizontal
coordinate systems over the past two
years we have worked tirelessly to
create slide after more than twenty
iterations of prototyping slide is now
ready for production but we need your
support to bring slide to the market
back us on Kickstarter today
to be the first to receive slide when it
releases at a sharply discounted rate
slide a simple stylish secure and
sustainable we're excited to see it
change your window on the world on
behalf of Dyson myself thank you for
supporting us
what if you could connect to any device
with a single cable are you ready for
ten times more speed and a two times
more powerful cable introducing neck
needeth crafted with the highest quality
materials including rare earth neodymium
magnets 18 karat gold plated connectors
shielded with aerospace aluminum
combining the latest advanced circuitry
technology for smarter and safer
charging on both ends the world's first
groundbreaking patent-pending reversible
cross device USB 3.0 magnetic cable
featuring 10 times faster data transfer
speed and a 2 times more powerful cable
compared to a traditional USB 2.0 cable
by harnessing the force of nature
you can effortlessly insert the magnetic
tip to both ends of the device and the
magneto cable immediately magnetizes and
snaps to the devices the breakthrough
concept of the both end magnetic
connector cable successfully opens the
door to multi device connectivity for
SuperSpeed charging and data sake
meaning you can cross connects almost
any device between USB Lightning Android
type C mini USB and beyond
Magneto was born out of the creators
frustration with our daily lives caused
by all the different types of devices we
first created a prototype by putting
some existing product components
together and we spent months with
countless hours to complete the design
we knew this was going to be a great
product that we got to share with the
world to reinvent a new standard of USB
cables we have accomplished the most
sophisticated test
combined with the highest quality
materials to design a state-of-the-art
USB cable our team has chosen the
largest manufacturer that's made over a
hundred million electronic devices for
many of the top brands to build this
awesome design and we're ready to go we
need your support for our campaign to
help us bring this super charging cable
to the market be part of us as
contributors you are welcome to write us
with a new suggestion or new ideas for
further improvement of magneto within
the period of the campaign magneto is
the world's most powerful magnetic USB
cable for everything
