home are your towels as we reuse them
they retain moisture allowing bacteria
to breathe why not use paper towels
according to the Rainforest Action
Network that's not exactly the best
alternative how about these but wait
that wouldn't work in my home unless
stop using bacteria-infested raves and
help save the environment introducing
home dry have you ever wondered why you
have never seen a hand dryer in
someone's home maybe you thought about
this or maybe it never crossed your mind
a group of people from different
backgrounds such as business design
sales in chemistry got together to build
perfect home and drive we've all seen
them before in public restrooms but
they're bulky they're loud and very
expensive it took dozens of concepts and
prototypes hundreds of experimental
simulations thousands of hours of
craftsmanship and an infinite amount of
patience to bring you home drive a
cordless beautifully designed compact
and affordable bathroom and kitchen home
and dryer home dry is not only
environmentally friendly it has a
built-in patented blue UV light to kill
bacteria that even soap can't get to
hands-free with a rechargeable battery
and wall mountable home dry will change
your everyday life at home home dries
industrial motor pumps out heated HEPA
filtered air at two times the speed than
a traditional hand dryer

the average 480 days the removable base
doubles as an extra battery and charging
port an LED battery indicator shows you
when battery needs to be charged when
mounted on the wall simply plug in and
used while charging or remove the
battery and charge separately we are so
confident about what we have created and
are excited to bring home drive market
please help us reach our goal so we can
afford to produce home drug at an
affordable price for everyone
we are surrounded by technology it's
entering our homes and helping us
automate daily tasks but I find myself
thinking there has to be a more natural
and accessible way to control the
devices around us if the goal of
automation is to simplify our lives why
does it feel so complicated our goal as
a company is to solve this
say hello to knocky knocky is a small
elegant device that instantly transforms
ordinary surfaces in your environment
into remote controls using naki couldn't
be easier simply take it out of the box
pick a place to put it select a surface
to attach it to and then define all the
things you'd like Nike to do
Nike can control a wide variety of
devices around us but the true beauty of
our technology is that what it can do is
only limited by your imagination
put one in your living room or the
kitchen or even your bedroom
I mean imagine rolling over in the
morning and tapping a simple pattern
anywhere on your nightstand to snooze
your alarm and start the coffeemaker
without even opening your eyes you just
bought ten more minutes in bed and
you'll definitely want to put one in
your kids bedroom it's exciting to think
of how naki will spark their imagination
as they figure out all kinds of ways to
use it using Wi-Fi which is proven to be
far more reliable and would better reach
them Bluetooth you can enjoy using naki
from anywhere the number of devices and
software that naki interact with is
rapidly growing every day
it currently includes nest Phillips you
lifx smartthings IFTTT and more but even
if you're new to the smart technology
world you can still use naki for simple
functions around your home
other technologies that rely on sound or
voice control can be unreliable and
confusing to use they can be triggered
accidentally and don't always work as
expected our patent-pending technology
uses non acoustic sensors it's able to
distinguish deliberate tap or knock
patterns from random vibrations in the
environment the beauty of our product is
that it makes any regular environment
into a user interface think about the
surfaces around you so many of them
serve one or two purposes add an AA key
to them and you instantly have a hub for
automation we carefully chose every
material and finish Funaki we've gone
through series of different tests and
prototypes to make sure that naki blends
in in your environment and also looks
beautiful on your surfaces we're doing
our first production runs here in the
USA because it's important for our
entire team to be there on the ground
floor ensuring that we're manufacturing
the best possible product
it's not some far-fetched idea we have
finalized our designs we have beautiful
working prototype and we need to raise
funds to actually get it in a production
and immediately start shipping them to
your door we couldn't be more excited
about how this product is going to
change lives and bring joy to people
everywhere
naki accomplishes what technology is
supposed to do instead of taking over
our life it enhances it allowing you to
put more thought and effort into the
things that really matter
happen to the world around you with the
magic of naki
you
your vehicle is your important asset so
you might consider buying a dashcam to
protect it but before you buy have you
considered the cameras ability to record
at night with the footage be clear
enough to be used as evidence what about
the back of your vehicle what if your
vehicle is parked and unattended we ask
these questions so we built the town
black box the world's first smart
modular true 4k nighttime vehicle
security system with the latest Oh V
image sensor F 1.4 diaphragm 2160p true
4k resolution and a 166 degree wide
angle of view the town captures two
starry night with clarity as you venture
into the night the town comes in a set
including a front camera for the
windshield and a back camera for the
rear providing the 332 degree field of
vision when your car is unattended the
town automatically detects approaching
persons and vehicles through its radar
he then turns on the camera by its
cutting-edge obd power cable and starts
filming the incident so the battery will
only be used when there is motion nearby
by attaching your new town to its gps
module you can enjoy a smart and safe
driving experience with lea town's
advanced driver assistance systems that
give forward collision and Lane
Departure warnings in KC one at the
extra safety on the road using the
town's GPS with google map helps track
your driving route the town's modular
design allows for multiple functions in
different occasions and makes
installation flexible and easy
let us protect you and your vehicle and
make your night adventures safe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
