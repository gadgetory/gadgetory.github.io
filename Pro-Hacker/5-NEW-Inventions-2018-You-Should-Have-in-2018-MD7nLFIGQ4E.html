Huey plug is going to change your

okay so all of us own a few phone
accessories right and some of them can
actually do some really impressive
things but right now if I asked you to
get one you'd probably say I don't have
it with me so most of the time you end
up leaning your phone against some
random object instead of actually using
that expensive tripod that you left at
home so because there weren't any real
solutions we made our own and back in
2013 we launched our first Kickstarter
campaign for the pocket tripod a fully
adjustable stand for your iPhone that
holds her device in both portrait and
landscape without covering the school
best part is that it transforms into the
size of a couple of credit cards and
hides away in any wallet or purse until
you need it again people loved it we
raised more than our funding goal by
almost double and even Apple co-founder
Steve Wozniak the Oise said why didn't
someone do this before what a great idea
that I wish I thought I put one of them
in my backpack which is always with but
then a few of our very clever backers
realized something that we missed who
told us I've got a case on my phone I'm
not gonna take it off every time that's
just too much work and someone else said
so what you guys some kind of Apple
fanboys you know some people Rock Angela
right that got us thinking I can't make
a pocket tripod for every phone in case
bottle out there there's at least a
million different combinations who knows
so as soon as we shift all rewards to
our two and a half thousand backers we
started working on a universal pocket
tripod instead of limiting it to only
bear iPhones for months
we studied case designs got feedback
from our backers and tested ideas once
we had a universal opening shape we made
it in a range of sizes so that it fits
as many case and phone combinations as
possible
this is the new universal pocket tripod
does it work with the Apple silicone
case perfectly how about the Galaxy Note
yup works fantastic in landscape and
halfway in portrait does it work with
every case almost unless it's gigantic
we've also created this guide that lets
you know exactly what pocket tripod you
need just by knowing what case and
device combination you have okay but
what if I like it bare but also
sometimes with protection do any two
pocket tripods nope because whenever you
swap your case or your phone you can
also get the adapters to match their new
size good to go the pocket tripods been
used and tested for the past two years
by thousands of people who applied they
use it as their primary tripod every day
to take amazing time lapses for making
video calls and even to create light
paintings we've made the pocket tripod
with the highest standards of
engineering materials and manufacturing
they say the best camera is the one
that's with you and the same is true
when it comes to tripods the pocket
tripod is now a proven product and with
your help we want to make it one of the
most practical smartphone accessories
for as many people as we can we hope you
join us thank you
cycling is great for your health your
budget and your planet maybe you bike as
much as possible or maybe you've been
meaning to get into it but the reality
on the street often makes your ride
challenging
we wanted to give riders total
confidence on the road by making them
visible from every direction that's why
we designed monkey lights
we've been making monkey lights since
2007 our lights are known for being
incredibly bright durable and fun
in 2013 we kick-started the first video
bike wheel the monkey light Pro since
then we've talked to thousands of monkey
light users around the world they keep
telling us just how confident they feel
when they ride monkey lights were
originally designed to be fun and
visible now we're ready to take the next
step with sleek new designs that are
ridiculously easy to use with our third
generation of monkey lights you just
ride your bike and they work their magic
all the lights feature our new fully
automatic technology they reliably turn
on when you need them and they securely
lock into your spokes this way you won't
lose your lights and you'll never forget
to turn them on these third-generation
lights also feature our new hub mounted
rechargeable battery the battery lasts
for months of normal usage and it pops
out easily to charge from any USB port
our lights are great for every kind of
bike in any type of Rider and now we're
able to make them more affordable than
ever
so why monkey lights well take a look at
this this is how a bike looks with
traditional front and rear lights now
look at it with monkey lights all of our
monkey lights are clearly visible from
every direction by illuminating the
wheels the moving light greatly
increases visibility even on a crowded
street the speed and direction of the
rider can be seen as well
monkey lights light up the road and make
every ride more safe and more fun our
8:10 combo is a set of two fully
automatic lights it features a classic
look with a bright white light for the
front wheel and a red light for the rear
wheel the a-15

years of improving our products
upgrading our equipment and rigorous
testing we mold our lights right here in
California with a process that we
developed ourselves thanks for all your
help so far your support is critical
it helps us pay for the tooling and
materials that we need to bring these
products to market help us fulfill our
vision of making cycling as safe and fun
as possible
still using the old fashioned way to
measure sizes and distances measuring by
yourself is always difficult you get all
sweaty it's hard to know how to do it
right either way it can be a waste of
time and effort feeling frustrated and
bothered now you have a better measuring
choice the eye pins spatial ruler run
the eye pins spatial ruler app plug the
eye pin spatial ruler into the iPhone
headphone jack then you can easily
measure spatial dimensions of course you
can save the measuring results and also
instantly share them
it makes the discussions between you and
your designers or even your mates easier
never again worry about picking the
wrong size of furniture snap the
furniture you like and get its size for
the IP and spatial ruler app

you can edit the same places in
different times and spaces which saves
you time make furnishing easy and with
no more mistakes create lovely and
