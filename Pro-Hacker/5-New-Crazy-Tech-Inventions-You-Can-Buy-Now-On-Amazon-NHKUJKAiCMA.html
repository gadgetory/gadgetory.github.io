so good a selection of the overboard
waterproof dry tube bags here and I'm
going by dad so dad what is the dry tube
and what's it used for raining
well a dry tube is probably the most
practical bag on the market it is a
completely waterproof bag that is
available in many different sizes and
it's ideal for keeping all your
valuables dry if you're on the beach or
if you're on the boat or if your kite
surfing anywhere
where water is an issue is the perfect
bag for you okay okay well that's an
interesting question these are rated at
class three on the internationally
recognized waterproof rating system
class three means that they will survive
any kind of spray heavy downpour foul
weather application they will go into
the water
they're leaving floats and they'll
survive quick submersion which means if
you capsize the kayak for instance hey I
even swim sure from my boat with my
towel and my t-shirt to the beach with
them and they just float along behind me
right and what are they made of to make
them say water they're made of a
heavy-duty PVC tarpaulin and the
interesting thing is the construction
which is a quite a rare construction
it's the high-frequency welded
construction which means there's no
stitching there's no holes
it's totally waterproof they feel little
fold seal system I'll spin this around
just to show exactly how that works when
the bag is open you have a clear big
opening just on one side you have the
stiffener bar you simply
the edges together and roll down we
recommend three to four times and as you
can see the air pressure is building
once that's happened you simply take the
clips and marry them at the top and
there you are so there's an ugly color
here so which colors and sizes well we
do several different sizes because
there's several different applications
that people require we start off at the
bitty little five liter
we go up twelve litre 20 litre 30 liter
and 40 litre we do a range of colors the
colors are yellow blue red and black we
even do them with a window or without a
window depending on your requirements in
the bag there's a pink one and there's a
pink one we've just launched by popular
demand at twenty liter pink right so
these are the bags
what do they come with good question all
our bags come with a heavy duty
adjustable shoulder strap with
heavy-duty buckles the five liter and
the twelve liter have natural handles
where the seal is created but for the 20
liters upwards we've included a
heavy-duty handle just in case you're
carrying a lot of heavy goods like dive
weights and things like that and that is
the overboard waterproof strike you bag
