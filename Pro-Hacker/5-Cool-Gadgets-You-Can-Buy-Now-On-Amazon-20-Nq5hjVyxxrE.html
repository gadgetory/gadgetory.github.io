let inside your home the dog walker the
plumber your two out-of-town friends

the two people you never let inside that
door one is a professional cat burglar

and that one still has one let's face it
you don't have time to open the door for
everyone you can't actually which is
precisely why you have August August is
the lock that requires no key only an
invitation an invitation that you can
give and take away whenever you please
keyless codeless and completely secure
August mind your entry when you cannot

arrives and you'll know precisely when
he leaves no more racing home to let you
out of town guests enter and no more
having to ask for keys Mac your lock
recognizes you automatically and opens
without you having to do a thing and for
your friends you just create an
invitation and press send grant access
for a day or a night or a week even a
month
and take that access away whenever you
like August isn't connected to your
wireless router or even your electrical
service so there's no risk of downtime
or system failure plus you can always
still open your door the old-fashioned
way if you like you just don't have to
secure seamless simple August you are
invited
