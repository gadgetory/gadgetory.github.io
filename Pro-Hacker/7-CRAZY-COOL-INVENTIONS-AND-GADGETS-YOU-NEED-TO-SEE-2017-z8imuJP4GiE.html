really amazing we create solutions for
the learner over the past year we've
built something that we truly love and
we know you will too we call it the
start board the sock or tract your
body's natural weight shifting simply
lean forward to accelerate no demote
needed the board's motion control system
is based on intelligent weight and
motion senses you are the controller the
powerful jewel hub motors let you reach
top speeds of 20 miles per hour
we designed a removable battery pack
that has 13 miles of range on a single
charge it contains the same lithium
cells powering a Tesla range anxiety no
worries the start Boras battery tab is
swamped on the go but of course we want
you to be safe so we developed an
intelligent braking system that brings
the start board to a full stop once you
hop off it also stops it from
accidentally rolling downhill we've been
working on the start or for quite some
time now many sleepless nights of
optimizing software algorithms tweaking
hardware features and adjusting
prototypes after a few months of actual
usage durability and stress system the
stock board is now ready for production

very own stock board at an unbeatable

advanced personal cinema sin ago your
personal Ultra HD headset the packed one
is designed to be the ultimate travel
bag for those that know the benefits of
traveling light and avoiding airline
headaches the design combines the casual
versatility of a duffel with the
organization of a suitcase
the jet-setting sidekick features a dual
compartment design that allows you to
easily pack and neatly organize your
belongings each side has a zip around
divider to keep things in place one side
is mesh while the other is quilted with
a computer pocket there are top access
zippers to get to the contents of each
side quickly without opening the entire
bag the padded laptop pocket is located
in the center so your bag remains well
balanced and your clothing adds further
protection from bumps quickly access
your laptop from the top zipper and
remove it for security there are four
mesh pockets to hold the included
laundry and tote bag as well as your
chargers vitamins or any other small
item the interior zipper pockets on each
side are a great place to tuck receipts
or personal items you want to stash out
of sight and we're out of the way once
you've got everything packed zip up your
well-organized bag like a suitcase on
the front of the bag there are two
zippered pockets to stow away things you
want to easily access while on the go
on the back there's a magazine pocket in
the newly added TSA pocket rather than
using the plastic bins to pass your
personal items through security simply
pull out the mesh TSA pocket and stow
them away once through security rather
than join the scramble of travellers
collecting their different belongings
simply grab your bag and head to a
comfortable spot to reorganize the red
label serves as a reminder to grab your
laptop or anything else that you had to
send through the x-ray separately we
also added several accessory loops on
the outside of the bag to clip your
water bottle or other travel items these
will also serve as attachment points for
future accessories from packed true to
our ethos and approach to design you
won't find any logos on the exterior of
the bag and those are the ins and outs
of the packed one pack it like a
suitcase carry it like a duffel and
stash it in the last remaining overhead
space
