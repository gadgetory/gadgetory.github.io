in ancient Japan the summer I were
extremely powerful there a weapon of
choice was the tapered Sumer we have
recreated the iconic samurai sword
pocket-sized
cooking should be a joy it's more than
just a means to a meal it's a tangible
experience it's a chance to create to
decompress to connect it doesn't take
special training to find joy in cooking
at home no matter where you're starting
anyone can make a meal they're proud of
but ask any chef and they'll tell you
the most important tool in the process
is your chef's knife I'm not a
professional chef but I love to go I
love cooking at home for friends and
family
and over the years I've found how much
more enjoyable it is when I have the
right tools this is especially true when
it comes to having a really great chef's
knife what you do in the kitchen mostly
involves your chef's knife all the
prepping cutting and slicing and all
that stuff it can feel like a chore if
you've got a crummy knife
whereas when you've got a really good
chef's knife
it feels good you look forward to it to
help bring joy back to the kitchen we
spent the last two years creating what
we believe is the best chef's knife in
its class the Concours chef
it all starts with the court we wanted
to make an incredibly sharp knife that
would stay sharp for a long time without
sharpening that's why we chose to use uh
stem still produced only in subhana
Japan known the world over worse ability
to hold an edge next we focus on balance
a well balanced knife will feel like an
extension of your hand you'll instantly
notice the way the knife seems to know
what you want it to do in fact Kon in
Japanese means intuition or six cents
and we named it that because we wanted a
blade that would do exactly what you
wanted it to do and of course we wanted
this knife to be beautiful the Austin
Kors clad between sixty six layers of
Damascus stainless steel and is paired
with your choice of beautiful dark ebony
wood or an extremely durable g10
composite handle once we had a design we
were happy with we gave the Concours
chef's knife to some professionals to
put it to the test and get their
feedback I like the comment because it's
very meticulously balanced it has a
great rocker action on it razor sharp
and very easy to maintain so I've been
used in the concours chef knife for
about a month now
I haven't had to sharpen it at all I'll
take it to the home every day owner it
every day but State is really sharp
feels great in the hand it's a really
comfortable mat to use weighted
beautifully this knife sharp when it
once holds its edge doesn't mean a lot
of maintenance
it was extremely sharp which is what we
want you could take you take that super
ripe tomato and just slice it paper-thin
slices stand them at the daily grind
that I have to go through working with
this thing in my hand all the time the
way it fits the way it balances the way
it's sharp is it's a pretty cool night
we really want to get people back into
the kitchen and enjoy the benefits of
home cook
now maybe you'll eat a little healthier
save some money but it's all about
cooking and sharing a piece of you with
the people that you love there's no
better way to build relationships than
sharing a good meal together
but we really need your help Boston
still is only produced in subhana Japan
a place in a large enough order we'll be
able to bring down the cost on these
knives a knife like this would normally
cost hundreds of dollars but by cutting
out the middleman and going directly
through Kickstarter we'll be able to get
this knife into as many hands as
possible because we want you to love the
way you cook
you
