mealtime brings people together it's
more than a time for nourishing the body
we nourish our spirit and our
relationships but tremor whether from
essential tremor or Parkinson's disease
takes away from this experience forcing
people to focus instead on the basic
task of eating currently there's no cure
for these disorders and the solutions
out there often fall short or invasive
after sinks of my own friends struggling
with a tremor I realized the frustration
loss of dignity and social isolation my
tremor can Hannah I wanted to create
something that would allow people to go
out to restaurants or something enjoy a
meal without stress we invented the lift
where spoon to cancel hand tremor and
take the frustration out of eating for
the first time we have the technology to
actively stabilize a person's tremor and
a device so small but it fits in your
hand the spoon works by sensing a
person's tremor and intelligently
stabilizing itself to make the foods
journey from the plate to the mouth much
easier lift where is designed to be part
of your life the device is small and
portable so that you can easily take it
with you when you go out to eat it's
comfortable and effective because lift
where allows your hand to shake while
the cancellation technology and the
handle stabilizes it's bill it's proven
to be effective in clinical trials we
measured on average more than seventy
percent reduction in tremor for
different eating related tasks it's easy
to clean and it holds a charge for
several meals so you can place it in the
charging cradle whenever it's convenient
we're proud to offer a product that
allows people to take control of the
tremor when you eat with with where your
tremor retreats into the background of
the meal so you can focus on the best
parts of dining the food you're eating
and the people you're eating with we
can't wait to bring lift wear to your
life
Oh
Oh
time for take out again if you're like
me you like good food but cooking takes
too much time and energy the result is
not always amazing you need a way to
stop guessing and just cook things right
every time you need pen telligence you
see pan telligent has a temperature
sensor right at the center of a pant
pant Elgin tells me when the pan is hot
enough to start if the heat is too high
or too low and everything else flip the
salmon Thank You Siri you wouldn't try
baking in an oven without a thermostat
the white guess on your stovetop put
away the ramen noodle lose the takeout
menu you can have healthy delicious
restaurant-quality food at home whenever
you want intelligent it took everything
perfectly take out your meat boys and
get ready to blow ladies there's some
hot food porn coming through every
butcher in town knows I'm a sucker for a
good piece of meat just as a next guy
but sometimes I just kick in so you take
whatever is on that plate and the
pleasure in your mouth becomes a huge
pain in the ass more than 200,000
Americans per day get to know this in
the hard way which is kind of soft
actually this is what I call a nasty STD
the thing that you can catch during main
course second course or any kind of
intercourse with the bad meat in
sixty-nine percent of cases you couldn't
tell if the meat or fish is spoiled or
not even if it sits on your face and not
to mention you'd like to get to know it
before you spread the legs so the long
hours of filling your chick doesn't go
down the drain I'm coming I'm coming
seriously I'm not even there yet fine
I'd like to present to you food sniffer
the number one tool to get lucky without
any second-guessing simply slide it in
and wait if you get green
you can most probably hit it raw yellow
means you need to heat it up a little
bit longer and a red one office e stands
for red flag ultimate turn off yes I
know it might be hard to swallow but I'm
not faking it this is a real thing that
checks your raw meat like no one ever
could just ask any of these guys so if
the sight of meat makes you drool or
fish is something you can't resist get
yourself food sniffer especially if
you're still into experimenting click
here now to get your personal foo
sniffer that will help you decide
whether to Bennett or bite it oh and
remember always sniff before you swallow
