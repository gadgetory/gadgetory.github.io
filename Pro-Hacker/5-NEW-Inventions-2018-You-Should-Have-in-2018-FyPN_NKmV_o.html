adding Riverbanks to my gear kit enables
me to go further off the grid and handle
any situation
Riverbanks is the first module portable
power solution of its kind
the main module has two USB C and two
USB a ports in the supports wireless
charging there's also an LED screen that
shows you how much battery life you have
left how much power your devices are
drawing and what ports are using the AC
module has a standard 110 volt AC port
and can be connected to the main module
to increase my overall power capacity
the versatility of combining both
modules allows me to create a portable
workstation wherever I can charge my
laptop four times camera batteries 18 to
20 times and phone 18 to 30 times they
even when I'm all out of courts in my
laptop I can use riverbank as a USB hub
to transfer photos from an SD card to my
computer the car jump starter module
could jumpstart my car up to ten times
in one charge and also adds power
capacity when stacked with the riverbank
main module and this thing keeps me on
the road and on time for the next shoot
all three modules are less than 100 watt
hours each this makes riverbank the
largest capacity power station you can
legally fly with the riverbank can be
used to power the whole team during a
meeting if you power my laptop and busy
coffee shops where wall outlets aren't
accessible and the extra adapter tips
make riverbank compatible with most
laptop models and I can recharge it with
eco flows portable solar panels when I'm
outside so I still have to use to power
my barbecues with friends at the end of
the day
wherever I am in the world Riverbanks
kisi powered and connected so I never
missed a moment
