two minutes and she's out but you you've
been trying for two hours
I'm sure you've tried every trick in the
book like trying to stop thinking stop
thinking stop thinking stop crap I
thought or trying to relax
oh it's not that these techniques are
useless in fact they're actually pretty
good unfortunately you probably had more
important things to learn at school
this here is history relaxing fast is
his thing just look he focuses on his
breathing and he progressively slows it
down and by slowing his breathing all
the way down to about six breaths a
minute
he stimulates the barrel flicks a
physiological mechanism that allows him
to become completely calm in just a few
minutes and when it comes to not
thinking he's pretty good at that too he
can concentrate on his breathing for a
really long time and remain undistracted
by buzzing thoughts but you are not his
room even in bed you struggle to focus
on your breath for more than twenty
seconds at a time
actually your attention span is probably
more like balls than his runs
that's why we've designed dota it helps
you fall asleep by making you almost as
chill as his room I'll have one of those
you synchronize your breathing with the
light projected on the ceiling by
focusing on something outside your own
head you'll pay less attention to the
thoughts that are keeping you awake at
the same time just like a metronome dodo
helps slow down your breathing from
eleven to six breaths a minute which
helps relieve your anxiety and so in
less than eight minutes you'll find
yourself ready to doze off dodo won't
turn you into a Buddhist monk but it
will help you fall asleep faster and
that's probably all you need remember
the last time you needed to send a
message or tell someone where you were
but for some reason you couldn't that's

crowd is struggling to get their message
through
Goten is great for traveling because it
works anywhere in the world explore and
roam for free and if there's an
emergency you can send a message to all
go tenez within range because here's the
thing cell phones are great but there's
a lot of situations when they're just
not that reliable it's time to start
your own network and make no service no
problem
