choking noises while you sleep or you
have morning headaches and don't feel
rested after sleeping if you have
excessive sleepiness I believe that you
have sleep apnea what this means is that
your heart and other vital organs become
starved of oxygen that can lead to a lot
of health problems normally you will
need a series of tests and an overnight
sleep study in a sleep clinic go to
sleep is the new way to monitor your
sleep and screen sleep apnea to use go
to sleep all you need to do is put it on
before you go to sleep at night and take
it off when you wake up in the morning
it's the smallest home sleep test device
on the market it weighs only about six
grams and looks like a capsule held in a
soft silicon ring the battery can last
three whole nights and the memory can
record seven nights sleep data go to
sleep keeps a track of your blood oxygen
saturation heart rate perfusion index
tossing and turning during your sleep
and you will get whole night of sleep
monitor to test the severity of your
sleep apnea it was fascinating to see
such a detailed analysis of my sleep
pattern I've always had a snoring
problem but I didn't know my blood
oxygen levels dropped from 96 to 80 to
20 times in an hour which was really
scary
but this could change it all sleep apnea
can come with a range of clinical issues
such as feeling constantly sleepy in the
daytime fatigue and high blood pressure
stroke and heart attacks no arrhythmias
and diabetes all this can seriously
weaken the immune system the classic
sleep apnea patient that we think of is
an overweight man with a large belly and
a thick neck however it can affect
anyone nine percent of women and 24% of
men suffer from sleep apnea
unfortunately over 80% go undiagnosed
and untreated the condition really needs
long-term management go to sleep
provides continuous data instead of just
a snapshots that clinical monitoring
provides by continuously collecting and
mining your sleep data the correlation
of some chronic disease with your sleep
quality can be revealed I've gone from
wearing all this at night to this tiny
little ring I just literally put it on
at night wake up in the morning check
the app and it's all done cannot believe
it I really want to get one use go to
sleep every night to get a better
night's rest and to improve your overall
sleep health and
style
you
you

necessary when an incident occurs to the
device you will receive the push notice
from the app immediately no matter if it
is a Wi-Fi disconnection or the food is
running out it also includes lots of
great features hyper sized sensor to
detect the food consumption and features
to calculate remaining days from the
tech machine interface physiology we
chose the most comfort degree to plate
the pets in order to reduce the stress
from the neck to the minimum it also has
a great dual lock system to keep food
fresh and retaining the taste of pet
food the way your pet life
frig and logo aluminum with special
coloring process stainless Bowl easy to

will start a new life in your home the
design DNA comes from an idea of the
image when a baby kitten and puppy
squats down and talking to you the
design follows a docile feeling instead
of being boxy we selected the most
popular color material in consumer
electronic products to build the feeder
with premium perceived quality - and co2
one smart cut feeder you can easily

our prototype is available at the moment
and the product manufacturing is coming
soon new one will not be possible
without you we are really excited to
bring the new products to you first and
thank you all for your support
you
this is our first product logic and QV
as you get more UV exposure it's user
interface and world transform and color
and when logic Inc reaches his end it
means that you've had enough Sun for the
day we started with UV and along the way
we've explored a range of sensors for
example pollution alcohol pH hydration
skin health
that shows how dry oily or hydrated your
skin is high-energy visible light
temperature and also DNA we imagine when
they when people will be able to pick
and choose a range of sensors and match
them to a fully customized tattoo making
that experience for that person unique
being both a conduct of health awareness
and self-expression
we want to thank the increasing the
bandwidth of what defines it goes beyond
the current state of software apps now
the apps are programming and mattered
under skin like these tattoos and we
think that's an exciting future
