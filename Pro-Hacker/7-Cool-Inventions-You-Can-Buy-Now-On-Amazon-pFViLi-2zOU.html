Open Sesame
sesame is what's called a smartlock
which means you can unlock it using your
phone as the key I've tried other smart
laws they're way too big their apps are
confusing they take too long to connect
and they're hassle to install and I'm
pretty handy sesame is different you can
install it in seconds literally no one's
screwing no replacing sesame has a
patented design that fits any latch
anywhere in the world the app is
handsome and intuitive but you can open
your door without it like this or like
this
sesame senses when my phone is nearby
and gets ready for my special nook
and I can get the optional Wi-Fi access
point it plugs into the wall nearby so
sesame is always on my home network and
it's linked to the access point with
Bluetooth which keeps it connected while
going easy on the batteries and with no
keys it's easy to let other people into
I can choose who has access and who
doesn't
I get notifications when my lock opens
and closes so I can always know what's
going on no matter where I am and it's
got military-grade encryption
no one's hacking this thing Open Sesame
it may sound crazy but you can do this
to all of it it's easy how do we know
because we've made it easy at DJI we
created the flying camera as you know it
and there's a good chance that the drone
videos you've seen online were shot with
one of our cameras this time we started
small so you can dream big we created
your first personal drone but we're
still squeezing in big power it
automatically follows you or whatever
you want without a bracelet or tracker
avoids obstacles and comes packed with a
4k stabilized camera 27 minute flight
time
a whole lot more this is the DJI Matic
Pro and this is the DJI Mavic Pro
unfolded to make it this small we have
to rip out a ton of cool stuff right now
it's got 24 high-performance computing
cores dual satellite connectivity an
all-new transmission system with a 4.3
mile range for vision sensors and more
sound complicated it's not it's easy
the Maddock knows where it takes off
from where it is in the air where it's
going and what is capturing when you
take off the Mavic uses 2 vision sensors
and connects with up to 20 satellites
also it can remember your location
this means the Mavic knows where home is
so it can return by itself precision
landing technology means it can land
almost exactly where you took off at the
touch of a button as you fly satellite
systems keep track of you working in
harmony with all four vision sensors
telling it what's below and what's in
front whether you are flying beside a
cliff in a forest or even indoors just
like you Maddux sees and thinks that
means it can avoid the things in its
path
from trees to walls
any good flying camera needs
stabilization the Maddox expertly
miniaturized gimble teach the entire
camera steady
unlike electronic stabilization you use
every pixel from the sensor and you
don't have the weight of a bulky add-on
camera shooting an epic tracking shot of
a friend is easy active track technology
means it just takes a few taps not just
one kind of tracking shot either
it's got spotlight profile and tricks or
use tap flight to tap and fly
Terrain follow mode keeps the Mavic at a
height you define as the ground Rises so
you can focus on your shot not your
height everything can be controlled
using a gamepad sized controller you can
keep in your pocket it opens up to clamp
around your phone and has been custom
engineered to give you more feedback and
more accuracy you will always feel in
control if you don't want to bother with
the controller fly using virtual
joysticks right from the phone over
Wi-Fi whether you fly with the remote
controller or just your phone active
track modes are ready to make you shoot
like a pro want to be on camera not
behind it it just takes a wave and a
gesture then there's the new DJI goggle
strap these on to really feel like
you're flying combine them with sport
mode to get your pulse pumping while you
fly at an incredible forty miles per
hour once you've got your shots edit
everything together in DJI go and share
or even stream your flight live to
Facebook or YouTube inspiration can
strike from the smallest thing a sketch
a feeling and experience the Mavic has
been designed for you to take it
anywhere ready at a moment's notice
whenever inspiration strikes you to
create something truly great
DJI Mavic wherever you go
