no matter who your family is we all want
to keep the people we love safe and
that's why we made salt the first safe
gun for safe home
hi I'm Adam this is Andy we're the
creators of salt salt is a gun but it's
not like any gun that you've ever seen
it was designed around the belief that a
firearm shouldn't have to take a life in
order to protect a life from that simple
idea we started by completely rethinking
the bullet instead of LED salt was
design issued a specialized round filled
with powerful toxin - instead of killing
the target salt opens up on impact and
cloud that instantly causes respiratory
and visual distress so while an intruder
or a curious child will be incapacitated
encounter wouldn't be fatal
this rethink also lets salt be used not
only offensively but defensively as well
so if an intruder is kicking down your
door
salt allows you to shoot the area around
it before the danger is on top of you
this creates a protective cloud of toxin
between you and the intruder before he's
ever a threat to you or your family our
last big idea was to make salt easy to
use for everyone so we replace the
violent bang of black powder with the
silent power of compressed air the
result is a fear free user experience so
the only person that should have
anything to be scared of is an intruder
and that's all a safe gun for a safe
home so now all we need is you the
testing the Rd the prototyping is all
done and we're ready to begin production
but salt can't be made without you
without all of us really wanting a
better way to keep the people we love
safe so if you're is intrigued by the
ideas as we are we'd love to make you

together we can make the world just a
little bit safer
