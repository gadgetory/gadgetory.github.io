this is us well this was us when life
revolved around blanks then we turn it
into this the point is we've known each
other since kindergarten and life still
revolves around two wheels so much in
fact we set up a company together to
make awesome bikes at a great price that
was in 2010 since then we've grown if
you've gone from taking the gamble on a
truckload of bikes we thought people
might want to producing a ton of us we
know people want we've got all the
grown-up stuff like a big team an office
at a warehouse full of bikes ready for
delivery so now with a mission to get
more people on bikes we've designed one
that can revolutionize your world of
urban transportation ladies and
gentlemen we'd like to introduce the
pure cycles Volta
we know there are plenty of ebikes on
the market there's heavy ones pricey one
kind of funny-looking wands he even had
a crack at making one for y'all before
but we were quite satisfied so we
scoured the globe and assembled a team
of engineering gurus with Fung and his
friends we figured out how our bike
would have a forty mile range on a
single charge how the battery would fit
stealthily into the top tube the motor
into the rear hub and how our bike would
be one of the lightest ebikes
on the market we also did this all right
Oscar walk towards me bro so once again
I introduce to you the pure cycles Volta
this bike is simple and smart we know it
looks smart but we mean it is smart and
even has its own app featuring GPS
tracking if the bike is stolen a workout
log and smart modes to maximize battery
life and giving your desired level of
output power regenerates with braking
and integrated smart lights switch on
and off automatically
this bike is pedal-assist stripping away
the unnecessary buttons and throttles
and while you are in the kudos of
looking like you're working out on the
way to the office the breezy power
assisted riding means you won't even
have smudged your makeup being urban
dwellers ourselves we recognize that
space is at a premium so we wanted to
design an e-bike that not only packs a
punch on the road but can be fit into a
tight space or carry it up to a fifth
floor apartment if necessary
surely a bike is smart and fast and fun
as this is absorbent ly expensive I hear
you say well not really our bikes will
retail for around $2,500 but for our
backers we're cutting the price by
$1,000 making the pure cycles volta one
of the most affordable ebikes on the
market
but what good is a special backers deal
if it takes years to get your eBay it's
no good at all that's why we're making
humour from you back this campaign you
will get your bike by the end of 2017
guaranteed how do we know we can pull
this off because we've got the best guys
on the job and because we're a lot
better at making quality bikes than we
are at curio
you
ever thought about all the things you
achieve with a simple push of a button
technology brings endless possibilities
right to our fingertips making life more
comfortable in every aspect and helping
us prepare better for the future except
when it comes to a flat tire
right ere is the next generation of
effortless air pops and it works at the
push of a button just like you're used
to just as it should ride air is clean
simple and efficient it's designed to
help you in two common situations the
natural loss of air pressure that always
catches you off-guard and a flat tire
that stops you from getting on your bike
at all right air is the perfect quick
fix for bone lets you inflate your tires
with a single push of a button this way
you can take care of a flat after you
get to where you need to be ride air can
be refilled with an air compressor in
literally a second and it's built-in
safety prevents air from leaking out we
worked on a slick and elegant design
that would fit perfectly on your bike so
that you're never caught without it just
to be on the safe side it has built-in
lock to keep your ride air where it
belongs and of course ride air isn't
just for riding you can also use it to
inflate lots of other things
