phone salesman
meet koji coach Wow the robot that means
coding fun using emojis with OneTouch
commands your kids will be coding in
seconds and having less
koji features games that build key
skills like memory sequencing it logic
and problem solving kids can even create
and store custom programs that are as
unique as they are give your kids in a
mode ocation with koji new from Maui
electricity and electric circuits are
now essential whole life however most
people feel those are something far from
them to enable anyone to play with
electric circuits we launched conductive
pen with which you can draw electric
circuits for example she has no
experience of study design that she is
comfortably making electric circuits
with our pens hey Co this doesn't work
really let me see
um this short out you shouldn't have
connected these how can I fix it well
unfortunately you have to make it again
from scratch are you serious
this is what have happened in the past
but now you don't have to make it a game
from scratch we got to race it with our
way racers you can race in a fixers
hockey patterns quickly our racers
enable you to create advanced gimmicks
with trials and errors for example you
can make a birthday card that lights up
when opened
you can add tricks to the gradient cars
you can also make a slider with which
you can control lights you can make
sensor interfaces on paper you can make
even more complicated works such as
music interfaces such the lasers allow
you to try and edit circuit patterns
intellectually and flexibly
I've been researching electrical circuit
prototyping using the conductive ink a
major limitation of prototyping with the
conductive ink is difficulty of changing
the design you can't undo circuit design
unlike software with our circuit editor
you can change your design easily and
quickly obedience try and radar is
important at some part of learning
process I'm using an agent part of my
own project conductor we're sticking
together really easily using this new
circuit eraser with the agent Parker is
super convenient I can edit my circuits
on the fly which is amazing with our
circuit racers you can make a circuit
without fear of mistakes we've developed
a prototype of the racer by supporting
this project you can help us find the
first mass production of the racers we
prepare the kids doesn't let you realize
your creativity instantly so why don't
you join us and let's see a new Fry's
Electronics together
