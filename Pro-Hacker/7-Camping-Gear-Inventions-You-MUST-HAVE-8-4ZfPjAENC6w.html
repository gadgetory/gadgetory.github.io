we are solo soap since 2011 Chris is
making super efficient wood burning
backpacking and camping stoves
our unique patented design does require
any bulky batteries or fans all you need
is a handful of twigs for speck year
after year we enjoy interacting with
some growing numbers so low so cute
we're grateful that they trust our
products enough to take with them on
their most memorable adventures we
believe that time spent outdoors with
family and friends can create some of
life's most precious and meaningful
moments but with our lives becoming
busier and busier spending time with
those we care about it's becoming more
difficult so we're making it easier for
you to spend more time with family and
friends outdoors introducing the solo
stove
bonfire a backyard fire pit like you've
never seen before the bonfire uses the
same patented design and technology as
our other solo scopes but it's our
largest model yet it's designed with
unique double walls which allows air
flow through the bottom poles of the
bonfire to channel air to the bottom of
the fire and up between the walls this
pre heated air allows the fire to burn
more complete which results in a more
efficient fire with very little smoke a
more efficient burn means you'll get
more fire from your logs compared to an
open fire pit the bonfire is super
durable made out of premium 304
stainless steel and is backed by a
lifetime guarantee we can't wait to
bring the soothing ambience the dancing
flames and the rustic smell of a glowing
campfire straight to your backyard
we're excited to play a small part in
bringing you together with family and
friends in the outdoors become a backer
and be the first to experience the solo
stove bonfire
what it was designed to be is a
two-in-one campfire we wanted to have
the propane and we wanted to have the
wood and it's more than that because
what you can also do is you can shark
hole and cook over and grill over it etc
you can also cook over the wood and you
can also cook over the propane we do
bacon and eggs over the propane part all
the time really great really easy
philosophy and easy to control
the flank and is a multifunctional ultra
via that combine a hammock a mosquito
protected hemlock a waterproof clothing
tent that can also be set up on the
ground with the bb10 and a fancy rain
poncho all-in-one smart and reliable

about seven seconds and you can be
converted to its different functions
quickly and easily this makes it one of
the smartest most versatile outdoor
meals that you can possibly get

simplicity of the flying tent but it
took us a while to get there the biggest
challenge was to merge all these
functions into one smart products that
allows small packaging it is
compromising its functionality after two
years of hard work our team was finally
able to come up with a truly unique
product that exceeds all our initial
expectations the times when annoying
