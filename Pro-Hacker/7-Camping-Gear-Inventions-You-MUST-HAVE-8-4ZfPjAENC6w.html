making super efficient wood burning
backpacking and camping stoves
our unique patented design does require
any bulky batteries or fans all you need
is a handful of twigs for speck year
after year we enjoy interacting with
some growing numbers so low so cute
we're grateful that they trust our
products enough to take with them on
their most memorable adventures we
believe that time spent outdoors with
family and friends can create some of
life's most precious and meaningful
moments but with our lives becoming
busier and busier spending time with
those we care about it's becoming more
difficult so we're making it easier for
you to spend more time with family and
friends outdoors introducing the solo
stove
bonfire a backyard fire pit like you've
never seen before the bonfire uses the
same patented design and technology as
our other solo scopes but it's our
largest model yet it's designed with
unique double walls which allows air
flow through the bottom poles of the
bonfire to channel air to the bottom of
the fire and up between the walls this
pre heated air allows the fire to burn
more complete which results in a more
efficient fire with very little smoke a
more efficient burn means you'll get
more fire from your logs compared to an
open fire pit the bonfire is super
durable made out of premium 304
stainless steel and is backed by a
lifetime guarantee we can't wait to
bring the soothing ambience the dancing
flames and the rustic smell of a glowing
campfire straight to your backyard
