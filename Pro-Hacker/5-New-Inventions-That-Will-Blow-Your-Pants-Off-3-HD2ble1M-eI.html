Oh
so with chip we really want to bring the
fun of baking cookies and bring that to
everybody sometimes it can be a little
bit tedious being able to make cookies
from scratch and we brought that whole
entire experience under 10 minutes that
was a huge accomplishment for us but we
didn't want to stop there we really
wanted to also figure out how can we
make this machine even more fun
I mean cookies themselves are a ton of
fun so Roley hey what if we tap the
cookie machine Winship actions deliver
messages to you your friends on the
special occasions of like happy birthday
wish you know the best of luck your
first day of the job or school so we
wanted apps idea of cookie grams in
which you can send your messages after
they've actually baked their cookies to
your special loved ones and Friends what
my the sea salt chocolate chip or the
oatmeal raisin but you gotta try the
gluten-free ones made they're so good
what I also love is to start my day with
a super healthy breakfast bar cookie
they've got fruits and nuts and grains
and seeds it's a really great way to
start the day plus it's so easy to make
you just pop it and chip and it's
freshly baked and ready to go in under
ten minutes just grab that with your
coffee and you're good to go
shit's gonna bake cookies better than a
regular oven because he uses a special
connection cooking technology where we
have any carbon fiber heating element
it's more energy efficient than
surrounding a fan that blows hot air
very evenly spread throughout the UH
themself that doughnut shaped pattern
around the cookies so those cookies are
gonna come out perfectly every time our
team's been working so hard on chip and
now we need your help to bring him to
life all we want is for you to have
freshly baked cookies in under 10
minutes you can have them at home office
