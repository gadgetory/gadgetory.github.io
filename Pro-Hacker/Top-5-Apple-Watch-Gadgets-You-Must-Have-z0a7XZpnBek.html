then this is for you
we're going to challenge something you
probably take for granted about your
sport watch like the rest of your
performance gear your watch is evolved
to help you achieve more we simply asked
why are your valuable stats not in your
natural line of sight we want to know
our cadence without losing we want to
know our pace without going slower
we want to know our metrics and we want
to stay focused on a sport and honor
form
today's watches deliver a corn of
information in ways we never could have
imagined so why do we wear them the same
way we always have our vision is a bat a
band that moves your watch to the
optimum position abandonned enables you
to view and interact with your watch
using no arm rotation it means staying
informed
it means improve safety when grabbing a
glance and it means improved comfort and
convenience when using your apps while
looking at your metrics
on top of optimizing the position it's
designed to be ultra lightweight
comfortable to wear and durable during
activity
ergonomic design creates the perfect
angle of view and interacting on the
movie and is adjustable size fits
everyone on the left or right hand
stopping yet another piece of technology
from bendiness and more uncomfortable
positions and with a versatile design it
can be worn 24/7 or easily swap between
bands to break a hundred years of
tradition we needed to think differently
we needed to break the status quo if
this sounds like you join us and help
change the face of time
