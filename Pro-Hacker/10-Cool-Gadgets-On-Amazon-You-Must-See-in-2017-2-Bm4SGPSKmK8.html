today's cameras allow anyone to capture
incredible imagery with unique
perspectives and in any environment but
at the end of the adventure trip or
shoot we're left with gigabytes and
gigabytes of footage and no time to
process at all a big part of progression
is being able to share and show there is
so much content shot daily by so many
people that never sees the light of day
I mean I sit on literally probably ten
or so hard drives of content that I've
never shared with anyone that's what
inspired us to build an AR box the first
rugged device that allows you full
control of your HD content while on the
go in our box is designed for your media
it's the only product that downloads
your camera's memory card organizes your
files for you and empowers you to
quickly edit today's highlights and full
resolution krumitz montage
you no longer need to bring your laptop
everywhere you go or spend hours digging
through footage just plug in your camera
connect with an AR box hotspot and open
our app we started prototyping in the
garage over a year ago and built several
versions of nar box to get us here we've
parted out with an incredible team of
athletes and photographers who have
vetted this product since the very
beginning
one of the greatest joys of my life is
being able to get outdoors with friends
and capture moments and the other aspect
is being able to share those moments
what I really like about the gnar box is
that is hands down the fastest way to
get all the content off of my camera we
usually shoot in the highest resolution
possible with a simple hotspot
connection I can actually edit full
high-res up to 4k footage on my smart
phone the challenge we faced was packing
the power of a 15-inch laptop into a
small pocket-sized device but that's
exactly what we did
implementing a quad-core CPU and eight
core GPU 4 gigabytes of RAM 128
gigabytes of flash and a 300 megabits
per second Wi-Fi all in a system
dedicated to serving media its packaging
an ip67 enclosure which means it's dust
proof sand proof and waterproof to one
meter this means you can view process
and edit 4k video and raw photos
anywhere you want anytime you want the
user interface we've built is both
simple and intuitive with pro-style
editing features like slow-motion color
correction brightness and contrast
adjustments and cropping all in a clean
mobile package to be able to go through
my whole photo process without having to
touch my laptop and the three special
things we envision are boxes of
solutions to our adventure different
problems we've since built a community
of over 20,000 subscribers and found
that just about anybody who loves to
shoot photos and videos had the same
problems we did our manufacturer is
ready to go with our molding and tooling
all we need to do is setup the assembly
line get the green light from our beta
testers
and deliver the NAR box to our backers
back us today and help us complete this
incredible journey we can't wait to
share in our box with you
you see amazing isn't it this is the air
selfie the only portable flying camera
integrated into your mobile phone cover
Micro land ultralight it comes with it's
very own device for storage and charging
with an easy one-hand control from its
own where did the idea come from well
I'll show you look at this what an epic
day out of bonafide selfie time as they
say just need to squeeze a teeny bit
no hands never mind ah more manageable
group just two guys actually they want
to take a selfie to remember this
wonderful place well I guess they can
just describe the view to their friends
back home right okay one more try this
time a good old barbecue outside on a
sunny day with lots of friends let's try
the selfie stick strategy still can't
fit everybody in annoying situations am
i right we've all been there buddy
that's how air selfie was born a perfect
team gathered together working in London
Milan and Shanghai to combine micro
flying technologies ultralight HD
cameras with in flight stability systems
err selfie can travel in a 20 meter
radius and hovers for up to three
minutes it's easily controllable from
both iOS or Android smartphone apps it's
only 52 grams and it's locked into its
phone cover and recharges so what if the
guys had an air selfie with them they
make it hover find the perfect angle and
leave the controls finally snap an
amazing photo with the selfie delay
timer mode while it is autonomously
flying and keeping its position in the
air awesome what about the two explorers
they select the classic flying mode from
the three options available control
layer selfie through the app by holding
a phone horizontally and take both
memorable photos and videos and what
would have happened at the barbecue
enough would be squeezing just select
the selfie mode use only two buttons to
find the right distance to shoot and
take a great picture what about an
indoor location whatever it may be a
party at somebody's house or a night out
in a club there are no issues there
selfie fly's easily it's simple to
control and very safe
and once you shoot a great picture don't
keep it to yourself
it's so easy to share it right from your
phone as easy as grabbing the air selfie
safely while it's still hovering in the
air so this is air selfie the only
portable flying camera integrated into
your mobile phone cover ready to explore
new perspectives let's take a look at
its technical features power bank inside
its own custom phone cover a battery
that charges itself in only 30 minutes 5
megapixel HD video camera to suit social
media optimized images sophisticated
sensors and its own Wi-Fi control unit
in flight stability systems to hover

powerful brushless motors it's safe to
grab while it's still hovering and of
course its own 4 gigabyte microSD memory
