we use it in every aspect of our lives
it enables us to do amazing things but
what if we could go further what if we
could go beyond the screen where your
digital world is blended with your real
world now we can this is the world with
Holograms
what will they enable us to do new ways
to visualize our work I have an idea for
the fuel tank new ways to share ideas
with each other I think that you're in I
just put the images in onedrive more
immersive ways to play
new ways to teach and learn so put the
new trap into place of the old one and
tights in here and here new ways to
collaborate and explore the places we've
never been look at this formation let's
take a closer look
and new ways to create the things we
imagine
because when you change the way you see
the world you can change the world you
see them
this is microsoft hololens
you
why err a Brody and I are playing
first-person shooter we're sitting there
on the couch driving this Jeep I'm on
the back and I'm pounding away with the
gun and he's hitting the bumps and then
the thing explodes on the screen we go
flying but there's really nothing except
a little vibration what good is that
like is something missing here we
started thinking about wow you know that
would be great if we could kind of get
that feeling across not only do you feel
the impact but you feel the spread and
you get the kickback and it's all there
the whole experience and that's when you
actually feel like you're totally
immersed with air egg that's what you
get my name is Brody Stanfield I'm the
president co-founder of tech my name is
Michael Stanfield and I'm the vice
president and co-founder gaming today is
a two dimensional product experience is
limited to sight and sound and so we're
providing a new dimension it's a suit
it's a haptic product that provides
sensory stimulation taking the user into
the game whether it be sound sensations
of touch the idea of the impact Eric
will put you into that experience that
you've always wanted
there are three major components to this
suit
there's the decoder the exoskeleton and
the sim skin the decoder is the piece
that attaches actually to your console
or platform takes information that it
brings that and sends it to the
exoskeleton the exoskeleton is now the
component that sort of has all the
pieces in ARAG that you're wearing from
the nervous system which is the feedback
to the control center which takes the
information from the decoder as well as
the power supply to make sure it's
wireless the sound that we're providing
is a patented sound it's quite a
different experience we want to make it
a surround sound feel so the idea is we
have six speakers two on the front on
this side two on that side and then on
the back one here and one here as well
as a subwoofer you're always in a sweet
spot no matter where you are
and as for like vibratory feedback right
now it's always been to the controller
so you feel the rumble in your hand now
we're actually getting is so it's
located on the specific parts your body
where it should be there are sixteen
points on the front eight points on the
side and sixteen points on the back
alright so first thing we're going to do
is I'm going to test this in vibrational
stuff so to start with I'm just gonna
set a value here and I'm gonna be top
right you do that yeah
alright so let's switch that over to
bottom left and where's you yeah
switches awesome that's pretty much how
vibration works as for stems they're
pretty much focused on particular
muscles it contracts the muscles I can
either give a full contraction or it can
be a slight contraction once again same
thing top right so they just to tell you
okay
alright shut that off how you feeling we
can see it moving your shoulder forward
like that yeah nothing will wait alright
so that's pretty much it for the basic
fundamentals of what air I can actually
do so what do you think of it it was
pretty interesting and that really
experienced anything like that yeah
virtual world awareness you actually
inside the world that you're playing in
the last piece is the sim skin so Sims
kin is the look and feel over top you
can then have these front piece plates
that you put on or an armor on the sides
and that kind of stuff to actually look
like you're in the game that you're
actually envisioning yourself in games
already have sound arity of haptic
feedback so we take that information
that's already there and we implemented
with air egg and it's now a matter of
the developers to take on that role if
they have a game and they want to
compete with a triple-a game and they're
only an indie company well now you can
it's not just about the visuals anymore
it's about how you can how you can
differentiate your product we think
that's going to be a big difference
the ultimate goal of this campaign is to
create airag we want to be able to
create that product for you which kicks
our success we can actually ensure that
everyone who wants us can get it
the initial involvement of the community
will be through our our website and our
IT infrastructure we want to ensure that
the individuals who actually start the
kickstarter program and go through the
campaign with us are the individuals who
are going to be initially involved in
the development process and making
decisions with us not only do we want
you to be part of it the community part
of purchasing the product we want people
to actually part of the development
process we want to bring people in and
actually get them to try it out and show
us what they actually think is good
we're gonna get people to actually come
here to our office and work on it with
us so the funding takes into account the
development it takes into account the
manufacturing kicked into account some
of the distribution costs as well we
take a look at it as a whole you we want
you to help us actually make this
everything it can be
the process of this we want to make sure
that it's good from start to finish we
have engineering firm in place we have
the web infrastructure warehouse and
distribution in place we have all the
components necessary to actually go
through this process not only will the
product be ready and all your input be
in place but you actually get the
product on time the customer service
section is where we want to focus as
well we believe that that's one of the
most important aspects of the community
it's not only the thing that determines
the viability and whether this is
successful it's also what determines
where we're headed if you're gonna be
part of this campaign where we have an
expectation actually we talked about
that those people who want to be
involved hey you can see this come to
fruition you'll be part of the success
of a new product out there in the market
you're gonna be part of the group of
people who actually bring this to other
households you finally get to be that
one of the drivers in the gaming
industry let's take this product and
move it forward you'll be part of the
first Legion the only way is that get on
board
it's blurring the line between the real
and the virtual world the new gear that
lets you touch what you play a new suit
is taking virtual reality beyond the
visual and into the touch and feel UK
company tests the studio's no relation
to Tesla Motors is behind the wearable
tech it's called the Tesla suit and
consists of a belt
gloves a vest and leg and arm bands it's
completely wireless and incorporates
mesh sensors to stimulate sensations in
the skin through tiny electric pulses
the developers expected to be fully
compatible with existing virtual reality
headsets like the oculus and even
consoles like PlayStation and Xbox Tesla
Studios hopes to make it available
sometime next year</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
