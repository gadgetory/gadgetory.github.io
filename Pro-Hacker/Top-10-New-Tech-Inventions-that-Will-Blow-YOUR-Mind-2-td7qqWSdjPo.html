plexidrone we have thought about the
things that people don't really think
about how do you improve drone
technology how do you make it accessible
to everyone how do you inspire people to
create using drone technology at riku
robotics we believe technology should be
building bridges towards new levels of
creativity and productivity rather than
barriers and the plexi drill is one of
those technologies a drone that you can
snap together and take apart in less
than one minute and when you're done you
just put it into your hardshell backpack
and take it anywhere that you want to go
the plexi pack is something we designed
in order to carry everything you need to
capture all the great shots that you
want and carry it with you everywhere
you go anywhere you can go with a
backpack
you can take the plexidrone with the
plexi drone you can carry more than just
a camera with very simple payload
Cliff's are able to just snap on
whatever it is that you want to put on
there it's so simple
another unique feature about the
plexidrone is that it has a retractable
landing gear you will no longer have any
kind of junk in your shot you never have
to crop anything out at the bottom it's
just gonna be clear beautiful 360 view
on the plexi drone gps follow me is an
amazing feature all that you do is press
follow me on your mobile device on your
phone or your tablet and it's as easy as
that it's gonna be very very easy to use
everybody has a smartphone now great now
you just saved yourself eight hundred
bucks for a controller aside from that
you're also able to control more than
one of them at the same time you will
definitely find no drones that you can
control using our swarm technology it's
completely new something you won't find
anywhere else
that means that you're able to view the
same scene from multiple vantage points
you get the same shot with one user but
many drones
our drone is equipped with an ultrasonic
sensor at the front of it it'll flash
its lights and give you an audio message
to let you know that you're getting it
as
you don't have to interpret blinking LED
lights because it tells you in its own
voice initialization sequence completed
are you even going to use me plexi drone
is going to unleash new dimensions of
creativity and productivity and take
your camera to places that you never
thought were possible in order for us to
realize our dream we need your support
any support that you could give to us to
bring the plexi drone to market would be
extremely valuable even just sharing our
story with your friends what we're here
to do is to reimagine what drone
technology means to all of us
plexy drone is ready
hey here here let me gets a tip Wow
Danijela watch me jump
hey nature s0 is excited about pride on
a sphere you can become one of the first
users by supporting us on our IndieGoGo
campaign but now it's time to bring the
right on go respect yeah
snowboarding is one of my biggest
passions in life for the last 15 years
I've been developing augmented reality
helmets of fighter pilots two years ago
during a ski trip I decided to merge my
passion in my profession and for the
first time make this site of pilot
technology available to all skiers the
special thing about the pilots smart
element is the way the augmented reality
layers are seamlessly overlaid on the
real world we've adopted this advanced
technology to the world of winter sports
so you can enjoy the same experience
last winter we skied with our first
prototype when we saw the graphics
overlaid on the snow and all the people
around us we knew in that moment the
skiing was about to change forever
others in the features are worthless if
they are not protected in the harsh
environment of the mountain left were
designed the most durable comfortable
and lightweight girdles possible become
the first to have ride on goggles by
supporting us on IndieGoGo together we
can make this amazing vision accessible
to all skiers as soon as possible
what if a stylist could work as easily
as your everyday writing and drawing
tools while offering advanced digital
features like clip to erase perfect palm
rejection hover zoom and more without
ever needing batteries buttons or even a
Bluetooth connection meet flip the
stylist that is as easy to use as the
pencil you grew up with flip uses an
incredibly simple and unique method of
communicating with any Apple device so
you can write on your iPad or iPhone
just like you would with a pen and paper
making flip the most intuitive digital
note-taking stylus ever developed it's
also a very powerful tool that digital
artists will love with flips
interchangeable magnetic tips the
artists in you will be inspired to draw
sketch and paint in all your favorite
apps in the past advanced smart stylus
features like flip to erase palm
rejection and others have required
complex electronics to improve upon this
we powered flip with magnetics our rare
earth magnets produce an exact invisible
magnetic field that is always on just
like the Earth's magnetic field clips
patented software algorithms developed
by our software partner wide Vantage use
the hardware already in your device to
sense and detect Clips magnetic field
and determine the precise location and
orientation of the stylus so our palm
rejection flipped to erase and other
features work perfectly want to erase
flip knows just flip it over and your
clip is now an eraser want to rest your
palm on the screen while using the
stylus flip knows since we know the
exact location of the stylus we can
perfectly reject any other object
touching the screen want to hover and
then zoom in to generate more detail
flip knows just enable the hover
functionality and we can even detect the
stylus while it is still in the air want
to take notes in a class or meeting but
don't want to reenter your password and
reconnect your Bluetooth stylus every
time your iPad wakes up again
full hip knows we sense when you stop
writing and automatically dim your
screen to help save power and then
instantly turn your screen back on when
you are ready to make your next note
flip comes with a free easy-to-use
note-taking and drawing app called flip
notes we also know many of our backers
already have their favourite apps so
we've developed an app developers kit
that allows any note-taking or drying
app to quickly integrate flips features
into their apps we've already engaged
with several popular apps and we'll be
happy to keep adding to the list just
let us know your favorite apps and we
will work with them in addition to
note-taking and drawing our software
partner is developing fun educational
learning apps for kids that can be
activated by flip these apps will be
available on the iTunes Store this is
our third Kickstarter project and we
love that our backers continue to drive
our innovation thank you for allowing us
to turn your ideas into products flip by
link tech smart intuitive simple we
can't wait to see what you create with
your flip weekends and holidays there's
no better way to spend them than lying
under the Sun with friends lounging in
the great outdoors or cuddling with your
other half most people use air
mattresses but do we actually like them
or do we hate them to use it you need to
go through the hassle of finding a palm
electrical useless when you go outside a
hand won will make you exhausted
or you can be a hero and blow it up on
your own whatever but that was before we
are happy to present you with Bhutto the
world's most ultimate air mattress it
will be your best friend wherever and
whenever you need a rest mono flow is
our unique technology that provides you
a comfortable place to rest with only a
few swift hand movements the few toes
unmatchable comfort and ease of
inflation make it the best air mattress
available in mere moments you will have
a perfect space for relaxing next to the
pool beach or even in the water
you can sit alone with your loved one or
with your good friends since futo can
hold 450 pounds and stay inflated for up
to eight hours let beautto entertain
your kids while you soak up the Sun it
takes only seconds to put it back into
your bag once you're done lounging keep
all of your basic necessities in the
side pockets of the universal bag our
team looked through hundreds of
different forms of materials before
choosing the most cozy and practical one
to make few tow convenient easy to use
and long lasting now we are looking for
your help to launch mass production and
release the most versatile air mattress
ever let relaxation come first and enjoy
every minute of your rest time all
effect is short for holographic vector
display and it is a volumetric display
system it draws images in the air with
light
all of us can be viewed by multiple
people from multiple angles it is a true
volumetric display like the Holograms
that we've seen in movies and science
fiction for so long I can see a future
where every toggled every control you
have is gonna be a projected volumetric
entity you'll have buttons you'll have
signs there's there's room in education
and planning
whenever you see a movie and there's a
projection it's always being used for
very practical purposes it's always
being used to describe a large
dimensional scene and that technology
does not exist you can't really print an
object but it will take a long long time
and it's not interactive this technology
you can you can create landscapes you
can create a scenery and move it and
change it you can create designs and see
them come to life but not they can make
a building and actually see it without
waiting for my cab and then modify it
again there's also a future where it can
be used as communication device it is a
first step but it can go far beyond just
a simple display it's a holographic
vector display okay turn it on by
pressing that button right here yep oh
man
and it's so so cool and it's heart is an
Edison microcontroller and you can load
images to it via a USB or Wi-Fi or
Bluetooth it's basically a computer you
can program it or you can actually code
for it if you're advanced the SDK gives
you all the tools you'll need to get
started right out of the box take
something very simple a point in space
as XY and Z and you take two of those
now you have a vector
you take a group of those now you have
an object the SDK gives you the tools to
manipulate an object in space with
minimal program instead of the Unity
engine effect it's like is as one of
those things are really important and
this is an application of physics mostly
and computer science I'm also have to
have a lot of experience manufacturing I
designed built protocol phone booths and
streetlights I think there's a few
technologies that are as disruptive as
crowdfunding and as important as
Kickstarter in the past somebody liking
with an idea and then would have to go
through a very long circuitous route to
get funding in this way you know I can
produce an idea and make a product and
bring it directly to the people who will
help me develop it in the future the
idea is to get all of X enhances as many
people as possible developers
programmers artists to see what they
will come up with and and then we can
develop it further use that experience
in that that implicate go to the next
phase
you
food goes through a long journey which
can take months even years before it
reaches our kitchens every food has its
own story so feeling it understanding
where the products come from it's a
beautiful thing we all enjoy deliciously
served meals with fresh ingredients the
recent study from Oxford University
shows that artfully presented food
actually tastes better we combined our
skills to create something useful
memorable and we would enjoy having it
allowed speciali the walnut cutting
board with a removable built in premium
Damascus knife that spins around the
board and makes cutting easier for years
the hunt for the right knife had had us
wondering about that perfect blade that
would work its way through all types of
food items perfectly we got our hands on
Damascus steel a historical metal with a
wavy surface pattern hammered out with
steel and iron and molded into your most
perfect kitchen experience and we picked
the most preferred wood for cutting
boards by professional chefs the walnut
which depending what has been carved out
of is of the finest grain selected for
its durability and for the splendor that
it brings to speciality
these two facts combined have led to the
development of a unique knife and
cutting board solution that allows for
easy cutting chopping slicing dicing and
even feeling of delicious foods such as
fruits vegetables cheeses breads meats
and more for presenting them in an
appealing manner with specially a light
cutting board every chop and slice could
be fast and straight cut as professional
chefs - the idea behind speciality is
freeing sophistication and ambience
together which will amaze friends and
bring something special to any of our
Damascus knife can rotate around the
board and does not just work its way up
and down but right and left is one we
spent a lot of hours finding a way to
attach a custom knife at a walnut
cutting board that spins it around we've
finally developed a built-in brass pin
we made the brass pin and knife
removable so when any of the parts need
to be cleaned
including the knife and pin will be able
to unassembled the whole system is
incredibly intuitive the knife swiveling
along the surface of the cutting board
in order to reach any food item that you
place on it when we designed our knife
we didn't want to have the unnatural
plastic handle so that's why we used
fine grows within our knives handles the
idea is to give value to good quality
food and using it with enjoyment if
you're happy when you're cooking your
food is gonna be happy and it's gonna be
more delicious our 17 inches long
Damascus knife can be easily separated
from the cutting board for cutting extra
large items
whether it's delicious pizza for a
gigantic watermelon make an
unforgettable impression on your guests
people not stop asking you questions
about your special a cutting board we
know that there are hosts and hostesses
all around the world just waiting to get
something like this into their homes we
are very excited to bring specially
Ollie to your home and hope you want to
please support and share our campaign my
name is Geoff barrel seven years ago I
got together with a group of really
smart engineers and we developed a
product called the Drobo with the goal
of making safe expandable storage
available to everybody a year ago the
same team got together we've been
developing a new product we call the
transporter the transporter is the
world's first social storage solution it
allows you to share collaborate and
backup files transfer files anywhere in
the world to whoever you want right
within the storage device itself there
really was no easy way to do the things
the transporter does for for sure you
could maybe use the cloud but it's
really expensive and the more data you
store the more you pay privacy's are
concerned who has access to the data and
how many copies of it are there how safe
is it and when you need it back you have
to download it all again so we designed
transporter with a number of goals in
mind
first of all privacy we wanted all of
the data stored on the transporter to be
completely private only you and the
people that you specify have access to
the data or visibility into what the
data is secondly monthly fees
everybody hates monthly fees and every
sharing a collaboration solution that we
could see had a monthly fee component we
wanted the transporter to be a solution
that you buy and you own - you know
exactly how much it costs right up front
data transfer solutions tend to be
extremely complicated we wanted a
solution that's easy to use something
like Facebook literally with the
transport
you just invite other people to
participate they accept the invitations
and that's it there's no more complexity
than that let's say you want to backup
your data today with a hard drive you
have to actually physically backup to
the hard drive and then take that
somewhere else drive it over to maybe
your sister's house we'll take it into
your workplace or carry it with you with
the transporter this is all automatic
the transporter will backup data from
your computer automatically and then
transfer it to another transporter
located wherever you want once it's set
up there's nothing for you to manage the
transporter makes it easy for even large
groups of people to collaborate on the
same data whether it's a social group or
a working group it's like one hard drive
being shared between a whole bunch of
people but you all have your own copy of
the data getting access to all of your
data wherever you happen to be in the
world has been a challenge historically
this is also something that transporter
helps with with our software on your
computer or on your mobile device you
can access your transporter wherever you
happen to be and there's no Geographic
limit to this either people in different
countries can participate just as easily
as people who live around the corner
today there are a hundred transporters
in existence everybody in our company
has won some of our friends have them
too and we're using them to back up our
data and share and collaborate with each
other if like us you would like a
private storage solution with no monthly
fees that you own and control then
please back our Kickstarter campaign so
we can make this product to reality
we
to travel whether it's discovering new
places or going back home to visit
family and friends however a long
journey can really do a number on your
body even a few days after you get to
your destination you seem to still be
recovering typically if you're traveling
on a long journey and want to get some
rest
you can either use a neck pillow or a
mashed up sweatshirt or jacket
we knew there had to be something better
than this and after doing our research
and creating multiple prototypes we're
excited to introduce the nod pod the nod
pod is the ultimate sleep travel
solution it keeps your neck and head at
a 90 degree angle which is the exact
same position in which you sleep in a
bed the patented over-the-top design
keeps your head from falling forward or
leaning left or right that way you won't
wake up with the kink in your neck or
with a bit of awkwardness from sleeping
on the person seated next to you the nod
pod is simple to use and works on all
types of seats from clean seats car
seats train seats and even desk chairs
plus the memory foam pillow is super
soft and the exterior is a breathable
and water repellant pu fabric so you can
be asleep for hours comfortably we
promise you this is the best sleep
you'll ever get while traveling in order
to produce the nod pod at an affordable
price with quality manufacturers we need
to meet a minimum order quantity that's
where you come in with your support on
Kickstarter we can make the ultimate
sleep travel solution a reality thank
you
