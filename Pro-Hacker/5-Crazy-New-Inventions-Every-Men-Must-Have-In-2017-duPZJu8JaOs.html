reaction ball with a moderately erratic
bounce that means if I bounce it to
waist height
it'll deflect up to 18 inches
horizontally forces me to watch and
react to each and every bounce but it's
not too erratic I don't have to chase it
all over the room
so I can bounce the ball really quickly
faster I go the more challenging it is
but it also keeps me at the best of my
ability and keeps my brain fully focused
my mind wanders I'm going to drop this
ball there are two core elements are
exercises to be done using the cue ball
the first is called bounce and catch you
take one or two cue balls and you bounce
them to waist height alternating hands
as you go you try to go as fast as you
can you count how many bounces you can
do in 60 seconds to keep track of how
you're progressing it trains I hand
coordination vision and reaction time
the faster the better the next exercise
trains peripheral vision if you think
about it the center of our vision the
one we used to read with is really quite
small
everything else is peripheral vision so
we can train that we expand our visual
awareness there's very little on the
market that will do that but the cue
ball does it really fast and efficiently
and that this is how it works
you do the same exercise again but this
time instead of watching the balls as
you bounce them you fix your focus on a
point on the ground and you bounce the
cue balls around that fixed point
they're erratic and they're bouncing and
they're small you have to track it with
your peripheral vision and catch it with
your hands you know increase your
confidence in the ability to do that and
as you do it faster and more your brain
will automate that skill so you don't
have to think about it anymore you will
just react and you'll react quickly the
cue ball adapts to any one skill level
you can go slow or you can go fast it'll
work with children as young as five
years old all the way to the elderly
it'll make driving your car a better
experience you'll be able to see more of
what's going on around you if you're an
athlete you'll be able to see hit and
catch better if you're a student or an
adult you'll just simply get better at
eye hand coordination you'll see better
and your reaction times will become much
faster by some cue balls and try these
exercises you'll be amazed at the
results follow me on Facebook follow me
on Twitter there's lots more information
where this came from
thanks for watching
you
people try to lose fat in different ways
some exercise some diet and some do
nothing
but are they happy with the results yeah
except for these thunder thighs
well this mommy told me is impossible
these handles done get much love let's
face it we all have those stubborn areas
of fat we just can't get rid of meat
silicon lipo the first targeted fat
reduction device for home use that
really works no diet no exercise simply
use silken lipo for just 15 minutes a
day and get results no diet no exercise
only 15 minutes a day that's right just
eight weeks targeting stubborn areas
will reduce fat and strengthen
underlying muscles so you can give your
body the shape you've always wanted
I don't know silken lipo really works
silken lipo uses the same proven
technology found in a large professional
light therapy machines found in the
world's most advanced and expensive
beauty clinics we've simply shrunk that
same technology into the first-ever
affordable easy-to-use home device to
make it even better we've combined the
low-level light therapy with electrical
muscle stimulation technology EMS to
optimize the fat reduction and
strengthen underlying muscles
low level light therapy is a proven
technology for the permanent reduction
of fat with years of clinical experience
in my own clinic low level light therapy
is one of the most popular it can
permanently slim firm and shape areas
without downtime without pain without
discomfort without the side effects
associated with traditional surgical
treatments when I first heard that
they've been able to compact lower light
therapy into a simple little home device
I was understandably skeptical but when
I reviewed the basic science and the
results I've come to realize a Silk'n
lipo is as effective as some of my large
body contouring logo light therapy
systems I use in the office that the
patient can use 15 minutes a day and
over the same kind of permanent fat
contouring and body slimming results
I've been able to achieve with in office
treatments
how does it work that is accumulated by
your body and stored in fat cells under
your skin Silk'n lipo uses specifically
calibrated frequencies of light to
perforate fat cell walls releasing their
fatty contents and harmlessly causing
shrinkage in the region once outside the
cell your body's natural processes flush
the fatty acids out of your system in
the same natural way regular dietary
fibers expelled to accelerate this
process and to help build strength and
muscle tone so can added EMS technology
this stimulates muscle activity and
circulation in the treated area speeding
up the rate at which the excess fat is
flushed out of your system leaving your
body looking its best Silk'n the
pioneers of permanent hair removal
technology shrunk down for home use now

non-invasive fat reduction technology to
