fun Libra turn one-click comes with
Bluetooth gloss one doubles of a
speakerphone has 12 hours battery life
and your splash proof grab your favorite
color today and get out there and
explore life yeah well I don't really
know where to start
Rango is probably the coolest cat on the
face of the planet
he used to ride up to work with me on my
motorcycle used to go to cafes to get
out it was a pretty cool relationship
and eventually I came across Raven no
stuck to a tree saying that they had
found this really beautiful tabby cat
dead on the side of the road I decided
if nobody else had found a way of
transferring cats and dogs then I was
certainly going to so this is pod line
it's the smallest and lightest GPS
tracker in market as an interchangeable
battery it's waterproof
it has bluetooth but the most important
thing is that this device can be
attached to your animals color and sync
to your phone allowing you to always
know where your animal is you never have
to worry about losing your phone again
we've spent a lot of time getting the
product design absolutely bang-on the
ergonomic design is really cool with no
sharp edges so it's as comfortable as
possible for the animal the app is a
really slick user experience that's both
fun and functional to you and we've
squeezed as much as we can out of the
battery life getting up to a week's
YouTube I don't know the inconsolable
would give off your dog not knowing
where they are or what they're doing or
live or so well he's that touch that
temperatures wander and then we rely on
other people to bring him back but we're
always worried that there'll be a time
when we lose in forever they're one of
the most amazing features that we've
developed is a pet League which is like
a social network for your animal this is
going to allow you to prepare your
animals results across the world so
you'll be able to determine whether
you've got the fastest dog in the park
or the most adventurous cat in the
country the Apple so allows you to set
safe zone alerts so you can actually see
when your animal breaches the set
perimeter through an alert on your phone
you know he just he disappears he goes
on adventures it's cool like that
just to be able to see what he's done
how far each dog ran and then we can
compare them to see which one's maggie's
faster so we're really excited because
we have confirmed orders from some of
the largest pet retailers in the world
we've finalized the design and we're
just about to go into the final stages
of production we really need some help
in production and that's why we'd like
you to support us in this campaign and
make sure that nobody ever has to go
through the pain of losing their animal
again like I did
more than 40% of our lives are spent in
habit for most of us that time is wasted
the secret to transformation is not to
try harder it's to replace bad habits
with the habit of excellence if you
wanted to transform yourself how would
you start first identify the habits that
hold you back
paired them with a negative stimulus
like electric shock
each surge of voltage trains your brain
and weakens the neural connection until
the bad habit is severed next replace
the bad habit with a positive one reward
yourself when you complete your daily
goal commit to a penalty if you fail the
fear of loss stimulates your basal
ganglia while the chance of reward
motivates your prefrontal cortex in
fewer than 30 days the action becomes a
habit
Havelock is the first system designed to
help you build good habits and break bad
ones earn rewards when you succeed pay
the price when you fail and experience
the electric shock that keeps you on
track
