you
it may sound crazy but you can do this
to all of it it's easy how do we know
because we've made it at DJI we created
the flying camera as you know it sand
there's a good chance that the drone
videos you've seen online were shot with
one of our cameras this time we started
small but you can dream big we created
your first personal drone but we're
still squeezing in big powers it
automatically follows you or whatever
you want without a bracelet or tracker
avoid obstacles and come packed with a
full case stabilized camera 27 minutes
flight time and a whole lot more
this is the DJI gatok pro and this is
the DJI mavic pro unfolded to make it
this small we have to rip out a ton of
cool stuff right now
it's got 24 high-performance computing
cores dual satellite connectivity and
all new transmission system with a 4.3
mile range for vision sensors and more
sound complicated it's not it's easy
the Mavic knows where it takes off from
where it is in the air where it's going
and what is capturing
when you take off the Mavic uses 2
vision sensors and connects with up to
20 satellites also it can remember your
location
this means the Mavic knows where home is
so it can return by itself precision
landing technology means it can land
almost exactly where you took off at the
touch of a button as you fly satellite
systems keep track of you working in
harmony with all four vision sensors
telling it what's below and what's in
front
whether you are flying beside a cliff in
a forest or even indoors just like you
Maddux T's and things that means it can
avoid the things in its path from trees
to walls any good flying camera
destabilization the Maddux expertly
miniaturized gimbal it's the entire
camera steady
unlike electronic stabilization we use
every pixel from the sensory and you
don't have the weight of a bulky add-on
camera shooting an epic tracking shot of
a friend is easy active track technology
means it just takes a few tap not just
one kind of tracking shot either
it's got spotlight profile and trait or
you tap light to tap and slot terrain
follow mode keeps thematic at a height
you define as the ground right so you
can focus on your shot and not your
height everything can be controlled
using a gamepad size controller you can
keep in your pocket it opens up to clamp
around your phone and has been custom
engineered to give you more feedback and
more accuracy you will always feel in
control if you don't want to bother with
the controller fly eating virtual
joystick right from the phone over what
whether you fly with the remote
controller or just your phone active
tracked modes are ready to make you
shoot like a pro want to be on camera
not behind it it just takes a wave and a
gesture then there's the new DJI goggle
strap these on to really feel like
you're flying combine them with sport
mode you get your pulse pumping while
you fly at an incredible 40 miles per
hour once you've got your shot edit

along its original flight path until
signal is regained every minute in the
air counts the new high-capacity battery
