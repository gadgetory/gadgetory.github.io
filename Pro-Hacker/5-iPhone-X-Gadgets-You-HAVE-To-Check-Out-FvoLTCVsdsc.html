what you see in science fiction's tech
fiction is very quickly becoming
possible if you point the structure
sensor out into the world you're
capturing the world it's like giving
some sort of a superpower to average Joe
devices what if you could give your
mobile device a new sense the ability to
not just capture the world in
two-dimensional images but to actually
understand it in three dimensions the
structure sensor does just that it's the
world's first 3d sensor for mobile
devices what I really am excited about
the destructor sensor is it makes it so
easy you can clip it to a mobile device
and walk around your world basically
pull your world into a digital form my
name is Jeff powers and I'm a founder of
occipital we're passionate about giving
devices the ability to see and
understand the world around them this
isn't about taking pictures it's about
computer vision and interaction we call
it spatial computing it's much bigger
than just us and it's going to change
the way we interact with the world let
me show you what you can do with them
you'll be able to capture every
dimension of an entire room in a matter
of seconds and you can send a model to
your phone so you can get any dimension
you need at any time you'll be able to
easily capture and send
three-dimensional objects across town or
across the world and make decisions
together even when you're apart you'll
be able to play games games where the
real world becomes the game world
structureworks by capturing a pattern of
invisible laser projected light which
allows you to measure thousands of
distances all at once the iPad has
arguably the best user experience of any
tablet and it was important to us to go
the extra mile to make structure work
specifically with it
structure latches securely to your iPad
it connects via the new lightning
connector the end result is actually
thermal design mechanical design
industrial design open put together into
one perfect object structures single
piece body is machined from high-grade
anodized aluminum it serves as both a
beautiful exterior and as a thermal core
that keeps the precision optics inside
at an optimal temperature what's really
important is get a platform out there
and see what developers do it you'll get
an SDK that lets you tap into a 3d
sensor on iOS you'll have complete
low-level access to the sensor and if
you don't feel like processing raw depth
data you can tap into the high level
api's if you want to develop on another
platform we're giving you everything you
need a USB hacker cable open source
drivers and even open CAD specs so you
can 3d print your own attachment for
almost anything new senses are going to
make possible new applications for me
the challenge has been in creating
three-dimensional objects this
completely obliterates that challenge
structure is the sensor we always wanted
add the panel through 6d and red lays
there so this is a team that can
actually pull this off get a sensor and
be one of the first to experience what
happens when your mobile device can
understand the world in three dimensions
everybody has OCD especially when it
comes to cables we like cable to be tidy
clean organized and put in places where
they belong to what if you don't need a
cable to charge your devices introducing
no cable the best portable wireless
charging station designed for your new
iPhone
no more stumbling over the cables no
more endless waiting to start up your
dead phone just put charge and go no
cable is compatible with any device that
means cheese standards whether you are
using an iPhone Samsung or Google no
cable always keeps your devices fully
charged to connect no cable with the
power supply and leave your phone
no cable charges your phone while it's
getting charged itself the premium
casing material makes no cable light
durable and easy to carry
it also features two USB ports that
allows you to charge other two devices
while charging your phone and wireless
LAN imagine a perfect day with no cute
wake up in the morning and throne okay
be in your bag use your phone throughout
your day to work talk and play
worried about getting a train battery
Masey cables at home and free up some
space near luggage
no cable is all you need for work
play in traffic
