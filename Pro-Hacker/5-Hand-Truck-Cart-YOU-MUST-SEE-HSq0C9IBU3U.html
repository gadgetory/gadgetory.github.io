demonstrate the power made advantage for
hydronic heating contractors we will
start with Department one a residential
hot water heater and this long flight of
stairs the power mate l1 is an extremely
rugged and easy to use general-purpose
stair climber and a favorite among
residential contractors watch Dave as he
quickly loads a residential hot water
heater using the heavy-duty reinforced
cotton straps by raising the wheels the
load is now easy to break back into a
balanced position Dave uses the wheels
and then the bottom rubber guard as a
fulcrum while opening and closing the
machine the power mate does the rest
notice that the load is always in
control while the machine does all the
lifting this substantially reduces the
risk of injury do the lifting strength
you can also expect to save on labor
costs when using a power mate notice
that Dave is moving this water heater by
themself save on labor while making each
job more profitable or simply do more
installs with the same labor force the
choice is yours

with hot water heater attachments in
vehicle charging systems and rough
terrain attachments for uneven ground to
