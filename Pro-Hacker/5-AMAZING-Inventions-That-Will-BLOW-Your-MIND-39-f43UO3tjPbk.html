waking up first ever easy thanks to Big
C one move and they can stop their alarm
and that's just the beginning they can
also control all kinds of connected
devices with simple gestures it's very
useful when Alex on his bike and can't
focus on anything but the road or when
Lisa is so busy working doing stuff but
she just can't touch your devices just
like them anytime you want to do many
things at the same time Big C can help
it's smart seamless and easy well easier
than cooking apparently no need to stop
doing what you're doing no need to reach
the device you want to interact with you
can even switch from one function to
another or from one device to another
with a simple gesture told you it was
smart and because Big C is full of
surprises
it also lets you control your
environment
believe me that's something you will
like well you know almost everything now
so what are you waiting for
even though we are online 24/7 for all
kinds of smart devices really touching
each other when we're not together it's
still impossible so I started thinking
what if two people could communicate
over a distance by touch touch is a
universal language and hey creates new
moments and ways to communicate with
your loved one and the great thing is
you can create your own personal meaning
for a touch what did you like to be
together watching a sports event say hey
good luck or say hey good morning or
just say hey I'm thinking about you your
hey means what you two wanna see it
can't get much more personal for me it
all started with my oldest son when he
was 4 years old and we start a little
tradition when we saw something special
first one we would see what's grease two
times and now we use it on all kinds of
occasions sometimes it's just say I love
you five years later the tradition is
still very much alive I wanted to create
something that made this possible even
when we were not together and to answer
this question we created this little
piece of magic hey enables people to
share special moments by touching each
other in real time whenever wherever you
are
hey creates a real natural feel social
touch is vital for forming and
maintaining social connections with
other people think for example of
hugging someone you love or even just
holding their hands or putting your hand
on someone's shoulder these are really
fundamental ways in which we communicate
intimacy and love for the past five
years I've been doing research into
social touch through haptic technology
so technology that you can feel and what
I've seen from my own research and from
research of other people is that there
are parallels between the way that
people experience real social touch and
the way that people experience social
touch through technology imagine that no
matter where you are you're always quite
literally in touch with the people that
you love I think that's that's something
really remarkable and I think it can
really change the way that people
communicate with each
I have a long-distance relationship and
I will have it for a long time because
it's my my own daughter I have a
long-distance relationship for a short
period of time it's not very easy to be
separated from someone when actually
really want to do is be together
physical contact is that the mainly
thing you miss in a relationship a
long-distance relationship would be
really nice if there's just something
that you can give him a little sort of
feeling like a I'm here thinking about
you let's run through this yeah phew my
my wrists twitching and they kind of
like this quiz and because like the
strap was like so you know the squeeze
felt more like a like a like a real
squeeze like a little pinch when
somebody's skin Oh
pinches you it's very subtle although
what I guess sometimes Jesus need to
think that someone is thinking about you
you know or that you are thinking about
the other person without need to say
anything else it would really add
something to our daily skyping or
texting it would be another way to stay
in touch with each other you just need
to know like I'm here thinking about you
at this point we have thoroughly tested
our prototype and we are ready now for
the next steps
