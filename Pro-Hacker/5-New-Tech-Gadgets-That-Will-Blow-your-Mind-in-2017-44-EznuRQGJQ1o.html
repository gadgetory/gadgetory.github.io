part of our daily lives and so as
charging it a cord plugged into the wall
gets the job done but inconveniences our
daily life whether it's having to reach
behind the table to where the cord has
fallen we're searching for the cordon
long the many that clutter your desktop
everything important in your life has a
place time your iPhone does too
we worked hard reinventing the iPhone
dock during the past 15 months to bring
you pure minimalistic design combined
with cutting-edge technology and
innovation to provide your daily life
with an experience that matches your
iPhones ingenuity the Lockean IO dock
the world's first might buy certified
duck featuring a lightning receptacle
and audio app the internal design was
engineered to precisely allow the
lightning connector to flex forward 15
degrees enabling safer and faster
undocking hi babe hey I noticed left the
kitchen sink on are you calling me from
inside the house maybe
works with thick or thin cases
interchangeable support pads provide
both vertical and lateral support just
use any lightning cable to connect
directly to the can IO dock available in
all six iphone colors designed for
one-handed undocking with minimal effort
undock your iPhone in one fluid motion
we set out to design a product that
gives your iPhone a place in your life
outside your pocket
okay I ride an hour I've seen I'd want
to run it for feel the other day
what if all cars had a single light in
the center strange then why do we only
have one light in front of our bicycles
introducing luma a 360 degrees light
system that shows your true width while
cycling it combines all the lights
needed on your bikes front lights rear
lights and side lights all integrated
into the bicycles wrists three different
lights at each end of your handlebar
never worry again about leaving your
lights home or having them stolen the
grips feature a solid core for easy
installation and lock-on rings for
secure fastening luma meets all the
legal requirements even in countries
with strict regulations such as Denmark
or Norway though it makes you visible
luma itself is almost invisible it has a
compact elegant design that does not
interfere with looks of your bike the
body is made of aircraft-grade aluminum
the same alloy used for helicopters and
airplanes
it's tough almost indestructible we've
paid special attention to the surface
finish anodized ultra sonic cleaned and
hand brushed for a premium look finally
each set comes with built-in lithium
batteries that are easily charged
through a standard microUSB board we
love bicycles and we love to cycle we
want to have a product that is not just
good the one that advances the frontiers
of visibility and traffic safety help us
spread the word and save the world
get a luma for someone you care for it's
not just the light it's all you need to
see and be seen
these are not just deer but their
customs perfectly fitted foundlings
motors of the exact shape of your ear
not the average here not a similar year
your this is what it's like exercise
with regulators I wear earbuds all the
time and I always have trouble with them
falling out I'm a marathon runner so I
need a certain amount of distance and I
get all sweaty they just tend to slip
right out
I love to have something that would be
more molded to my ear down will fit
perfectly few years to never have
stopped over you're traveling somewhere
far we're simply gonna round down moulds
are launching early 2007 for the WWC on
moulds com2 it
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
