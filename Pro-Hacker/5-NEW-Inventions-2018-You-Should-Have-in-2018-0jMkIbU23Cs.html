important without knowing it we surround
ourselves with a lot of harmful
synthetic chemicals our skin however is
not an impenetrable barrier it's our
largest organ and it absorbs an
incredible amount of everything we touch
synthetic dyes and textiles a lot of
breeding of pathogens like bacteria dust
mites and fungi which scientists linked
to allergies and skin problems today one
in four people suffer from skin disease
and the cost of treatments are
skyrocketing let's do something about
this I'm Michael Cole fond of izalith
bedding inspired by an almost forgotten
Japanese art we are going to create the
healthiest sleeping experience using
only three ingredients natural indigo
cotton and water what is I so mad
it's a Japanese art of dying textiles
with natural indigo we Japanese have
known about indigo skin healing and
bacteria repelling effects for centuries
it looks beautiful and feels great and
makes a yarn extremely durable
what's the aizome secret inspired by
Japanese tradition we use zero synthetic
chemicals in the entire process and to
reach a high fade resistant see even
after 100 wash cycles we use a
cutting-edge sound wave technology that
enhances the dye on a molecular level
and you know what's cool we use two
hundred times less water and
conventional dyeing and always can be
turned into biodegradable natural
fertilizer here in Tokyo we've gathered
a fantastic group of people with
backgrounds and dermatology textiles and
quality management we've carefully
selected our partners and production is
