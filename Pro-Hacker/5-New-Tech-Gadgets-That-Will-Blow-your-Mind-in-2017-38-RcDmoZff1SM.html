Electric skateboards and hoverboards
have taken the world by storm and become
the hottest trend among young skaters
but they've also had certain flaws that
can compromise their overall performance
remote-controlled skateboards are hard
to ride and the remote can be easily
lost hoverboards are generally tough to
Valerie
imagine afford to combine all the great
features and eliminated the negative
presenting the JCR board a genuine
intuitive electric skateboard the JCR
board is here to offer the easiest most
entertaining and safest way to ride
our qualified team of developers and
designers created a unique intuitive
control skateboard
who will take skating to the next level
we use the most advanced sensor
technology which entirely relies on the
rider's body to control the movement of
the war
you don't need a remote or footpads to
control this mind-blowing skateboard
hands-free just step and go
ready for the next revolution and 3d
storytelling
introducing Syd Syd delivers the most
stable 3d experience ever compared to
any other 3d video cameras today we have
researched and tested other 3d cameras
and most of them promise stability in
shooting but can't deliver shit is
portable for photographers lightweight
for adventurers and convenient for
content creators that lack of stability
creates a lot of dizziness and is no fun
for VR headsets
Syd promises stability making the
experience more immersive whence it is
combined with a smartphone and a gimbal
users can see the real-time image and
control the camera through the app on
their phones making the experience
convenient much more stable and even
more immersive than ever before you can
also edit and share your stories easily
understood application city can be used
to live string by simply connecting to
your PC tablet or smartphones
it can also add a rfx to your video live
stream with it you don't have to worry
about carrying bulky 3d systems it's
ready to use
in seconds and you can take professional
looking photos with that wiggling
background
it is a revolution
imagine how we interact with the world
but today we just mostly poke at the
screen fingers and hands are incredible
why are we so limited introducing vela
an innovative device that instantly
turns any surface into a smart interface
the world at your fingertips once
connected you will be able to control
different hardware devices or software
applications by using simple gestures
vela will make your life more convenient
use it to control music light
temperature or any other application you
have in your mind you are only limited
by your imagination
and you only need one valid device to
control multiple devices or applications
you can use our presets like letter so
read your own gestures according to your
preference simply assign gestures for
different scenarios and switch between
them just by moving your hands our human
hand is fantastic they can not only
field but also manipulate things in a
versatile way the current smartphone
technologies are just putting everything
into small tiny screen which highly
limits and constraint the interactive
areas of our hands Bello works on any
surface so you can clip it anywhere you
like or even design your own control pad
unlike other devices Vella gives you
tracking and multiple text to action
features so you are not limited to just
one action but if different patterns to
assign for different actions it is super
easy to use and really works for
everyone if you are a developer you can
try new ideas and figure out different
customized applications with our
well-designed API to track the human
gestures Vella uses a special sonar
technology that is nowadays widely used
in military cars and drones it transmits
signal pulses collects the reflective
energy from your finger and then
translates it into the performed action
our team has been focused on sensing
techniques from Colombia
we are passionate about making tours
which are just human needs by amplifying
human capabilities turning any surface
around you into a remote control enables
many potential possibilities in our
daily lives we have seen lots of
products in the market but we have not
found any of them capable to track and
to recognize with high probability with
Wella attracts your finger with the
finance precision and transform it in
the customized action weller
brings magic to your daily life
