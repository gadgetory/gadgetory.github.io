was so much fun especially that crazy
setting where it just shoots everywhere
I'm kind of sweating a little bit right
now within 20 seconds I was already
starting to make small adjustments to
how I was holding the paddle I was very
efficient two attacks started out and it
seemed easy but then it got so much
harder I mean there's something for
every skill level I've actually played
ping phone robots before I actually blew
my mind
hi Kickstarter I'm Alex and I'm Harrison
me and my brother always tried to kick
each other's ass while we play ping pong
so we start shooting first turnabout
with just a garbage can to just search
for us to smash but later on we find out
with app and software you can do a lot
more you can simulate games you can
create your own drills and the coolest
part is you can share those drills with
anyone in the world three months ago we
decide to join axe which is the world's
largest hardware accelerator we source a
lot of motors and we also designed all
the mechanism from the ground up to give
you the fun experience that we want you
to have we have talked to many
manufacturers now now the last part is
just cooling and Kickstarter that's why
we need your help please back and share
this campaign on Kickstarter so we can
bring trainer bot to you thank you

magical to unbelievably magical body

shy a pilot an industrial designer and
an inventor he loves things that fly he
wants try to turn his car into an
airplane no success shy Olli said that
his dream was to bring the joy of flight
to everyone few years ago he made a
breakthrough in the field of cool stuff
that flies he invented the power of the
first electric paper airplane but then a
friend of shai's told him nice gadget
really but you can't make a
remote-controlled paper airplane shy
took a moment to think and said
challenge accepted two years of research
and 57 prototypes later he made it
happen
Meech eyes unbelievably magical
invention power up three the first ever
smartphone controlled paper airplane
using state-of-the-art technology power

Bluetooth smart technology for an
amazing 60 yards of controlled flight
and a tiny rechargeable battery to power
this amazing beast out of juice charge
the battery with any microUSB cable AB
Sylar and his career as a pilot planes

pelvis ticks always had potential to be
a lot of fun growing up but the
technology just wasn't good enough to
let us do what we really wanted back in
1997 we set out to turn pogo sticks into
a whole new sport our concept was based
on the idea of having a portable
trampoline something you can jump three
six even Ken feet high on but also take
any where you want to go the v4 is the
portable trampoline we'd always dreamed
up with the v4 you have the ability to
add a remove air and completely change
the stiffness of the bounce someone who
weighs 300 pounds can jump on the same
exact v4 as someone who only weighs 80
pounds all you need to do is change the
air pressure in less than a minute
you can perfectly tune the v4 to each
riders preferences pumping more air in
to jump higher and taking air out to
jump lower this makes sharing it with
friends and family a fun-filled
experience that everyone can enjoy
you can also collapse the v4 to make
transportation a breeze whether you're a
pro or just stepping on to the v4 for
the very first time you'll love the
weightless flight like experience you'll
get the basics in minutes and from that
point on there's no limit to how far you
can challenge yourself with the v4
you'll be able to jump up onto ledges
down stairs and over gaps of all sizes
while nailing down some pretty awesome
tricks after playing around on the v4
you'll never look at your surroundings
in the same way again obstacles and
features that are too high for bikes and
skateboards are perfect for the v4 so
those of you looking for a fun way to
stay in shape the v4 will work most of
the muscle groups in your body and get
your heart pounding immediately it's a
killer cardio workout and the best part
is that while you're having fun bouncing
around you won't even realize how
quickly you build a sweat in order to
achieve superior build quality and
maintain the high tolerances necessary
for the v4 to work we manufacture and
assemble it right here in our Southern
California shop we work closely with our
suppliers to become a part of the build
process and as each component is made or
right there to test them
this streamlines are manufacturing and
ensures that every v4 we make is up to
our standards if you're looking for the
portable trampoline that we always
dreamed of v4 is going to knock your
socks off whether you want to use it
simply for exercise or to jump eight
feet high and do crazy tricks on is up
to you
and we know you'll love every second of
it join us and help change the way pogo
sticks are seen forever

start with an idea make coffee just
kidding I don't drink coffee sketch the
design kill the design think some more
get out the sewing machine take a seat
sit on it stop sitting start doing rind
it found it test it back to the drawing
board tear tear tear let's do this for
real machine it welded grind it reveal
it give it a leather seat give it red
stitching give it a shiny paint job give
it a handle for precise steering did I
mention its fins consonant get it in the
newspaper patent it again we're on a
mission to make a product that is not
only unique but fun as well when you're
sitting five inches off the ground
suddenly every tree becomes an obstacle
every ramp becomes an opportunity and
every corner becomes a drift
spin-spin-spin your way to happiness
find your path or your turn because in
the end it's all about the feelings and
the excitement this is what you've been
waiting for
