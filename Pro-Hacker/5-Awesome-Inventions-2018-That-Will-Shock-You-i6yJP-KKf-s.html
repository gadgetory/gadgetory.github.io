there you're sorry could work
at least one-third of a person's entire
life is spent in sleeping these figures
indicate that nearly 30% of the
population suffer from poor quality
sleep most of which is caused by snoring
every day about 3,000 people died of
severe snoring around the world lack of
sufficiently oxygenated blood can lead
to many serious medical conditions such
as hypertension and heart diseases
moreover snoring also makes the bed
partners suffer even worse here comes a
snoring killer too one smart anti
snoring pad actually snoring is caused
by an obstruction in the airway of
breath when sleeping
whenever snores are detected by the
smart anti snoring pad the air bag under
the pillow will be triggered to inflate
slowly
so that the users head on the pillow
will be gently turned aside
this action effectively adjusts the
users sleeping position to correct
snoring without disturbing the users
sleep
it feels like the user is sleeping in
mom's arms that always take care of the
users sleep without snoring super easy
to use simply place it under your pillow
the in bed subunit of the product is
completely free of charges or radiation
therefore it is safe and quiet
at the same time its mobile app can
monitor the pad with real-time feedback
and records to the user and among every
beloved one the whole families sleeping
health is thus well-managed
you
to one technology an expert in sleeping
respiration a promise in high quality
sleep this is a remote control with 49
buttons I'm sure you have one for your
television another one for your cable
box and even one for newer devices like
your Apple TV this is the spin it's also
a remote control that wants to replace
all of these and it has a grand total of
zero buttons it can control your
television smart lightbulbs smart
speakers streaming devices through Wi-Fi
Bluetooth or even infrared the
technology that remote controls have
traditionally used instead of pushing
buttons it's all about twisting or
tapping you can program spin to turn on
your television by swiping the back side
of the device and this is where you can
also jump around the menus play pause
rewind and fast-forward to turn the
volume up go right down left you
actually feel a vibration in the device
with each volume knotch
and if you've ever wondered what smart
lights are good for it's so devices like
these can turn them off on and change
the colors when you first start using it
you can program spin with an app on your
smartphone or with the remote control
that you're hoping to get rid of and it
can remember up to a hundred and forty
different commands spin faces a lot of
competition there are plenty of devices
out there trying to control everything
in our homes I've covered startups
looking at gesture control - tech
behemoths like Amazon's echo using voice
commands spin does have one thing in
common with remote control it uses
double-a batteries and unlike a remote
it doesn't come with your television and
will set you back about a hundred bucks
