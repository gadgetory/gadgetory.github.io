philosophy at a research university I've
invented a useful new product and well I
don't know

get tangled and with all that dancing

Goku Peter passionate dad told me to
stop I put hope to be the ghetto fast
don't competed falling Brooklyn dog
detected eclipse Hong Kong is a nice way
to flush a listen to the two-way you
love the gold let's go be a people
I've been traveling a lot lately we all
like to have fun but it's a good idea to
stay safe I don't go anywhere without
Robocop it's this tiny device all you do
is pull the pin and it releases a
startling alarm that can get you out of
a bad situation
hey guys I'm Jeff hi guys I'm helmet I
think it's amazing how many people have
the same experience with their ear buds
it definitely is you know an earbud
problem you know they're falling out you
can tell people are kind of pushing them
back in or that they're uncomfortable
they make your ears tender so we needed
to create a solution that solution is
your hook when you're running you know
outside or when you're working on the
gym you want something to stay with you
as an active person you want to achieve
that focus where you can push yourself
to the limit that you've never been
before and why be distracted by any of
your buds when you don't have to be and
we don't want you to think this is only
for athletes the problem of ear buds
falling out is so common so what we've
created with ear hooks is a universal
attachment that connects to almost all
in-ear circular ear buds that increases
their fit increases their comfort as far
as design goes we really looks at every
piece of your house as you can see we've
got a shark fin design on the top here
which we call the tip on this piece is
what disperses a lot of the weight of
the actual ear bud you've got the
elastic tire here which stretches on and
off we did a lot of testing me
relentlessly tweak and change the design
but we prototype over 20 different ear
hooks
throughout the process the testing range
from running cycling swimming surfing we
really tried to do everything we could
to make sure that these ear hooks could
endure with every environment that they
would ever see we were very thoughtful
in our design process each step of the
way we've redesigned and we've
reproduced and we've retested and we
know now that we have a product that is
passing all this test with flying colors
the same way athletes push themselves to
be great at what they do we've pushed
ourselves to make your hugs great at
what they do
right now your hooks is something that
not too many people know about but it's
really I do know about it have had a
great response we want to share this
product with the world and we can only
do that with your help we're hoping this
will be a collaboration hoping to learn
more about our products from all of you
we want to hear some stories from you
guys and you know really make this a
great product together when you talk
about listening to music it makes you
want to move in with your hooks you
