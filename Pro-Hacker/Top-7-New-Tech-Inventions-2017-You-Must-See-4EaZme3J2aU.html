at the French eco our goal has always
been to create the best products on the
market unlike other brands
we believe it's style that we have to
compromise function our commitment would
be to leave and the great success with
the world birth speed wallet have driven
our efforts to create an even slimmer to
smaller and more luxurious wallet made
out of the DES materials available this
time we are proud to present the world's
first carbon fiber speed wallet our
butter for luxury goods in fast cars let
us define the accessing the same stuff
carbon fibers used by the world's best
hyper car manufacturers 8.33 millimeter
thickness allowed us to go crazy in
terms of design we were able to make
just three to six millimeters safe and
just without a Degas of standard setting
we also chose this fabric because it
develops have 300 over time that makes
each - Union the complement is exclusive
material we decided to use the plastic
on leather with a fine to make it one of
the most brilliant wallets on the market
in addition to competence in all the
time it provides each your active than
any other wallet normal folding deals or
digging to find the car you're looking
for difficult angle the fact that were
able to factorize amazing features in
such a small design makes us believe we
have created the world's best one
hey there this is Alan with the tachi
today I'm going to show you our new type
C power meter what this will do is
measure power input or power output to
your type C device I'll show you how it
works here
so I've got my power bank and my type C
cable so what I'm going to do is connect
the type-c cable to the power meter and
then plug it into my macbook pro you'll
see the tsuitachi logo come up here and
on this readout it will measure the
voltage in volts the current and amps as
well as the current over time and
milliampere that's flowing into the
MacBook Pro now let's change modes and
we'll show you how to measure output
power so I'll grab my sitaji tub over
here
plug this in to the power meter then
plug my power meter into the macbook and
then I grab my iPhone and plug this in
to the hub you'll be able to see on the
screen of the power meter the arrow has
changed direction so it's measuring
output power now so again it'll give you
the same the voltage the current as well
as the milliamp hours so this device is
really useful for testing your
accessories and peripherals to make sure
that they're operating at their
advertised specifications this will let
you weed out if you have any counterfeit
products or any products that aren't
functioning as they should as well as
showing you if you're charging your type
C device such as the MacBook Pro will
show you how many milliamp hours have
charged over time as well as showing the
drain how many milliamp hours have left
the MacBook Pro to charge the icon so
yes that's our new type C power meter
hope you guys liked it let me know in
the comments if you have any questions
and check us out on our website to touch
net as well as Facebook Twitter and
Instagram thanks have a good thing

compact adapter for your macbook that is
able to provide all the ports you need
introducing hyper drive the adapters it

is ringing the morning officer that's
the sound of damage haven't me and my
friends had the same problem so I wanted
to find a solution it wasn't a pretext I
protected my ears but still meant I
could enjoy going to gigs that loud
music without feeling like I was
listening to music underwater
conventional earplugs are fiddling hand
call and not fun to wear especially at
concerts and gates because they make the
music sound muscled through developing
our ear phones which was successfully
funded on Kickstarter last year I
discovered a revolutionary way of
protecting our East I'd like to
introduce isolate ear protectors
traditional ear protection products try
to absorb sound from entering your ear
they ruin your music experience and fail
to isolate you properly from bass
frequencies when you miss out on the
details of the highs reviews making what
you do here sound very unbalanced by
using our patent-pending technology
I discovered a while I could create ear
protectors that don't absorb them they
block it giving you a sensation that you
are simply lowered the volume using
flower isolator a concert is really
something else you can hear every
instrument every detail play flow level
that's never before everyone who loves
gonna gigs and festivals is going to
love isolate they take out peach the
excessive bass which means you can hear
details at constants that's normally
masked and no dangerous ear pain from
sudden whistles or screams from behind
you in the crowd our bodies and bone
structure at like dynamic gumpa material
is as the sound gets louder your body
feels everything that your is they face
and the mazing comfort with isolates you
simply pinch roll and in turn they can
be used in any environment English to
isolate your ears one we use the highest
quality materials in the design of
isolate solid titanium and alanine our
entry-level isolate products are solid
aerospace condominium and our isolate
Crozier's solids are painting for the
ultimate air pres experience
cocaine is the denser of the two metals
and so attenuate sounds to a higher
level as you can see the isolate design
is finalized the milder goes now you too
can be one of the very first people in
the world to join the ear protection
revolution isolate by Flair lung disease
