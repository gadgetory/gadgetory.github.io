magic it's a 600-acre campground where
we host a lot of outdoor weddings the
one to 360 has been a really valuable
resource for us because it helps us to
create virtual tours of our property
with a street view style approach and it
makes it a lot easier for potential
guests see what they're getting into
before they get here
being able to click through the property
was huge you know looking at the 360
video tour just set this place apart so
much using virtual tours in advance
helps set us apart from our competition
in this industry I've been playing
Minecraft a lot for the last several
years and recently I got one of the new
Wonder 360 cameras to help me with the
in-game world design I built myself a
rig where I can just strap it onto an
old bike helmet pairs really easily to
my phone once I'm connected I can just
like take it outside into any of the
environments that I'm finding
interesting by the time I get back the
3d point cloud is waiting for me on my
computer and I can turn that file into a
Minecraft world right away the Wonder
360 has been really helpful as a tool
when we move into new builds and
construction putting the helmet on I was
able to walk around and make sure I knew
exactly what the designer and the
architect were going to see as well as
far as the space and what we're gonna be
working with what was really great about
this project was the property owner
handing off a 360 capture where I could
see how my design will fit into the
pre-existing landscape I think that
it'll help a lot with other landowners
in the future for their builds and how
they can more sustainably interact with
their spaces and it'll make a huge
difference for us as we develop more of
this property my name is Trevor
I have a travel vlog and the product
that is enabling me to
what I love the most recently is the
Wonder 360 hey I'm Jack and I've been
riding with a helmet camera for a couple
of years now
and I recently switched from a one
directional camera to a 360 camera and
with this I can see in all directions
everywhere I go I'm such a Luddite when
it comes to technology especially
cameras this thing's amazing it's super
easy I just pop it down because it's 360
I can make it follow her movements my
name is Zack I think acrobatics in
parkour and I really like the Wonder 360
because it makes it really easy to bring
the camera into class set it down and it
captures the whole room no matter which
way our practice goes and that way I
don't need a whole camera crew in order
to get every part of my run as I go up
and down back and forth I love that I
can live shooting a face book and it
stitches the 360 for me automatically it
works with all my old attachments and
it's waterproof love the cool filters
artificial bouquet tilt-shift classic
I'm Creek I've been drifting for nine
years and I just started using the
Wonder 360 the fact that the image comes
out of this camera is stabilized and I
don't have to modify the footage with
the computer is outstanding
I've been strapping the Wonder 360 to my
dog Shiloh she got a huge following on
Instagram her followers really love the
perspective that this camera gives and
in the city where it's a little more
dangerous I've got a record of what
happens if I'm involved in a close call
I can prove it I also love the Phantom
flipper it allows me to capture every
part of emotion and
easily analyzed individual aspects of
that motion and really show the students
where they need to improve and practice
I love that I can view and edit the
clips on my phone so if I'm on a nice
ride in the countryside I can come home
and recreate it and show it to all my
friends and the 3d mode is pretty cool
it's really easy to edit on my phone
directly from the app the video that I
actually want to share I love it

we love flip books they're engaging

started thinking about how we could
bring flip books to the next level how
about creating an interactive flip book
that you could bring to life with your
own style
that's how molecular DS was born Maluku
lettuce is not only a flip book but also
a coloring book and more than that it's
an animated covering choose your
favorite tool pencils markers
watercolors graphite brushes or
technical pencils the possibilities are
endless
after working on several prototypes
we're proud to announce our final
version is ready to go into production
we took great care of the details every
single molecule at ease is largely hand
produced and comes with high quality
recycled paper to prevent colors from
passing through it also includes a
protective slip case to keep it safe but
we haven't told you the best part yet
when liquid lettuce hides a special
secret a mind-blowing magic trick watch
this thanks to a special cutting process
molecular distant just feature two but
six animated sequences which will be
triggered depending on the position of
your thumb people go nuts trying to
understand how it works when the cue
lettuce presents a unique challenge for
people of all ages it's also a great
stress reliever and a perfect gift and
as if that wasn't enough molecular test
comes with a perfect partner to help you
develop your animation skills meet
Blanco Blanco is a flip book with blank
pages to animate whatever you want it

imagine an app that knows the best
serving temperature of everyone and
imagine a wine cooler that cools your
favorite wine at his exact temperature
meet kelvin the world's first smart wine
cooler
Nakul super fast is ultra silent and is
portable wine and champagne represent
everything what is beautiful about life
most of the time you enjoy them with
family and friends and they are part of
the most memorable moments of your life
but we noticed a very big problem wine
and champagne are in 99% of the cases
served at the wrong temperature take
scenario one you use an ice bucket you
put your white or a0 champagne in the
bucket and it becomes fast to cold with
red wine you have the reverse problem
you just put it on the table and it gets
way to one so white wines are drunk too
cold and red wines are served too warm
or scenario - you're the proud owner of
a wine cellar a wine refrigerator the
first glass has this magic taste of how
a wine should taste the red wine warms
up by an average one degrees Celsius or
two degrees Fahrenheit every three to
four minutes so in no time the wine is
way too hot the experts agree 100% from
top Wine magazine's to the world's most
renowned summer is the biggest single
wine mistake you can make is drinking
your wine at the wrong temperature
there's absolutely no solution today to
solve these taste problems but now
technology enables us to solve this
hence the Kelvin smart wine cooler you
can cool your wine with it super fast
coding system or you can keep the wine
at the right temperature with less power
consumption you can let the app do the
work or you can use the cooler manually
and adapt it to your taste you can use
the charging station or you can add a
battery and make it portable and last
but not least you can go super fast or
opt for slower but super silent cooling
the cooler can cool so fast because we
developed a unique airflow system in the
upper part of the cooler in the lower
part we integrated a 120 watt cooling
system with each sink and Pelletier
delivering the cold air flow for the
of the Machine by fine-tuning every
component we were able to deliver a
super silent cooling experience the app
meanwhile contains the first worldwide
database of ideal serving temperatures
more than 350,000 from 80,000 winemakers
we already recognize 84% of the wines
and offer you a 24/7 sommelier service
and you can use it for keeping your wine
inventory in a very easy way hardware
engineers software developers and
sommeliers the guardians of wine
knowledge all these experts were glued
together by our industrial designers
whose primary task was to integrate all
these complex and detailed work into an
evergreen design that fits in almost any
interior beer the kitchen or a living
room we're absolutely sure you will love
it so jump with us to the 21st century
and support our project we're already
immensely grateful for that
Calvin smart wine cooler your wine
deserves it
