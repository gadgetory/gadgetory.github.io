hi guys I'm Lorenzo hi I'm Carlo every
day smartphones are becoming smarter but
the battery life remains critical we'd
like to use our phones without the fear
of running out of battery
of course there are solutions such as
power cases and extra batteries but
they're either not portable enough or is
to forget we designed a product so
compact that will follow you everywhere
a cable the size of an inch we call it
in charge it's a very simple product
it's so useful that we believe everybody
should own one that's why one of our
main goals was to keep it affordable
a tiny product at a tiny price
we spend an average 70% of our day next
to a USB port and every time it's a
chance to top-up or batteries there are
over five billion USB ports around the
world in charge will fit into your
pocket and you won't have to fight with
tangle cords ever again thanks to its
remarkably compact design you can snap
it onto your keyring and there's no
chance to forget it at all we spent the
last three months designed the product
and testing the prototypes and now we
are finally ready to start the
production in charger will be available
with both lightning connector and micro
USB so it's compatible with most of the
devices out there we are really excited
about this and we hope you are too

get your own in charge at a special
price so please consider backing our
project and share it with your friends

your point of view from a new exciting
angle
I need just twenty seconds of your time
this is the eye pockit drive what does
it do I'll tell ya so usually people use
a cable or the internet or the cloud to
transfer their files I don't trust the
cloud with my personal information so I
use the eye pockit Drive and this is why
I can plug this directly into my iPhone
iPad and computer and transfer the files
from that device to whatever device I
want to the streaming for this is
immediate
I can watch video files they play right
off of that high pocket drive and it
works completely from there okay so I
may have lied about that 20 seconds
but hey you're interested now so let's
continue using the eye pockit Drive you
can stream all your music right off the
drive you can even export your own
contacts onto the drive and have them
accessible on any device you use alright
now that's pretty amazing but the
coolest thing about the eye pockit drive
is it's completely portable you can take
this anywhere you go planes trains buses
and even the middle of the desert the
eye pockit drive small useful and
portable hi I'm Jean with the power
company since January I've run two
successful campaigns on IndieGoGo and
now I'm releasing my third one for the
eye pockit drive I developed this with a
partner company over in China currently
the only way to move files from an iPad
or an iPhone to a PC or a Mac is through
the cloud or the Internet I don't
believe in the security of the cloud
that's why we've created this product
you can transfer files directly onto
this as a hard drive and even backup
files from your PC and Mac and keep them
on you that way they're safe and secure
as two reasons we're running this
campaign one for inventory and two for
further development of the app currently
the app is done but there are many more
functions that we can add
- this fog
imagine you're at the park relaxing the
beach soaking up the Sun or with friends
at a rooftop party or music festival and
suddenly your phone or tablet runs out
of battery with no power outlets nearby
we're all becoming increasingly
dependent on our devices and their
batteries just never last long enough
when charging your device on the go
using solar energy
you've always got power and it's
environmentally friendly so why don't
more people use solar chargers we
believe they simply haven't found the
right one yet make the solar tab a truly
efficient solar charger featuring
excellent Scandinavian design but you'll
want to take with you every time you
leave the house the solar tap sports a
big solar panel and a unique cover that
doesn't just make it look stunning but
protect it when it's tucked away in your
bag the cover also works as a stand
which you can adjust depending on the
sun's position for maximum exposure at
all times and after sunset you can give
your tablet another full charge thanks
to the solar tabs powerful built in
battery cell it AB the perfect companion
to your mobile devices</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
