founders are sparring athletes and faced
a major problem while exercising the
difficulty to use and carry their smart

prepared with an existing smartphone
while operating them multiple issues can
arise no feasible way to initiate a call
or send a text message take videos and
photos or even be able to use popular
applications on a small SmartWatch
display and thats how glove D was born a
wearable smartphone in the form of a
glove can do so much more than just a
