from the very beginning it has been a
family project
I started prototyping in my father's
garage and then my parents decided to
sell the house to help me to build a
real music on about six years ago I came
up with an idea that would allow me to
combine my two passions design and music
and this is how music on was born it's a
creative musical instrument for children
ages two to ninety-two in search of
inspiration
I took my double bass and instrument
I've been playing for 10 years and I
visited dozens of preschools at one such
preschool I met a little girl she was
almost completely deaf so she had little
opportunity to interact with other
children or teachers but as soon as I
started playing she came closer hugged
the double bass and she started
listening to my music using her whole
body it was an unforgettable experience
and I knew that I was going in the right
direction
studies show that every person is born
with some musical skills they just have
to be properly developed music is
natural for children music on is simply
taking it to the next level that's why
kids fall in love with it they use it
intuitively for them it's just a fun
activity but we see that it teaches them
cooperation manual skills coding math
and even physics but the most important
part is that they are encouraged to be
creative
music Connor is a friendly musical
instrument which works like an old
barrel organ it's simply designed
masterpiece made from wood it has been
developed by Polish specialists with
attention paid to supreme quality and
safety
you only need one instrument to create
the sound of a whole band it's fully
analog children get to compose
spontaneously during play arrange the
instrument areum changed tempo and even
improvised the set is safe and simple to
use for two-year-olds and up music on is
suitable for private homes general
education facilities including
preschools and any other places where
children get to learn and play
it follows Montessori approach what's
more we've discovered that music on is
also a great therapeutic tool for
children on the autism spectrum and with
other physical social and cognitive
disabilities since music is a universal
language music on is widely appreciated
by children educators and design experts
they fall in love with how well it uses
good design for educational purposes
during the design phase music on was
displayed around the world from
Singapore to New York and from Berlin to
Lima and received globally recognized
Design Awards we've invited experts to
join our interdisciplinarity and in the
last two years we've been developing
music on we are confident that we've
created a state of the art versatile
educational musical instrument we
visited tens of places we had hundreds
of children interact with music on we
saw happy open-minded some creative
children passionate educators and
therapists and extremely proud parents
when I watched my son today I was very
surprised because at the beginning he
didn't know where
then he started to discover more and
more about the instruments at the end I
saw that even though he's very small he
completely understood what it's about
it's really intuitive it's really simple
and for children is the most important
doesn't need any explanation tech needs
agenda music on soil formerly medieval
chamois tack bars or whammy a system
yes typically Amy disco music on spittle
ooh
the watch TV mammograms here - pickles
Nica as a societal good obsessed I need
for ruptures changes above it we believe
every child is a genius and with the
right investments that genius can be
released far more quickly than with
traditional instruments music on is a
giant leap forward for global education
enabled by simply pushing buttons music
is a universal language and we want
musicals to inspire happiness in
children all around the world regardless
of where they come from or what language
they speak and we're asking you to help
us make this project come true we want
to help children to develop in a fun and
original way and we're asking you to do
the same by pledging to our campaign
hello I'm Chuck Martin general manager
of innovation here at Bissell Bissell we
know pets and the messes they make
around the home and when it's time to
bathe them the messes they get even
bigger we focus on cleaning up the
messes that life brings including the
pet messes now we're bringing these
insights to the dog bathing process the
Bissell bark bath truly is the next
generation of bathing your dog a faster
easier and less messy way thistle
strengths are really around
understanding the consumer in the needs
of the consumer especially the pet
parent and we know pets we know how pets
interact with the household and the
messes that they make in a home and we
realized that people are very frustrated
with the bathing process and we took a
look at that and we thought well if
we're cleaning up after the dogs when
they come into the house and they leave
spots and stains in the carpet and
upholstery and we're never really
addressing the animal itself that is
dirty we started taking a look at the
technology and the knowledge we had of
both pets and cleaning and we found this
great new idea and this new concept
about bathing your animal anywhere in
your home so marrying the insights that
we have around the consumer experience
and around the consumer with the
engineering knowledge is the perfect
match as we know pets you know pet
parents we know messes we know dirt bark
bath is really important because it
gives the consumer a new way outside of
their traditional way of bathing to
actually bathe their dog anywhere in
their home that they want whenever they
want what it also allows people to do is
clean more frequently in 10 minutes I
can have all three dogs just just a
slight cleaning and the smell goes away
and everything I mean it works great
because you could actually bathe your
dog every other day if you wanted to and
it wouldn't be a chore where were before
it was HR to bathe three dogs you can
use it in your kitchen and just within
less than 10 minutes you can wash your
dog this is different because we're
actually changing the way that you wash
the animal normally you would wash from
the fur down and what we're doing is
we're cleaning from the skin up that's
how we can actually use less water
because in a traditional bathtub method
of washing your dog
about 19 gallons of water to wash an 80
pound dog we use less than 48 ounces of
water because we're much more efficient
at the process so our no rinse shampoo
is really unique because it doesn't have
a lot of the harsh chemicals that other
shampoos might and it's really safe and
effective on the animal are you gonna
give yourself a bath it was perfect
there was no mess and that was about an
hour shorter than what it would have
taken me to give him a normal bath it
was great and he dried a lot faster when
I first saw the product I thought that
there was no way that this was actually
going to work on Oreo she just got too
much care it really really worked good
it's better for the homeowner because
they'll use a lot less water it's better
for the homeowner because they won't
have to wrestle the dog to get them in
and out of the bathtub and it really
delivers on the promise that it's
supposed to give to the pet parrot which
is we're going to take care of your dog
in a way that's never been done it's
easier for you and easier for your dog
please join us in this new adventure in
caring for your dog be one of the first
to get your bark bath order now and keep
checking back with us as we'll be
posting new videos and updates
hello and thank you for taking the time
to view our campaign video I'm Jason
thought director of m2c innovation with
inventors of the hugely successful
potent brand but has taken the camping
world by storm over the last few years
pod changed the face of camping by
allowing tents to be connected together
and we are now ready for launch a quick
pitch modular camping version cool cue
cube offers quick pitching time of less
than 2 minutes straight out the bag and
fully pitched unlike other quick
pitching tents in fact like many other
tents in the camping world you can stand
up in all of our variations from the two
men right through to the format the cube
is an easy to pack away as it is to set
up and it means you won't need to be an
expert in origami to try and get it back
into the bag when you're ready to come
home one of the major issues with
standard tents is being woken up by the
Sun so with the cube tent we've added a
black lining to our material and this
blocks out the sunlight our extensive
ventilation system means that a cool
environment inside our tents the
material is PU coated and rated to a
hydrostatic head rating of 4,000 meaning
you'll be nice and dry even under heavy
rain condition
a heavy-duty 300d nylon material means
this tent is built to last for many
years to come the key to the cube is
that they're easy to erect and they
offer you a great space inside in
addition we have a few extras that we
think will make this tender in a class
of its own
unlike other tents you can connect them
together the universal tunnel system
means you can build your own bespoke set
up of interconnected tents on every cube
you can connect to every corner
meaning the possibilities to join are
absolutely endless
just imagine the fun a group of mates
could have connecting together these are
festive acquaintances securing your very
own party area as part of this campaign
we are offering a two man three man and
poor man versions of the tent in blue
red and orange color options we are also
adding some add-ons offering you a solar
panel that can be sipped inside the
window of the cube to store power and a
thirteen thousand milliamp battery pack
this battery pack has a huge capacity
why not use it to use one of our ultra
cool LED lighting strips we're offering
this LED light strip in white or if you
want to attend to be the party tent then
you can use the color-changing version
we've been developing the cubes for the
last six months and have finally signed
off a sample that we are happy needs all
of our strict quality controls and so
now we need your help to meet the
materials and production costs to bring
this project to life and with our
existing distribution network that
already covers the UK Europe and the USA
we know we'll get this product out to
you on time we've put together some
amazing packages for you to pledge on
and all we need now is your help to
bring our vision to life with your
and now you've seen it please share it
don't forget to use the hashtag cubit
