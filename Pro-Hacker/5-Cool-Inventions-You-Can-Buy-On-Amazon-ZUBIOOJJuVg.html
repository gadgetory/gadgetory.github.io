want to introduce you to a revolutionary
audio system called the arc one the arc
one is a sound system that sets the
standard for sound quality in an
all-in-one high fidelity wireless
speaker system the one stunning design
incorporates years of acoustic research
resulting in the creation of the sound
array module this patented instrument
allows sound to be distributed evenly
producing crisp detailed highs and
powerful rich bass listeners can
literally be anywhere in a room and have
the same sound experience it's truly
amazing our custom arc audio application
allows audio optimization based upon the
space you're in it uses the microphone
in your smart device it's the first of
its kind the arc team set out to create
a system that possessed its own unique
sonic signature an all-in-one speaker
that would fill your space with stereo
sound but from a single all-in-one unit
that didn't compromise quality or take
up too much space additionally we have a
customized digital sound processor or
DSP that restores streaming audio
quality that is instantly noticeable
the art one can be connected wirelessly
via Wi-Fi Bluetooth airplay USB and
Direct Connect over auxilary cable it's
simple to use and sets up in under a
minute
the patented sound rate allows direct
touch control of volume inputs planned
pause it's really easy to use and
extremely convenient
lastly the arc one is capable of
producing an immense amount of room
filling volume you will swear there are
multiple speakers in the room you're in
and if you ever want to add multiple
speakers it is multi-zone capable as
well
patema dark audio has been hard at work
developing the one over the past three
years and with your support we'll be
able to finalize production and bring
the one to market you can support us
with one of our many unique pledges
Thank You Kickstarter's we can't wait
for you to experience the arc one
the power of music touches all of us on
our smartphones touch and motion
controls have made buttons obsolete for
years at sugar we believe it's time our
portable speakers caught up that's why
we've created the sugar cube to create a
simpler more personal music experience
sugar cube creates musical atmosphere
just for you that's why we design
controls that let you stay focused on
the things that matter tap once to play
or pause tilt it left and right this
give for and that when it alarms snooze
is just one rotation away sugar cube is
a Wi-Fi music box that streams audio
from Pandora iTunes BBC radio and iOS or
Android devices sound quality was always
our top priority that's why we
customized a neodymium full range driver
optimized for its size we designed the
acoustic chamber and reflex tube to
deliver excellent bass performance best
of all this technology is combined
inside a beautiful wooden housing as
audio engineers we know that wooden
speaker boxes deliver clear and rich
sound it sounds every bit as good as it
looks and feels
this is Leo two minutes and she's out
but you you've been trying for two hours
I'm sure you've tried every trick in the
book like trying to stop thinking stop
thinking stop thinking stop crap I
thought or trying to relax
oh it's not that these techniques are
useless in fact they're actually pretty
good unfortunately you probably had more
important things to learn at school
this here is history
relaxing fast is his thing just look he
focuses on his breathing and he
progressively slows it down and by
slowing his breathing all the way down
to about six breaths a minute
he stimulates the barrel flicks a
physiological mechanism that allows him
to become completely calm in just a few
minutes and when it comes to not
thinking he's pretty good at that too he
can concentrate on his breathing for a
really long time and remain undistracted
by buzzing thoughts but you are not his
room even in bed he struggle to focus on
your breath for more than twenty seconds
at a time
actually your attention span is probably
more like balls than his runs
that's why we've designed dota it helps
you fall asleep by making you almost as
chill as a shrimp I'll have one of those
you synchronize your breathing with the
light projected on the ceiling by
focusing on something outside your own
head you'll pay less attention to the
thoughts that are keeping you awake at
the same time just like a metronome doto
helps slow down your breathing from
eleven to six breaths a minute which
helps relieve your anxiety and so in
less than eight minutes you'll find
yourself ready to doze off dota won't
turn you into a Buddhist monk but it
will help you fall asleep faster and
that's probably all you need remember
the last time your car's check engine
light came on did you know what was
wrong did you know what to do about it

engine light our sensor plugs directly
