wrong in our work obsessed culture we
assume that success comes from optimal
productivity yet no matter how much we
get done the world throws more and more
Adam how is it the more we get done the
worse we actually feel we all know the
feeling of waking up full of energy
excited to crush it but at the end of
the day we're completely drained our
obsession with killing it is killing us
we knew there had to be a better way so
like all good entrepreneurs we became
the experiment we tried everything
planners books apps seminars coaches
masterminds meditation cold showers
there was even a sweat lodge and what we
learned is true success is not in this
productivity it's a feeling a focus flow
and freedom and it turns out we don't
all work the same way because we don't
all work the same way every human being
organizes and processes information
differently and so we need a system that
works the way we do after 73,000 beta
users more than a dozen prototypes and
countless hours and development we
finally did it introducing an Evo the
world's first personalized flow system
it had to be beautiful so we spared no
expense on design copper gilded pages
full-color throughout and a smart to
interior layout but Evo is more than
just a planner it's a dashboard for your
life first you start by taking the
assessment to identify your brain type
so we can send you your customized
planning then use the Evo app to track
and measure your daily progress this
helps you recognize patterns and see
what's working for you are you happier
and more effective when you get outside
does your workflow take a dip when you
skip your morning meditation Evo will
show you by focusing on the right things
Evo ensures that you evolve and get
better every single day with Evo you get
more done have more energy and become
more aligned with who you really are and
this productivity is not the answer
it's focus focus equals flow and flow is
freedom our founding members get the
lowest price ever on eagle join us and
back Evo today

the adventure started in a tiny college
bedroom there were an engineer and a
scientist who liked tinkering with
electronics and encoding and coding and
coding one day the scientists noticed
that his mom often forgot what she had
taken her pills or not they started
thinking and came up with a simple
invention to remind people if they took
their medication if a smart box could
record the time it has been opened then
it could help users remember if they sir
take in their medicine by recording the
user's actions the smart box could
remind users to take their medication if
and only if they forgot this would give
users more flexibility to take their
medicine whenever they want with no
intrusive reminders with the smart box
connected to the Internet users can
track if their grandma's have taken
their blood pressure pills on time they
named this little invention the memo box
