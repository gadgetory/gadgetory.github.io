thank you
Oh
we built technology trucks those have
conventional engines but we pair them
with very sophisticated systems that
increase both the efficiency and the
safety of those vehicles now all of
these are potentially game-changing
technologies and will continue to work
on those but we wanted to push ourselves
and our vendor partners just a little
bit further so let me take a quick
moment to introduce some of our partners
on this project we have bill Kahn and
Victor Garcia from Peterbilt motors we
have Adam Hill with Great Dane trailers
and we have Steve Gillette's with
capstone turbine and so here today for
the first time publicly Walmart's
advanced vehicle experience what you're
seeing in the video is the powertrain
which is made up of a micro turbine a
battery storage system and an electric
motor moving inside the cab to the
sliding driver's door you'll see the key
difference that allowed for the more
dramatic Aero design the driver sits in
the center of the console rather than
over to the left the dash is electronic
and therefore customizable to the gauges
and performance data that a particular
driver wants to monitor and it's all
finished off with a full-size
comfortable sleeper moving on to the
trailer not only is this the first time
a trailer has been made
of carbon-fiber it's actually the first
time one-piece 53-foot panels of
carbon-fiber have been manufactured
looking at the front of the trailer you
can see that the nose is convex which
increases the aerodynamics of the entire
package as well as adding additional
cargo space inside the trailer my name
is Bill condiment manager of advanced
concepts of Peterbilt motors and the
program director on the wave project
we've missed a little bit about the
aerodynamics of the truck but let me
elaborate a little bit further you
notice with the center console driver
were able to taper those of the vehicle
anymore another key feature is that
because we have the advanced powertrain
we do not need to have the radiator and
from the vehicle anymore this relates to
20% improvement in aerodynamics over
melt over Walmart's existing Peterbilt
fleet if you think about it
20% aerodynamic improvement relates
directly to a 10% improvement in fuel
economy hello my name is Adam Hill from
Great Dane trailers and I would like to
talk to you today about this newest
technology at Walmart commissioned us to
build this piece of equipment over the
road trailer is made primarily of carbon
fiber material carbon fiber is about ten
times stronger than steel but it's
lighter than fiberglass and that is one
of the biggest reasons that it was
chosen to highlight the technology of
this equipment this trailer has the
capability of being fully loaded with a
standard cargo load it can handle
forklift traffic for backhauls and it is
100% dr t illegal there are several
technologies that went into this trailer
besides the carbon fiber which gives us
about 4000 pounds of weight savings when
SPECT
very similar to a conventional Walmart
cleep trailer
hi I'm Steve Gillette with capstone
turbine gas turbines were evaluated by
Peterbilt back in the 60s while they
proved to be robust fuel efficiency was
lacking an advantage of the capstone
microturbine is that it can operate on
natural gas or other fuels
this will help Walmart achieve its goal
of using 100% renewable fuels in the
future the emissions is extremely low
and does not require after treatment or
use any diesel emissions fuels the micro
turbine is spinning at high speed on air
bearings so there's no oil to change and
the turbine is air-cooled eliminating
the need for a large radiator which
allows for a more aerodynamic design
truck like the one you see here
behind every milestone and every
innovation in every industry craft and
trade there exists a mover someone who
gets things where they need to be and
gets them there fast
these movers make the world we know
possible our progress depends on their
commitment to a job done well and a job
done right they bridge our networks and
span our gaps where others the obstacles
that defy success
movers see nothing but open road they
know the ins and outs of this country
every inch of asphalt from New York City
to Los Angeles
they've long-haul to the Rockies and the
Cascades through the Shenandoah Valley
and the Blue Ridge Mountains they've
seen shorelines planes cities and
suburbs they've seen the Great Lakes and
cross the Mississippi countless times
they put tools in our reach the tools we
need to transform today's ambitions into
the accomplishments of tomorrow
movers jumpstart innovation they move
our dreams and our inspiration they move
our joy in our laughter
we move our shelter and our safety they
move the bonds that forge our identity
they move the common good we cherish in
spite of division they move the moments
we share with our families around the
dinner table they move the world with
what moves them for too long we've asked
the movers who make our dreams possible
to depend on outdated technology
technology that compromises the planet
we work so tirelessly toward perfecting
for too long we've asked them to
sacrifice their health and their safety
so we can have better access to the
things they give our lives meaning for
too long we've ignored the simple fact
that what we move comes at a cost a cost
to our environment to the movers to our
future and to ourselves it's easy to
accept what we have without questioning
how we got it it's easy to accept modest
change that's outpaced by the rate of
our failures when we accept these
failures we choose to fail the same
people who for more than half a century
have refused to fail us
movers revolutionized our world it's
time we revolutionize theirs
for those who bravely stand at the
crossroads of innovation and enterprise
for those who are prepared to give our
children a moral compass and not just a
road map for those who wish to leave the
planet better than it was when we found
it for those who are driven for those
who dare to reinvent for those who dare
to reimagine
this truck is completely anonymous it
does not need any other systems to
operate so you can't drive this truck
without any assistance any preconditions
on any infrastructure and whatsoever it
drives by itself it's autonomous
it it's a strange feeling but after a
couple of kilometers I'm very very
comfortable a few very safe I mean feel
very secure and I have to say it's
really fun to drive the truck
actually it's very simple right you push
that button and you lean back and relax
that's all that it's about
everything else is being done by the
system the system takes over and pilots
you tutor traffic it's just great it's a
good feeling
Oh
there
Oh
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
