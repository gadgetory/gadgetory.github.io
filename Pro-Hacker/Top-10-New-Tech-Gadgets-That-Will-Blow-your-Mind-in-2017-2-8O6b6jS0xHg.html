gun you must always be prepared have to
be trained you are your gun free when
it's not on you you want to know it's
secure and accessible safes are not
always accessible or easy to open
especially in the dark and locks are a
nuisance to operate as for smart guns
what smart guns are a dangerous concept
taking an unreliable technology and
embedding it into your gun is not a
smart decision our mission is to bring
you the perfect solution introducing
zorax the new generation of guns going
nor exes caliber specific has two modes
the first mode is awareness if someone
tries to tamper with your gun you're
immediately alerted and when you need
your gun charging it will eject door s
and chamber a fresh round the second
mode is when your gun is locked when
Zoar is locked
no one can charge your gun if someone
tries to charge your gun the locking
mechanism will immediately expand
preventing the gun from being loaded
special polymers in the locking
mechanism prevent any damage to the
mirror szura's developed a revolutionary
unlocking mechanism rapid dial rapid
dial is a simple mechanism which counts
clicks while you turn it you don't need
to start from a specific point even the
direction that you turn the lock doesn't
matter these two factors allow you to
unlock your weapon without looking at it
even in the dark you can choose a simple
code or any length code you wish you
won't believe how fast and simple it is
until you try it
you can also opens or acts from your
phone but you can only lock it by
physically pressing the lock button
zorax normally communicates with your
phone directly through bluetooth it also
comes with a zorb bridge a Bluetooth to
Wi-Fi router when plugged into the wall
near your gun you'll be made aware from
anywhere in the world if your gun is
being tampered with now if your home is
your safe and you don't lock your gun
but you still want alerts we have a
solution
Raziel watchdog

rather a notification device its sole
purpose is to notify you if your weapon
is tampered with
zorax with a census by veterans of elite
IDF technological in combat
we worked on it for two years bringing
it to perfection Suresh allows you to be
ready aware and see more than ever
before
join the zuhr revolution own your gun we
live in a world where one value is
prized above all of it freedom freedom -
speaking the freedom to move freedom to
live that's what allows us to chart our
own course to be who we are and to
determine our own way when you think
about the Internet why should it be any
different
shouldn't technology make us more free
in today's digital world you might think
that your cloud service gives you
freedom
but the big print giveth and the small
print take it away
whether you know it or not our search
for convenience has led us to give up
certain freedoms fries like ownership
privacy Commission when it comes to
cloud services you've essentially
uploaded all of our belongings to
someone else's computer so that person
or business could then turn around and
rent those things back to us all for a
monthly fee our own stuff
stuff that we paid for why are we ok
with that and you're not that's word
dapper company we want to help you take
back what's being lost our moments our
memories the music that shaped our lives
we want to help take back the power and
shoes how when and where our digital
lives unfold it's why we created cloud
by deadly
if the first personal home cloud that
gives you that bikini
no more renting out no more contracts no
more using your data besides them
because we believe convenience shouldn't
come shikaka
are you ready to take back your digital
life join become the master of your
exactly uncle
life can get hectic you're busy with
family friends and work everyday and
keeping track of everything can get a
bit overwhelming many GPS trackers and
beacons still left the appeal and
functionality for everyday use so we
came up with tags to protect the people
and things that matter most tag is the
perfect combination of form and function
traditional GPS trackers and beacons are
limited being completely dependent on
Wi-Fi or Bluetooth connectivity to offer
a very small range which had we've
improved on these offerings allowing
anything you've tagged to be located
anywhere around the world at any time
and because we know mobility is key tag
also comes with an app for your phone
imagine knowing a second gearcase read
their schools go home or your elderly
grandma sets out for the grocery store
with the tag app you'll be able to
define a location and ensure you're
alerted when the tag enters or leaves we
bake this in with several other features
to ensure greater peace of mind
for you and your loved ones we've also
spent a considerable amount of time
designing accessories for tags to
increase the ease of use and portability
we envision a future where tag helps
your everyday life not only helping in
your mind when it comes to your family
but also protecting a variety of other
valuables like vehicles sports equipment
luggage and so much more to build on the
future we need your help
we have the ideas to prototypes in the
Athlon comes ready
to need your help to get tagged and
every family vacation the perfect excuse
for doing the things we miss out on in
daily life going to the same Beach every
year cooking steaks on the grill

there are moments when we all men and
women alike just need to play with our
balls bummer

special effects engineers for the movie

two minutes three times a day for your
whole life have you ever thought about
how much time in your life we spend
brushing your teeth how many other
wonderful things could you do in this
time
I'm Aldo Domini Chilean funny in my 10
years experience as a dentist I got
clear evidence of how prevention is the
key in oral health but you would never
imagine that most of the problems
originate from an incorrect tooth
brushing technique today for us it is
unacceptable that children can make
mistakes brushing their teeth
the adults still don't dedicate enough
time to do it properly
that the elderly lack an effective
device for prevention we want everyone
to be able to brush their teeth in a
simple fashion but mostly an effective
way that's why we invented glare smile
glare smile is the first toothbrush
which thanks to three brushes
automatically removes dental plaque to
the correct way what you need to do to
brush all your teeth is to simply slide
it for ten seconds along your dental
arches using glared smile you won't risk
mistakes and you'll save a lot of
precious time in your life
I believed in this project from the very
beginning as I wanted to be the first
one to try Glarus mine so creating a
device which could improve our everyday
life was a fascinating challenge that we
engaged in the development of the
product by addressing the problems of
hundreds of patients and by studying the
correct brushing moves the several
laboratory tests and we developed a
brand new unusual design that 100% are
made in Italy forget your usual
toothbrush it is absolutely
user-friendly you can start and stop it
with a single button later but also
select many functions with a large
touchscreen display such as four
different preset brushing modems it
comes with interchangeable brushes with
the size for adults and a size for
children and has a countdown which
alerts when it is time to change the AUV
LED to kill bacteria automatically
activates when it is switched off and
the removable cap provides a mechanic
cleaning mode for brushes with
rechargeable batteries and USB charger
and a docking station it will always be
ready to use furthermore glair smile is
also eco-friendly cameras Ariana thanks
to recyclable materials and a solar
charger you can connect glared smile to
an app which shows you the usage
statistics in it for life okay so that
as a mother you can be sure that your
children are brushing the right way we
want to create a true revolution in oral
health to make sure that everyone from
children to adults to the elderly
can have guaranteed oral prevention
always we've already put a lot of effort
in research tested and in developing
many prototypes to create the final
product our need now is to build the
critical mass to safety investments of
mass production reaching the campaign
goal with your help will enable the
manufacturing of the first batch so that
you could be among the first to try
glair smile glare smiles will let you
discover how simple and fast it can be
to brush your teeth the right way
Claire smile the simplicity of your
smile
