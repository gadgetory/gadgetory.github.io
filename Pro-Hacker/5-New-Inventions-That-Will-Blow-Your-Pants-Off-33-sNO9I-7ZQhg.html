task which is boring and not fun that
was when we asked ourselves how could
encourage kids to learn new words in a
more fun and interactive way that led us
to develop wordy an educational toy that
was made to be engaging for kids
there are several features of how you
can use wording with a smartphone device
as one of the features you can use our
app to let wordy print out orders this
can be used as a tool for educational
purposes encouraging kids to learn words
with interactive activity the second
feature is using it as a simple drawing
board to print out what you draw with
your smartphone app
another future is inserting your own
words or phrases with such features
wordy would be a great containing to
help your child learn new words in a new
way what is a little toy it provides
something entirely new conventional
thoughts in the market the contents and
the way to enjoy quality is a limitless
wizard help we can realize our dream to
make a work available for everyone you
can find more information in the space
of our we look for your support
wherever life takes you carry the
perfect backup plan the portable
versatile talon by tactical modern life
presents challenges work sports
adventures small things can easily blow
out and become big talon helps keep the
small things small made with an advanced
composite technology and world-first
patent pending design the talon packs 17
tools and features to match in a
pocket-sized carry it comes with metric
and imperial wrenches and rulers box
cutter bottle opener and standard
quarter-inch Phillips and flathead hack
stripes the talon adapts to your life
simply swap out the hex drives for your
next adventure whether you need an Allen
head 30 stalks the Talon holds two
within its body a flexible elastomer
keeps the tools locked in place and
ready when you need them the original
socket design allows your hand to be
positioned as you would with a regular
screwdriver a feature that many pocket
tools don't allow the talon is made of
one of the world's most advanced
composite materials 40% lighter than
titanium and the strength of diecast
metal plus the material tank allows you
to carry your talent without fear of
scratching your latest phone or tablet
the talon can go anywhere you do and it
complies with current tsa requirements
for air travel the australian designed
engineered and manufactured talon
multi-tool by tactical compact enough to
carry everyday lightweight enough not to
weigh you down
heavy duty enough to get things done
talon in your hand
enough said two years ago we brought you
tactic as first crowdfunding campaign
the one bottle opener and now we have
our latest innovation ready for you
talon pushes the limits with materials
technology and functionality its
patent-pending design is made possible
by using an advanced composite material
this makes it super strong and enables
the unique unibody design that increases
strength and hardness
we've also created a dual-purpose
storage compartment into the design to
function as a socket something that
hasn't been possible in a multi-tool
until now we make the Talon in Melbourne
Australia and over the past few months
our team has worked closely to perfect
the design for manufacture it's great to
be involved again with the same factory
that produces our popular one bottle
opener this kind of collaborations make
sure that everyone involved has a deep
understanding of the project and the
high standards we expect having a local
manufacturer also reduces the risks
usually associated with overseas
manufacture now waiting on shipments
faulty products or delivery delays will
be right there in front of the machine
as they come off the line it doesn't get
any more personal than that
importantly tooling has already
commenced yes that's right we've made
the decision to launch straight into the
production process because we reckon
you're going to want one or two in time
for Christmas we're tooling the mods now
and we'll be ready for full-scale
production well before Christmas thanks
for the support and look forward to
getting a talent in your hand soon

hi my name is yasm Umrah I'm a jazz
drummer I used to work for major record
company music lava-like me live in the
city we always use the headphones
headphones gives you a good sound
mobility and silence but sometimes I
couldn't stand it
headphones are painful leave them on for
more than an hour and they've hurt when
running it gets uncomfortable and sweaty
I thought why not to design a headphone
and solve these problems
this is Lisa V shares
3d molded open-air frame design allows
you to interact with your environment
while you're listening to your audio
this is the first pain-free bluetooth
headphone it doesn't press on your ears
which can cause discomfort instead the
3d geometric frame sits around your ear
with minimal body contact
this allows airflow and makes them
comfortable to wear for long periods of
time B shares core audio technology
comes from Yamaha smock five module one
of Yamahas most advanced codecs and
enables us to provide superior sound
quality our headphones have an onboard
3-band equalizer that works with all
your music apps and allows you to
customize the sound to your own personal
taste
it's important that you and only you can
hear the sound of your headphones V
share is designed with directional flat
speakers that produce amazing sound
quality and yet focus the sound directly
to your ears to keep what you're
listening to private the airframe keeps
you in touch with the sounds around you
so you notice when other people approach
or want to talk with you and without
removing your headphones or adjusting
your audio you can carry on a normal
conversation when you want to be
undisturbed that V share headphones have
an interchangeable closed frame as well
for when you want to concentrate or when
you're in a loud environment each
headset is able to broadcast or receive
from other headsets so you can use V
share to share your audio with your
friends without disturbing others around
you we hope you can find places where V
share fits your lifestyle we partnered
with a major Japanese audio company to
help us manufacture the highest quality
headphones possible our plans are set
and we have a scheduled to deliver be
sure to you on time we need your help
we need funding to come as a call for
moles and tools for manufacturing with
your help we can deliver these amazing
headphones to you please share and a
backup
this is what I designed this year
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
