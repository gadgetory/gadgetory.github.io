Talon pushes the limits with material

by using an advanced composite material

the unique unibody design that increases
strength and hardness we've also created
a dual purpose storage compartment into
the design to function as a socket
something that hasn't been
possible in a multi-tool until now we
make the talent in melbourne australia
and over the past few months our team
has worked closely to perfect the design
for manufacture it's great to be
involved again with the same factory
that produces our popular one bottle
opener this kind of collaboration make
sure that everyone involved as a deep
understanding of the project and the
high standards we expect having a local
manufacturer also reduces the risks
usually associated with overseas
manufacture now waiting on shipments
faulty products or delivery delays will
be right there in front of the machine
as they come off the line it doesn't get
any more personal than that importantly
tooling has already commenced yes that's
right we've made the decision to launch
straight into the production process
because we reckon you're going to want
one or two in time for Christmas we're
tooling the mods now and we'll be ready
for full-scale production well before
Christmas thanks for the support and
look forward to getting a talent in your
hand soon
