years ago
I created Roomba small user friendly
robot that cleans home floors all by
itself
since room is amazing success I've been
looking for opportunities for other
practical robots I found a great one in
the garden
it's called turtle turtle is a robot
that eliminates weeds it's solar powered
chemical free and waterproof everyday it
charges itself in the Sun and when it
has enough energy it goes patrolling for
weeds my name is Rory McKean and the CEO
of Franklin robotics turtle uses the
height of the plant to decide if it's
good or if it's bad if it's taller than
an inch should leaves it alone if it's
smaller than an inch it cuts it turtle
has two methods of removing weeds the
first is a small nylon string on the
bottom of the robot that spins rapidly
to cut the weeds the second is the
design of the wheels as the robot drives
around the wheel scrub the surface of
the soil damaging pre-emergent weeds
turtle doesn't need to pull weeds
because it chops them every day even if
it's chopped weed sprouts again Koda
will keep chopping it down until it runs
out of store energy and dies there's no
mapping or programming required for
turtle you put the robot in the garden
fresco and the robot takes care of the
rest turtle uses bluetooth to talk to
the user smartphone there's an app that
accompanies turtle through the app you
can learn about conditions in your
garden and what turtle has been doing
because turtle cuts the weeds every day
the clippings are small so they fall
back onto the ground and travel up
returning the nutrients to the soil to
inform turtle that you want to keep a
small plant you put one of the provided
plant collars around the seedling this
lets turtle know that it's a desired
plant once the plant is larger you can
remove the collar if you like turtle
collects some energy even on cloudy days
and it uses this energy very carefully
thus it can keep operating through
extended cloudy periods turtle is helped
by the fact that we can't grow very fast
when there's no Sun turtle can easily
cover the typical garden size in the US
which is about a hundred square feet
given favorable soil conditions or sunny
climates turtle is able to cover more
area than that
turtle is round in short it has
four-wheel drive and extreme camber
wheels those are all design choices that
improve total mobility in the garden
turtle requires a barrier to keep it
from wandering away from the garden this
could be the edge of a raised bed a
chicken wire fence or some other type of
Florida we've been developing turtle
over the past two years constantly
testing prototyping and iterating to
make the best product that we can the
launch and kick started because we need
your help to bring turtle to production
with your support today you can be one
of the first to have turtle in your
garden because weeding sucks you should
make a robot do it I'm wearing here
today is the body guard it's a basic
concept of taking the weapon out of your
hand and putting it into a system that's
worn on your arm what makes I think the
body guards so unique is the fact that
hold it up Dave it can't really ever be
taken away from you like a gun or a
baton it sits in a glove and it gives
one the ability to to fight to shoot and
still have this this is a what we call a
non-lethal weapon you can see there's
plenty of real estate under the shield
here for other technologies from
biometrics GPS communications you name
it this idea was hatched on the back
patio of my my house where David was
once again thinking about other people
besides himself and it was developed as
a non-lethal weapon something that would
save lives something that would detour
deterrent behavior that could absolutely
escalate basically creating this as a
platform and then allowing you to embody
as many technologies that you can
imagine to make it smart and a good way
to defend yourself out there in the
world let me stand back just a little
bit there without days
Oh
what we want to do is bring the physical
experience of using the energy the
impact that you get at a concert or club
into the real world where you can have
it everywhere and anytime you want bass
is really the part of the music that
connects you to the music physically in
a club you get that big energy from a
big sound system if you put on the music
the next day and it's just attached
one's own which is missing that part
whatever music you're listening to it
adds a physical element to it which is
something that you're totally missing
normally in a home listening or
on-the-go environment people are pushing
the envelope of what they can get out of
those big systems
what's the way that they make decision
when we put put the based on someone's
arm and we turn on the music and soon as
the Beast kicks in they have this big
smile on their face because it really
pulls you into the music you listen to
it but you can also feel it in your body
nope assister intent this song is going
like more and more aggressive sort of on
the bass and you wouldn't think that you
know the same pace and it's you know the
same intensity that the bass that would
be able to match it but it is that's
pretty rare so I really feel the kick
drum which is nice and then like lemur
sustain bass notes and elitism and I
think that's really the power of it is
the ability to get that you know tactile
physical immersion that you get with
like sub bass and yet in the end it was
just fun I didn't want to take it off
you know the baselet has very high
fidelity it matches exactly the wave
form of the base of the 20 meters
for us the main challenge was no
technology existed that could do this in
such a small size so we had to create
our phone differentiate between this and
melodic bass line and card kicks so even
if the music is a melody and a kick in
between you can feel the difference the
drums you can actually kind of feel like
toms and kick and stuff I felt but more
what goes on the run with it inside the
baselet is amazing technology we've
built our own haptic engine which takes
up roughly half the space we've got the
other half which is battery to give a
really long play time and we've managed
to squeeze vo joints around the battery
and I have to get it so there's hardly
any room for the electronics and it was
a tough job to get it into this size the
base is really designed as an everyday
companion you can hook it up to a
smartphone to a computer you can hook it
up to a laptop or VR headset you can
really use it with anything that you
would use for for listening to music or
playing games or watching movies the
basis designed to be really easy to use
you just plug and play basically there's
no app to load there's no software to
configure ideally in the morning you
leave the how to put it on your phone
your headphone when you commute to war
when you act more whenever you want to
listen to music on about I think that's
when the beta comes in this actually has
a really powerful energizing impact on
you I think it's going to be great when
you're out about jogging or do sports
that it really elevates you can activate
you and keeps you going
one of the cool things about the bases
is that it hooks up to anything that has
a headphone out of it and so what I
tried right away is hooking up to a
synthesizer and you play a bass line and
suddenly you have that physical impact
or bass you can feel the beat of the
music you're creating and if you're a DJ
you can also use the baselet to get a
sense of how the music will feel on a
big sound system in a club as well as
for music lovers I'm really making the
basic for myself I want to use it every
day and we're already at this stage I'm
really really happy with that music is
certainly the most important content in
people's lives so whatever chance
I have to make that experience better
I'm good I'm going to use it I'm gonna
jump on it I wouldn't take it off three
other we are power practical we design
and make practical power products
Kickstarter is where we make our ideas a
reality and we're back to announce our
latest innovation the jewel the jewel is
a smart mug designed to keep coffee or
tea at the temperature you set all day
long here's the issue coffee is brewed
between 195 and 205 degrees but most
people enjoy their drink between 120 and
150 degrees that's a big difference
if you drink coffee or tea you probably
have a collection of the mugs we have
dozens and we tested them all ceramic
mugs cool too quickly leaving only a few
minutes in that ideal drinking range we
also have the tongue Scorchers insulated
mugs that keep your drink too hot for
too long
enter the jewel designed to cool your
drink quickly to your perfect
temperature and then keep it there to
the last drop setting your favorite
temperature is as easy as twisting the
bottom pick a spot between 120 and 150
degrees once the temperature set plug
the coaster into a USB port fill up the
jewel and place on the coaster the
jewels lid is just as important to
keeping your drink at that perfect
temperature as the technology that
powers it the lid has three settings
cooling sealed and drinking the lid and
the coats are worked together to keep it
just right when the light is amber it's
too hot with the simple turn of the lid
the jewel quickly vent heat and cool
your drink if your drink is cooled off
the light will turn blue twist the lid
to seal this will trap heat and the
jewel will warm your drink to the
temperature
you've set when you're on the go you
still mode to keep it hot and prevent
spills when the light goes white the
temps just right twist the ledge
drinking position and enjoy when the
jewels on the coaster it will stay at
that perfect temperature all day long
the jewels coasters were designed for
both work and play with two models one
for the home or office and one for your
car whether you're commuting to work at
the office your house or off to the next
adventure the jewel will deliver you
that perfect cup every time our
Kickstarter backers have played a huge
role in our company and are ultimately
what brought us to life we feel very
fortunate to be part of this new wave of
business and look forward to seeing you
all again please back the Scherer
project the GoPro changed the way we
capture life's most epic moments from
the sky to the ground to beneath the
wave however even the best GoPros are
prone to camera shake we wanted to be a
part of what makes ethic mode
unforgettable
so we built slick the world's finest
GoPro stabilizer slick sensors calculate
the differences in movement while moving
over to a then autonomously repositions
your camera thanks to it three motive
eliminating camera shake
and
from the beginning we didn't believe
that how to be a trade-off between
mobility and stability flick tips more
and attaches to your existing GoPro
mounts to attach it to your helmet chest
mount or pole mount just as you go to
camp
then plug your GoPro on click and you're
ready to ride with flick getting smooth
footage no longer needs to be planned in
advance the results are always stable
and amazing shaky GoPro footage is one
of the last remaining problems with
capturing action sports and I think that
sleek is really the perfect solution
it's light its durable it's completely
weatherproof that's something I've been
dreaming of for the last decade click
will bring your GoPro put a to the next
level of quality but us today and join
the new GoPro experience eumundi
solution and now you can make an even
better
that's leg
we spent on average eight times more
time in our beds and in our cars but for
some reason our cars have climate
control and can now park and try
themselves while our beds is paid the
same for hundreds of juicers at smart
divan we believe it's time for our beds
to catch up to the 21st century
introducing the smart new LED breeze the
world's first dual zone climate control
cell making bedrooms
well possibly the single biggest
innovation in our bedrooms in the last
100 years in addition to making the bed
for you the breeze lets you select your
preferred temperature for each side of
the bed independently using the
smartphone app avoiding all future
arguments about room temperature we were
able to achieve both climate control and
self making bed features through our
patent-pending
inflatable sheet place seamlessly
between your duvet and duvet cover no
more sweaty nights than regulating your
body temperature by leaving a leg out of
the duvet it's time we just sleep the
attention it deserves we all know that a
good night's sleep will give us happier
healthier and more productive
in 2016 smart Juliet amazed the world by
introducing the first app controlled
self-making panel this year we wanted to
make smart do they even better by doing
more than making the bed 40 we wanted to
improve your nice as well that's how the
smart do bed breeze was born you and
your partner can benefit from a better
night's sleep like individually
adjusting the temperature with your
smartphone you can even refresh or
preheat your bed a few minutes before
sleep to enjoy the perfect temperature
when you get in it breeze is also a
great way to reduce your energy
consumption by heating and cooling your
body directly instead of the entire
house
it will also eliminate arguments over
room temperature or who will have to
make the bed keeping your sheets dry and
oxygenated will also eliminate potential
dust mites in terms from the day truly
innovative and futuristic products like
the breeze need the vision and support
of the crowdfunding community to come to
life we thank you for your support
