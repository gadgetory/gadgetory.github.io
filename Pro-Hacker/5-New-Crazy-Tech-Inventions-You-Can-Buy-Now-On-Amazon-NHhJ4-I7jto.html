it's time to begin the vitae fine
this is Leo two minutes and she's out
but you you've been trying for two hours
I'm sure you've tried every trick in the
book like trying to stop thinking stop
thinking stop thinking stop crap I
thought or trying to relax
oh it's not that these techniques are
useless in fact they're actually pretty
good
unfortunately you probably had more
important things to learn at school
this here is history
relaxing fast is his thing just look he
focuses on his breathing and he
progressively slows it down and by
slowing his breathing all the way down
to about six breaths a minute he
stimulates the barrel flicks a
physiological mechanism that allows him
to become completely calm in just a few
minutes and when it comes to not
thinking he's pretty good at that too he
can concentrate on his breathing for a
really long time and remain undistracted
by buzzing thoughts but you are not his
room even in bed you struggle to focus
on your breath for more than twenty
seconds at a time
actually your attention span is probably
more like balls
than his runs that's why we've designed
dota it helps you fall asleep by making
you almost as chill as his room I'll
have one of those
you synchronize your breathing with the
light projected on the ceiling by
focusing on something outside your own
head you'll pay less attention to the
thoughts that are keeping you awake at
the same time just like a metronome dodo
helps slow down your breathing from
eleven to six breaths a minute which
helps to relieve your anxiety and so in
less than eight minutes you'll find
yourself ready to doze off dota won't
turn you into a Buddhist monk but it
will help you fall asleep faster and
that's probably all you need
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
