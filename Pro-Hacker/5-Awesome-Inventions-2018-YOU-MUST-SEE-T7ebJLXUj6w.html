ultimate Wi-Fi system see these cute
little guys they're called bees plug
them in and they form a powerful mesh
network
you guys have signal over there yeah
cool we set out to build a Wi-Fi system
for the connected home because if it
isn't already your house is about to be
full of things that use the Internet
speakers thermostats lamps cameras
assistants they sting so you can see why
the m2 supports up to 60 devices and
gives you a high bandwidth connection
anywhere in your home
but your home has walls and that's where
Wi-Fi hits the wall not the m2 its
signal is so strong that it bounces off
of walls and can even go through them
together with the bees this forms a
strong mesh network so you get coverage
and all those hard-to-reach places in
your house the bees are flexible and you
can easily rearrange them for even
stronger signal in areas you need it the
m2 is also fast oh yeah it's 20% faster
than the next best router out there
around double the speed of the industry
average it can even handle multiple
streams of 8k video that's twice the
resolution you have now actually it's
four times more seriously our easy to
use mobile app puts you in control of
the entire network so you can manage
users and get a full view of the speeds
across the system to avoid bottlenecks
like if someone leaves the TV streaming
you're always doing that
so who builds this thing Burcu based
outside in Toronto Canada our technology
has been used by some of the world's
largest telecom and Internet companies
but this new generation is even more
if you guys unblocked me I could Google
this for you and who's on your team
we've got a world-class team one of our
lead engineers created the technology
behind all modern smartphone antennas
another developed signal technology for
satellites collectively our team has
over 500 patents and has won numerous
design and engineering boards together
we're committed to building the very
best Wi-Fi hardware to power the future
of connected technology and we want you
to join us in building that future oh
definitely back us and get an end to
fast future proof Wi-Fi from Mirko
finally a gaming mouse that puts full
control in the palm of your hand
LexA is a mouse specifically designed
for gamers of all levels so whether you
play in professional gaming tournaments
or you're just a weekend gamer lexif is
designed to be a versatile Mouse for
gamers everywhere Oh awesome the mouse
is super smooth and this is something a
lot of companies can't get Alexa plows
easily allows you to perform complex
tasks in multiple dimensions with
increased precision usually you'd have
to stop in order to switch through your
items in your inventory but when you're
using the joystick you can just simply
just scroll through your items so it
does genuinely give you an advantage
when you're playing your game like
Minecraft lexif provides six degrees of
freedom via two joysticks and one laser
glide sensor it works by tilting forward
backward and side-to-side the mouse
moves with your hand and it goes with it
that's a very big plus this mouse but
actually here a competitive advantage in
gameplay the laser sensor lets the user
control the mechanical gliding at very
high speeds while maintaining the best
accuracy the tilting allows you to have
more three-dimensional movement all
within the mouse itself so you can
combine multiple movements into your
Mouse seamlessly it has a joystick on
the side so if I'm playing and I want to
zoom in to shoot someone it
automatically goes into the zoom mode I
don't have to like double click on the
mouse I'm kind of shot are they gonna
give you lexif shape is designed in a
way that buttons are very accessible
while still providing a solid feeling
the sides are covered in the finest
rubber enabling a strong grip when
needed it's comfortable it's smooth I
wasn't ready for it the lexif Gaming
Mouse also provides a separate model
specifically designed for left-handed
gamers what truly sets the Lexx it Mouse
apart from its competitors is it's
conveniently positioned joystick on the
side of the mouse along with its
internal mechanical two axis joystick
which allows users to operate the mouse
to tilt or to use as a joystick offering
two options in one this mini joystick
features mechanical feedback forces that
only regular-sized joysticks used to
offer making
this the first of its kind the joystick
allows me to go through the entire map
which is actually really cool I mean
it's great it's gonna make a massive
difference in big games the joystick
over here
Lexus control panel allows you to
customize and configure the settings
specific to what you're comfortable with
providing you with various shortcuts
and once you configure the settings you
won't need to configure them again our
goal is to bring the LexA plows to
gamers everywhere but we need your help
please support our campaign so that you
too can take advantage of the innovative
features our gaming mouse will offer you
elevate your gameplay with LexA
hey Siri call Jane Smith hey how's it
going I'm good good
technology has transformed our world
forever it's how we keep in touch with
friends and family I would share most
precious moments and how we explore the
world so we find answers and learn new
things invites us to wonder and ask
questions technologies allowed us to
overcome every obstacle in boundary
connecting people and ideas from around
the world uniting us and bringing us
closer together but what about our data
think about it more information about
our lives is being collected than any
other time in history every day we rely
on services that have failed us time and
time again from getting hacked to the
misuse and selling of private
information it seems almost impossible
to keep our data safe but what if we
didn't have to give it up at all last
year we came to you with an idea with
your support we were able to build
software and ship thousands of devices
that has improved online security for
individuals and businesses worldwide but
filter is just the beginning this is
beam
it's a router that encrypts all your
information at breathtaking speeds so
your internet provider can't see what
you're doing and services can't track
you it'll protect all the devices in
your home from threats online keeps your
physical location hidden so you can
access any part of the internet from
anywhere in the world it's the world's
most advanced router we created being
because we believe technology should
empower humanity not exploit our nature
to connect and learn your privacy
matters and it's worth protecting now
more than ever join us today visit the
