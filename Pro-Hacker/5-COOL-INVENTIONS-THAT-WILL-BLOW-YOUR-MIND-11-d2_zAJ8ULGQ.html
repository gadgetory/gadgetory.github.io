GoPro videos are always shaky and
stabilizers out there are too complex
heavy and too big to be mounted anywhere
at NU on matter we wanted to create a
solution that was so convenient that it
would become part of your camera
so we developed quark the world's
smallest waterproof stabilizer for your
GoPro that stabilizes your camera to
keep it leveled and create amazing
cinematic shots no matter what Clarke is
so small that you don't need to remove
your camera anymore
it becomes an extension of it allowing
you to mount it on the camera mounts you
already have just turn it on with your
camera and you are ready to go
mark is a lot more than a stabilizer
it's a real tool with built-in moving
time-lapse feature to brings a new way
of creating content and empowering you
to be more creative
developed by engineers and athletes we
went through many iterations of
prototypes to develop a product
optimized for your camera
together let's start a new era in
personal video making so we are now
ready to bring that product to market
but we need your help so focus today any
questions from the way you create
hi I'm Jason McKeon
doctor neuroscientist and co-founder of
Morris I love helping people improve
their lives and I'm super passionate
about weight loss
I've been over we in the past and I know
how difficult it is to lose weight I
also know how difficult it is to keep
that we at loss going am odious we
believe this is much more than just diet
and exercise the source of your weight
loss problem lies deep within your brain
my co-founder is dr. Paul McGill and a
few years ago he made an amazing
discovery our brains have what's called
a set point that controls how much body
fat we have this varies from person to
person which is why two people can eat
the same and one will gain weight while
the other one and the implications of
this are profound a few years ago I
realized that there was a connection
between stimulation of the vestibular
nerve just behind your ear and weight
loss I was working in neurosurgery with
Jason at the time and knew of his
interest in electronics as a hobby from
the very beginning I've been using and
developing the moodiest prototypes on
myself within just one year my body fat
had almost halves and now almost one
year later I still haven't regained any
fat this technology has amazing
potential and we're inviting you to join
us at the more dias community we want
you to be the first group of people who
take part in the next generation of
weight loss mo Dias is really simple to
use just place it on your head
attach the sticky pads behind your ears
turn the headset on and then control it
using the app simple
use mo Deus for just 45 minutes per
session and that's it and the results
well the technology was tasted in
overweight volunteers they didn't change
their diet or lifestyle and received up
to three hours of stimulation a week
after four months we found that all of
the volunteers lost body fat in one case
as much as 16% statistically these
results were very significant we're
delighted by these initial results and
actually can't wait to see how effective
Moody's will be when combined with some
lifestyle changes after five years of
clinical research and many shed pounds
we are finally ready to release modest
we are very excited to see your results
and to help you get there we are
offering our early backers great
discounts a complete 12-week package and
up to one hundred dollars in cash back
in fact we are so confident of amazing
results we are offering a 100%
money-back guarantee our Plautius we
believe this is the next generation of
we at lost technology so join the
moodiest community today and let's get
started in that journey to a happier
healthier you
for so long technology has been held
back by one important thing emotion
that's why we created oli the first
robot assistant with an evolving
personality and the deep breath outwards
let the stress all away Megan I would
suggest raising the temperature by 10
degrees hot yoga can increase weight
loss and build muscle tone let's do it
not a problem at all oli is proactive
meaning it anticipates your needs just a
thought
Megan shall I set the mood with some
jazz while you read yeah music through
oli sounds amazing too because it knows
where you are in the room it can best
direct the audio to your liking no
matter the track and no matter the mood
oli always keeps us one step ahead
looking sharp den traffic is very heavy
today
you should leave in the next two minutes
to make your meeting on time thanks Ali
it's also going to rain at end a.m.
don't forget your umbrella your
schedules your reminders and everything
else
oli remembers happy birthday to you
happy birthday to you happy birthday Dan
our AI system and character engine
creates a unique personality for every
Olli
that means each one will relate to you
in a distinctive way go go go one more
Kevin and you hit your target for the
day well done good morning Angela
it's time to wake up
uh-uh Alex you do know you need to work
out for an extra 15 minutes to burn that
off right and a wide smart vision camera
that detects our own emotions hey Ryan
long day for which I think a bit of air
guitar therapy might do the trick
the Ottawa started with mission to
change human relationships with
technology all is the first robot a
system with evolving personality people
are different
how one is unique and so we sell robot
our team is also made up of incredibly
diverse group of people we bring the
best talents from AI
Neron science engineering robotics
design and animation that avoids life
into a robot we've also been fortunate
enough to work with some top professors
in their respective field Ali's the
first robotics product that has won four
Innovation Awards in CES we do that in
2017 we've come a long way and iterated
quite a bit through our journey now we
are ready to manufacture at a large
scale and we need your help to take all
it to the next stage of production okay
time to join us and we know we are Mouse
and we've designed a phone case that can
do this is my iPhone 7 ready and they
look like this
we found that slim phone cases weren't
that protective and protective phone
cases are ugly so we designed a lot of
phone cases carbon-fibre ones metal ones
curved ones wooden ones leather ones you
name it we designed it and we tested
them on real iPhones some survived
always worse
and some didn't did go expensive but in
the end we did it
introducing limitless by Mouse a slim
phone case with serious engineering that
hasn't compromised on looks walnut
bamboo black marble black leather matte
grey Kevlar carbon fiber this is
London's Waterloo Bridge a 35 foot drop
here we go not even a scratch how
because we've engineered an advanced
impact material aero shock it's inside
all our phone cases this unique polymer
contains thousands of micro air pockets
that absorb the impact the ball bearing
the drop some regular plastic bounces
but on arrow shock the energy is
absorbed the same thing happens in our
phone cases all our cases are seriously
protective so protective we've dropped
it from a crane onto concrete from 45
feet
all our cases have a steel plate built
into the back and they come with a free
magnetic wall mount for backers they fit
both the iPhone 6 and 7 so you don't
have to upgrade your case the same
applies for the six plus and the 7 plus
here you can see our tools making our
cases using our own materials the
IndieGoGo right now okay okay
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
