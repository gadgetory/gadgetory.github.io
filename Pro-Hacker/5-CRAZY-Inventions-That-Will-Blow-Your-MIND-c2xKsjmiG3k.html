dream to interact with the virtual world
in a natural way use your hands your
feet your whole body and a couple of
years ago I came across prosthesis
that's when we decided to come together
and found a company the system works by
combining multiple sensor types by
actually taking the best features of
each sensors and combine them fuse them
in a certain way that we actually have a
very precise system and which allows you
to fully immerse in the in virtual
content
the most important feature that we
wanted our system to have is the very
precise tracking of the hand not only
position but also finger movements we
think that our technology will
revolutionize virtual reality because it
really makes interaction natural so you
don't have to learn the buttons of
control but you really can use your
hands to interact with virtual reality
our system actually is the only one
right now that is mobile that allows you
to use your hands the hand might not
always be in the line of sight so it
might manipulate something which is out
of of your reel basically we wanted to
have the possibility to incorporate
different movements as well as or even
foot steps to actually move in the
virtual reality immersion is
particularly important because it
connects the user to the virtual reality
so you're not just playing you avatar
you really become data
augmented reality will certainly enrich
our lives by adding information in your
surrounding you are actually not changed
to any location or computer you can take
it everywhere and let virtual
information pop up you can then interact
with this information
my ambition for sensor X is that we get
this the system out in the in the field
and actually let people use it to
immerse into virtual reality the dream
for motion capture I think has been out
there for a long time and now finally
with the Ascension of head mounted
devices different types of sensors and
experts like Nikko and roll I think we
have reached a level where you can
actually implement it it is really a
paradigm change that can really change
the way we interact with electronics and
and computers this is your life without
blue bow this is your life with him this
is your life with a bow we do bow using
your phone or tablet anywhere as
effortless
introducing inb arrow to the world's
first designer oxygen purifier it's your
personal portable oxygen friend we've

carbon dioxide as the day goes on oxygen

healthy 21 percent to a sleep-inducing
17 percent and we are hit with the
dreaded two o'clock slump we overdose on

Dyanne b ro 2 is not I repeat NOT a
medical oxygen concentrator and should
not be purchased mining when needing
oxygen for medical conditions if you

consult your doctor before use

up on oxygen
anytime inb arrow to feed your brain and
