something comes along that works so damn
well that you don't need to fuss over
appearances it reminds us that above all
else we just want something useful
Jason freed said you need to get the
fundamentals right fun wears off cool
wears off useful never wears off
when we're rolling down the highway of
our lives what is it we want people to
see a rebel a trendsetter a man of
wealth and taste there's a funny old
saying from Mark Twain that goes clothes
make the man naked people have little or
no influence in society
but sometimes designers come along who
are the rebels they remind us that above
all else we just want something that can
be used
you
just because they're cool yep
[Laughter]
it's fine do whatever you want that is
awesome
[Laughter]
that's awesome
yeah thank you I kind of sort of cool
a really big knives to put a little tiny
oh yeah
[Laughter]
hold that throw it again keep it okay
[Laughter]
you
hey guys it's Mike from outdoor element
and we love some carabiners they come in
a variety of shapes and sizes they're
that third hand that you can rely on and
they've been around for a while they've
evolved over the years and as the
adventure type we wanted to develop an
everyday beater that can help you out
when things get crazy all introducing
the fighter beaner understanding that
fire creation is crucial in times of
emergency we've introduced our ever
spark technology to the bener sometimes
all you need is a spark to totally
change the situation designed to be
titanium coated stainless steel and at 1
ounce this should be part of everyone's
everyday carry
we integrated a blade for those ad hoc
moments paracord fishing line
perhaps a seatbelt
and of course a bottle opener for those
moments of celebration
we've partnered up with SolidWorks with
their entrepreneurial program to develop
the fire beaner for an ergonomic design
for stress analysis and for overall
manufacturability so go on
slap under a key chain or put on your
pack and always be prepared we have our
manufacturer set up and our first set of
prototypes have been approved and now
we're asking for your help to help
launch our first production run to bring
the fire beaner into your hands and to
your adventure and all the features of
the fire beaner come in handy day in and
day out
so get those grills and stoves lit clean
up those loose ends and get the backyard
ready
so please back this project you'll thank
yourself later
camping backpacking hiking just being in
the outdoors gives us a chance for
adventure and of course the opportunity
to buy some really cool gear here at
bare minimum we love innovation and
we're changing the way you eat outdoors
camping has significantly evolved over
the years the sleeping bag has gone from
big and bulky to small and light the
lantern has gone from heavy and
dangerous to light and bright the cook
pot has gone from this to this cooking
on the trail hasn't changed much than
till now introducing the bear bowl a
super lightweight collapsible cooking
pot designed for hikers backpackers and
Preppers it's made of a food grade flame
resistant material the deceptively small
container can fit 32 ounces of water the
four inch base makes it easy to use with
a variety of heating sources we chose an
aluminum base because of the heat
resistance durability and weight so
you're asking yourself why do I need one
of these well let me tell you it's about
the size of your wallet and it weighs
less than the cellphone
hello mr. bear with four folds and two
snaps it's so simple to put together you
can even do it during a bear attack
barring any unfortunate bear attacks you
can take your bear Bowl from flat to
cook in no time
well at least as fast as it takes a bear
to get coffee at a drive-thru simply
reverse the process and you can take
your bear Bowl back to flat and ready to
pack clean up on the trail can be a real
bear but not with the bear bowl simply
open the bear ball flat and wipe it

clean the barrel than any other ball on

great product and we're really excited
