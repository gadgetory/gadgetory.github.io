all from Sara turn left in 20 miles

like tomorrow it really really does it
feels like tomorrow you've taken all

high-tech cars and just put it right
here honestly it's it's gonna change
everything when you put on a Scully
helmet you get any essentially an
ecosystem assuage it generally resulting
into a much more yeah

innovation that you had then fold about
before being a professional motorcycle

rayful from riding on the studio but
this could make a fun again it will make
your riding safer with its high-speed
microprocessor and operating system it's
the smartest motorcycle helmet ever
imagined Scully is the future
join the revolution
if anything in this life is searched hey
guys if you're watching this more than
likely you're someone who lives life on
two wheels for me riding a motorcycle is
more than a hobby and a bike is more
than a toy living in LA I ride my
motorcycle every day and I depend on it
for almost all my transportation riding
in a city infamous for traffic has made
me a better rider but it's also made me
aware that there are some idiots out
there who aren't looking out for you so
you got to look out for yourself knowing
that a teenager sending a text could
bring me down someday I set out looking
for some solid protective but what I
found was frustrating let's just say
high visibility jackets and baggy mom
jeans don't really jive too well with
the custom bobber
vintage bike and cafe racer aesthetic
that I personally prefer you shouldn't
have to sacrifice style for safety
tobacco motor wear company wants to
change all that we're about bringing you
premium quality american-made motor wear
in classic styles that look awesome on
and off the bike and we're starting with
tobacco's Kevlar lined 5-pocket jean
when you put on a pair of tobacco's you
will notice that they look and feel like
a kick-ass pair of jeans like you might
already wear day to day or when you're
out on a ride with your buddies they
represent the best of American
manufacturing fabrics and LA design but
inside every pair of tobacco's is over
half a yard of 100% DuPont Kevlar Kevlar
is one of the strongest fabrics in the
world and is remarkably resistant to
abrasion puncture and heat our Kevlar
lining covers all your high abrasion
areas from your waist to your shin past
the knee and we cover your rear and back
the lining is sewn directly into the
seam of the jeans so you don't have any
cross seems like you do in other Kevlar
jeans brands our jeans are modeled after
classic American brands like Levi's and
Lee and come to you in a perfectly
proportioned slim straight cut no frills
or fancy washes begging for attention
our jeans are built to last made in the
USA using durable selvage denim we use
eco-friendly raw fabrics that haven't
been washed or distressed in any way
back in the day this is how all jeans
started out and as you put your tobaccos
through the thick and thin of your daily
grind
they will evolve to become a perfectly
fitted second skin a hundred percent
unique to you and here's the best part
using social media we want to
crowdsource our products and allow you
to help us decide which styles go into
production by pre-ordering here on
Kickstarter you allow us to cut down on
overhead and skip the retail step so you
can get the best style Kevlar lined
motorcycle jeans at our wholesale price
just two hundred and forty dollars every
pair of jeans comes in our durable
blank canvas tobacco pouch feel free to
store your jeans in here but for those
of you with a little more imagination
you can upcycle your pouch put a strap
on it to make it a messenger bag or put
some ties on it and make it a retro
saddle bag you can wax it stain it make
it a tool roll it literally is a blank
canvas for you to make your
we can't do this without your support
our initial goal of 20,000 dollars will
allow us to produce our first run of
tobacco genes for $40,000 we can offer
you a choice of additional fabrics and
colors we are asking you to help us
build tobacco motor wear company and in
recognition of that help all the weather
patches on our genes and our blank
canvas pouches will be branded with the
letters B LDR builder this will be
limited to our first run of tobacco
genes and will never be seen again so
you'll be able to prove that you were
with us from the beginning thanks for
watching let's ride
the perfect ride where Roger and
technology come together to create the
definitive riding experience but there
are obstacles sustained exposure to
riding noise over 100 decibels may
result in permanent hearing loss or
distract and fatigue a rider increasing
the probability of a serious accident
traditional solutions simply aren't
enough introducing the Sena smart helmet
the only revolutionary helmet that
intelligently controls and reduces
harmful riding noise while still
allowing you to clearly hear traffic
sirens and your rpms how is this
possible the intelligent noise control
system module snaps in and gets to work
utilizing four hidden microphones to
effectively capture and dramatically
phase out harmful helmet noise switch on
ambient mode to hone in on external
sounds and conversations without the
need to remove your helmet the
lightweight carbon fiber shell is
streamlined for maximum strength and
minimal weight variable ventilation
options an adjustable multi zone foam
pad system and neck roll are designed
for ultimate comfort for everyday riding
and it wouldn't be a center helmet
without Bluetooth capabilities snapping
an optional Bluetooth module and
activate a world of communication and
music listening capabilities in
conjunction with the intelligent noise
control system you can listen at volumes
lower than ever before the Sena smart
helmet was designed by riders for riders
with safety technology and a more
enjoyable riding experience in mind make
the most of every mile with a sinner
smart helmet the perfect companion with
a perfect ride
my name is Adam Timmy Berg and I've been
riding motorcycles most of my life but
there was a big problem the boots
they're bulky uncomfortable and
extremely unfashionable so we set out to
design the perfect solution
the roam zeros the aim of Rome was to
create a motorcycle shoe that fits into
your everyday life I've spent the last
three years dedicating my life to Rome
and I'm extremely excited to show you
what we've been working on for impact
we integrated new technology called d3o
for protection of the toe and ankle
areas d3o is light and flexible but it
becomes rigid with impact the harder you
hit it the harder it gets this is why
professional riders trusted in their
gear for sliding we have used abrasion
resistant leather to protect against
road rash but we didn't stop there one
of the greatest dangers of riding
motorcycles is not being seen so we
developed and pounded our own Wireless
blinker and brake light technology and
seamlessly integrated it into the shoe
after adding our small box to your
existing blinker and brake light system
the Rome zeroes become an extension of
your motorcycle when we look in our
mirrors it's hard to notice the presence
of a motorcycle illuminating the rider
increases visibility and is one step
closer to keeping you alive whether
you're riding to school to bike night to
work or just meeting up with some
friends for coffee Rome zeroes will be
there to help you stay safe while
freeing you from the conventional
methods of motorcycle shoes Rome zeroes
offer a safe riding experience through
impact protection abrasion resistance
and high visibility without sacrificing
comfort or style the Rome zeroes allow
you to focus on what's most important
the ride we need your help to make this
a reality we're almost ready for
manufacturing and we need funding for
tooling costs material costs and to put
in our first large order we look forward
to delivering you a motorcycle shoe that
fits your everyday life the world is
ours to roam and do all my fellow bikers
ride safe

the ride
anyone who rides a motorcycle
appreciates the freedom and convenience
what's not so fun is parking and storing
your bike balancing and moving a bike
when it's stationary can be clumsy and
difficult it doesn't need to be this way
dynamo tote is a solution to easily and
safely Park move and store motorcycles
for the garage workshop or showroom
unique multi-directional wheels allow
movement of a part to motorcycle in any
direction we presently have three
different products patented a rear stand
for bikes with conventional double sided
swingarm and pickup spools a rear stand
for bikes with a single-sided swingarm
and a hollow rear axle and a front wheel
device which will suit almost any bike
our rear stands are based on well known
and well accepted paddock stands
conventional paddock stands with swing
arm casters have been around for years
but have found little acceptance because
of the usual shortcomings of casters
innovative large omnidirectional wheels
cannot miss align and will easily roll
over the Pebble Creek or exposed
aggregate and concrete expansion joints
with the by Kelvin a stable upright
position by the rear stand the front
wheel devised simpler interfaces and
lives the bike by the tire only
independent to the forks triple clamps
of all
crane and will work with virtually any
road bike with the addition of a front
wheel device you have unlimited
maneuverability the bike can now be
turned 360 degrees and it's only for
those who take their bike to the
racetrack the rear stands have all the
functionality of your current at extend
but with some additional features not
seen before a handle which doubles as a
safety bar to prevent the unintended
tipping forward of the bike off the
stand or simply for peace of mind or
your bike is unattended our optional
closed ball pickups on the right hand
side allows the stand to be easily
engaged without having to balance the
bike with one hand this makes putting
your bike on the stand simple and more
importantly safe for you and by we've
also replaced the usual thumb screws for
outriggers with an innovative but simple
mechanism which allows quick adjustment
in seconds high quality materials and
robust construction all Dyna moto stands
are manufactured in Brisbane Australia
we hope that by providing a safe and
easy way to notify who will make
motorcycle ownership more accessible
