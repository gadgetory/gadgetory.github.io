system designed to keep up with how we
use Wi-Fi today from play to streaming
to video calling here's how it works you
simply replace your existing router with
a Google Wi-Fi point or points if you
have a larger home these points work
together with your current modem and
Internet service to provide fast
seamless Wi-Fi for your whole home
Google Wi-Fi is set up and controlled
for a mobile app it gives you a host of
features for simple straightforward
access to your network no matter where
you are like lighting you see which
devices are connected at any one time or
giving you parental control so if it's
time to dinner or time for bed you can
give them a little time off
it lets you easily find and share your
Wi-Fi password with guests and even
allows you to prioritize a specific
device for faster speeds so the
important stuff never gets interrupted
and network assist technology works in
the background to make sure you always
get the fastest possible speed it takes
care of things like Wi-Fi channel
selection high traffic on the channel
you're using can slow down your Wi-Fi
speed Google Wi-Fi constantly monitors
to make sure you're on the least
congested Channel and when you're moving
from room to room and make sure you're
connected to the closest Wi-Fi point and
the strongest fastest signal it will
even let you know if you can improve
Wi-Fi performance by moving a Wi-Fi
point to a better location
design for your homes complex Wi-Fi
needs yet simple to control Google Wi-Fi
home Wi-Fi simply solve

now
the foundation for innovation
we live in a connected world now more
than ever the Internet is accessible on
virtually every device in our homes and
as parents we've all had that moment
when we realize how exposed our children
can be on the Internet
existing parental control solutions are
complicated to use so we started by
asking how can we make it simple for
busy parents to create a safer online
experience for our children
introducing Griffon a simple to use
Wi-Fi router designed to help parents
work together to better manage our
connected families the simplicity of
Griffon starts with an end where you can
view all your connected devices and
manage settings for each individual
device in your home because all the
traffic goes through the router there is
no need to install complicated software
on any of your devices as parents we are
constantly multitasking so we've
developed an exciting new technology to
allow parents to have real-time control
over their child's internet access from
anywhere even outside the home digital
parenting is better together so we made
it simple for parents teachers and
schools to work together with a social
collaboration platform it's difficult to
know which websites are appropriate for
our child to guide the parent Griffin
aggregates the approval ratings from
other parents and the community through
crowd ranking managing your child's
online activities is not just about
blocking harmful websites but also about
discovering useful content to help your
child learn and grow with Griffin the
parent can easily manage screen time
through the app you can set bedtimes and
homework times or simply pause the
internet for family time
while you are spending time with the
things that matter Griffins keeping all
your connected things safe with 24/7
intelligent intrusion detection and
active malware filtering Griffin is
elegantly designed with the latest Wi-Fi
technology
wireless mesh six high-powered antennas
tri-band Wi-Fi radios antenna beam
forming and mu-mimo
hi my name is John I'm the co-creator of
Griffin like many parents I struggled
with managing my children's screen time
the existing solutions are very
complicated to use and many parents we
talked to simply gave up that's why we
built Griffin to be simple to use design
by parents for parents to build riffing
we have assembled a global team of
experts with a proven track record of
delivering powered winning products like
Apple iPod and my five mobile hotspot we
have world over the past year creating a
beautiful design and developing the
software platform where is in Qualcomm
and their latest Wi-Fi technology and we
are partnered with Kaspersky one of the
leaders in security and malware
detection we have chosen our
manufacturing partner
now we need your support to take this
product to production please join our
community and spread the message by
sharing the link below together we can
make the internet safer for our children
Thank You Kickstarter's my internet is
does not work for like ever
I tried again press the capital M and
then press ok oh yeah
not for tasting a purchase are
please please please like and then blink
meet onhub a different kind of router
that makes it simple to get better Wi-Fi
on up starts fast and stays fast
constantly improves on its own and it
communicates with an app not blinking
lights on hope the new way to Wi-Fi how
we use Wi-Fi is changing every day there
are more devices more apps and more
video and we're connecting our homes
like never before so shouldn't the
routers that give us that Wi-Fi change
to enter on hub on hub represents an
inside-out router rethink it's built
with the idea that if we love the
devices that use Wi-Fi maybe we should
love the devices that supply it to to
help make that happen we didn't just
build a router we built hardware and
software that can live inside many of
them the first thing you'll notice about
a non hub is it doesn't look like a
router that's because routers work
better in the open off the floor not in
the closet so if we want you to put it
on a shelf it can't look like a bear
claw we then had to create components
that perform like we want but fit inside
this design the homework of that is the
antennas they're more compact powerful
and work together to get your device
fast steady Wi-Fi no matter how you're
holding it there's also one antenna
whose only job is to always find the
least congested Wi-Fi channel and those
blinking lights nobody understood gone
replacing them is a simple app that
helps you set it up know who's online
and how much Wi-Fi they're using and
another cool thing when you connect it
on hub router the whole system learns
from how Wi-Fi is being used and updates
itself automatically and this is only
the beginning
soon over 50 billion more devices will
be using Wi-Fi on hub is designed to
evolve and grow with them so no matter
what the future looks like you will have
one simple hub to manage your wireless
world that's a lot to like and hopefully
yes one day love</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
