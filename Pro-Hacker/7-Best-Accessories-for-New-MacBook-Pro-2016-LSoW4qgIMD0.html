remember the first time you streamed the
video on your smartphone at that moment
you are no longer tied to your living
room for your entertainment or to your
office for work you could access your
content anywhere but there's one small
problem your small mobile device screen
almost all of us prefer large displays
for entertainment and for work those
work deadlines are approaching a large
desktop monitor our dual screen setup
will significantly boost your
productivity so what if there is a way
to have the mobility of a phone tablet
or laptop without losing the benefit of
a large screen sounds impossible but
that's exactly what we did introducing
sput the spontaneous pop-up display spud
is a high-resolution 24 inch display
that collapses down to the size of a
book and weighs less than 2 pounds this
revolutionary product is the first truly
collapsible display and the only device
that gives you both portability and a
large screen for entertainment and
productivity throughout the spa's design
process we focus on image quality and
ease of use we use the latest projection
technology combined with our own custom
optics to project a large high quality
image of a very short distance this
enables us to produce a bright sharp
image that's about 4 times larger than a
laptop screen and 23 times larger than a
smartphone
to make but as easy to use as possible
we design to work just like a ruggedized
umbrella you can pop up the screen in a
very intuitive way you have the spot set
up and run in less than 10 seconds at
sinks but it's also lightweight
battery-powered and uses a hassle-free
HDMI connection you can get straight to
the big screen you want without wasting
any time or setup one of the most
exciting things about the spud is the
many different ways that you can use on
the entertainment side but it's
basically a portable TV or movie screen
whether you're traveling camping hanging
out with friends at a coffee shop or
just lounging around your house it's the
big screen that you can use anywhere for
work having a dual screen setup is great
for productivity but you can also use it
for presentations and it's a
collaboration it's great for trade shows
sales visits or any kind of field work
but gives you the flexibility you need
no matter the situation and it's great
because it's a complete solution in a
very small package that you can take
anywhere we have the team the product
and the vision to execute on spud and
now all we need is your support by
backing us on Kickstarter you're
becoming part of our founding community
as a special thank you we'll be adding
all of our Kickstarter backers to an
exclusive VIP list that gives you early
access the discount codes product
updates and beta testing opportunities
so Kickstarter what will you do with
your spud
it just doesn't make sense to me that in
this day and age are still forced to
fragment where we store our files so
this is TARDIS it's what we built we
start with a solid unibody aluminum
enclosure we use the fastest mlc flash
memory modules paired with the fastest
4k flash controllers a market would take
all that and we put it into a package
where the data is transferred through
14-karat gold contacts and then the cool
part is what's happening on the inside
here's how it works
TARDIS pair seamlessly merges with your
macbook so instead of having two
separate drives during all your class
now you have two drives that are paired
working together as one the files to use
most a prioritize to pay the same speed
to come to expect from there on it's
automatic nothing to manage nothing to
do it just works
and it's really fast TARDIS creates a
new product category and it's a true
end-to-end solution for anyone that's
run out of storage space on a modern
macro control everything is happening on
the back end it happens automatically
happens seamlessly</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
