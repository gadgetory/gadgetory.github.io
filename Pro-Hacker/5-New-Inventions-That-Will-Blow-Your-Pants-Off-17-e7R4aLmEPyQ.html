built with a foodie indicate for image
sensor system all four sensors are
precisely synchronized to ensure
simultaneous recording each lens is
closely mount with each other resulting
in shorter safety distance between the
camera and the object
we have chosen a super high resolution
hundred ninety degree fish islands which
provides excellent image quality and
outperforms those spots camera wreck
solutions a full metal housing is used
to improve heat dissipation resulting in
much longer continuous recording there
are two power options an ac/dc power
adapter socket and a detachable battery
unit using 18 650 standard the imperil
we try to perpetuate self-image farmers
are stored on SD cards in addition to
the four individual HDMI ports there is
a Gigabit Ethernet spot which allows not
only easy and fast image transfer but
also life will possibility through
external solutions and since we provide
full sets open a PR expert users we
found this extremely useful because they
can remotely control s1 through the even
after prompt
we think professional we our cameras
should be more sophisticated than
traditional cameras we have developed a
special algorithm to coordinate auto
right balance and auto exposure of all
four sensors resulting in more
harmonized images

quality turning and optimization we have
continued to improve the overall image
