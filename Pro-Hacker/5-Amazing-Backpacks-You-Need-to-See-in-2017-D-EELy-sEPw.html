hi my name is Heather and I'm a
professional slackline is from the US
when I'm on the Highline I tried to be
fully in each moment in each step in the
world so when I'm using my slacklining
here I don't have to constantly be
thinking about if I'm safe because I
know that I trust the gear I trust it's
rating the same thing with other
products in life you know you don't want
to have a pack but digging into your
shoulders or hurting your back the way
that it's sitting and positioned it's
distracting you from what your purpose
is finding a backpack that is
comfortable looks nice and you can be in
pretty much any situation it's really
amazing we get it you carry around a lot
from laptops to water bottle but the
conventional backpack just doesn't cut
it we've noticed most everyday backpacks
are made to save money at our backs
expense they may look great or seem
smart they do little to protect and
sometimes being a harm our back that is
why we spared no expense creating a
beautiful backpack that's well balanced
and perfectly tailored to your body a
backpack that gives your body a break

gear and brought it to your everyday
life Joey is on point

your body need a more space Joey expands
in a very unique way retaining balance
even when doubled in size looking for
accessibility Joey has a pair of easily
accessible pockets you can take out your
cell phone wallet or keys on the go and
store them safely so you can have your
hands-free again now we didn't even
mention the countless ways to stoke

our campaign is that we are ready for
production but we need your support to
make it happen on behalf of koala thank
you for bringing Joey to life
backpacks are part of our life as
mundane as air and water we throw things
we can't live without in depth and true
from about everywhere we go every day we
never even bothered stop and think about
what they tend to do so what is
backpacks can charge your devices what
if we turn them into our alternative
persona neat backpack a beautifully
designed urban backpack perfect for a
connected on the go lifestyle of that
act backpack is fully weatherproof it is
constructed entirely using material made
from recycled bottles the bag houses
third liters worth of your everyday
items like a 15-inch laptop one ten inch
tablet and a number of other gadgets and
gear
backpacks features a side access for
your laptop a u-lock hook belt a yoga
mat loop and a shoe pocket backpacks is
the sleek all-around backpack for
today's urban commuter I'm a frequent
traveler and it always bothers me how my
backpacks can't keep up with me
it can't charge my head cell phones and
they all look pretty embarrassing in the
office I need a bag that's going to keep
up with my day-to-day lifestyle I need a
bag with unlimited possibilities and I'm
just not going to be satisfied until I
get one we need a solution for the
problems we've had and and for the
problems we will have a smart docking
system is that answer but we need your
support the bag now has a finished
design and a prototype but we need your
support in order to make the smart badge
system
we really appreciate the wus and lo is
on Facebook and Instagram and so please
pledge today and let's build a better
bag for small
we're proud to introduce the ample smart
backpack the world's most advanced
portable charging solution integrated
directly into the fabric of the bag I
think that it should be easier to charge
your phone in your laptop wherever you
are without needing to find a power
outlet my life is lived on the go I
can't keep my laptop charged past noon
my phone needs to be plugged in before
3:00 p.m. I must have tried every
portable charging system portable
battery most of them just don't get it
done what I really need is a serious
charging solution that can power
anything anytime anywhere
the portable charging solution that I
needed didn't exist and I wanted to
build it and when I explained what I
wanted to do to some engineering friends
of mine they wanted to help because they
needed it - we're proud to introduce the
ample smart backpack portable charging
solution that we needed and we think you
might need - and we're proud to have
been named a 2015 CES Innovation Awards
honoree in two categories a testament to
the engineering rigor that was put into
the development of this product so I've
been designing bags for over decades and
the challenge here was that the bag
wasn't just holding your devices but you
are also plugging your devices into the
bag for them to be charged I started to
create illustration drawings where I
would then send them to Tomoko and she
would start engineering the housings
around those pieces and then she would
send them back and I would tailor the
bag design around her CAD data our goal
was to create a design that was truly
intuitive for the user and we wanted the
electronics to almost disappear into the
fabrics of the bag the amplifier
backpack can charge all of your devices
overnight or throughout the day we
integrated a powerful custom-built
battery that can recharge a smartphone
two to three times there's a USB port in
every pocket and you can add three
expansion batteries for days that you
need more power the modular batteries
charge rapidly when docked into the bag
but can also be removed and used
separately you can stick in your coat
pocket or your first and take dinner
with you and you don't have to carry the
bag with you to have
backup power when we first thought about
putting electronics into a backpack we
immediately worried what happens if you
drop it so we added shock absorbers and
an extra layer of foam all the way
around and we apply the water-resistant
coating to all of the exterior fabric to
help keep the rain out have you ever
forgotten your backpack at a coffee shop
the ample smart backpack can alert you
if you do and we built a mobile app that
will monitor battery level connected
devices and smart sensors in the bag
where you can use the OLED display and
touch sensor to monitor the vitals
inside of the bag without ever opening a
zipper sample is a talented team of
designers and engineers with decades of
experience launching new products more
importantly though we're commuters
travelers coffee shop dwellers and
on-the-go doers and we needed a more
ample bag we have a plan to get into
production by early summer but we need
help to get there we're hoping to raise
at least 125 thousand dollars to cover
the cost of tooling and raw materials
and as a thank you to our early backers
we're offering a 25% discount on the bag
and all of the accessory modules please
support us in bringing the ample smart
backpack to life
