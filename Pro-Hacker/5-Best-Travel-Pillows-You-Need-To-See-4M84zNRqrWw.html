the best experiences life has to offer
but arriving at your destination without
getting enough sleep can be the absolute
worst finding a comfortable enough
position to sleep in can be a challenge
and some travel pillows on the market
just don't do the trick some of them can
be cumbersome others are simply
impractical and well yeah hi I'm Matt
Benedetto and I'm the inventor of the
voyage pillow after spending the past
year in development I am proud to
introduce the voyage pillow as the most
compact versatile and comfortable travel
pillow for your next trip adventure or
daily commute
my unique pillow design combines a micro
bead pillow with a multi-purpose poly
spandex band for amazing comfort and
versatility most travel pillows are made
for sleeping in one particular position
but the voyage pillow allows you to
customize the way you sleep you can use
it over your eyes around your neck
against the window around your hand the
possibilities are endless
Plus never worry about the pillow
falling out of place when you shift
positions or are on the move the voyage
pillows incredibly compact sides will
save you precious space needed your
carry-on or check bags compared to a
traditional travel pillow focus on
packing the things you'll need to make
your trip memorable simply grab and go
the poly spandex fabric allows for just
the right amount of stretch for a
comfortable fit for all sizes the
interior features a smooth plush fabric
for a soft touch and feel when sleeping
finally thousands of microbeads adjust
perfectly to your unique sleeping
position and snap right back into place
choose your favorite color way from
midnight black sunrise red or ocean blue
getting the sleep I deserve is no longer
a dream even though flying on a private
plane might be

customer Nina baby number 15 to the
departure of your area once again all
customers should be gate number 15 to
the park every round final boarding call

computer a lumbar support for long

plane or even a knee wedge to reduce
stress on your hips while sleeping and
all of this in a super compact travel
friendly format it's time for you to
retire those ancient travel pillows and
embrace the comfort convenience and
support we all deserve in one pillow

introducing face cradle face cradle is
different because it has an internal
frame in each of two pillows that fold
out and quickly lock to your desired
position it has five modes of comfort
for more than a regular neck pillow and
allows you to be held or supported in
the whole 180 degrees forward of your
seat the great thing is the multiple new
positions you can try standard neck
pillow
we call this dozing mode but we need
more comfort positions neck pillows can
be uncomfortable our first improvement
is mode two we call this snoozing to
open pillows hold and depress buttons
release and lock at twenty to ten
o'clock position face cradle supports
the head higher up and on to your
shoulders taking pressure off your neck
mode three we call table nap place face
cradle onto your tray table prop it with
a pillow or your bag if necessary fold
your arms between the two pillows you
can use this mode anywhere there's a
table mode four and five are deep sleep
modes attach the harness open and lock
the pillows to the 11:30 o'clock
position loot the harness around your
seat back it's even better to put it
around a winged headrest now lean
forward into your face cradle select
your most comfortable angle by the quick
adjust cam lock relax and cradle your
face into the luxurious memory foam this
is deep sleep front mode
it's like resting in a massage table

sleep no other travel pillow offers such
comfort
