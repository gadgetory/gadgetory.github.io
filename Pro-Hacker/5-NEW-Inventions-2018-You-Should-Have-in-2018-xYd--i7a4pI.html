hi i'm ryan and i'm elias we are part of
the team behind sonic soak sonic soak is
a smartphone sized device that uses
ultrasound technology to clean almost
anything in ways never before possible
it cleans to the microscopic level
beyond what any laundry machine or
cleaning spray can do the inspiration
for this device came from the fact that
we were frequent travelers and cleaning
our clothes while on the go was always a
hassle so we had to set out to find a
good solution
it's also quiet and can be used to clean
more than clothes it can clean glasses
jewelry fruits razors baby bottles the
products that are tough to clean using
sponges or rags or your hands or soap
and water I think they get the idea is
ok I just want to be clear this is the
best way to clean pretty much anything
sonic soak works by generating
ultrasonic sound waves that create
microscopic high pressure bubbles to
wash away dirt grime and oils we had no
idea at the time that we come up with
was a device that had so many benefits
outside of travellers wanting an easy
way to wash clothes while on the go
it's also simple to use you simply place
it water add some soap turn on the
built-in timer and walk away minutes

travelers moms neat freaks looking for a
thorough cleanse and not just on clothes
by the way but on fruits and vegetables

more than a great way to clean your
laundry it can clean just about anything
