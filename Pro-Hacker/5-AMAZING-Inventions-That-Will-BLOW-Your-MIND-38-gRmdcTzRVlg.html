necessary you can delete all the
information on the card with the push of
a button I've got my key I've got my
phone I've got my wallet fuse allows you
to select any card to use when you need

might rather use debit and credit you

fused has the capability for NFC
technology NFC means you can tap the
card to make contactless payment using
its button you can create a six tap
password to lock and unlock the card so
if it ends up in the wrong hand

fuse card so that your preferred payment
method doesn't accidentally change the

minutes unless it's told otherwise

card your clone will send you an alert
before you get too far away

days that means you have about a month
before you have to worry about
recharging it but when you do have to
charge it visas portable charging cradle

charge the card on the go in Savannah we
had the chance to use the fuse it's
pretty awesome that you can put all this
tech into a card as thin as this fuse
your whole wallet in one card
