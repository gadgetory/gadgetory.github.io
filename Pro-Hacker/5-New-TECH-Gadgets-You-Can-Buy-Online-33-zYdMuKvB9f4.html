without a single person noticing
as long as television has been around
we've sat and waited for the story to
come to us the story that broadcasters
and networks wanted us to see no more no
less what is the space between you and
the TV could live and breathe and you
could control the story this is the new
frontier and it's called in air what you
are seeing here is a visualization of
what the viewing experience would be
like
when using in air on a 3d television we
call it augmented television in air
seamlessly accesses Internet content
related to the program being watched and
virtually places this information in
layers in front of the TV in a dynamic
manner the in air app will be available
for free on both iOS and Android and
will allow you to turn your smartphone
tablet or smart watch into a remote
control the screen of your device acts
like a trackpad and simple gestures will
allow you to navigate the content on
screen when how do you use the entire TV
viewer let's explore some demos this
example demonstrates how in air can port
an existing mobile app into the in air
viewing space for a completely new
experience
viewing is in line with the TV program
and does not require you to look up and
down between devices
in areas found links to info on the
movie the soundtrack and the artists and
special information on the Jaguar
featured in movie viewers can also
navigate information feeds and find more
details just being able to watch TV and
look up the actors at the same time is
awesome normally I'm battling back and
forth between my phone and the TV and
now I can just keep my eyes on the TV
it's cool it was really cool to be able
to watch the news and pull up the times
to see what they had to say about the
same story I've been part of a number of
consumer technology companies early on I
think I have a pretty good sense of when
a product is about to become
indispensable to our everyday lives I
really think that any air is absolutely
that kind of a product
