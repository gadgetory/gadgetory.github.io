hot tea and so do we
but there's a problem the electric
kettle
everyone always overfill it keeping
excess water and wasting energy research
proved that one day of extra energy use
from overfilling electric kettles it's
enough to light all the streetlights in
England for a night with Mito we set out
to solve this problem meter only heats
as much water as you need in the vessel
of your choice
simply fill your cup with water place it
on to the induction base and immerse the
rod in the liquid the base that heats
the disc of the rod which heats the
liquid surrounding it giving you the
exact amount of hot water you wanted we
focused on a simple and elegant design
that is intuitive to use
me to adjust to your need
you can heat milk for a hot chocolate or
warm up the food for your baby
are you having guests over no problem
just prepare an entire a tea kettle
for everyone to share me toast out is a
graduation project and now a year and a
half later we have a working prototype
we have been working endlessly on the
design and the user experience and the
electronics revolutionized how the
liquids will be heated in the future
over the course of last few months we
want multiple innovation and design
awards and thousands of people reached
out to us asking for meto
now our next chapter begins and we need
your support it's time to be gearing up
to manufacture and that requires huge
resources NATO is a small product but
with the big impact
imagine the positive change we could
make if everybody sign using Neto so
let's leave a mark in this world even if
it's just a scratch
clicks basin water can be lots of fun so
we need to drink it sure we know it's
helpful but it's just a phase is
exciting with all those flavor drinks
which means we drink a lot less water
and a whole lot more that job Hey we
decided to put some fun into drinking
water with the right cup it's the
world's first ever fruit flavoured cup
designed to get people drinking more
water and we believe it's going to be a
real game-changer so how does it work
Wow well for starters our brain
identifies flavor using two main senses
taste and smell that's why we inserted
innovative FDA approved fruit scent and
flavor directly into the right Cup so
when you drink water from it your nose
picks up the fruity aroma your tongue
senses the hint of a sweet taste what in
fact you're only drinking natural water
oh wow sounds great but does it work
well we asked ourselves that very same
question so we put the right cup to the
test with our orange flavored prototype
not just water tastes like something
else just water it's crazy brilliant
just brilliant the right cup is great
for anyone who wants to cut down on
sugary drinks and drink more water which
is basically everybody
you
yeah it's Rivet volume I can hear
everything it's amazing it's amazing how
I hear the sound sleeper yeah well I
don't know buddy movie yeah
oh wow very cool
