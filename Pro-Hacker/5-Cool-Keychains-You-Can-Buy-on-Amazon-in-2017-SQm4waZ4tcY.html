numerous digital services through the
use of various devices if you do the
math a person may easily have more than
15 different accounts security experts
agree that for a password to be truly
secure it must contain a random
combination of letters numbers and
symbols remembering such a secure
password is not a job meant for us
humans in the past few years hackers
have proven over and over again just how
vulnerable our computer systems can be
major companies like eBay Dropbox and
LinkedIn have reported cyber attacks
that have compromised users information
and passwords this is why we created
passport it's a security device that
allows you to generate store and use
unique and secure passwords for all the
services apps and devices you use
passport is small enough that you can
comfortably carry it in your pocket or
purse along with your keys passport is
easy to set up and simple to use it can
connect to your devices via a USB or
bluetooth and it's recognized
automatically on all major platforms
here's how you use your passport first
access your passport by entering your
master key the only password you'll ever
have to remember then access the login
screen of the service you'd like to use
on your preferred device finally browse
your passport for the appropriate
account and select it passport will
automatically log in to your account
say goodbye to using unsecure passwords
and having to remember any of them ever
again should it fall into the wrong
hands
passport incorporates several security
mechanisms to protect your privacy it
encrypts your data using the same
encryption algorithm the US government
uses to protect top-secret information
our free synchronization app also allows
you to create and store an encrypted
copy of your accounts for easy recovery
in case of loss or theft

hi guys I'm Lorenzo
hi I'm Carlo every day smartphones are
becoming smarter but the battery life
remains critical we'd like to use our
phones without the fear of running out
of battery
of course there are solutions such as
power cases and extra batteries but are
either not portable enough or easy to
forget
we designed a product so compact that
will follow you everywhere a cable the
size of an inch we call it in charge
it's a very simple product it's so
useful that we believe everybody should
own one that's why one of our main goals
was to keep it affordable
a tiny product at a tiny price we spend
an average 70% of our day next to a USB
port and every time it's a chance to
top-up for batteries there are over five
billion USB ports around the world in
charge will fit in your pocket and you
won't have to fight with tangle cords
ever again thanks to its remarkably
compact design you can snap it onto your
keyring and there's no chance to forget
it at all we spent the last three months
design the product and testing the
prototypes and now we are finally ready
to start the production in charger will
be available with both lightning
connector and micro USB so it's
compatible with most of the devices out
there we are really excited about this
and we hope you are too
now we need your help to bring in charge
into your pocket
as a supporter you will get your own in
charge at a special price so please
consider back in our project and share
it with your friends thanks for watching
we really appreciate your support thank
you
