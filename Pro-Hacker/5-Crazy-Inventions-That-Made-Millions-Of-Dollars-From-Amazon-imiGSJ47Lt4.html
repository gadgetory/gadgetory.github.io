you to hideaway the bottle you'll always
reach for because it's always within
reach experts suggest that for optimum
health
the average active person drink over 10
glasses of water every day but for those
of us who are always on the go it's
nearly impossible to stay hydrated
without reaching for disposable bottles
of water or sugary sports drinks bottled
water may be convenient but it's not
cheap it costs more than two thousand
times more than tap water even though
it's less regulated for health and
quality then there's the bottle every
minute US consumers throw out ninety
thousand plastic bottles and less than a
quarter are actually recycled the rest
end up in our landfills and in our
streets parks and beaches we need a
convenient solution to disposable
plastic bottles that fits our active
lifestyle
so as a freelance product designer I'm
traveling a lot visiting clients
visiting factories going to trade shows
I was looking for a water bottle that
would not take up a lot of space in my
carry-on and I started looking around
for a product that would work that would
still be functional and it wasn't out
there as I'm going through airports I'm
seeing so many travelers probably with
the same problem and I figured this is a
problem I can solve myself you know once
I had a solution for business travel I
realised this had great application my
personal life especially in the outdoors
going backpacking or just on hikes I
could bring water with me and when the
bottle was empty it it collapses and
goes away and takes no extra space in my
back no one loves buying disposable
water bottles it's it's merely out of
convenience and the Hideaway makes a
reusable bottle more convenient in fact
in some places disposable water bottles
are being banned so we're all going to
move towards the reusable water bottle
model and that's why I feel like this is
kind of the next generation and
hydration this gives you an option to
have a water bottle all the time without
having to throw anything away
I'm really excited to share the Hideaway
bottle with with the world and
Kickstarter is an amazing opportunity to
do that to be able to show you the
backers what this is all about so please
check out the rewards we need to raise a
significant amount of money to get this
into production to get it on the shelves
this year and just as important please
share it with everyone you know tell
them about this great water bottle The
Hideaway
for thousands of years humans have been
filling their notebooks and then just
buying more like the notebook industry
has given up on innovation hey what's
this
the notebook Hemingway wrote on that's
cool I guess we're from rocket book and
we make notebooks from the future
at rocket book we are already famous for
inventing the wave notebook the smart
notebook that can be erased in the
microwaves we've shipped 100,000 waves
to satisfied customers around the world
others may stop there but we're maniacs
obsessed with blending old-fashioned
notebooks with future and awesome so
we've spent a year in the rocket lab
designing a new notebook that feels like
pen and paper but is endlessly reusable
and completely integrated with your
digital lifestyle
introducing the Everlast notebook from
rocket book the Everlast brings cloud
scalability to pen and paper simply
write scan and a race imagine one
thousand of your favorite notebooks in
one sleek design that fits in your
backpack here's how it works
Everlast pages look and feel like paper
but they're actually constructed from a
polyester composite rather than would
you write on the Everlast using any pen
from the pilot FriXion line which are
available in-store and online writing on
the Everlast
feels perfectly natural and smooth and
as the ink dries it forms a complete
bond to the polyester page so it won't
rub off but what makes this formulation
so unique is that each page can be wiped
completely clean with a moist towel so
it can be used over and over and over
again the Everlast notebook is also
compatible with the rocket book app so
before you wipe your notes off the page
you can blast them online to your
favorite cloud services in a fraction of
a second rocket book machine vision
scans enhances and sends each page to
the specific destination they belong on
the cloud services you already use
each Everlast notebook page has seven
symbols set up the rocket book app to
assign each symbol to a location within
Dropbox Google Docs Evernote or many
other services you could configure your
diamond to send meeting notes directly
to your shared team folder in Dropbox or
students could configure their star
symbol to send notes right to a math
folder in Google Drive so you can make
your list break out that diagram or
color in that drawing then tomorrow
start your day with a brand new notebook
with the ever last one notebook becomes
one thousand notebooks the utility of
the cloud and the joy of pen and paper
that's rocket book
