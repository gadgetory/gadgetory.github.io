entrepreneur professional writer
activist friend mother and longboard
writer I'm here to celebrate the day
when technology caught up with my dreams
to make the world a safer place for
everyone in 2000 I was attacked by a
complete stranger
hey cut my throat open my stomach
step three times into my heart area it
happened in a safe neighborhood in the
light of day 200 feet from the police
station I fought for life with what I
had
tooth and nail but what actually saved
me was the call for help
16 years ago I had few options so I used
my voice I was extremely lucky the help
came to me I'm
and being alive is all the difference
since that day I've been thinking if
anything could have kept me away from
bad experience
Taman easy and smart to save lives and
give a warm feeling that you and your
loved ones are safe and sound

the ring with the panic button to send
an alert to friends people nearby police

loved ones and you will always know when
they need your help is the ring in
emergencies including fires floods
robbery armed attacks sexual assaults or
health problems
why ring it's the fastest and safest way
to send an alert with the ring it can
send a signal without no one know you
did that you don't need to dig around
for the device and then look at it to
find the button you don't need there
they had to be free you don't need to
have a long conversation with the 9-1-1
operator gather a great team and created
the system that drops the latest high
technology designed around your finger
in the application you can manage a list
of receivers specifying on health issues

critical information we've made
thousands of product items to make sure
the ring is nice and comfortable to wear
the bottom is functional and the false
alarms are negligible we aim to build
community where people come forward to
offer up a hand to those in trouble we
call it cross or security and we believe
that society is ready to protect itself

crazy causes and I let her go with a
lighter heart
I embrace the unknown while feeling safe
and secure I want to share that feeling
with you imagine the world where help is
always there we can make it together

as most parents would agree monitoring a
child's fever using a traditional
thermometer can be a very laborious
process check my 10 a wearable
thermometer is an entirely new way to
monitor fever check my temp is simply
worn as an armband it records
temperature accurately and continuously
and sends the data directly to your
smartphone or tablet it uses our
patent-pending multi temp technology
sensors embedded in the device read not
only body temperature but also the
outside temperature in addition it has
an accelerometer to track body movements
so check my temp can tell you when your
child is awake or if they've fallen out

sitting we do it for over nine hours
every single day and because of the way
we're doing it
90% of us will get back pain in our
lives seriously when we hunch and slump
it affects our mood our happiness even
how optimistic we feel look at yourself
right now
how are you sitting how's your back and
your neck probably not too great huh hi
my name is Catherine and I started
working on my posture two and a half
years ago when I started having terrible
sciatica pain I have spent so much time
and money on doctors visits therapies
special pillows and all these ridiculous
products but I couldn't find anything
that just worked so for the past year
I've been creating a real solution with
the most amazing designers and
prototypers and dozens and dozens of
people with really bad backs it was
important to create something small
enough I could fit in my purse and
something effortless so I could just
count on it working in five seconds flat
something reliable and something that
would help me improve my posture even
when I wasn't wearing it this is better
back it allows you to effortlessly sit
in perfect posture easing back pain and
training yourself how to sit use it when
you're sitting at your desk on an
airplane watching a game or even when
you meditate basically use it anytime
you have to sit you don't have to go far
to find people with bad posture or back
pain a friend a parent someone you work
with or even people you meet product
testing around San Francisco every
Friday here's what people think about
better back
so let's have the palabra I feel Donny
feels awesome it's so easy to just sit
up straight this could sound weird back
and like feel my my body you know I can
feel my hey my organs not being squished
I can feel that it's right here but it's
not like oh I have all this on me it's
just like I am just like relieved
pain-free I'm sitting straight upright
it's like it forces your torso to stay
upright where can I get one of these can
I have this one simple it's easy I put
it on and I feel immediate relief so
that's how it feels and this is how it's
actually helping better back gives you
better posture it allows you to not
fatigue the muscles that you use when
you're sitting down so when you do stand
up your posture is literally changed
good posture can change who you are it
affects your attitude it affects your
decision making good posture changes who
you are literally sitting correctly over
time does more than stop slumping stress
on your spine it also retrains your
body's natural default posture so
whether you're standing or sitting
without better back your posture is
greatly improved let me show you how it
works better bag zips itself into a
portable case throw it in your bag and
unpack it when you're ready to sit wrap
the back pad around your back and the
knee straps around your knees all
there's left to do is to pull on the
adjustable leg straps to stack your
spine into perfect posture so if you're
going to spend nine hours of your day
sitting you might as well be doing it
right when you're pain free and your
body is perfectly aligned you feel
happier more confident and you regain
your ability to focus on whatever it is
you want out of life
you
our sleep is very important to us so we
decided to do something about it and
redesign every aspect of how beds and
mattresses are made and function
we're Beluga comes from is that we're
trying to utilize modern design and
technology to produce beds that you have
full control so you can customize it any
way you wish the SL suspension system is
very unique because it allows you to
control its firmness and it stays as new
throughout the lifespan of the bed it
acts like a spring but is very soft and
it yields itself around you rather than
resist you our climate control works by
using ambient air already in your room
which we then are able to either heat or
let pass through to in the summertime
ventilator to keep you cool and in the
winter time to actually warm the bed so
it's not chilled when you come to use it
we've incorporated a Vibram massage
that's pressure point rather than a bed
being vibrated it's directly placed in
vibration sensors beneath specific
pressure points in your body because
that was developed to help you navigate
your way in the dark without disturbing
your partner it automatically comes on
and we use an external wireless sensor
that allows the light to come on for a
certain amount of time to help guide you
to and from your bed we also have a
variety of colors that you can choose or
what ambient lighting you'd like when
they come on anti snoring system we
developed because it's just one of the
most disruptive experience you have with
a partner we use our very specialized
air suspension system to change the
angle at which you sleep when snoring is
monitored we have a built-in sensor
within the mattress that is specifically
tuned to pick up your frequency of sound
when you start snoring it will change
the tilt of your head and your neck to
both partners separately the idea of
technology in a bedroom is a challenge
and we felt that it was very important
to keep the ambience of a bedroom
technology free and everything we design
is designed to be invisible and unseen
everything you'd normally have in your
room to create the ambience you want is
the most important thing our control of
the bed is either through a nap or you
can have our own touch screen remote
control if you wish to use that beyond
that we have obviously the sleep
monitoring system which can interact
with your existing sleep monitoring
technology as wearable or as something
you have on your smile
phone or tablet with the help of the
IndieGoGo community we'd like the
opportunity to bring Beluga beds to the
mass-market we already have
manufacturing in place and we're ready
to take orders for any size of bed for
any continent worldwide
