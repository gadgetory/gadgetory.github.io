smartphones are a brilliant invention
they function as our camera our GPS our
flashlights and even as our entire
computer app developers do their best to
make user interface as simple and
intuitive as possible to play music roll
your eyes message sent to mom but
sometimes it's easier to manage things
with a physical controller meet Nemean
Busey the inventors of pressing a new
way to control and automate your
everyday smartphone actions Pressey is a
tiny physical button that connects to
your headphone jack and sends unique
signals to an intuitive app that can
activate one of many commands here are
some of the many things you can do with
your pressie take instant photos and
upload them to your favorite social
network turn on your LED light send your
location for emergencies start a
discreet tape recording don't tell
anyone but I like bears check into your
favorite social network and much more
pressing is not just a one-trick pony
you can easily configure the Pressy app
to execute different actions for
different sequences of clicks for
example two short clicks can call your
mom and two long clicks can call your
dad but what if you want to use your
headphones just let pressey rest in the
special keychain and use the headphone
button as pressing it all still works
Pressey even has an API so developers
can bring you more cool features Pressey

quadcopter it fits inside of the
controller itself which is the size of a
wallet fits perfectly into your pocket
not only does the quadcopter fit inside
of the remote control but it actually
uses the remote controls batteries to
charge itself while not in use making it
go virtually anywhere that you can this
is the most portable compact quadcopter
on the market so we've had probably
about five or six different remote
control planes but the wallet drone
seems to last forever and maybe it's the
size of the small size it but it flew
longer than just about any other copter
with over you

orange get yours today on IndieGoGo for

in your ear wish me Salman oh hey i put
in here comes up yeah okay can you hear
me French leave amid all filthy little
buddies all say yes I can hear you talk
spanish girls as this but this is
awesome but how you do it yeah it's
translating translating
this little wearable uses translation
technology to allow two people to speak
different languages but still clearly
understand each other simply put when
one person speaks the other here is it
in their language developing the pilot
has been an intensive process our team
has been working over two years andrew
is original co-founder and overseas
prior development I'm an electrical
engineer and expert and manufacturing we
also have mechanical engineer software
engineer PhD in machine translation as
well as an industrial designer our wide
breadth experts has allowed us to
develop a product from the ground up we
wanted to create something that hugs the
curves of the year without being
obtrusive something snug but fashionable
to wear in the process we just decided
to throw in an extra earpiece for
wireless training music that means the
full system includes two earpieces and
its accompanying app it's from the app
itself where all of the languages are
uploaded to the earpiece it's kind of an
end-all solution for the traveler or the
international professional that's what
we're doing here at Waverly valves it's
simply the most advanced communication
wearable
this IndieGoGo campaign helps us finish
what we started we can get the ear
pieces along with this portable charger
manufactured in delivered within a year
the app works on its own if you just
want to use the app for basic
translation and we'll have the app out
by late summer first for our backers
here in indy gogo but for the full
experience you really want the ear
pieces too it's the dream you know a
life untethered free of language
barriers it's just that it's no longer
dream anymore it's real
bye
we all want to keep track of the things
that matter the most to us every year
millions of pets cars bikes and even
children are lost or go missing wouldn't
it be great if your smartphone can keep
you connected to the things you love no
matter where they are could help you
find them anywhere in your neighborhood
or even in surrounding cities
introducing the iota tracker the world's
smallest real-time GPS tracker with a
rechargeable battery and no monthly fees
other tracking solutions on the market
are too big have monthly fees that
quickly add up and need to be recharged
every few days but the iota is not just
about tracking using the iota tracker
app you can also set up a virtual fence
and receive an alert or email anytime
your eye ohta enters or leaves an area
around your home if you're away from
home the iota tracker app lets you see
that your dog walker has taken your dog
out for a walk when you expect it and
for how long you expected we've managed
to cram all these features into one
small waterproof and durable thumb-sized
tracker the iota also gets great battery
life two to four weeks and will even
send you an alert when it needs a
recharge you get all these great
features with no monthly fees because

signals instead of an expensive cellular
network subscription each iota starter
kit includes a home base at no
additional cost simply connect it to
your home Wi-Fi network and you can find
your pet down the street or near any
home base in the surrounding area
they'll all be on the lookout for your
pet each home base covers a large area a
half miles per mile around
you're home far more than Bluetooth or
Wi-Fi doesn't take very many home bases
to cover an entire city there are
already hundred set up in the San
Francisco Bay Area and in other cities
across the u.s. soon there will be great
coverage in your community the network
is increasing everyday and it's all free
to use so visit our website today and
see how iota can help you to never lose
sight of what's important
I never really thought it was a problem
I'd always suspected those around me had
seen my incessant pen clicking me
shaking and desk tapping but i had no
idea how bad they're gone
I just figured it all the time with
anything I could get my hands on didn't
matter what a bubble wrap oh the bubble
wrap the way pop pop popped
I just couldn't get enough that was
probably wrong
thankfully my Kickstarter community told
me
from the people that brought you to add
comes over the counter fidget cube
fidget cube is a final desk toy designed
to satisfy any urges to click roll spin
and other common fidgety impulses
without driving your colleagues and
loved ones away
the GQ is a cube that you fidget with
studies have suggested that fidgeting
increases focus and improves
productivity side effects may include a
sudden ability to cope with boring
meetings pay attention in class power
through netflix marathons which at cube
is designed to allow discreet visiting
in any setting do not use fidget cube if
you have an aversion to rectangular
prisms fidget cube let's be satisfying
my fidgeting without endlessly annoying
those around me I thought I could stop
at any time and now I realize I don't
want him fidget cube can help take the
first step to fidgeting freedom today
okay so in all seriousness we may joke
about fidgeting we give our friends and
co-workers a hard time for the pen
clicking and the nail-biting but what if
there aren't something what opinion is a
coping mechanism a way for us to sleep
focus the more present in a moment some
science is smarter than us believe that
we have this thing called floating
attention which makes it hard for us to
focus in certain circumstances okay hey
Mark yeah yeah and actually fidgety has
been shown to be able to help keep that
floating attention occupied which helps
you better focus on the task at hand
what's maybe even a little crazier is
that some recent studies have suggested
that students who use fidgeting as a
mechanism during test taking tend to
perform better on those tests and when
their arts itself
Bridget cube has been a project we've
dreamt about for almost four years now
and we're excited to finally be bringing
it to you it's been a long road with a
lot of prototypes but we think we're
going to love it when designing fidget
cube we wanted to ensure two things
first the functionality needed to truly
satisfy fidgeting needs it needed to be
an entire toolbox of fidgety options
while staying small and compact which
leads us to our second and equally
important priority we wanted fidget cube
to be a premium desk toy that could be
discreetly used in any situation from a
classroom to a boardroom the fidgets
cube of course has six sides
Bridge
we really think fidgety has so many
different applications and we're so
important to you trying out lockers
thank you so much for your support
