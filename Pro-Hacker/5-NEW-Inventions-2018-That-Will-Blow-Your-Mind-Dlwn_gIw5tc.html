few moments at the age of 27 I never
thought my back would make me feel this

on your sensitive spots it's built
simple but strong Hey there are other
ways of fixing your stupid back and yet
chiropractors are great but they're not
always convenient and you have to keep
paying every time your back hurts it
adds up yeah I recommend the plexus will
for all my patients recommended by our
other tools that claim they can solve
your back pain plastic not needing hooks
foam rollers the problem with foam
rollers is they aren't designed to go
between the shoulder blades they don't
offer that same deep muscle really
stretches the plexus wheel oh and
they're not just great for back pain
relief my wife uses her plexus wheel for
yoga and exercise I'll never understand
why there's so much hating on yoga pants
I love when she exercises really though
everyone can use the plexus wheel young
people old people even Gary for my team
