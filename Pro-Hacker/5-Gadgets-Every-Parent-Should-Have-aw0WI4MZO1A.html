swim safe uses patented RF technology to
monitor swimmers anywhere around water
set the swim level for each swimmer put
on the band and let the kids splash and
have fun the swim safe hub stays in
constant contact with every band
checking in several times a second if a
swimmer is submerged for too long the
hub and bands will alert parents and
lifeguards with flashing lights and
sirens develop by physicians designers
and engineers seal swim safe gives kids
and parents the confidence to learn to
swim without inhibiting their fun get
steel swim safe for your family
while working on my PhD I realize that
sixty-second could change the world
that's because it only takes 60 second
of UV LED light to kill the germs that
have plagued humankind since the
beginning of time just 60 seconds
underdeveloped immune systems are unable
to fight off deadly germs and viruses
which is why there is le the world's
first portable medical grade sterilizer
just place your baby's bottle pacifier
or teething ring into le and in 60
seconds it's germ-free UV light
particularly UVB particular type of UV
kills all sorts of germs including
viruses bacteria and fungi by damaging
their DNA or RNA Ellie runs on a
rechargeable battery and it's very
compact so you can take it anywhere and
while it's great for bottles and binkies
le consider eyes anything that fits into
the chamber including water for mixing
formula small toys or even breast pump
accessories just put it into the Le and
in 60 seconds it's safe to use Ellie's
true violet UV digital technology kills
germs and viruses at the core by
breaking their DNA strand including
antibiotic resistant superbugs
we clearly do need to have available
portable devices for when we're carrying
around food or other items such as baby
bottles or other types of things that
might become contaminated and
particularly with their more vulnerable
populations such as a very young child
true violet technology also has many
promising applications that address
global concerns such as air and water
sterilization especially in areas
without centralized water supply or
electricity
and 60 seconds is all it takes
