precision performance industrial robots
are too expensive and hard to use
however they could save you time at home
help you do creative work or learn new
technologies so why keep these benefits
away from you meet near yo won the first
accessible six access robotic arm
Miriah one is a low-cost and
user-friendly robot made out of 3d
printing and open-source technologies it
was created so everyone can use it for
makers Merial one can help you learn
robotics and be your perfect coworker it
can easily pick and place many kinds of
objects for example to automate a 3d
printer do anything your imagination can
create just by easily changing the
end-effector tool with Nero one
reproduce industrial use cases such as
drilling or drawing on any surface with
any orientation
Nerio one is great for robotics
education for students to learn but also
for children they can get to know more
about new technologies and get some
programming basics so much fun involved
near yo one will also save you some time
and daily life so you can relax and do
the things that matter the most
controlling Merial one is so easy you
can teach the robot what you wanted to
do just by moving it with your hands

you can use the mobile and web
applications to have more control over
the robot and control it from a remote
place near you one will be connected to
the Internet
oh and it means you can also get free
software upgrades and you can share
programs with your family friends and
other people around the world we
specially thought about makers and
developers by making most of our code
open-source STL files for 3d printing
will also be released you will be able
to program directly on the robot with
many api's and the source code it's a
great way to learn robotics and do
useful stuff with Arduino Raspberry Pi
and robot operating system we are
passionate robot makers who want to
spread the world with easy-to-use
low-cost and useful robots time has come
for robotics to get out of factories and
help people having a better life and
better technology education please focus
on Kickstarter to help bringing
accessible robots to everyone and thank
you for both

joso story started two years ago when
the very design studio that please guide
Jim Barney and Carmen came up with the
concept they wanted to connect the
digital world to the real world not from
a screen that you can add ink Joe
Sarah's been through loads of prototypes
hardware incubator software and
electronic development and now it's
ready to go and it's an award winner -
turns out people love Java people like
the artist in Illustrator Anthony
Burrell enables you to take work from
the front screen that is very perfect
almost too perfect and it takes it into
the real world and it gives it a
personality it's not just artists to see
the potential of Giotto here's Jim the
idea of guy it's awesome seeing how just
inspires people everyone that sees it
all seems to come up with a new thing
they wanted a job people want to make do
lists and love notes to information and
we've made sure that it works with all
the absolutely love including slack
Spotify even Amazon Alexa the notion of
being able to create these these pieces
of art live in a real world space with
no screams that's that's just that's
completely new those design studio works
alongside product design experts and
electronics engineer to hone the nuts
and bolts of Java every detail is a
thing of beauty
worthy of hanging on your wall the team
has worked closely with manufacturers
based in Shenzhen to ensure the pricing
is realistic and production is viewable
so to celebrate the launch of jostle on
Kickstarter we've got something special
lined up in 365 days of art that means a
brand new image from a top illustrator
on your wall every day for a year
started as a small team with a good
respect everything into this to get it
ready to go
and we're so close that it's simply not
going to happen to our Kickstarter so
help us make it a reality so the
question is what will you job
