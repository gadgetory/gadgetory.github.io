fly drones has triggered a rise in the
number of incidents where the safety and
security of individuals and facilities
has been compromised drones have
infiltrated the security of heads of
state delivered contraband into prisons
photographed private film sets and the
property of celebrities attempts to
protect using conventional weapons have
failed sky wall 100 has the ability to
quickly and easily neutralize a drone
threat by physically capturing a drone
in a net and controlling its descent to
the ground it combines a compressed gas
powered launcher with an intelligent
projectile this portable system provides
a highly mobile and cost-effective
method of dealing with drone threats the
launcher is equipped with a smart scope
to assist in precise targeting the
operator acquires a target while
receiving constant feedback from the
smart scope the on-board computer tracks
the targets flight path and calculates
the required projectile trajectory to
intercept a hovering or moving drone the
smart scope responds forcing the
operator to adjust their aim vertical
adjustments account for range while
lateral adjustments allow the operator
to accurately lead a moving target when
the smart scope is locked on to the
target a solid tone indicates the system
is ready to launch
the only way to completely neutralize a
drone whether it's being flown manually
or autonomously is to physically
intercept it the system can be rapidly
reloaded allowing multiple drone threats
to be quickly engaged by a single
operator skywarp projectiles can carry a
range of countermeasures the sv40
includes a parachute which controls the
descent of a captured drone this
minimizes the risk of any collateral
damage and keeps the drone intact
allowing for forensic investigation and
identification of the perpetrator if the
operator misses the parachute will still
deploy and safely return the tethered
components for reuse other features can
also be included such as audible and
visual alarms and tamper proof marking
systems the system is de-energized when
not in use so it is safe to handle and
transport sky wall captures drones

you
the most germs infested objects in your
home are your towels as we use them they
retain moisture allowing bacteria to
breathe why not use paper towels
according to the Rainforest Action
Network that's not exactly the best
alternative how about these wait that
wouldn't work in my home unless stop
using bacteria-infested raves and help
save the environment introducing home
drug have you ever wondered why you've
never seen a hand dryer in someone's
home maybe you thought about this or
maybe it never crossed your mind a group
of people from different backgrounds
such as business design sales in
chemistry got together to build a
perfect home and dryer we've all seen
them before in public restrooms but
they're bulky they're loud and very
expensive it took dozens of concepts and
prototypes hundreds of experimental
simulations thousands of hours of
craftsmanship and an infinite amount of
patience to bring you home drive a
cordless beautifully designed compact
and affordable bathroom and kitchen home
and dryer home dry is not only
environmentally friendly it has a
built-in patented blue UV light to kill
bacteria that even soap can't get you
hands-free with a rechargeable battery
and wall mountable home dry will change
your everyday life at home home dries
industrial motor pumps out heated HEPA
filtered air at two times the speed than
a traditional hand dryer
thus we bring you an industrial products
small enough for your home that dries
your hands in 14 seconds palm dryers
rechargeable battery less 1920 sessions
and on the average 480 days the
removable base doubles as an extra
battery and charging port an LED battery
indicator shows you when battery needs
to be charged when mounted on the wall
simply plug in and used while charging
or remove the battery and charged
separately we are so confident about
what we have created and are excited to
bring home drive market please help us
reach our goal so we can afford to
produce home drug at an affordable price

have you ever thought about creating
electricity from plants using the very
nature of leaves as a solar panel months
of investigation and development here in
BO have shown successful results but
anyways let's just get to the point this
is my phone charger a plant yes and no I
am NOT crazy just bear with me and I
will explain how all of this works we
generate electricity from plants
photosynthesis and this is all you need
the cable a phone and a plant this
system collects electricity during the
whole day and night and uses it to
charge your smartphone whenever you need
it
just like with any other phone charger
it doesn't to plug in the USB cable for
the system to work use the cable you
already own like your device because any
phone works just fine and there you go
eurosam plant is recharging your awesome
phone creating the greenest and most
efficient electricity ever seen now
let's take a look deeper inside we have
created a binary biological cell with a
solid biomass layer and the biological
micro organic solution which activates
in touch with water between these layers
we find the internal electrical circuit
to store the energy and the cavity to
create an oxygen flow inside above the
system we have installed a special
semipermeable grillage to contain the
soil and allow the water to filter and
purify
firstly remove the USB cable from the
inside of the plant pot then add some
water to begin the activation process
other microorganisms allowing them to
distribute around the system now is the
moment for you to add a plant and
corrupt the gaps with some extra soil
then the organic substances generated
from photosynthesis are attracted
downwards without harming the plant in
any way these substances serve as
nourishment for our bacteria which have
been previously isolated using our
patented secluding process they break up
the waste and some electrons are set
free and travel through the nano wires
created by these bacteria from one
electrode to the other in the most
efficient way at the same time water is
generated due to an excess of hydrogen
the current is driven toward the
accumulator supplying the USB connection
for you to charge your device now is the
time for you to place your bio light
wherever you want charge your smartphone
your tablet ebook or similar devices so
now that you understand how all of this
works let's rewind a little bit after
row our main goal does an early
consistent selling plant pots by
supporting us with bio light you're
contributing for a much greater goal our
aim is to be part of a revolution
to cover the whole world with trees so
if plants nourished ourselves in the
past they will nourish our cities in the
future
I'm excited to introduce to you one of
the most innovative products in the
world of watersports in a long time the
big speak jet
the Bigsby jet is a mini water
propulsion device designed to attach to
virtually anything you want to motorized
in water attach it to your kayak you can
attach to your stand-up paddleboard and
if that wasn't enough we've developed a
submersible battery pack that you can
attach to your big speech at and at
about 5 pounds you know of the world's
first and only portable diver propulsion
vehicle this is going to change the way
we interact with our water sports the
possibilities are endless we can
motorized virtually anything the big
speech jet can push a kayak up to about
seven miles an hour you can go a lot
further
you can fight current you can fight win
you can explore places that you weren't
able to before
we've built in dozens of features to
make this a truly versatile and modular
product most importantly we wanted to
make sure you can use your existing
watercraft there is no need for you to
purchase a new kayak or used on the
paddleboard we've spent the past 18
months working on this amazing product
we've sourced all the parts we've tested
them in every body of water you can
imagine we've been to 11 major
iterations of the big speed jet and at
every turn you've improved it you've
made it better we've made it more
efficient and now it's ready for you
with your support we can produce 500
units which is the minimum we need to
make the big fees affordable support our
Kickstarter campaign and help us bring
this amazing product to life thank you
and see you on the water
you
let's face water can be lots of fun
until we need to drink it sure we know
it's healthy but it just doesn't taste
as exciting as all those flavored drinks
which means we drink a lot less water
and a whole lot more of that Chuck hey
and that's a problem a very big problem
so we decided to put some fun into
drinking water with the right cup it's
the world's first ever fruit flavored
cup designed to get people drinking more
water sure it might look simple but it
actually took six years of research and
patented technologies to get where we
are today and we believe it's gonna be a
real game food so how does it work
health for starters our brain identifies
flavor using two main senses taste and
smell that's why we inserted innovative
fda-approved fruit scent and flavor
directly into the right cup so when you
drink water from it your nose picks up
the fruity aroma your tongue senses the
hint of a sweet taste and your brain
yells when in fact you're only drinking
natural water but does it work well we
asked ourselves that very same question
so we put the right cup to the test with
our orange flavored prototype whoa okay
Wow
you're kidding me right what's in this
it's not just water it tastes like
something else
just water it's crazy brilliant just
brilliant now that we know that it works
let's meet the team behind the idea for
years have been researching and
lecturing about scent marketing showing
how easy it is to manipulate the brain
with smell when I was 30 I was diagnosed
as diabetes and my doctors told me to
drink only water but I hated the taste
that's when I came up with the idea for
the right cup
after years of research and development
we've reached the stage where we need
your support to turn the right cup into
a reality the right cup is great for
anyone who wants to cut down on sugary
drinks and drink more water which is
basically everybody please help us
change lives of millions of people by
supporting our project on IndieGoGo
together we can make a real difference
and turn the world into a better and
healthier place one cup at a time
let's make drinking water fun again
let may I add to your list carrots
what is button we created the button
device for us humans to serve as a
physical touch point to the Internet it
is simple and intuitive everyone knows
how to use it just press it button tells
the end result of the press companies
distribute buttons to their clients or
point of sale to create a shortcut to
their services order a taxi food
maintenance services place reorders in
online stores or gather customer
feedback with buttons companies can turn
their products or services on demand by
offering super simple one press orders
or service calls some said they wanted a
smaller button something that is more
subtle it can deliver the same magic so
now we're proud and happy to introduce a
little sister or brother to the button
button mini it's not the songs but it's
packed with the same magic button mini
has three different communications
alternatives to choose from mobile
theta6 Fox and Wi-Fi but some mini has a
rechargeable battery lasting 4000
presses per charge the button back end
is the coolest thing of all it lets you
easily integrate buttons with your
existing infrastructure for example have
your service respond to the button being
pressed and then also deliver your
response back to the button for showing
green or red light to the end user
button actions are configured from the
cloud platform that comes in the same
package we're also introducing button
for commerce API which is a secure easy
and scalable way to deploy button as
part of any purchase ordering or other
commercial backend
what does that mean simple with a press
of a button you get your order done paid
and delivered it can't get any easier
than that press the button and the magic
happens
