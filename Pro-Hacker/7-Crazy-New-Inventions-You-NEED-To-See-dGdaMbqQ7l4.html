factory that fits on your tabletop it
works with any vacuum cleaner and a
whole selection of different materials

bed the form box molds a 3d shape in
seconds take it out and start a
production line right from your tabletop
so you can bring your first collection
of products to life
start a business from your kitchen table
use everyday items to customize your
creations work with different materials
even chocolate so you can make
professional-grade products good enough
to eat sometimes you don't want to
design something from scratch explore
our online library of projects to see
what other makers around the world are
sharing even use maker machines like
your 3d printer with the four box
multiply versions of your prototypes
without the weight and get a factory
level of finish from your home or studio
we've meticulously designed the form box
to fit with your life and your ambitions

tell me do you enjoy a nice glass of
wine I think you might and so you know
that as good as wine is when you open a
bottle it only tastes that way for about
a day but now with cuvee because cuvee
has a super smart bottling and
dispensing system that keeps oxygen from
touching the wine this is what you order
and this is how you pour it the screen
tells you what you're drinking tells you
how much there is left to drink shows
you the story of the wine lets you rate
the wine and even order more hey guys
what are we drinking well I was gonna
open a red and I've been craving a
Chardonnay
possi now that's a problem what are you
gonna do open two bottles no I've read
it's fine no it's fine no with cuvee you
can have that Chardonnay you're crazy
knock yourself out for both take it
apart
as one friend who loves his rose a live
person the rest of us not so much with
cuvee you can choose between hundreds of
varietals styles and vineyards in order
from the cuvette online store or even
from the bottle this means you can keep
more wines around and not worry about
wastage oxygen never gets into this
bottle so every glass you pour will
taste amazing for up to 30 days
drink what you want always fresh one
glass at a time your skin tells a story
it's the story of how you live your life
outside connected to the things that
matter to you but if your skin could ask
for something it would ask for
protection because there are over 1
million cases of skin cancer per year in
the United States alone
the problem with sunscreen you can't see
if it's actually protecting you
sunscreen is like an invisible armor so
how do you know if it's worn off how do
you know if you've applied enough to
protect your skin hi I'm Dave founder
and creator of sunscreen er sunscreen is
a special camera that shows you the UV
rays that sunscreen blocks when you look
through sunscreen er protected skin
appears dark unprotected skin appears
lightly you can actually see the spots
where water sand or sweat has worn away
your protection whether you just need a
quick look at your kids skin or you want
to check your own protection sunscreen
er has you covered I love spending time
outside with my family but I've always
been concerned about skin damage my goal
in creating sunscreen er was to find an
easy way for my family to protect
ourselves while we enjoy be outdoors so
I took technology that was previously
only accessible to scientists and made
it accessible to all of us sunscreen er
is easy to use waterproof and durable
it's smaller than a granola bar yet as
powerful as a multi thousand dollar
camera
it's perfect for everywhere the beach
the soccer field your favorite fishing
hole even the golf course and it helps
us protect our skin and our loved ones
from sun damage
your skin story should be about doing
the things you love protect it
with sunscreen err
we all love listen to music on our smart
devices the whole thousands of songs and
are easy to use the cramming so many
features into one device comes at a cost
and that cost the sound quality if you
have ever listened to high-end audio
equipment
you know that sound is richer louder and
has a superior base but then I'll go
back to listen to music on my smartphone
or mp3 player which just can't match
this out every year we get better
resolution screens plus the computers
and more gigabytes why is the audio
pentatonic so that's why we created um
you am piece of tiny headphone and fly
that fits in your pocket and works with
all your music classes now for the first
time you have high end audio sound on
your portable devices it's really easy
to set up um just plug um into your
audio device plug your headphones into
em and that's it now you can listen to
music the way the artist intended you
can't take your hi-fi system with you
when you leave the house but with um you
can and it fits right in your pocket you
can listen to music while you're walking
or on the bus um has a 10-hour battery
life so you can take it with you
anywhere if you have a nicer set of
headphones you know they don't go loud
enough
um allows your headphones to go two and
a half times louder without sounding
distort and it makes your regular
earbuds sound great too and if you love
your vase
um has different EQ modes which includes
an extra base setting experience movies
the way they were meant to be feel like
you're sitting in the cinema
do you listen to Pandora or Spotify
well we design you amp to make streaming
music sound even better you ant even
works in your caste so you won't miss
out on great sound even on the way to
work through the use of multi-layer PCB
technology micro sized components and a
tiny computer to handle it all we've
been able to take what's normally inside
a large device and fit it into a compact
convenient package with incredible sound
there are so many other uses for your
web like computer games speakers and
even plug your headphones into your TV
we finished the prototype now we need
your help to manufacture and deliver the
best audio experience you've ever had
hi I'm Laura Enzo our robotic
engineering student and a commuter every
day I take the train going to my
University
it takes me one and a half hour of
walking every single day really too much
time I think a lot of you are in the
same situation and we all know that
commuting is both stressful and time
consuming this made me think I'll to
move more quickly and with less effort
I needed something portable that I could
carry on train and even in class for
this reason I created vault there's more
less and lightest electric vehicle in
the world both is more than just an
electric board is the most portable
vehicle out there it's an amazing mean
of stands for powerful lightweight easy
to use as marked as more great
revolution in the world of mobility
both to let you save time on your daily
commute and three more for your favorite
activities it has a top speed of 21 km/h
and it's just as fast as a bicycle it
has a range of about 10 kilometer more
than what you need for the short daily
commute in the city with a length of 60
centimeters is the smallest electric
skateboard in the world with a weight of
4 kilograms is light enough to be
carried even when not in use with no
effort on your backpack or by hand to
build the balls I got help from my
father a photographer electronics
engineer and drawers maker after one
year of prototyping and testing this is
the final version the battery and
electronics are embedded in the wooden
body he has a powerful motor of 2,000
watts of power and it can go up hill and
start from a full stop the inside
batteries are so powerful that can
recharge your devices on the go to the
built-in USB port you can even recharge
completely your iPhone up to 20 times
with the remote controller driving bolt
is easiest playing a video game
whoa I see thank you
well it's Italian design bold is both
modern and practical and it's deck is of
the right size for a comfortable and
safe landing it also has the brake to
stop safely you can think bought like a
compact longboarder he has a larger
track for more stability he has bigger
wheels to overcome every obstacle on the
street mode is marked with bluetooth for
connectivity we are going to develop a
smartphone app and also integrate it
with wearables both as extremely low
running cost and let you save money on
fuel a complete recharge for entire year
will be less than five dollars on the
build and when the sun goes down turn on
the lights and continue to skate we
believe that everyone deserves a better
way to move
we want to make both the most affordable
for anyone but to cap down cost we need
an economy of scale our manufacturers
are ready but now we need your help to
start production abroad that's why we're
here on IndieGoGo if you like the
project please tell your friends and
support us to receive amazing perks
thank you I think we can all agree that
we're living in the future right now
Jennifer here has a smartphone that
enables her to auto ride home control
the temperature turn on the lights -
face it we're living in a technological
Wonderland and yet here we find Phil
Phil's forgotten the combination of his
travel log is the current solution to
that problem
we live in an era filled with
technological marvels and yet this is
what happens when Phil forgets a lot
combination is that the best we can do
no because we live in an era where the
air vault exists the air bolts is a
travel lock you control with your
smartphone it's a lot the future
deserves a lock with customizable
security settings this airball opens
whenever my phone is within bluetooth
right well maybe you don't trust anyone
in your lives that's fine the settings
on this airball require me to went to a
password into the app well maybe your
air bolts been stolen that's fine too
because you can set your air ball to
activate an alarm when it moves too far
away from your home or you can activate
the alarm manually drop that man
it's the justice
the future deserves hi Bill hi tell them
what happened bill I lost my bag you
lost your we live in a world where I can
use my smartphone to one of my sleeping
patterns but Bill here can't find his
bag if bill had been using the air bolt
instead of some antique you could have
located it using the air box
crowd-sourced GPS networks what if you
lose your phone well you can still
unlock your air ball by logging in from
another device well you can enter our
backup button code using your hands like
some kind of prehistoric man
the air vault has a rechargeable battery
which only needs to be charged once a
year by a standard microUSB connector
it's CSA approved so f of security is
not an issue the app will record a
history of every time you've locked and
unlocked your airport you can even share
access to your ever with your friends so
you'll be able to unlock it from the
other side of the world thanks pal
you're welcome buddy
and look how small it is seriously look
at it it's really small a volt
it's the travel lock we all deserve
what if filming took care of itself if
you were able to swim explore and dive
while your camera follow

well divers run to exploring marveling
at the beauty of the ocean and bringing
back memories of our underwater
adventures if you're like us you know
how cool it is to share your diving
experiences with people on land you also
know how filming gets in the way of
simply enjoying the moments which is why
we dive in the first place that's why a
year ago we had the dream with imagine
an autonomous underwater drone that
follows you during your - lets you
capture beautiful footage hands-free so
you can focus on the diving now above
all is in pass of becoming a reality
this camera is completely autonomous
autonomous means that you don't have to
do anything at all
we've created and patented an underwater
localization technology it enables
ibubble
to know where you are and to keep you or
your surroundings in the frame now you
can record your diving adventures with
no camera handling whatsoever ibubble
comes loaded with a built-in library of
carefully designed camera movements all
you have to do is choose your shot from
the control bracelet and I bubble
execute the results are incredible
beautiful underwater footage from
completely new perspectives you might
wonder how I bubble performs when you
have let's say a specific close-up to
shoot good question you just call I
bubble back with your bracelet grab it
and film as you want when you're done
let ibubble go and it goes right back to
follow mode we've all dreamed of
following a tell tale or month away
while it swim fast and far away so we've
enabled eye beable to do just that all
by itself press the target locking
button for a few seconds and eye bubble
will recognize the shape it needs to
follow release it and watch as it glides
by turtles and sharks capturing what's
out of your reach we've designed all the
features in close collaboration with the
diving community and professionals from
the underwater world when application
puja bubbles with a duty to the bottom
companies GCE
domine
oh yeah liebherr Zuma the Coon hunts
redundant community he doesn't the same
tone she a Manny booyah in that
competence but is a talk to my shrine
can be able to know keep it on longer
you will you this anymore
you know everything it's just expands
usually the type of things that I can
create so how does the future prison one
Porsche in the heavily Chantal sensitive
enough I can't wait to have my own eye
today with the work we've done and the
team we've built we know we can make
above all a reality the last thing we
need is your help if we reach our goal
will access the whistles is needed to
deliver a bubble next year with more
fans will have even more features so by
I beable today thank you from the entire
eyeball team</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
