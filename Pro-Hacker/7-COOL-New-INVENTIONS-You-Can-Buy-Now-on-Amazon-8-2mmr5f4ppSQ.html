changed forever and since then it hasn't
stopped her a second
this April we're returning to
Kickstarter to drive it another step
forward imagine total control over your
iPhone's camera like never before with
no less than five external buttons just
like a real DSLR imagine a more
comfortable and safer drip for taking
pictures one-handed even with gloves
imagine being able to connect it to a
tripod for much sharper pictures and
connecting it to almost anything you
want unleash the power of your iPhone's
camera for better pictures time after
time picked off DSLR your iPhone
smartphones are a brilliant invention
they function as our camera our GPS our
flashlights and even as our entire
computer app developers do their best to
make user interface as simple and
intuitive as possible to play music roll
your eyes message sent to mom but
sometimes it's easier to manage things
with a physical controller meet Nemean
Busey the inventors of pressing a new
way to control and automate your
everyday smartphone action Pressey is a
tiny physical button that connects to
your headphone jack and sends unique
signals to an intuitive app that can
activate one of many commands here are
some of the many things you can do with
your press e take instant photos and
upload them to your favorite social
network turn on your LED light send your
location for emergencies start a
discreet tape recording don't tell
everyone but I like birds check into
your favorite social network and much
more pressing is not just a one-trick
pony
you can easily configure the Pressy app
to execute different actions for
different sequences of clicks for
example - short quick scan call your mom
and too long clicks can call your dad
but what if you want to use your
headphones just let press e rest in the
special key chain and use the headphone
button as pressing it also still works
press e even has an API so developers
can bring you more cool features this is
where Nemean Busey asked for your help
press e need your love the 2,000 people
support press e and order one Mimi and
Busey will be able to mass-produce press
e press e the almighty button
more than 40% of our lives are spent in
habit for most of us that time is wasted
the secret to transformation is not to
try harder it's to replace bad habits
with the habits of excellence if you
wanted to transform yourself how would
you start first identify the habits that
hold you back
paired them with a negative stimulus
like electric shock each surge of
voltage trains your brain and weakens
the neural connection until the bad
habit is severed next replace the bad
habit with a positive one reward
yourself when you complete your daily
goal commit to a penalty if you fail the
fear of loss stimulates your basal
ganglia while the chance of reward
motivates your prefrontal cortex in
fewer than 30 days the action becomes a
habit
Havelock is the first system designed to
help you build good habit and break bad
ones earn rewards when you succeed pay
the price when you fail and experience
the electric shock that keeps you on
track
