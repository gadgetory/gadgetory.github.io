to all of it it's easy how do we know
because we've made it at DJI we created
the flying camera as you know it and
there's a good chance that the drone
videos you've seen online were shot with
one of our cameras this time we started
small but you can drink fake we created
your first personal throne but we're
still squeezing in big power it
automatically follows you or whatever
you want without a bracelet or tracker
avoid obstacles and comes packed with a
full case stabilized camera 27 minutes
flight time and a whole lot more this is
the DJI Mavic pro and this is the DJI
Mavic pro unfolding to make it this

stuff right now
it's got 24 high-performance computing
cores dual satellite connectivity and
all new transmission system with a 4.3
mile range for vision sensors and more
sound complicated it's not it's easy
the Mavic knows where it takes off from
where it is in the air where it's going
and what is captured
when you take off the Mavic uses 2
vision sensors and connects with up to
20 satellites also it can remember your
location this means the Mavic knows
where home is so it can return by itself
precision landing technology means it
can land almost exactly where you took
off at the touch of a button as you fly
satellite systems keep track of you
working in harmony with all four vision
sensors telling it what's below and
what's in front whether you are flying
beside a cliff in a forest or even
indoors just like you Maddux T's and
things that means it can avoid the
things in its path from trees to walls
any good flying camera feet
stabilization the Maddux expertly
miniaturized gimbal it's the entire
camera steady
unlike electronic stabilization we use
every pixel from the sensor and you
don't have the weight of a bulky add-on
camera shooting an epic tracking shot of
a friend is easy active track technology
means it just takes a few taps not just
one kind of tracking shot either it got
spotlight profile and trait or youth tap
light to tap and flock
Terrain follow mode keeps thematic at a
height you define as the ground right so
you can focus on your shot not your -
everything can be controlled using a
gamepad size controller you can keep in
your pocket it opens up to clamp around
your phone and has been custom
engineered to give you more feedback and
more accuracy you will always feel in
control if you don't want to bother with
the controller fly using virtual
joystick right from the phone over Wi-Fi
whether you fly with the remote
controller or just your phone active
tracked modes are ready to make you
shoot like a pro want to be on camera
not behind it it just takes a wave and a
gesture then there's the new DJI goggle
strap these on to really feel like
you're flying combine them with sport
mode to get your pulse pumping while you
