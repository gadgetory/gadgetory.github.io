wallet
leaving your wallet behind is the worst
that's why we invented leaf the world's
thinnest most advanced wallet tracking
technology to date leat this super thin
and slides easily into your wallet
without adding annoying bulk and it
works with your smartphone to instantly
remind you if you've left your wallet
behind you forgot your wallet I forgot
my wallet
see and the leaf is smart so when this
happens this happens
bing-bong bing-bong we will notify you
and even drop a pin in your google maps
where your wallet was last within range
and provide you their contact info so
you can call the place and tell them to
hold it for you
what if you just misplaced your wallet
at home before Leif this is what
happened but with Leif things are much
easier almost fun
and you can program leaf to notify you
when your wallet is a certain distance
away that way it isn't constantly going
off at home but might be more sensitive
when you're out and about
that dudes hat was dope right you didn't
even know he was a handsy cordini
beep you won't have to charge the leaf
off thing but when you do it's super
easy leaf charges wirelessly and you
don't even have to take it out of your
wallet lost wallets at up to trillions
of dollars a year and lost money stolen
identities maybe but even if not there's
nothing more annoying than having to
reorder new cards and update your
Netflix card info and whatever leaf
fixes all that stop leaving start
leasing get it
