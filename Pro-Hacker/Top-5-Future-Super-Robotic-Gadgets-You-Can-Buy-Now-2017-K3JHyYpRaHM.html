are always concerned about how to best
communicate with their kids as education
experts say it is crucial for parents to
help kids form good habits in this stage
now we have honey bot the first
educational family robot designed
especially for young kids distinguishing
from other similar products we have
integrated AR technology into
interactive activities for example kids
can draw a picture and then honey bots
will recognize the object and turn it
into animation with educational
explanation and music we have also
prepared many flashcards of diverse
objects with AR technology kids can show
the flashcards - honey Bach and honey
BOTS will display the objects on the
screen in 3d form with explanation to
help kids learn and memorize honey BOTS
habit-forming system was designed to
help parents guide their kids to develop
good habits easily kids can keep a
virtual pet with honey bots like a real
pet you will get hungry dirty and tired
as the pet owners the kids will need to
feed it give it bats
and put it to bed according to different
scenes from such interactions kids will
be able to gradually build good habits
besides it's educating function honey
bot is also designed to help
communication between parents and kids
be more fun and effective parents can
use the voice changing function with
smart phones and send a voice message to
honey pot honey Bob will then play the
message to kids with a funny voice even
when parents are miles away they can
video call their kids and talk to them
face to face
we hope that honey bot becomes the angel
of your home by providing good company
for your kids helping you in your kids
bond and helping kids gain knowledge and
develop good habits considering the
safety issues we only use the safest and
most environmental friendly materials to
make honey bot and we made it into more
of a round shape without sharp angles we
have already finished our MD and small
batch production now we need your help
and support to mass produce honey bot
please support us and make honey bot
into reality
we're kids hack day and during the last
two years we've been running technology
workshops for kids all over the world
based on this experience in our work
with straw bees we have created a major
toy combining programming electronics
and mechanics we call it a quirk but
it's a toy to make toys work but is the
microcontroller toy that anyone can
program it works with Arduino and the
construction toy straw Gea's let's
squeeze on electronics you can connect
components to the legs of the quark pot
by simply squeezing a straw over them
snap on a backpack to add extra
functions with work but it's easy for
anyone to build an interactive project
in an instant the quark part requires no
soldiering or red boarding and you can
recharge it with a standard microUSB
working with kids we have designed an
easy-to-use visual programming interface
that runs directly in your browser so
you can create modify and share projects
with your friends quark but adds life to
your creations bringing motion sound and
light to almost anything regular straws
become the framework for your
imagination
I'm an elephant we believe that making
your own toys should be as fun as
playing with them so order your quark
pot today and start making is your house
this is your car this is your toothbrush
these are your things but these are the
things that matter and somewhere in
between is this guy introducing giba the
world's first family robot say hi G Bo
hi g bo g bo helps everyone out
throughout their day he's the world's
best cameraman by intelligently tracking
the action around him he can
independently take video and photos so
that you can put down your camera and be
a part of the seat Gina take the picture
he's a hands-free helper you can talk to
him and he'll talk to you back so you
don't have to skip a beat excuse me
and yes you bow Melissa just sent a
reminder that she's picking you up in
half an hour to go grocery shopping
thanks G bo he's an entertainer and
educator through interactive
applications g bo can teach let me in or
else i'll ha and all and I'll blow your
house in
hey where'd you go there you he's the
closest thing to a real life
teleportation device he can turn and
look at whoever you want with a simple
tap of your finger
check out my turkey dinner mom I wish
you wouldn't eat the idea baby dirty
pizza I want Turkey visa and he's a
platform so his skills keep expand he'll
be able to connect to your home welcome
home
Eric hey buddy can you order some
takeout for me sure thing
Chinese as usual you know me so well and
even be a great wingman you have a voice
message from Ashley want to hear it
absolutely
Hey call me when you're home better make
that takeoff for two Jibo we've jumped a
bit four years and now he's finally here
and he's not just an aluminum shell nor
is he just a three axis motor system
he's not even just a connected device
he's one of the family's geebo this
little bot of mine what if technology
actually treated you like a human being
what if technology helps you to feel
closer to the ones you love
what if technology helped you like a
partner rather than simply being a tool
that's what she was about that's why I
created this company and I've got the
right team to do it people with a proven
track record of bringing innovative
technologies and exciting content to
market but now we need your help to
build Gebo to bring it to the world and
to grow the community let's work
together to make Tchibo truly great and
together we can humanize technology
in today's hectic world it's getting
increasingly difficult to remember what
truly matters the health of you and your
loved ones but now someone can help with
his artificial intelligence pillow
recognizes each and every member of your
family and starts caring for them
Clara here are your cholesterol pills I
see you're running low shall I really
hope is 100% secure and his skills and
functionalities will grow the more you
use him the more he gets to know you

training session Liza Thank You pillow

have what it takes to make pillow a
reality we now ask you to join us as we
enter the next exciting phase of
bringing our prototype to production
together we can reinvent the future of
personal health thank you guys thank you
below this is Cosmo Cosmo Cosmo Cosmo is
a rambunctious little kid a little bit
mischievous he's smart a lot of robot in
a very small package all the technology
inside of Cosmo is really there for one
reason to bring the magic of robotic
character to life it's a very complex
system and has for transmissions inside
of it with probably 40 or 50 gears each
robot is made out of over 300 different
parts there's the AI systems the
robotics accelerometers the animation
gyros the computer vision we're running
an extremely complicated artificial
intelligence inside the robot which
needs to make thousands and thousands of
decisions per second
he's a mobile manipulator he can drive
around the world he can see you he can
recognize you he looked up at me and his
eyes
whoa and I was like well he just
recognized me gives you goosebumps
because you realize that this is a
little character who actually
understands who you are and what role
you play in his world figuring out the
path to a unique personalities it's an
ongoing question I think we did about
40-50 Studies on just little nuances
looking at the interface with the
monitor where the eyes are going to look
at you gospel moves the headpin and
problems you every little detail have
its special attention paid to it we
literally have a rigged up version of
Cosmo in Maya where our animators can
animate him using the exact same
techniques that they would use for
digital characters except the output
isn't rendered the output is actually
Cosmo behaving in the real world we've
been looking for ways to make it either
feel more organic more imperfect so that
it feels smaller than he made it
sound is a critical piece it's the one
dimension where we have full control
just like in a movie or a video game
we're building his procedural voice
system we're doing all these things so
that as you interact with Cosmo he
becomes his own thing one of the things
that makes Cosmo so surprising and so
lovable is that he defies your
expectations we're creating something
that really does feel like it's part of
the family those are the moments we
usually don't share with machines or
robots until now Cosmo is a pioneer for
the ability to create characters and
tell stories in the real world with this
technology we can make additional
characters with new capabilities new
personalities at a level that we've
never seen before
