Bluetooth speaker classy versatile
durable for nine years the team at can Z
technology have developed and
manufactured om speakers for world
famous brands now they're finally coming
out with their own and it does
everything you've ever wanted in a pair
of portable speakers throw on the
carrying case and you have a super
durable portable device it's
water-resistant and can take a beating
but that's not the best part
go duo can be instantly split into a
stereo speaker system the magnetic base
connects the two speakers together and
allows you to easily attach them to any
magnetic surface making them extremely
versatile when unlinked each half can
play as a standalone speaker when linked
the two speakers will synchronize for a
distinct stereo experience big bass
suite eyes you won't lose sound fidelity
with these babies you can play them
Wireless or use the hidden jack for a
quick hookup clean sleek modern these
are the wireless speakers you've been
waiting for go do a premium sound
anywhere
when you're fishing and you know you you
get a bite and you hook on a fish and
you're reeling that sucker and I mean
you have all that action throughout that
process but then when you catch the fish
and then you take a picture with it you
smile for the camera and you share that
to all your friends saying look at this
cat so we want to make it so that you
can share the actual action go fish cam
Incorporated was developed by me and my
brother and then we developed it to be a
technology for what we found to be an
underserved market there are camera
technologies or fish finders in the
market but what we found was they're not
capturing where the action was and by
seeing which baits are attracting fish
and how a fish might strike just having
the data and learning about those
aspects of fishing will allow you to
make better decisions in what to use and
why and when that's something that it's
very hard to do without an application
like this one of the key features is
that it sits on the line and it works
with your fishing line so it's not gonna
be struck how you fish or your fishing
style and top of that we have infrared
and green lighting around the camera rim
so that you can fish during nighttime or
in darker lighting and then we also have
the depth of it so that can go up to 150
meters underwater as well as the ability
to last for four hours so we really put
in a lot of work into making sure that
when they go fish that they're good news
go fish camp when we started the project
with Go Fish we broke down the process
into multiple steps we started initially
with a conceptual design looking at the
product from a both a visual as well as
a feature benefit standpoint it was
important to us that we had a premium
product that had future benefits that
just weren't available on the market
currently in terms of looking forward to
production the three-dimensional CAD and
mechanical drawings are all completed
the coding for the app is completed at
this point we're really just using
Kickstarter to get ourselves into
production and get this product out into
the marketplace this is a new product
that a lot of people are excited about
and by their support and their backing
of us it's going to allow us to get to
the next step so that we can share our
vision with the
as well it's an awesome technology that
allow you to capture kind of
action-packed footage and share it with
your friends and family and it
definitely bring a lot of the excitement
to the industry
for several days last year my home city
of Seoul had a worst airport in the
world area stayed inside whereas
sometimes the air was even worse my team
was already working on probable indoor
air quality monitor but this inspired us
to make one that's even better
that's how we created Piko Piko combines
numerous sensors into one tiny I mean
really tiny packs that attaches to your
smartphone it includes your laser based
particle sensors for measuring cancer
closing p.m. 10 and PM 2.5 finders
sensors for carbon dioxide and VOCs on
hygrometer for measuring humidity we
even threw in a thermometer for to
measure we made it our smartphone
connected device so you can measure and
track everything through the app because
is almost ready for mass production we
have fully tested our prototype with
half front and an Institute of
Technology we finalize design and we
lined up great Factory now we just need
have fun in the global placards like you
to help us bring people to the world
oh yeah if you're curious about our
technology we have details on everything
on our IndieGoGo page
