first camera that is able to laud your
dive it's also the first to
automatically correct the white balance
to match your depth it records in high
quality and is intuitive to use it has a
long battery life even in cold water
we have designed everything to be
operated while using gloves and it can
be mounted fast and easy the pair lens

electronic image stabilization this
removes shakes and creates a steady and
smooth video to avoid endless gigabytes
of data and make sharing easy we
invented snap record press once to take
a picture and hold to record easy

or Bluetooth and immediately view videos
pictures or snaps depth temperature and
time can be displayed in the video the

hi honey
for the past year we have been working
off a cotton and your desktop personal
fabrication device but Optimus capable
of to be scanning cutting materials as
well as 3d printing you can work with
four axis in subtractive mode to the
print PLA plastic in additive mode and
use the built-in 3d scanner or touch
probe to 3d digital position you may
pick a solid object or make something
new with play scan it and use the
resulting digital model to make a copy
of further adjustment in your favorite
modeling software or share it with your
friends so they can print it in their
materials of choice top/bottom allows a
seamless interaction between the
physical and the digital world you may
self assemble complex objects
fabricating parts and barrios materials
it's also highly customizable and
flexible allowing more tools and
function to be unlocked optimal or
schematics and software source code will
be open for everyone to play with we
design for taught them to be something
that you can add in a room or in your
office we reached a very high printing
volume and printing speed in a 36
centimeters cube toccata will empower
you with new tools but before that we
need you to help us making this possible
objective of this campaign is to found
the final testing and production
allowing us to get the resources and
tools as you can see we already
completed an early prototype we are now
close to finalize the consumer version
which will be even better with your
support
even though we are online 24/7 to all
kinds of smart devices really touching
each other when we're not together it's
still impossible so I started thinking
what if two people could communicate
over a distance by touch touch is a
universal language and hey create new
moments and ways to communicate with
your loved one and the great thing is
you can create your own personal meaning
for a touch what did you like to be
together watching a sports event say hey
good luck or say hey good morning or
just say hey I'm thinking about you your
hey means what you two wanted to do it
can't get much more personal for me it
all started with my oldest son when he
was four years old
and we start a little tradition when we
saw something special first one we would
see would squeeze two times and now we
use it on all kinds occasions sometimes
it's just say I love you five years
later the tradition is still very much
alive I wanted to create something that
made this possible even when we were not
together and to answer this question we
created this little piece of magic
hey enables people to share special
moments by touching each other in real
time whenever wherever you are
hey creates a real natural feel social
touch is vital for forming and
maintaining social connections with
other people think for example of
hugging someone you love or even just
holding their hands or putting your hand
on someone's shoulder these are really
fundamental ways in which we communicate
intimacy and love for the past five
years I've been doing research into
social touch through haptic technology
so technology that you can feel and what
I've seen from my own research and from
research of other people is that there
are parallels between the way that
people experience real social touch and
the way that people experience social
touch through technology imagine that no
matter where you are you're always quite
literally in touch with the people that
you love I think that's that's something
really remarkable
and I think it can really change the way
that people communicate with each other
I have a long-distance relationship and
I will have it for a long time because
it's my my own daughter I have a
long-distance relationship for a short
period of time it's not very easy to be
separated from someone when actually all
I want to do is be together physical
contact is that the mainly thing you
miss in a relationship in a
long-distance relationship
it'd be really nice if there's just
something that you can give him a little
sort of feeling like hey I'm here
thinking about you we're trying to do
this yeah I feel my my my wrists
twitching and they kind of like this
quiz and because like the strap was like
soft you know this quiz felt more like a
like a like a real squeeze like a little
pinch when somebody pinches you it's
very subtle although what I guess
sometimes Jesus need to think that
someone is thinking about you you know
or that you are thinking about the other
person without need to say anything else
it would really add something to our
daily skyping or texting it would be
another way to stay in touch with each
other
you just need to know like I'm here
thinking about you
at this point we have thoroughly tested
our prototype and we are ready now for
the next steps
setting up the production line rolling
out the marketing campaign and therefore
we need snackers help us to spread the
love and bring people together let's
keep in touch
