easier than you've ever imagined to
build projects with drawers which means
you can create projects you might have
only dreamed of before that's because
the drawer slide jig takes the guesswork
and uncertainty out of installing drawer
slides and makes it easier for anyone to
install drawers that fit right and
glides smoothly every time the drawer
slide jig does this by securely
supporting the slide in the exact
position needed as you install them in
the cabinet plus the jig supports the
drawer boxes as well to ensure that the
slides get installed on them with
perfect alignment - whether you're
installing drawers and a cabinet with
face frames or in a cabinet or piece of
furniture without frames the versatile
drawer slide jig clamps in place easily
and the jig works with ball bearing
epoxy coated and under mount slides
using the drawer slide jig couldn't be
simpler
built in tabs register the jigs brackets
in place precisely just align the tabs
with a face frame and then clamp the
bracket in place this positions the
bracket exactly where you needed to
place the jig at the right height and
does it without measuring ensuring
foolproof level positioning of the slide
on frameless cabinets in cases the
process is still simple the brackets
register against the front edge of the
cabinet and clamp in place at the layout
line sitting straight and level every
time once clamped in place the jigs
brackets support the drawer slide
completely providing that third hand
you've always needed to hold the slides
in place no matter how big or heavy the
slide the drawer slide jig holds it in
straight and level so you have both
hands-free to drive in the screws and
the drawer slide jig doesn't stop there
after all the job isn't complete until
the drawer box itself is aligned and
installed that's why the jigs brackets
are reversible so they can be mounted do
protrude out of the cabinet and hold
that drawer box in the exact right
position that allows you to set the
drawer box on the brackets and then pull
the slides into position the sturdy
brackets hold everything in place as you

microjig introduces gripper 3d
push-block
and it's the safest most precise
push-block giving you essential safety
precision and control when feeding work
through a table saw a must-have for any
table saw user it gives you the three
critical forces when cutting on the song
downward pressure to virtually eliminate
kickback and keep the workpiece down on
the tabletop inward pressure to keep the
work against the fence and prevent
Woodburn and forward pressure to advance
the cut and control both sides of the
workpiece the gripper is engineered with
a powerful gripping surface that gives
you far greater control and traction and
the saw blade tunnel allows the table
saw blade to pass through keeping your
hands shielded the entire cut and the
adjustable Center leg slides easily to
accommodate a wide range of cutting
dimensions and keeps a solid hold at the
offcut material using the gripper is
simple and safe place the gripper on
your workpiece slide it against the
fence and guide the cut along the fence
and you'll get a safe cut the gripper is
a fully adjustable push block system
engineered to handle the demands of your
workshop and your full range of projects
and it's amazing when it comes to
handling small work pieces the built-in
balance support drops down and
stabilizes for narrow work material
keeping your gripper square to the fence
the workpiece gets full contact with the
gripping surface to ensure a smooth
clean and safe cut
the precise quarter-inch leg makes the
gripper the most precise pusher in the
world
the proprietary green grip is lined
across the length of the leg to make
sure you have a firm grasp over the
smallest pieces of wood allowing you to
cut down to a quarter inch by quarter
inch all the while your hands are
protected with the gripper
you have your own moving blade guard the
gripper is an extremely versatile piece
of woodworking equipment we've also
introduced gripper advanced comes with
two additional precision accessories the
stabilizing plate gives you two hundred
and fifty percent more stabilizing area
and locks the workpiece against the
fence to enhance the versatility of the
gripper it intelligently maintains even
pressure without binding to create safer
and virtually burnfree cuts the
adjustable spacer adds one inch of
additional gripping surface to tackle
larger material and wider cuts they both
work remarkably well on the router table
the gripper holds the workpiece tight
against the router bit while the
stabilizing plate keeps you grounded and
moving smoothly across the table perfect
for freehand routing the adjustable
spacer is reversible and rises up to
give you extra clearance to pass over
the router bit when doing full profile
work like bullnose routing this takes
care of any uneven deep cuts on the back
end of the wood helping you make the
most of every piece no matter what
project you're taking on the gripper
will give you the control you need with
the precision to win over your biggest
fans with the gripper everything is
safer there are over thirty unique
applications substantially more than any
other push-block
you can use to grippers for ripping
stock longer over 16 inches to virtually
eliminate burning and protect both hands
when working on bigger projects you can
cut a wide range of material types and
sizes and then recreate your stunning
results with consistency without having
to readjust your fence
you can build more projects in less time
with less waste and much safer whether
you're making something for a magical
moment or building something to last a
lifetime work safer work smarter
