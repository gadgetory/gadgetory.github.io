Wi-Fi routers are dumb machines and they
make us act like dumb people yes we
unplugged it these machines work just
fine a decade ago when I only had one
computer but now my house is more
connected devices and I can even count
I want a modern Wi-Fi network that's
reliable and consistent wherever I am in
the house a network that's fast secure a
network that keeps kids like my nephew
out of harm's way
enter luma an intelligent Wi-Fi system
that actually delivers on the promise of
fast reliable internet it surrounds you
with Wi-Fi using technology that was
previously only available to large
companies you put one here another one
there immediately you're up and running
we call it surround Wi-Fi luma is smart
enough to know things like what devices
you're using what networks are
interfering and where potential problem
spots are so it can make smart decisions
to get you the fastest data everywhere
and of course no network should be
without a good security system
I can easily grant people access to my
network and just as easily revoke it
speaking of that I can rest easy knowing
that luma has modern parental controls
so I can limit the kid 2g level websites
and monitor make sure he's not up to any
shenanigans I can even set time limits
or pause the internet like during dinner
time yay awesome yeah go plug this in
I love you speed safety security this is
the future I was promised

friends and I we had an idea to create

family we made a video we went to the
Internet and we launched a crowdfunding

to Hong Kong the team got bigger and we
slept in factories until we shipped the
product then everyone received their new
bags they traveled everywhere they told
their friends and things went crazy
here's the fastest man alive
here's Shaquille O'Neal Tony Hawk Casey
nice that even the Pope got one we got
tons of feedback we listened to everyone
and I mean everyone even got lay with
the bag we took notes of everything we
kept learning improving designing an
executor to change the game again so

better and here is better

us coming back to you in our community
with the result of all of our learnings
and an insane amount of work and with
our products ready to ship to you thank
you for watching and thank you for your
support
let's make it happen so uncle what do
you think now what I heard that actually
you can get laid with this back
you
we love it out there it's how we
meditate it's a workout and a learning
curve it's our eternal playground we
also know how difficult it is to capture
yourself in action with every action
sport bringing instead of unique
challenges
nothing generic works that's why we
created airdog so you can capture your
Radice and most memorable runs
effortlessly airdog is the world's only
self flying action sports drone and
we've developed airdog with custom
flight modes for every action sport to
understand the unique dynamic of each
sport we worked with world-class
athletes we watched their insane skills
and epic moves listen to their feedback
and engineered it all into air dogs
action sports algorithms with custom
flight modes air dog adjust its behavior
depending on the sport to make sure you
get a perfect shot while keeping it safe
at all times surf mode instead of
wasting battery and footage on your
paddle in air dog takes off and captures
the action when you reach the brake zone
rapid directional changes and rotations
are filtered out to give you super
steady footage air dog makes sure it has
enough battery power to return and land
safely on the beach by itself
backcountry snowboarding and skiing
backcountry action demands extreme
precision and sensitivity and with air
leash you get exactly that even the most
extreme elevation changes won't throw
off the ultra precise tracking plus air
dog notifies you when the battery gets
low and gives you enough time to choose
a safe landing spot
mountain biking air dog is super compact
making it ready to go wherever you go
drops kickers and epic trails it's why
you do it
air dog uses lidar a system that will
prevent it from crashing into the ground
as it flies over terrain that's higher
than the terrain that you're riding on
wakeboarding whether you ride cable or
boat we've got you covered in cable Park
mode you just set two points along the
cable line creating a path that air dog
will stay on while following and keeping
the camera aimed at you at all times you
can even save multiple flight paths for
future session set the line and go about
business as usual air dog will
automatically land safely on the initial
takeoff spot so no worries about trying
to land it while you're in the moment in
wakeboarding boat mode you don't want
the drone to ship with every jump flip
or rotation to maintain a smooth shot
leave air leash in the boat and set the
length of the rope air dog offsets the
cameras focus to make sure you always
get a smooth and perfectly framed shot
these are just a few sports airdog is
built for there's more and even more to
come this is why air dog is the only
action sports strong it tracks follows
and stay safe in the most amazing places
and harshest environments you avoid the
hassle risk and costs while capturing
your action
airdog dishes out killer footage from
unlimited perspectives so you can share
your passion improve your performance
and aim higher
