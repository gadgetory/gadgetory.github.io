immersive near eye display with
see-through capability that uses your
smartphone to project panoramic IMAX
like imagery add up to five times the
resolution of VR viewers providing you a
personal theater experience anytime and
anywhere
compatible with most modern smartphones
simply slide your phone in to expand
connect an optional controller or air
mouse and immerse yourself and your
favorite movies shows and apps in
stunning resolution hi I'm will founder
of expanse as a gamer I love the idea of
3d hands-on fully immersive virtual
reality like the rift revived but there
just isn't enough good content out for
these devices and it'll take a while
before there is so with that in mind I
set to work designing a VR device that
would transform the way we use non VR
content like playing video games or
binge watching your favorite movies or
TV shows anyone who's watched a movie in
a gear VR or rift knows how our most of
it is to watch a video in a life-size
virtual theater the current VR devices
just don't have the resolution needed
for movies and games why is that when
the gear vr each IP is a separate
roundish image which uses less than half
of the screen where the standard
rectangular aspect ratio for videos in
most non vr content has to fit within
gear VR square aspect ratio waiting
another half of the pixel this is why
gear VR content is pixelated and suffers
from the so called screen door effect
there just aren't enough pixels width
expand each I can see all of the
displays pixels providing it to 3.6
million pixels per eye almost twice the
resolution of a 1080p TV and five times
more than a movie in gear VR or a rip
the resolution is only half the battle
immersion also requires field of view
other near eye displays are described as
looking like they a 50-inch TV of 8 B as
you can see here this gives you about a
30 degree
you'll review for comparison behind it
is a 10-foot projector screen which
provides a 64 degree field of view and
here is expand and almost twice the
resolution and over 90 degrees field of
view this means you can catch your
favorite movie show or sports game on an
IMAX sized screen in full resolution
anywhere in your house or on the go
fans uses your phone so you can stream
your content anywhere you can get a
cellular or Wi-Fi connection
we've also sourced a full HD display
cartridge that slides into expanse and
connects to your favorite HDMI device
and we're currently working on a 4k
AMOLED cartridge which would provide a
4k feeder experience at 10% the cost of
a similar TV but this is only the
beginning
expenses head tracking and see-through
capability allow you to use it in new
and exciting ways with the stunning
resolution expanse is the single best
way to experience new and immersive 360
content fans doesn't suffer from
pixelation or the so called screen door
effect which can ruin immersion drone
enthusiasts can watch a high-definition
real-time feed from their drones camera
overlaid on the real world letting you
pilot your drones while simultaneously
getting a first-person view of the
flight from the cockpit and gopro heroes
can show off their most recent
adventures the way they were meant to be
seeing while HDR photography enthusiasts
can see their photos on-site in wide
field of view right when they take
expanse also offers new and exciting
challenges for software developers to
begin making the first wave of apps that
utilize our unique see-through design
whether it's a heads-up display a GPS or
an augmented reality pet your
imagination set the limit for what
expanse can do we've been through
countless product design and prototype
iteration we finally arrived at a design
that is comfortable functional and
stylish we have production quotes from
multiple manufacturers including a
handful that are capable of molding
including our unique optics and should
be ready to start production in 12 weeks
we're extremely excited to share expense
start a community so please support and
helped make expand the reality
