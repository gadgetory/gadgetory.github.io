home hey guys it's Dylan from encased
and I'm here to tell you a little bit
about our latest product which I'm
personally very excited about since I
really need it you see I love the new
iPhones that the 7 8 X but this week I
was in the middle of a big phone call
when BAM fallen dead I couldn't charge
it because I was using my headphones we
don't really know why Apple got rid of
the audio jack but we want it back so we
created the audio
it's a high-grade iPhone case that also
has a standard audio jack so you can
plug in any pair of headphones and you
can use your headphones while you charge
your phone the case is also a battery
pack so that gives your phone an extra
battery life to last you the entire day
by the way we didn't just build any
headphone jack our built-in DSP and DAC
chipsets amplify and digitize the signal
to give you premium audio quality which
is usually reserved for high-end
expensive headphones it's probably our
best product yet but it's not our first
here it encased we've manufactured and
sold thousands of quality iPhone
accessories in Amazon we even created a
Bluetooth adapter that makes your bose
QC 15 headphones wireless and that one
sold faster than a cheetah catchiness
lunch our products earned thousands of
five-star reviews on Amazon not too
shabby
anyway the audio mod is already my
favorite product it has made my day that
much less stressful by the way if I
phone cases aren't your thing we are
also making external power banks that
bring back the jack so whether you're
watching netflix blasting your favorite
Spotify song or you're on a three-hour
conference call that demands the
headphones and power the audio mod has
you covered
but this case you will never run out of
battery again and you'll have the
freedom to use any headset you'd like
and charge your phone while you're at it
but most importantly ladies and
gentlemen the jack is back now in order
to bring this product to market we need
to hit our crowdfunding goal to secure
enough demand be the first one to get
the audio mod for your iPhone by backing
our campaign once we hit our goal we
will begin shipping as early as March
2018

hi my name is Martin Kathryn and I
invented Marco Kaur after I injured my
spine on a military mission in
Afghanistan by strengthening the inner
stabilization system with my invention I
got literally back on my feet and I can
now after years tie my own shoes or go
running it's like being born again
exercising with Marco has two aspects
Marco primarily strengthens inner
muscles which stabilize the spine as
support inner organs strengthening the
inner muscles is rather difficult and up
to this point no other tool on the
market has been able to do that a
balanced system of inner muscles is
crucial for pain free movement and
elegant posture and top results in
sports secondly Marco strengthens the
outer muscles as well these muscles are
responsible for movement we can see them
and we like to work them out Marco is
also very efficient in this field and
the results come fast
Marco core is not just a fitness and
Rehab tool it's an object of interesting
design thanks to the design studio of
the University of Arts in Prague Marco
Corps is the perfect fusion of design
and effectiveness no one sided
overworked group of muscles no
disbalance no pain pure perfection Marco
is going to enhance your performance in
every sport okay
almost in every sport a healthy looking
slim waist Marco takes care of that plus
it helps you burn fat easily anybody can
use that after Christmas
the principle of Marco Kaur exercising
is easy yet ingenious Marco's
strengthens inner muscles which support
good posture it's easy and natural age
is just a number with Marco I see this
project is another mission in my life to
be able to help others first we need a
bit of help from you if you think our
path is the right one support Marco and
become a part of Marco's large family
together we can make this work thank you
