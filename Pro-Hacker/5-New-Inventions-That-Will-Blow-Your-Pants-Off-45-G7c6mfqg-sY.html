can available to everyone thank you for
backing us on IndieGoGo to make web
scout a reality
you
you tell yourself you're gonna change
your diet stock your cupboards with
fresh fruit and vegetables
you follow all the latest health blogs
and all those new swanky kitchen
utensils you've got them but life gets
busy and in the way of treating our
bodies how they should be treated the
problem isn't a lack of motivation or
desire to be healthy the problem is a
lack of time at jusa we believe living
healthily should not be the difficult
choice but the easiest choice we have
study the size of habits and it turns
out you don't need to work under
different things to be healthy you'll
need to well one habit a keystone habit
and everything else you start to fall in
planes juicing is one of the simplest
and most effective forms of healthy
living yet the problem with home juicing
is that it's way too much work
all those cumbersome parts the weird
angles that seem intentionally designed
to outsmart your sponge so much effort
every time for seems to be so little
reward until now introducing juicer
juicing without the cleaning imagine a
machine that squeezes every single drop
of juice from the fruit to repress using
8 tons of force a machine that is so
beautiful and so simple to use that it'd
be a crime to put it anywhere other than
your kitchen bench how does it work
simply chop your fruit and vegetables
and put them in the single use or
multiple use environmentally friendly
juicing back and then into the juicer it
goes the machine is so simple to use
that all you need to do is press one
button and 90 seconds later you will
have the fruit squash to almost a paper
like thinness and virtually every drop
of nutritious juice in the glass simply
recycle or reuse the use bag it's
entirely up to you
juicers uniquely designed juicing bags
means no fruit or vegetable ever touch
the machine which means no cleaning no
pulling the machine apart no rinsing
just juice at juicer we came up with the
ultimate solution simple elegant and
most importantly convenient enough to
make juicing a daily healthy habit
and we think we've gone beyond just that
we believe that everybody should be able
to maintain a healthy lifestyle with
ease leaving time for the more important
things in life and right now we are
ready to launch chooser to the world all
we need is your help to make this
product cheaper to produce please help
us by backing this campaign thank you
please data hey Kickstarter my name is a
cheetah and I'm ranchers and we are the
creators of a nerve react a nerve react
is the world's first intelligent stove
safety device that attaches directly to
your existing knobs and recognizes
potential threats turn your stove off
before it's too late
how many of you have ever left food
cooking on the stove for too long and
ended up with smoke everywhere or even a
fire or left your house then just
wondered whether you left the stove on
if you've never left your stove on
before you may wonder whether this is
even a problem that needs a solution the
kitchen is the center of our homes
it's where so much of life happens
spending time with loved ones preparing
food and sharing meals with so much
happening it's easy to forget something
as simple as turning off your stove if
we're not careful something terrible can
happen I know because it happened to me
in the United States alone there are
over 350 7,000 house fires each year
that's one house fire every 85 seconds
these house fires caused almost 13,000
injuries per year and seven deaths every
day and cooking equipment is the most
common cause how many of these can be
prevented with a nerve react a nerve
react uses a combination of sensors and
electronics within these units to turn
your stove off when a hazardous
situation is detected over for one even
arises attach your existing knobs to the
device or use them as your new nose and
place a sensor unit on a ceiling above
this unit is the brains of the device
and houses a gas sensor and smoke
detector which when activated signal the
knob unit to turn off the burner this
unit also contains a motion sensor
that's linked to a timer and the knob
unit you select the time interval you
want using the touch sensor or you can
use a default setting if no motion is
detected in the vicinity of your stove
during that time interval the knob will
activate and turn your stove off a nerve
reacts novel design allows it to work on
any gas or electric stove head attached
to knobs of all shapes and sizes and if
you're away from home the smart phone
app allows you to check whether your
stove is on and turn it off if needed
you can even adjust the temperature of
your stove to ensure your food doesn't
overcook hair at a nerve we're
passionate about creating innovative
solutions to problems that affect your
well-being and safety every day our team
has worked incredibly hard this past
year to bring a nerve react to life
designing it to be as efficient as
possible while creating it to look great
in any home but now we need your help to
take the final step and get this
revolutionary device into every home and
onto every stove so please back us and
help us reach millions of people like
you who want to keep their home and
loved one safe we hope in their react
will provide you with the peace of mind
you deserve together we can help to
prevent the devastating effects caused
by house fires thank you
