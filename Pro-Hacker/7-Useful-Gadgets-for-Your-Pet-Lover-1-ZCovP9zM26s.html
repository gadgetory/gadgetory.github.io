gold coins
or even liquid gold what if there were a
magic solution that could collect all
your dogs poop without any direct hand
contact because in reality your dog
doesn't poop gold introducing picker poo
a dog parents dream
Kickapoo is made up of two parts a
rounded clip of soft silicon cushions
that secures comfortably around your
dog's tail and a durable disposable
collection bag that hangs beneath place
pick a poo on your dog's tail before you
go out for a walk and when he is ready
to poop all the droppings fall directly
into the collection bag when your dog is
finished pooping you just unclip the bag
and throw it away with no mess and no
leakage in the real world
dog poop is not gold we love our dogs
but don't love cleaning up after them I
grew up having dogs I've always looked
for a better and easier way to pick up
after them but the products in the
market are just not good enough for the
past two years my team and I have worked
hard testing and redesigning and testing
you can to finally come up with the
answer every step of the process has
been about making pick up to something
that real dog owners in Action News we
know that most dog owners want something
they can intuitively use with only one
hand so we build that thing to pick up
ooh - and it's even small enough to fit
in your pocket we design pick up poop so
there never has to be contact between
the poo and your hands or even on the
ground everything goes straight into the
bag and at those days after your dog ate
something you shouldn't have
pick up you can handle any bathroom
situation you know what type of gold
comes out most importantly we wanted to
make sure that pick up who will be dog
friendly we've given the pickup food to
more than 100 dogs of different breeds
and sizes and the feedback has been
incredible with your help
sharing this campaign with at least five
friends we're hoping to finally change
the lives of all documents
making our locks easier our street
cleaner in our hands boldly with
peekapoo

again
