multi-tool has been the go-to solution
for a lot of different problems in so
many different places on the trail
between here and over there
in a bass boat on Lake Minnetonka here
in the kitchen right under there and
starting today that includes some of the
places we haven't been able to go gate
72 row 12 seat a introducing tread the
first multi-tool that lets you be the
one who gets it done anywhere tread is

wrist

always at hand tread features 11
interchangeable links each crafted from
injection molded 17 for stainless steel

shock resistant sapphire crystal and it

tread the go to go anywhere to from
leather the original American multi-tool
measuring tapes help us measure
distances and the dimensions of
different objects but a measuring tape
doesn't work in every situation why
isn't there a single tool that lets us
measure everything now there is
introducing beigel the smart tape
measure bagel lets you measure just
about anything at home and at work bagel
has three different modes string mode
wheel mode and remote mode string mode
is great for measuring straight lines
curves and around corners wheel mode
lets you measure irregular or odd shaped
objects and it also makes taking
measurements with one hand much easier
remote mode lets you measure objects
that are far away and out of your reach
after you're done measuring you'll need
a way to record your measurements using
pen and paper can be a real hassle with
bagel you can quickly and easily save
your measurements with voice
descriptions just take your measurement
push the Save button and then tag a
voice memo to it
dog the future ADA when you're done
bangle will send your measurements to
bagels mobile app via bluetooth this
mobile application lets you review your
saved measurements and share them with
your friends bagel is precise it uses
our patented technology to make sure you
always get an accurate measurement also
bagel has an easy-to-read digital
display that's viewable in most lighting
conditions in the past few years
also some measuring devices have become
smarter and made our lives easier it's
math skills smart thermometers and even
smart watches but when it comes to
measuring size we still use a tape
measure which is more than a century old
why don't innovate the way we measure
size so we created bagel a smart tape
measure we put a lot of effort into
creating bagel our team worked night and
day to make the best quality product
with this friendly design we have our
final prototype that is ready for mass
production now we need your help to
deliver this amazing product to everyone
please help us bring this bagel to life
thank you
size matters
bagel
we decided to design a multi-tool that
combines all of our favorite features
into an ultra low-profile tool that we
call the titanium pocket tool this new
tool is made from aerospace grade five
titanium alloy
despite its minimal name and appearance
this new pocket tool is extremely
versatile and lets us do more and
careless
