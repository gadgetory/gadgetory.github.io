all about hi I'm Bassam and music has
always been an important part of my life
when I was young I learned to play the
old which is a 12 string instrument this
is when I realized that unity is
essential and can be difficult to do
with that help so I need more than just
a tuner but rather an assistant that
could enhance my music experience we've
been working on all this technology for
two years now and recently moved to
China as part of the accelerator program

startups we've selected a contract
manufacturer who's helped us finalize
our hardware and electronic design now

improve the music experience using our

campaign and getting your own roadie
