cutting-edge innovation technology
shouldn't be called an unreachable it
should be fun and part of daily life
this is e stars world first holographic
smartphone so how do we generate glass
free Holograms on smartphones when we're
looking at our smartphone a camera will
quickly track our removal eye tracking
data is sent to our on chip signal
processing unit it's quickly processed
by our eye tracking system which will
lock on to where our eyes are looking
this is very important our eye tracking
system will adjust the hologram
generated based on where your eyes are
looking and you'll immediately see the
holographic effect this is the world's
first holographic smartphone with our
pioneering eye tracking technology an
innovation dedicated to the smartphone
application we call this smart
holographics you'll find four cameras on
our holographic phone a perfect air
interface the dual lens camera on the
back is not just for taking holographic
images but more importantly it's
designed to collect and process
holographic data
so what new user experience will such an
innovative holographic smartphone bring
us no more dizziness or narrow viewing
angles when what you isn't really a
truly immersive way to watch videos in
3d game playing becomes more fun and
thrilling distance is no longer a
problem lifelike product displays for
online shopping
complex traffic systems become easy to
navigate education is no longer boring
but fun and lively anytime anywhere 3d
scanning and printer will all this is
just the beginning East our we'll
continue to create new technologies for
holographic applications we make the
impossible possible and create better

for more than a year our international
team of ultrasonic engineers talented
designers and experienced manufacturers
work hard on the development of the
dollfie device inspired by amazing
benefits of ultrasound successful
utilized for years in many industrial
and medical applications we are
passionate about redefining ultrasonic

thank you for your support
hi my name is Sergey
welcome to the fotokite lab our goal is
simple to make aerial filming easy and
safe you've probably seen many drone
projects by now already what's different
this time
it's the tether the tether changes
everything
unlike a conventional drone there's no
pilot in no smartphones no joysticks no
GPS this thing is just no-frills aerial
camera the technology comes from one of
the world's leading aerial robotics
research groups here in Switzerland we
actually already use this technology to
build our first product the fotokite
probe used in broadcasts in journalism
today with that experience we set out to
build something a bit more compact and
affordable the fotokite fee let me show
you how it works to lyse the photo kite
point it where you want it to go give it
a twist and it will fly there like a
kite
it always produces tension on the
feather if uses this tension to figure
out exactly where it is relative to you
if you want to control it in the air use
the electronic leash hold down the
button and rotate your wrist that will
change where the photo kite flies
relative to its always following you
it's always connected to you so if I
move it will move with me and this will
keep working anywhere in the cave on the
boat and no matter if you're in a horse
summer or the bike
berroco cans a lot of different features
for an experience so reliable and
comfortable that you can capture aerial
footage almost any place you want to
make it safe we use soft slow spinning
propellers packaged into the lightest
flying GoPro pop from the window of the
batteries can be changed easily and in
fact the whole system can be charged
easily by a USB and the best thing is
folds into a cube the size with firm
loss making it a portable flying camera
that you can take anywhere we're nearly
ready to put the photo kite fee into
mass production but we need to build
critical mass in order to bring the cost
of manufacturing down with our
experience our team and your financial
support we're super excited for the
chance to bring this product to you
please support us thank you so much
you
hello my name is David and I'm the CEO
of 3d Simo here's our new product the 3d

temperature and also choose from the
default material profiles you can draw
with a variety of materials including
flex fluorescents lay wood transparent
thermochromic decomposable materials and

Simo mini
thank you very much for your support
as urban cyclists we wanted to deal with
the biggest problems of biking in cities
namely navigation and security there are
a couple of accessories that try to
solve these issues but there hasn't been
any complete solution introducing smart
halo smart a low isn't just another bike
accessory in fact it's not meant to be
removed after each ride it installs
permanently on your handlebar and pairs
with your smartphone to turn your bike
into a smart bike and provide a biking
experience like no other
Smart halos design philosophy has always
been centered on simplicity biking in
cities can be a challenge so we've made
sure our device was simple yet smart how
by reducing its interfaced with simplest
possible form a circle this luminous
halo allows us to communicate an
impressive amount of information smart
halo finds the quickest safest routes
and bike paths for you to make your ride
a stress-free experience just input the
destination in our app tuck your phone
safely in your pocket and let smart halo
take care of the rest
our unique circular interface allows us
to show every type of turn the seeking
option also our light patterns warn you
in advance of an infinite chain so you
get plenty of time to plan your next
as soon as you start writing smart halo
tracks your bike metrics your time
distance average speed the calories
you've burned as well as your total
elevation unlike regular fitness apps
you don't need to press start or stop it
does it all
seamlessly you don't even need to take
your phone out of your pocket
smart halo is also equipped with a smart
nightlight it turns on automatically
when it's dark and shuts off on its own
when you're done right with the personal
assistant feature smart halo will notify
you of incoming calls or text messages
right on your handlebar all of this
intelligence wouldn't be possible
without having smart Hill living
permanently on a nova the design goal of
smart halo was to build a simple and
integrated interface that would fit
anybody and under any condition it's
built to resist the worst that Mother
Nature can throw at the brain dirt or
snow smart halo was also built to resist
your bites worst enemy fight these
assembled with a unique tamper-proof
system smart halo can only be unlocked
with a special key provided with the
product but we went further than this
smart hello is also an integrated alarm
system
when activated anyone trying to steal
your sweet ride we'll hear the angry
roar of smart hello smart hello has been
designed to be beautiful inside and out
there is no on/off button on smart hello
it's sophisticated sensors detect your
presence it only turns on when you are
riding when you're done it shuts down by
itself all this leads to amazing battery
life to keep going as long as you do
under normal usage smart yellow will
last around three weeks it's become
obvious with greener transportation
methods eight bikes are to be
legitimized they need to be connected in
smart and elegant with smart halo
there's balance between sophistication
and simplicity
you'll agree when you turn your bike
into a smart bite two years ago
we pitched an idea
not just a 3d printer
not just a milling machine
you
not just the 3d scanner
but a new way to make things when we
introduced the Baptists in one year ago
we wanted to push the envelope on
personal fabrication and 3d printing
today we're ready to make another step
forward in that direction introducing
fab totem prism
Bab totem prism is a new sterile
lithography 3d printing technology it's
an affordable yet high-quality solution
that works without expensive optics
print small details on a huge printing
volume
get ready for an unprecedented design
freedom and choose among different
materials and technologies it's time to
think bigger
personal fabrication will change the way
things are designed and made we have the
skills and ingenuity needed to fulfill
this vision support this project
together we can make it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
