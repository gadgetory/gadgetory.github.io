Oh

imagine how we interact with the world
but today we just mostly poke at the
screen fingers and hands are incredible
why are we so limited introducing Vella
an innovative device that instantly
turns any surface into a smart interface
the world at your fingertips once
connected you will be able to control
different hardware devices or software
applications by using simple gestures
Vella will make your life more
convenient use it to control music light
temperature or any other application you
have in your mind you are only limited
by your imagination and you only need
one valid device to control multiple
devices or applications you can use our
presets like letter so rad your own
gestures according to your preference
simply assign gestures for different
scenarios and switch between them just
by moving your hands our human hand is
fantastic they can not only field but
also manipulate things in the versatile
way the Korean smartphone technologies
are just putting everything into small
tiny screen which highly limits and
constraint the interacting areas of our
hands velo works on any surface so you
can clip it anywhere you like or even
design your own control pad unlike other
devices Vela gives you tracking and
multiple texts to action features so you
are not limited to just one action but
if different patterns to assign four
different actions it is super easy to
use and really works for everyone if you
are a developer you can try new ideas
and figure out different customized
applications with our well-designed API
to track the human gestures Vela uses a
special sonar technology that is
nowadays widely used in military cars
and drones it transmits signal pulses
collects the reflective energy from your
finger and then translates it into the
performed action our team has been
focused on sensing techniques for come
of years
we are passionate about making tools
which is just human needs by amplifying
human capabilities sending any surface
around you into a remote control enables
many potential possibilities in our
daily lives we have been seen lots of
products in the market but we have not
found any of them capable to track and
to recognize with high probability with
