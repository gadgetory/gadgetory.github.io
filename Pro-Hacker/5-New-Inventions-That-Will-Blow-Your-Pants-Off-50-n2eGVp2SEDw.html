kubel revolutionizes the way we teach
coding with the introduction of the tech
time programming language two years ago
Dana and I started a research-based
project to teach children in the age 4
to 10 about basic coding we did this
because we believe programming skills
are essential for kids to acquire to
succeed in the 21st century the result
of this project is Google robot in 2030
for this estimated that forty seven
percent of all the jobs up until today
will no longer exist they'll be taken
over by robotics and artificial
intelligence therefore kids need to
learn basic coding skills in order to
work side-by-side with technology the
problem with the way with teach coding
today is that we introduce you too late
and we use to complex tools we are
saying coding out of the screen
knowledgeable table so coding comes as
easy as being a puzzle game the robot
consists of 25 the head and the body
it's so intuitive that all you have to
do is to assemble the two and kugel is
ready for action Google revolutionizes
the way we teach coding with the
introduction of the tech time
programming language when you use the
tactile coding package children learn
crucial 21st century skills like
collaboration communication critical
thinking and creativity you can also add
the language packets and children will
learn to spell their first words for
every kubo subject packets we provide
learning material with examples and
therefore Google can both be used in
schools and homes schools
time our design philosophy is if you
design for children you should design
with children that series why we involve
children in every important design
decision it is our dream that every
child will have the opportunity to learn
coding from the very early age when you
support cool you help us achieve that
dream if you want to support a learn
