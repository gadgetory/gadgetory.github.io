no no no we are doing it again hey you
there 50 bed Mia
this is for the call from God is a good
reason for you to record your call well
I'm sure there are more reasons than
that to record an iPhone call you need
internet connection and let's not talk
about external server dependency oh and
by the way it's never free that's why we
invented ich the first iPhone case in
the world that can record your calls now
you can record both incoming and
outgoing calls for freedom always when
we started designing the case we knew
that our biggest challenge was to
ideally position the components for high
quality recordings while keeping the
case slim elegant and doesn't fully let
on what it actually does Jeep is so easy
to use to start and stop recording press
the stop button to playback press they
are the small button you don't have to
worry if the server is reliable
everything you record stays on your
ethical jig can playback your
conversation or upload it into your
computer can either make Jay and iPhone
cover they can also record conversation
done on me when I was having multiple
conversations with my internet service
providers consonant I was sure that
there had to be a better fairer way for
iPhone users to take control of their
own conversation and I became obsessed
with finding a solution and today I'm
proud to share with you that with Jick
we have that solution with your support
we can move from proof of concept to
widespread distribution we believe that
this is a product that iPhone users will
want to buy anyway so by pledging your
support now you'll get early access to
Jake and a greatly discounted price
thank you so much for your confidence in
us your passion and your support for
Jake Jake is ready now all we need is
your help to bring it to the rest to you
smartphones are a brilliant invention

flashlights and even as our entire
computer app developers do their best to
make user interface as simple and
intuitive as possible to play music roll
your eyes message sent to moms but
sometimes it's easier to manage things

Busey the inventors of pressing a new
way to control and automate your
everyday smartphone actions Pressey is a
tiny physical button that connects to
your headphone jack and sends unique
signals to an intuitive app that can

some of the many things you can do with
your press e take instant photos and
upload them to your favorite social
network turn on your LED light send your
location for emergencies start a
discreet tape recording go and tell
anyone but I like bears

and much more pressing is not just a
one-trick pony you can easily configure
the press II app to execute different
actions for different sequences of
clicks for example two short clicks can
call your mom and two long clicks can
call your dad but what if you want to
use your headphones just let press e
rest in the special keychain and use the
headphone button as pressing it also
still works
press e even has an API so developers
can bring you more cool features this is
where Nemean Busey asked for your help
