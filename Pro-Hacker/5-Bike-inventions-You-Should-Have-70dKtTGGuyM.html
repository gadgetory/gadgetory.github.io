every year in traffic jams and moan
about it because you're not getting
anything from life but that doesn't help
at all you don't want to get to the
office all sweaty that's for sure you
have no time for exercise because you
waste your life in your car hey your
life is outside not in your car you just
have to reach out and get it leave your
car in the garage because your bike can
be electric with BIOS if more people had
more fun on bikes and things would be
better on the roads for our environment
and for you too and if more people
switch to bikes the better off we will
be
Deimos has the power that you don't have
in the mornings you're a gateway drug
you're strong alie and the slopes and
against headwinds your trainer if you
want to ride up mountains went on the
flats
it listens to your heart when you're
training you and your bike become one it
shows your friends where you went and if
you want you can do something good for
others by describing your routes and
sharing them with your friends
my mouse is not heavy not complicated or
expensive how can this all work well
because the BIOS is a smart direct drive
the most incredible stuff can be done
with a little intelligence
and it fits almost any bike in a few
minutes it's ready child's play
remove crank put on the battery pack put
on baima's put on the switch ready any
other questions
it goes where the power on the bike
needs to be not on the rear or on the
front wheel but in the middle where it
should be no transmission no gears no
gadgets oh junk you do not need any
machine noises to get up a mountain and
it works by most turns you into a
superhero because by most gives you the
feeling that the power comes from your
legs somehow between a tail wind and a
slight downhill on the mountain but only
if that is what you want without the
drive your bike is your bike you can
ride it like your bike and on the whole
it looks just like your bike you can
remove the battery you can charge it at
home
now it's your turn
there are a million things you'd rather
do than sit in a traffic jam discover
fruits that you don't know put your life
in motion do something with yourself
almost every bike and electric with by
Mo's even yours
hey but I only want you to have more fun
in life and to make the world a little
better
with Primus
it would be really great if you could
support the by Moe's idea and share our
videos surely you know someone or whom
by most is perfect
you
