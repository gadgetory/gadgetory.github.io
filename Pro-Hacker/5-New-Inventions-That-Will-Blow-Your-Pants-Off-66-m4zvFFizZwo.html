on just like yours emailing texting
messaging navigation music chris is a
smart mobile device that connects you
with your digital life while driving
chris is listening chris is talking and
chris provides you a complete new
experience at the wheel I'm harder from
Drammen all to less and we have one
clear mission making driving smart and
safe and every color you have a lead
what at message from Sarah Rocca would
you like to hear it yes please the
message is meet for lunch today do you
want to reply yes send cool Pasquale
that's all I got cool half past 12:00 at
civil how should I send this message yes
please done we are living in a world of
constant connectivity information over
information we believe that proactive
artificial intelligence will allow us to
focusing on the things that really count
like driving there's a trafficking
causing a 10-minute delay you can save
five minutes with an alternative route
okay please take the alternative route
okay please take the next left turn
driving requires our full attention we
believe at Tesla and boys are the best
interfaces for as little distraction as
possible in the car Chris I'm running
late
good call Peter you have three contacts
with the name Peter which Peter would
you like to call Peter Abraham Peter
Maer Peter Wolf okay
calling Peter Wolf Chris is designed for
plug and play you just get in a car and
you plug and unplug it like this the
first time you install it it takes less
than three minutes and it's connected to
your smartphone and to your car audio
and you're good to go
Chris works with any car and with any
modern smartphone both iPhones and
Android traces and intelligence
hands-free device designed from the
ground up to be operated safely in the
car - the combination of voice hand
gestures and display it is very
intuitive and easy to use and reliably
does what you wanted to do and that is a
big difference to all those voice-only
assistants out there who often let you
down because they simply don't
understand what you want to do
Chris comes with lifelong updates and
continues to get better where many
people of their car is an extension of
their home it's a private space in which
they spend a lot of time and sometimes
other people come and drive with them so
we designed Chris to be a beautiful
object that integrates well with the
interior of your car it has a timeless
human design an iconic round shape and a
metal ring around the display which
gives it a very solid and valuable
finish Chris makes a drive smarter and
safer by keeping your hand on the wheel
and the eyes on the road join the drive
of your life Chris keeps you connected
why are you enjoying the open road with
your hub we can bring crystal eyes so

communication is beautiful it keeps us
together it brings us close
it is the key element of love but
although we can find it almost anywhere
it hardly exists on the road driving and
communicating at the same time is almost
impossible how many times have we wanted
to say please let me merge
or please lower your life or thank you
for waiting
what if we could tap our finger to
deliver our message introducing Auto top
a digital sign that shows anything we
wish to say by a touch of our finger
it can easily be installed on any car
window and program to display our own
list of messages from our smartphone
or from a special remote control we can
add or delete messages based on our need
with support for different languages and
even emojis we can use it for our safety
for our assistance or just for fun Auto
talk is based on LED lighting technology
to ensure that our message will be seen
in any time of the day and in any
weather conditions
it's a beautiful and simple way to greet
the world and to let the world greet a
sac we see communication devices
everywhere these days people are more
connected than ever by inventing Auto
Talk we wish to connect the road to this
new age of communication after six
months of development we finally have a
functioning prototype our goal now is to
complete design and bring the product to
consumer level and we can't do that
without your help help us bring
communication to the road
