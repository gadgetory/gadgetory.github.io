introducing Amazon echo hi there
and some of echos first customers
echo is a device designed around your
voice simply say Alexa and ask a
question or give a command Alexa how
many tablespoons are in 3/4 cup 3/4 cups
of 12 tablespoons echo is connected to
Alexa a cloud-based voice service so it
can help out with all sorts of useful
information right when you need it it's
amazed
you know bringing a technology from
Ironmen at Tony Stark's house in Sierra
Decco can hear you from anywhere in the
room so it's always ready to help I can
head to water running I could be cooking
the pubic and beyond the bat room and
she's speaking here you can create
shopping list a lesson I walk off to my
shopping would provide news for NPR news
in Washington control light I like to
turn on the light we use it to set
timers we use that feature all the time
the next one that's specifically helpful
I think uniquely to blind people
calendars today at 1:00 p.m. is lunch
with Madeline and much more Alexa house
traffic for Jose's commute the fastest
route takes about 18 minutes you can
even reorder from your amazon shopping
history by simply asking Alexa the
primary ordering is when you can ask
Alexa to order something that you've
already ordered to your prime account
stream music from Pandora tune in I
Heart Radio and prime music please music
a lot and listen to your favorite
audiobooks from audible in the years
since I first started reading are you
mrs. with its advanced audio design echo
fills any room with immersive sound
and she's kind of funny Alexa tell me a
joke why did the bubblegum cross the
road because it was stuck to the
chicken's foot the echo app is useful
for keeping track of to-do lists
another info on your device what's great
is that for example if I want to read
exactly what's on my to-do list that I
added through the echo I can also access
it even if I'm not at home echo is
always learning new skills we actually
discovered that we can teach Alex to
learn my accent
Alexa admits affair on my shopping list
I have added Nescafe to your shopping
list and becoming part of the family
Alexa what's the chance of rain there's
an 80% chance of rain the echo is a tool
that we use to keep her household
functioning I was ready to go like that
good bye bye good bye
Oh
Oh
well nowadays people take thousands of
pictures with your cell phone but they
never needed them so we decided to
create an object that will make them
able to share pictures with their their
friend and family in a tangible way
print is the first smartphone case that
prints out pictures instantly you just
have to carry off master get a picture
and complete instantly we were doing a
year on about 15 different prototypes to
come up with warm product
stay tuned edu for examples of the new
instance technology or Wi-Fi you can
take a picture that you can also use
pictures from Facebook Instagram any
picture that is already on your fun
my biggest design challenge was to
create an object that will work with
different types of smart think who are
compatible with the iPhone 5 the iPhone
6 and also the galaxy s4 in galaxy s5
and we are trying to bring it to more
smartphones so we don't need any ink
cartridge all the ink is already in the
paper you just have to hit it and the
picture will appear like magnetic like I
said what we realize that instant
cameras is the holy spirit we try to
capture it by recording of short videos
at 5 6 again just before you take a
picture the video will play
automatically on the paper through
augmented reality when you send it
through the app
we wanted to go further than just
printing pictures we want you to bring
memories that you could hold in your
hand and that you could give away
whenever you want to print is for
everybody because everybody likes a
printed picture that you can hold in
your hand you know it's like a memory
that page gives it away
this change in this is going real Oakham
is the world's first full-featured IOT
home surveillance camera Remo cam gives
you the ability to check in on your home
and take care of it anytime anywhere no
more surprises there are many private
security cameras out there already and
they all try to achieve one thing
protect what's important is whether
that's your home children or pets so
Remo cam decided to make a camera that
not only watches over your home but also
takes care of your lumpkin we added IOT
technology to control various devices at
home now we can see Jonathan sing and
asleep
then turn off the light we can feed
milky or turn on the TV the keeping
company you can catch max logging his
girlfriend on the couch
