when selecting a charger you have to
decide where you're going to use it what
you're going to charge with it how many
devices you'll have to power and what
devices it's optimized for but what if
you didn't introducing the Pearl charger
a 50 watt for poor charger with no
compromises the Pearl could deliver 2.7
amps to all four ports at the same time
most multi port Chargers have an overall
power rating so when you plug in too
many high power devices one or more of
the port's will be throttled the Pearl
lets you draw a maximum power from all
its ports simultaneously when you
connect your device the Pearl will
detect and adapt to the devices charging
scheme maximizing the amount of power
delivered and minimizing charging time
you can power it using lithium ion and
lithium polymer batteries lead acid
batteries ac/dc adapters and car
adapters the integrated watt meter
allows you to see how much power devices
drawing so you no longer have to guess
how fast your devices are charging we've
carefully designed the pearl charger
over many iterations optimizing and
refining the design to this point in
preparation for production we produce an
initial batch ironing out all the kinks
and making sure that the Pearl charger
is ready to manufacture we've sent many
of them to reviewers around the world so
you can see what others think before you
make the pledge we now need your help to
scale up production
we hope you'll back us on Kickstarter
and make the Pearl charger a reality
