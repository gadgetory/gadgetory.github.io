technology is moving in a lightning pace
from rockets that can explore the depths
of space to driverless smart cars while

entirely innovation has neglected the
humble bicycle we've seen modern-day

physically exhausting and embarrassing

of transportation the evo wheel comes in

hi I am Fabien the creator of Eddy the
smallest and lightest add-on kit for
bicycles that converts any bicycle into
a powerfully bike within seconds you
simply mount the drive unit to an
existing bike attach the battery switch
it on and off you go

thousands of bikes all over the world
have been equipped with Eddy making the
owners faster and happier
the reasons why area is so popular are
clear it is extremely light extremely
powerful very compact and you can use it
on any existing bike the only downside
of a friction roller Drive is this it
can be quite noisy however the new
generation of Eddy will sound more like
this and that's not the result of our
sound engineer playing around with
volume control it's the result of a
solid one-year Austrian engineering
process that has left to 90 percent
noise reduction like in the previous
version of Eddy there is no friction in
standby mode in all mode you can choose
between five support levels once your
pedal Eddy starts within half a second
if you stop pedaling Eddy stops
automatically one battery can last up to
four hours in constant use and can be
exchanged or charged easily another big
step forward of this wireless sensors
not only because they're much more
sensitive but to make the installation
so easy no matter which bike you're
using
in case you still want help with the
installation
we do have an extensive and permanent
groves or network we are so proud of
this new generation of Eddy it really
describes our vision of the future of
cycling now we need your help to
accelerate the production and establish
Eddy next on the market if you already
