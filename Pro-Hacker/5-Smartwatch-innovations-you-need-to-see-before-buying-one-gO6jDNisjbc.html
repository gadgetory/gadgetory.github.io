for energy our machines vehicles and
factories all demanded yet most of the
energy we use is wasted over 30 trillion
watt hours of heat per year are wasted
by power plants alone enough to power
the entire world and our environment is
part of the collateral damage over 15
billion batteries are thrown away in
landfills every year at matrix we wanted
to create technology that makes the way
we use energy more efficient and more
intimate we wanted to start with a
problem everyone has experienced
firsthand feeling frustrated when your
elctronic device runs out of power when
you need it the most there has been any
innovation to solve this problem
and that God is excited to solve it
using our thermal electric technology
after five years and several prototypes
were introducing our first product the
matrix carwash
it's a SmartWatch that's powered by you
it works by converting your own body
heat to electric power and the best part
is you never have to charge it the watch
comes alive because it's powered by you
the human body at rest and it's 100
watts as heat similar to that of an
incandescent lightbulb when exercising
that number jumps to one kilowatt
similar to the average power we use in a
home what's so cool about this watch is
that as you exercise and your skin gets
warmer the power watch generates more
power it's got a unique power meter that
shows how much electricity your body has
generated right on the face of a watch
we can do some exciting things with this
technology like accurately measure the
amount of calories you burn our
thermoelectric technology measures the
amount of heat you've generated from the
calories you've consumed it's also
packed with all the features you'd
expect in a SmartWatch it has sensors to
track both activity and sleep quality
we're designing changeable watch faces
to suit your mood which also built micro
applications so you can do more than
just tell the time and of course it
syncs with your phone and your account
in the cloud are you into running
mountaineering trailblazing it works
even better when you're out and about
especially in cold weather since you
never have to charge it or replace the
batteries it's very well sealed and
water-resistant to 50 meters and if you
ever take it off you'll go to sleep and
store all your data when you put it back
on it comes back to life we've done most
of the hard work
you have a few dozen prototypes and a
ton of data so we know it works the
power watch has been vetted and
certified by arrow electronics
we've brought on Andrea Ponte a
world-class SmartWatch designer our
engineering and manufacturing is headed
up by Larry side from Hong Kong who has
helped numerous wearable companies like
Fitbit shipped millions of units and to
ensure it all comes together
we've brought on Val sin as our
manufacturing director he has over 20
years of manufacturing experience
bringing products to market now we're
ready to go to market and we're so close
to the finish line your funds will go
towards the final production tooling to
manufacture the powerwall join our
campaign today so that we can get the
swabs
into your hands we'd be thrilled to have
you on this journey so that we can
harness the world's wasted
you
meet octopus the first icon-based watch
that teaches kids good habits and a
concept of time one it's a watch that
young kids can read and understand -
it's a scheduler that fosters
responsibility independence and
self-esteem
three it's an assistant that helps
parents to prioritize their expectations
and stay consistent with daily routines
no more power struggles enjoy family
life and focus on what really matters
octopus the training wheels for good
habits
my first impression of the tick wise
tool is it fits great then it looks good
on my wrist each little point that you
touch it's very specific and I like how
it goes from being a traditional type
function looking down at it to really
being able to interact with it my first
impression was that it was a neat watch
but outside of that I didn't really know
that I'd explore the functionality or
get to use it in the real world
normally I wouldn't consider answering
any phone calls while I'm riding my bike
but with the tick watch - you just flip
your wrists twice
answer the call flip another two times
and hang it up it tracks my workouts and
it fits with my lifestyle I'm not really
what you call tech savvy but the tick
watch - it's been really easy to use
okay Tico we want sushi I can ask it to
find a linear buy restaurant and it
shows the rating and the review and how
far away it is whenever I want to go for
a run I can always track all of my
fitness goals on it it's really
important for me to be able to track how
I want to do my workout if I want to use
it by calories or with distance or based
on my heart rate I was really impressed
with how convenient it was the scheduled
tasks - meetings they responded my voice
commands very easily okay to go schedule
a meeting with Bob Williams for 7:00
a.m. tomorrow I thought was pretty
awesome that you call an uber by just
saying call an uber into your watch and
it would request one for you it's great
to be able to focus on the task I have
at hand instead of having to shake my
phone all the time I receive the text I
simply glance in the watch I can dismiss
it until I'm ready to reply later you
know I don't see how I've really been
able to function without it it's really
helped me be more efficient it's made my
life a lot easier when it comes to my
workouts or even just my daily life okay
Tico how's the weather when I'm
selecting a watch it actually matters to
me how it looks it's cute I like it
overall I was really impressed with the
take walks - it's fast it's intuitive it
recognizes my voice faster than the
other SmartWatch have ever seen
so I got to keep this right

using Wi-Fi and bluetooth our
user-friendly app gives you full control
of connected devices as well as the
files stored in your wearable private
cloud stream your music and video

costs again automatically backup your
files to revolt for example when you
take pictures on the go when your
devices run low on memory free up space
by simply storing your files on revolt
with revolt all your devices work as a
team meaning they can access the same
content on all your devices if you save
a file on one device you can find it on
another we are a highly experienced team
of 16 members and our members have
experience building sony smart watches
unmanned helicopters fighter aircrafts
and automatic cars with some of the
world's leading engineers and advanced
technology but we would not have come
this far it was not for our online
community with over 2,000 members hi oh
there my name is Sean and I'm from small
town in Massachusetts I'm Matt I'm a
cloud architect from Chicago
hi everybody what's up my name is Ashley
and from the US their feedback is shaped
every aspect of revolves together we
have created a device that you can wear
as a wrist neck or pocket item reval can
tell the time and give you vital
statistics about your private cloud
we've come a long way but now we need
your help from this product so please
back us
reclaim your ghetto
we're all different we wear different
clothes we do different things yet all
of us have phones that pretty much have
the same features and now you're
probably thinking about getting a new
SmartWatch or may even already own one
are we really all going to end up
wearing the same watch as well it's not
only the style of your SmartWatch that
matters but why you could use it for
other platforms make you choose what's

nights refining our designs obsessing
over economics and materials to build a
device that looks beautiful and fits
perfectly on any wrist locks menus and
apps are easy to use and the watch will
work seamlessly with your iPhone and
Android smartphones we have been
approached and have partnered up with
major tech companies from around the
world to bring the best SmartWatch on
the planet to your wrist and as an open
platform we will soon allow anyone to
develop modules we are working with one
of the world's largest and most reliable
manufacturers in Taiwan and they are
ready to start production and this is
why we need your help

technology should be more personal and
upgradable back us and let's kick-start
this modular revolution together
