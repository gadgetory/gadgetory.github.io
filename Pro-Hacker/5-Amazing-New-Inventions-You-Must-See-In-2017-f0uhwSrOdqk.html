benefit many who makes using the
keyboard on the move from ryoga's and
creatives that need to constantly write
professionals who need to read and write
email create and edit documents and
spreadsheets hi I'm Martin really fit
I'm a founder of the air 4 which is a
london-based design consultancy and we
in the past have made a reputation from
designing a lot of handheld electronic
equipment including scion PDAs PDAs
our personal digital assistants
bizarrely they've sort of dropped out of
fashion we have always been strong
proponents for this kind of device we
feel it's time to bring it to the market
again because so many people they say
why isn't there a product like this now

I'm Tony Gonzalez and I'm excited to
introduce to you today fabulous a new
product the wine squirrel decanter the
special decanter allows you to have a
glass or two of your favorite wine and
enjoy the rest of the bottle days or
even weeks later
now some products has tried to solve
this problem of wine going bad with a
device that you insert into the wine
bottle problem is that were still
trapped air inside and the seal wasn't
good enough I thought why not decant the
wine bottle into a special container
that completely avoided any contact with
them we teamed up with talented
Australian designer
Clive Solari and now we're proud to
present the wine swirl de Cambra this
unique product can completely change the
way you drink wine I can now enjoy a
glass of wine with dinner and not worry
about the waste so how does it work well
the product consists of this beautiful
lead-free crystal glass decanter and the
seal after you pour the wine into the
decanter you simply insert the seal at
the level of the wine and turn
the seal you've just created is so
effective you can turn the decanter
upside down no wine will come in when
you're ready to drink the wine simply
disengage the seal and remove we're here
in Sonoma County California with
vineyard owner Jennifer crane who's been
using our wine squirrel I opened up a
bottle of my whoa Farms crane vineyard
designated poured it into the wine
squirrel
after a weak flavor was perfect it was
like I just opened the bottle resealed
it with the wine squirrel two weeks
later opened it again tasted it again
just as if I'd opened up the bottle this
product works
it looks fantastic you can put this
right onto the table every wine lover
needs this in their house
we use the internet to make plans
connect work and play together the
internet hosts our lives so why do we
entrust it to organisations who
typically don't have our best interests
at heart
most of our communications flow through
centralized web servers where
corporations control our online
experience they collect our information
limit our access to it and then sell it
to advertisers and because a centralized
internet concentrates power it's
vulnerable it can be censored hacked and
manipulated the internet is broken but
what if no one stood between you and
your data or dictated how you connect
with friends family and community if the
internet were free from central control
it would vastly expand humanity's
potential for creativity and
collaboration it would change the whole
game we know this world is possible
which is why we created polo polo is a
community rebuilding the internet by and
for the users rather than running
information through centralized
corporate servers like Amazon and Google
holo offers peer-to-peer web
applications that replace the middleman
with the spare computing power from our
own devices this creates a cloud run by
users like you and me holo gives you
back control of your data and online
relationships this isn't just file
hosting this is distributed crypto apps
small and large all the way up to
Facebook scale but we can't launch this
alone we need you to run a slice of this
new net and we don't want venture
capital to take control of this space
that's why we've built all this without
it and now we're asking you and your
friends to step up get a hosting box and
take back the internet simply get a holo
hosting box enable yourself and others
to access distributed apps through a web
browser and get paid in our secure
cryptocurrency holo fuel holo fuel can
then be used to pay hosts for data
storage and processing plus it makes
in-app purchases and micro payments easy
apps available on holo are built on holo
chain an alternative to blockchain
technology that is massively faster more
energy efficient more scalable and
10,000 times cheaper holo chain
architecture is so lightweight that you
can operate a full Facebook scale note
from a single smartphone that's great
news for developers who can build fast
applications that scale organically the
easiest way to help launch holo and
participate in its growth is to purchase
a holo port a pre-configured computer
we've optimized to host crypto apps just
plug it in connect it to the Internet
and start earning we've teamed up with a
world-class hardware supplier to produce
three different holo ports each with a
different capacity for earning holo fuel
choose the holo port that works best for
you and quickly earn back the cost of
your purchase if you claim one of the
first 1,000 you'll become a founding
member at holo we're building the future
of the Internet one that doesn't impose
or exploit but empowers join our
community
run holo earn crypto together
we can build a better Internet
