eh s50 stereo gaming headset is the
ultimate do-it-all headset whether your
game on PC mobile console or all three
the HS 50 was engineered from the ground
up to give you amazing sound quality at
a great value the HS 50s industrial
design hits all the marks from looks to
versatility you can take this headset
anywhere let's start with the ear cups
now whether you're in a six hour gaming
session are on a twelve hour flight
you're gonna want to be comfortable with
the HS fifty our engineers spent a
tremendous amount of time developing
cozy plush memory foam ear cups that
gently mold to fit your ear we also
designed the ear cups to swivel so
they'll sit perfectly no matter the
shape of your head size of your ears or
a fewer glasses
unlike most headsets in this price range
the HS 50 structural components are
built with a high-quality rugged metal
and we've really taken extra care and
all the materials used to ensure
long-term durability and performance
which is what we build our legacy on but
none of that really matters if the
headset doesn't kick ass the HS 50 is
loaded with specially tuned 50
millimeter drivers and a wide fidelity
range which creates an immersive gaming
experience on the side of the ear cup
you'll find on-air volume and mute
controls for quick adjustments on the
fly one of the things that I'm most
excited about is the versatility of the
mic the HS 50 stereo gaming headset uses
an optimized unidirectional microphone
and finally the microphone easily
detaches for use on the go the HS 50 is
compatible with PlayStation Xbox PC or
any mobile device you can play on any
system anywhere to find out more
