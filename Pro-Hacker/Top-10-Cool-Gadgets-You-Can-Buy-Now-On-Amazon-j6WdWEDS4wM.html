hi guys I'm Lorenzo
hi I'm Carlo every day smartphones are
becoming smarter but the battery life
remains critical we'd like to use our
phones without the fear of running out
of battery
of course there are solutions such as
power cases and extra batteries but are
either not portable enough or easy to
forget we designed a product so compact
that will follow you everywhere a cable
the size of an inch we call it in charge
it's a very simple product it's so
useful that we believe everybody should
own one that's why one of our main goals
was to keep it affordable
a tiny product at a tiny price
we spend an average 70% of our day next
to a USB port and every time it's a
chance to top-up for batteries there are
over five billion USB ports around the
world in charge will fit into your
pocket and you won't have to fight with
time on cords ever again thanks to its
remarkably compact design you can snap
it onto your keyring and there's no
chance to forget it at all we spent the
last three months designed the product
and testing the prototypes and now we
are finally ready to start the
production in charger will be available
with both lightning connector and micro
USB so it's compatible with most of the
devices out there we are really excited
about this and we hope you are too
now we need your help to bring in charge
into your pocket as a supporter you will
get your own in charge at a special
price so please consider back in our
project and share it with your friends
thanks for watching we really appreciate
your support thank you
