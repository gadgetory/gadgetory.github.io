better to do than hitting the nearby
lake to refresh yourself
but once you've arrived you are faced
with this familiar and awkward situation
you want to jump into the water but who
will take care of your valuables
introducing the spin safe a compact and
lightweight outdoor vault that screws
easily and securely into the ground
so far we're taking lots of risks
regarding the loss of our valuables
finally this has come to an end put your
valuables inside and lock the spin safe
with its top shell and combination lock
finally you can go swimming or play
beach volleyball without any worries all
accessible parts rotate freely
therefore the safe cannot be removed
until it is unlocked again beyond
physical protection our theft warning
app helps to make the spin safe even
safer if someone is tampering with it a
noisy acoustic signal alerts you and
people around our outdoor vault is
developed and produced in Germany in an
eco-friendly manner as it contains a
high percentage of recycled material but
the best thing is you'll not only have
one worry less but you'll always have
cash at hand for a tasty scoop of ice
cream

this is Marya a new type of furniture
collection designed for maximum
flexibility and based on a modular
framework this fixed piece furniture
collection can be mixed and matched to
provide over 20 functional uses for your
home so you can create and recreate the
furniture you need without any tools
Friday's aligning furniture with the way
we actually live today our homes are way
more dynamic than they've ever been in
the past now there are remote offices
Airbnb rentals and Instagram backdrops
hi I'm Jamie I'm Laura and we are the
creator Safari if you're a person like
me who moves a lot you know it's really
frustrating trying to find functional
furniture and that's first of all enough
to keep up the first apartment I ever
moved into I bought these really cool
bar stools and I love them I moved into
my next apartment that had a really
small kitchen and I didn't eat the
barstools so I just put them over in the
corner and they were sitting there for
months until eventually I sold them on
Craigslist lo and behold a couple months
later I moved into an apartment that
needed barstools even if you're not
dealing with the pains of moving for
still furniture is essential for compact
urban living I live in a small apartment
I love having my friends over to cook
however I don't have enough seats for
everyone sometimes people end up sitting
on the floor
I need furniture to adapt when I have
people over but not waste space on an
ordinary day so when me and Laura first
started out we analyzed the dimensions
of every object in a typical home and we
noticed that of our stools the same
height as the legs for a desk the coffee
table is the same height of the seat of
a chair and the headboard for your bed
is the same size of the four-person
kitchen table these shared dimensions
power bar eheh by reinventing nearly
piece of furniture in a home with a
simple framework the bargain collection
has two elements frames and accessories
the first element is the frame right now
we have two standard frames a Jade frame
and a seat frame each joint is welded
steel which will not come loose
unlike flat-pack furniture sold in post
regular stores the frames are powder
coated paint which makes these pieces
water and scratch resistant so you can
use them indoors or outdoors the phrase
are light so you can move them to
transform your space or move them to
your new home the second element is the
interchangeable accessories our goal is
to design accessories that are useful
wolf on and off the frames the
accessories are made of high quality
materials that will age and where
gracefully such as solid wood not
pressboard the disintegrates or veneer
that peels the fari a collection is
designed for quick assembly you will no
longer debut boxes of tools interpret
confusing guides or store leftover
hardware when it's time for a change
simply push the top out of the frame
- brevis product to market we need your
help
we're on Kickstarter to raise the funds
we need for manufacturing startup and to
build our online store to give you the
furniture you need Barrio is furniture
that makes sense for the way we live
today we move between cities we run the
businesses out of our apartments we have
band practices we host dinner parties
and we build new technology in our homes
our homes our studios meditation spaces
and urban greenhouses we need furniture
that can transform our home into the
spaces we need when we need them Varia
is furniture as dynamic as you are
when people say the sky's the limit we
ask why stop there this is the
relentless spirit and passion of you can
robot and from there we created another
glimpse of the future of possible this
is the BW space the newest addition to
the you can robot family and a great
leap forward for the industry BW space
is the newest and most improved
underwater drone from you can robot
which yields something unique and
groundbreaking in the process from the
sleek chassis to the incredible
technology inside it it's a work of art
that produces works of art it's
exceptionally powerful and nimble in the
water without sacrificing stability it
has the ability to capture 4k video at
30 frames per second and take still
photos at 12 megapixels with low latency
with 7 hours of total dive time 100
meter dive depth and a max speed of 2
meters per second
you can go farther faster the BW spaces
striking industrial design is the
perfect union of form and function with
state-of-the-art active tracking it can
follow your subject automatically and
with dual powerful LED lights you'll
have no problem navigating in the
darkest of conditions with 128 gigs of
internal storage you can record for
hours and take thousands of photos live
sharing makes it a breeze to share with
your friends with the click of a button
the whole world can tune into your
adventure the app is a sleek in compact
as the VW space itself and with the BW
space in your hands it will feel like
anything is possible
you're looking into the eyes of a robot
and he's looking back at you he's
curious about who you are and what
you're up to this is vector this is a
video about vector
he's the new creation from Hongki he is
a character a robot that is meant to
live in your home he's always on he's
alive the idea is really that vector
becomes part of the family or that home
both on the emotional character side but
then also on the utility side vector is
really the first robot that uses
advanced deep neural networks to do a
lot of perception and understanding of
the world around him what he does feels
intentional he can react to inputs in
his environment in his life we generally
want to find one defining feature and
then build from that
for vector curiosity was a big one what
they're saying is you officially live in
a time when robots sidekicks are a real
thing it's a step closer to that sci-fi
robot you know that everyone wants to be
friends with that step closer means
you've got a robot in your house waiting
for you to get home
autonomous like a Mars rover aware
enough to avoid Falls like a tightrope
walker and always excited to welcome you
home like a loyal companion vectors no
slouch roommate either he's happiest
when he's helping out ask him the
weather and then he'll show you he can
set a timer and cause a commotion when
it's finished
activate robot alarm and he can connect
his robot brain to the Internet to
answer your questions he's a little
robot who brings a lot to your house
he's also a little robot with nearly 700
parts that one right there that's his
sole part okay I made that one up but
the little guy's got soul let's get
someone in here to tell him what all
this stuff actually does how does he
here the vector has a microphone array
which allows it to hear voices and
noises and understand where it came from
what's he used to see vectored uses a
wide-angle camera
why doesn't he fall off the table for
crop sensors how come he doesn't bump
into stuff has this laser distance
sensor right here in the front whoa
robot lasers how do we know he won't use
that for evil we have a very strict
quality control process to make sure
that no evil robotic overlords emerge
from from vector this thing is just
awesome there's got to be a huge amount
of code inside the robot there is a huge
amount of code inside the robots a few
million lines of code at this point that
software really encompasses everything
from the character to the low-level
operating system to the cloud
functionality he has a camera in his
face and that's actually one of his
primary sensors not just capturing the
light in all the pixels but it's making
sense of those pixels he knows what it
is and where the stuff is that code
creates his intelligence and his
personality we think both about the IQ
and the intelligence as well as the EQ
and the emotion you feel something for
him you bond with him relate with him
care about him and you feel that he can
relate to you and give you something
back he is your friend he was built to
help and delight and entertain you that
is delightful and entertaining so
instead of sitting back and waiting for
the robot apocalypse on key is making
super smart robots built to bring joy
and companionship to humans did I
mention he likes to be pet and I know
vector is a really big milestone for
robotics because for the first time ever
there will be hundreds of thousands of
people living with a robot in their
homes and that has never happened before
vector is ready to live in your house or
at least he will be after the snap
