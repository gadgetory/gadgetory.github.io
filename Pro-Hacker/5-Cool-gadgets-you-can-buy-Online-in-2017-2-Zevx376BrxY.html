convenience great except for one problem
most people already have a watch so why
not smarten up your own watch hello
Kickstarter I'm Casper and this is my
good friend Roger hello we're here to
tell you about a new product a tiny
biscuit turns any watch into a smart
watch we call it the Triple E and we're
very excited to share with you
Triple E makes any smart watch and much
much more gives you notifications a full
fitness tracker makes amazing selfies
and let you control your music from your
wrist good morning Trivedi brings all
your notifications to the watch your
loan without cramping your style
if you can set your own color and
vibration pattern for each notification
easy recognition truly is optical heart
rate sensor and step counter give
advanced fitness tracking empowering you
to keep up speed with your fitness goals
data is sent straight to the Trib li app
which cleverly filters after data to
your favorite fitness apps trivially is
water resistant feel free to take it out
into the rain or even the shower there's
also a stealth mode customize your
privily to avoid unwanted interruptions
or filtering priority contacts and
silencing others you can sometimes you
just want to be in touch with select few
going out it needs file change easy
simply swap your Tripoli from one watch
to the other the disk is so small and so
thin that it fits under any watch
your ever has arrived

smart watch back is now to thank you for

check them out
well crap going around it sucks but it's
not the end of the world because we got
this little thing Hatchin ride it's a
new tool that makes having a flat tire
stuck way left
they quick and permanent solution to fix
just about any flat and here's the real
kicker you don't even have to take off
the wheel I used to be just like you
shelling out big bucks for tubes and
tires regardless of how bad the damage
was occasionally I'd even try it on my
own
maybe you do too if you're into that
hole self-punishment thing not the
crease job in the world either basically
I murdered my bike let me show you how
it works
remove the cap from the patch and ride
tool insert it directly into the hole
pull back the slider then push forward
remove the tool then pump your tire full
of air and you're up and running or
rollin and patch and ride works for all
types of tires road bikes mountain bike
cruisers kids bikes clincher and tubular
tubes even jogging stroller tires pretty
much anything with an inner tube catch
and rides cleaner for the environment to
put Patchen rides you reduce your carbon
footprint by patching instead of tossing
that's pretty great getting a flat tire
sucks the patch and rides makes it stuck
back
