well crap going around it sucks but it's
not the end of the world because we got
this little thing Hatchin ride it's a
new tool that makes having a flat tire
stuck way left
they quick and permanent solution to fix
just about any flat and here's the real
kicker you don't even have to take off
the wheel I used to be just like you
shelling out big bucks for tubes and
tires regardless of how bad the damage
was occasionally I'd even try it on my
own
maybe you do too if you're into that
hole self-punishment thing not the
crease job in the world either basically
I murdered my bike let me show you how
it works
remove the cap from the patch and ride
tool insert it directly into the hole
pull back the slider then push forward
remove the tool then pump your tire full
of air and you're up and running or
rollin and patch and ride works for all
types of tires road bikes mountain bike
cruisers kids bikes clincher and tubular
tubes even jogging stroller tires pretty
much anything with an inner tube catch
and rides cleaner for the environment to
put Patchen rides you reduce your carbon
footprint by patching instead of tossing
that's pretty great getting a flat tire
sucks the patch and rides makes it stuck
back
