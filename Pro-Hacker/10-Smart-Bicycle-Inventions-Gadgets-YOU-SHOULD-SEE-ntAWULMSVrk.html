know the feeling so do we in fact 50% of
active cyclists will have their bikes
stolen this is even worse for bike
wheels because any thief with a wrench
can remove your wheels in less than 30
seconds right now you need to carry
multiple locks to fully secure your
entire bike one for the front wheel and
another for the back wheel and frame but
this sucks because who wants to carry
multiple locks and then lock them every
single time you ride don't forget that
means multiple keys locks and all your
books binders backpack and laptop the
new solution to this madness is nut lock
nut lock provides one time installation
bike wheel security this innovative
product works by replacing the bicycle
wheels existing fasteners with custom
engineered ones that can only be removed
with a unique key in your package you
install it once and that wheel is now
protected yeah just one time nut lock
helps you outsmart fees by fully
protecting against commonly used theft
tools
it also removes the need to carry an
additional you lock or cable lock to
secure your entire bike keep in mind nut
lock only protects your wheels so you do
still need a you lock or cable lock to
secure your bike to an external object
we've custom engineered over 37 designs
and prototypes to deter theft as much as
possible new variations are being
created by the day making it practically
impossible for a thief to get his hands
on all the different nut lock
combinations and if you ever want to
remove your wheels all you need is the
key that came with your package just
throw that key on your keychain and
you're good to go
security has always felt good but it's
never looked this good
so grab nut lock lock your nuts and
celebrate by popping yourself a cold one
Cheers
