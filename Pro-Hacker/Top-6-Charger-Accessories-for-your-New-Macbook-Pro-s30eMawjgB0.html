mac however the new MacBooks no longer
have it
innovation shouldn't be making it harder
for you to charge your laptop
so we've designed a device that brings
back the convenience you've gotten used
to introducing snapping a charge all
your gadgets in a snap it's compact and
durable once you try it you'll never go
anywhere without
snap inator may even save your computer
max sake is back this time not just
format
our team of engineers the designers have
been specializing in electronic badges
for over 10 years
place your order today you can expect
your snap later to be shipped right on

the brand new math book one of the many
new devices featuring the powerful new
USB type-c port your entire computer's
power data transfer and output through a
single port it's the heights of
technological simplicity but what about
your stuff and when you need to
multitask how do you fit it all into a
single port your stuff needs marble the
first integrated system designed to work
with the USBC port
the marble offers a single compact way
to connect your many devices to your new
MacBook it's got two USB ports two USB
sea ports an HDMI type-a port a micro SD
card reader and a 60 watt AC Inlet to
power it all it's the only system made
to charge your new macbook while also
powering all of your devices
think of marble as your new supercharger
it gives you all the functionality of
having your devices nearby and connected
as though they were still plugged
straight into your computer and just
like the new math book marble is easy to
take with you no need to bring your Mac
adapter with you on the road
bring marble and you'll be able to power
your devices and your computer while
you're on the go marble was designed to
be relatively the same size as your
computer standard power adapter and when
you consider the other mess that marble
enables you to leave at home
marble makes a whole lot of sense if you
constantly find yourself on the move
marble saves you space saves you weight
and has the ease-of-use you need easily
switch from working at the office to
home to your favorite cafe around the
corner use the micro SD card port to get
access to your videos and photos
instantly with marble you have the
versatility and portability you need to
work from anywhere and while you work
charge your phone your tablet and your
computer in the same place and have
access to all your files at once while
you're at it it's kind of like having
your entire office fit neatly in your
pocket
depending on your needs marble comes in
two powerful options the dcs one which
features two USB 3.0 ports two USB sea
ports one HDMI type a port and the micro
SD reader while the DC s2 switches the
HDMI type a for an HDMI type B port and
throws in a mini DisplayPort for your
heavy duty needs like connecting
multiple external monitors when it's
time to get some serious work done at
the office there's no need to sacrifice
simplicity for the sake of extra power
run your monitors your hard drives even
your printers through the marble and
save yourself a headache or two marble
is super sleek super portable and most
importantly it's got the energy you need
to get the job done and remember marble
works with any computer that supports
USBC technology systems like the Dell
XPS 13 9350 and the huawei mate book
among others the potential of using the
marble 4 USB C port devices is
continuing to grow every day get marble
and supercharge your life
let us introduce charges the world's
most advanced universal travel adapter
that also charges your mobile devices
without any additional chargers it works
in the USA UK Europe Australia and over
150 other countries the idea was born
out of the everyday struggle of people
on the go every time I go on holiday I
want to focus on what to wear but I also
have to carry around a lot of devices
that I don't want to think about but I
can't live without or when I am on an
important business trip abroad and I
want less luggage but I need my smart
gadgets all these devices require many
chargers that take up half of my space
and don't forget the countless number of
adapters around the world yeah I always
get those confused and there are never
enough outlets in hotel rooms to charge
all my devices at once that never
happens anymore because we have charges
charges conforms to plug standards in
the USA UK Europe Australia and 150
countries around the world

worldwide with all the plugs
conveniently stored inside charges saves
you space and the trouble of forgetting
or losing your Chargers the height of

same time using the two integrated pins

your samsung at the same time it also
works with other devices sharing the
same charging standards

ports to make it the most convenient
Universal travel adapter and you still
have the outlet ready to use in addition
we created the charges Bank it's a power
bank that charges my phone up to three
times and has a USB port for any other
device it's been a great journey so far
we beta tested our ideas and pack them
into an awesome compact design we built
the PCB and model the design then we 3d
print it and test it some more this led
to the final working prototype that we
sent out to ten people to test for two
weeks we got their feedback and now we
are ready to go into mass production I
love to travel the world but I always
find difficulties in the outlet
standards of each new country and I
visit yeah I found charges and solve
that problem forever I mean it is so
compact and handy I take it everywhere
with me my wife and I used to argue over
who is going to use the phone charger
every night
yeah the chargers solve that problem
with a steel charging station and we
don't argue anymore forget the old
chargers go charges back us now on
