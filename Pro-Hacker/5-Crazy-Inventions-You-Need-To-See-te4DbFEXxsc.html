office worker or an athlete your feet
get strained every day the most common
cause for heel pain is plantar fasciitis
plantar fasciitis is inflammation of the
ligament on the bottom of the foot in
the United States alone more than three
million people each year will be
diagnosed with plantar fasciitis a
whopping 80 percent of women have foot
problems with plantar fasciitis being
one of the most common causes of their
pain we want to change that so meet high
healer your personal food therapist
it's the most versatile food care device
on the market you can use high-heel or
anywhere you want to relieve the pain in
your foot most people that are suffering
from foot pain have plantar fasciitis
the high-heeled ER is interesting in
that it now allows us to strengthen the
intrinsic muscles of the foot which we
were unable to do before I'm dr. Stephen
Bui I'm a surgeon podiatrist I have been
practicing for more than 15 years I'm
the inventer of the high heel er a high
heel is for anyone who suffer from foot
pain heel pain for example athlete like
runners for people that their weight
create a lot of stress on their feet
people that are on their feet a lot
during the day I'm a runner and I
definitely think this high Heelers for
me I don't work out I love high heels
and my feet are flat and it makes me
feel better it makes me feel like my
feet aren't consistently suffering I
love it it's perfect for me this is good
man it's good it's not for specific
people this this is for everyone even if
you don't do even if you don't run you
don't go to gym sometimes you walk from
one place to another it's always nice to
teach like to get those legs stretch and
it is something very good you don't need
to go for massage I here there is the
first of its kind never had anything in
the industry that can do all the
modalities at home there are four main
function of the high healer first is the
cooling effect of the roller which
helped the inflammation of the plantar
fascia if it has a rounded edge on one
side and a sharp edge on the other the
rounded edge is used for the acute
inflammation where you can't put down as
much pressure on the ligament when
you're pressing and the other side is a
sharper one for the chronic inflammation
which you can push down a little bit
harder it has the benefit of adding both
heat and cold so that if you have an
acute case of plantar fasciitis you
could use the ice if it's a chronic you
could use the heat allow the ligament to
stretch out the second feature is
stretching massaging of the plantar
fascia third function is to activate the
intrinsic muscle
within the foot to help stabilize the
foot and strengthening the foot stepping
along activating the small muscles that
actually fire when these things fire and
stretch and pull this strengthens the
bottom of the foot thereby the ligament
that's being destroyed which is called
the plantar fascia it doesn't have to
work so hard so the muscles will help
induce strengthening and the last
function is to help loosen up the
Achilles tendons the stretching will
stretch two types of muscles bottom of
the lake and then a little bit higher
behind the knee normally it would take
you thirty five minutes or so work
through all the exercises that need to
be done but using the device you can cut
that time down to about ten to fifteen
minutes
our first Kickstarter campaign with high
bowler was a great success our campaign
was funded by 200% with the help of 1700
amazing backers all the backers received
their products within three months the
campaign ended together with our
manufacturer we have already designed
the tooling and created the production
plan for high healer now we need your
support to bring this project to life
life is about experiences it's about
getting out of your comfort zone doing
the things you love and never feeling
held back we wanted to simplify the
complicated nature of scuba diving while

join us in creating the most
unforgettable underwater experience
possible there are two verbs that
describe what a plane does there's
flying and there's flying meet powerup
darts a paper airplane that's not just
flying it's flying
this is shy a pilot industrial designer
and inventor shine loves everything
airborne four years ago he was
challenged by a friend to create a
smartphone controlled paper airplane
which I accepted the challenge and
created powerup 3 the first ever
smartphone controlled paper airplane
then two years ago that same friend
challenged him to put a camera on the
plane so shy created powerup fpv the
first ever smartphone controlled paper
airplane with a streaming camera shiz
friend looked at those creations and
said cool but you can't make a paper
plane that can do a loop and a barrel
roll and then stall turn then just I
stopped his Fred before he
hyperventilated and said challenge
accepted now after a year of prototyping
and testing it's here power up dart the
first ever smartphone control paper
airplane that can do aerobatics yes
other planes can fly but they can't loop
or barrel roll or fly vertically dart
can it is incredible and it is small
just take a piece of paper fold it into
a plane catch the module download the
app and tell your friends GeForce got
nothing on you
you're an aerobatic pilot now powerup
dark gets its incredible aerobatic
capability from the high
thrust-to-weight ratio and unique shape
of the plane despite being so incredible
like the dart is easy and intuitive move
the phone to any direction and the wings
will follow when you start the plane
goes to 70% of its throttle so you can
fly it like a regular player but press
the boost button and you give the plane
that extra kick that transforms it into
a flying monster a small flying monster
power-ups Bluetooth module easily
charges through its microUSB port and
the entire thing is made of carbon fiber
an island so it's nearly indestructible
dart invites you to make many planes in
many shapes because every plane brings
with it new tricks and with them new
gasps for air try 5 10 50 planes then
fly them all together make a real shawl
arrange dogfights break every barrier
previously set by less incredible planes
and this little bugger is so cool it can
even fly around the office yeah you just
sent a love note through a smart phone
control paper airplane you have lived
powerup dart is ready for production so
if you want to fly aerobatics with the
most incredible all incredible planes
back power up dart and start flying
there's an elegance
when form and geometry collide with
function and technology the a to engage
ascends and holds itself steady at a
height of 1 meter before it begins to
rotate and initiate its infrared range
sensors when the aircraft attacks an
obstacle nearby it will automatically
fly in the opposite direction it's super
safe and fun anyone can do it are you
ready just turn the power on and place
it on an even surface
then cross the one key take off button
wait for it
whoa look at it go the a to engage is
responsive on every side so play with it
however you like get everyone involved
get a T engaged have you ever wanted to
be the life of the party
well now you can I mean who wouldn't
want to turn control it with your hand
pass it to a friend then simply press
the button again a safely land
kinko get engaged
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
