today I'm gonna tell you about a problem
that we all have you see I love driving
but I also love my phone and when the
two come together I find that I'm
constantly distracted and I can't keep
my eyes on the road I've never had an
accident but I have come really close
this inspired us to create bluej the
world's first smart mouth
we live in a fast-moving world where
there's always somewhere we need to be
and sometimes we can't really see the
way or find our car well Luger uses a
hybrid of Bluetooth smart and GPS so it
will always guide you back to your car
and as soon as you found it you've
probably lost your phone no problem
bluejay will find in Panama
the moment you put your phone on bluej
the real magic happens
woojae is designed for the road you can
make a call send a quick message or
share a location it's safer than ever
with a single tab
it knows how far the important places
are and it can guide you there
turn-by-turn
in the meantime enjoy listening to your
music podcasts and audiobooks all in one
place our team is working tirelessly to
bring you the next stage of connected
driving in the form of a beautiful
product help us make roads safer in
driving more enjoyable your pledges will
realize the world's first smart mount
introducing suits the world's first
truly smart car charger designed in
Germany Zeus has both brains and beauty
the elegance and license system provides
enhanced visibility and dark
environments and most importantly Zeus
is the only smart charger that can help
you find your car when you are at a loss
simply open the Zeus app and follow the
red arrow to find your car
Zeus also sports a powerful smart
chipset to deliver the swiftest charge
to any device charge to iPads at two
times the speed of normal car charges
Zeus is also the only charger to meet
u.s. military high temperature standard
another reason why Zeus is different two
times the speed two times smarter never
lose your car this is Bob like many
people bob is constantly on his phone
this means Bob makes some pretty stupid
mistakes
bob is not very smart about using his
phone but even he knows it's too
dangerous to take your eyes off when I'm
driving my smartphone can get me into
some serious trouble hudley is a
heads-up display which projects the
information that I need to an optical
glass in my clear line-of-sight this
allows me to quickly view information
without having to adjust my focus even
in bright light the display is visible
hudley will automatically adjust the
conditions for optimal computing public
is compatible on iOS or Android and
works with all my apps I love using Waze
when I'm in tired
navigate to work using my phone's
built-in hands-free functions I can
safely use all the applications I need
to reply I'm gonna be late boss my
favorite use of hudley is running apps
that are designed for our heads-up
display using the Navi or app I can see
it really looks like my directions are
floating on the road making it so much
easier for me to follow instructions
hudley connects and is powered by my
car's diagnostic port this gives me a
cool jet pilot style view which allows
me to view vital information like speed
fuel RPMs temperatures it'd be a safer
driver drivin ugly
be like Bob be better than Bob
these are your tasks for today two hours
to destination this is blue fox
requesting permission to take off
permission granted
Godspeed blue fox Roger that
come on wait a minute let's rewind for
years you prepared for battle press this
press that buckle up check that thing
look right now left turn that on no
better off focus look out exhausting if
only there was something to make life
easier in hell
why not fun well good news after long
months of brainstorming and endless
prototyping we are proud to present
Radio Mize Radio Mize is the ultimate
driving companion fitting all steering
wheels it immediately turns any car into
a connected car how like what does it do
what doesn't it do radio my stream's
personalized music and news into your
car without you ever taking your hands
off the wheel it learns what you like
and delivers it the cool app that comes
with Radio Mize also lets you manually
pick music and new genres so goodbye
Uzbekistani reggae so long boring
commute and hello drive tainment ice
then there's the pesky matter of
messaging when an important text or
social message comes in radio Mize reads
it aloud letting you focus on driving

asked for so oh how do I use it it's
already at your fingertips touch of a
button done no effort no distractions

driving but also monitors your speed

driving companion yeah we told you that

one seriously it was like a minute ago
ok anyway can I have one sure it's yours
hey tiger you still need your glasses

my's the new driving experience and just
to be clear we are the ones who came up
with that hello again empty fastest
route sound to early bird cafe
you and me we're busy people and being
busy means checking your phone even when
you're not supposed to even when you're
on the road but now there's navdy hold
on I gotta get this KC talk to me hey
Adam quick reminder first thing today

the early bird already on my way
see what's brilliant about navdy is this
master route phone automatically
rerouting to save ten minutes
perfect never been this way before I'm
gonna switch to Navi - see what's so
brilliant about navdy is its display is
focused in the distance so your eyes are
never off the road it's also 40 times
brighter than your smartphone and it
dims automatically so it's easy to see
day or night in fact sorry gotta take
this one - Greg and I actually want to
do Rose cafe add-on 60 - smiley face Oh

luckily Royce is one of my favorites
Abdi uses Google Maps and built-in
offline maps so you'll never get lost

connected to your car which means that
