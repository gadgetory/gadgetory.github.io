uncompromised product that we really

anthem boom conductor headphones
generates vibration and the vibration is
conducted through our facial bone into
our in their years for example when I
put these headphones on and you see that
they're seeing up here against my cheek
what's going to happen now is that music
is going to start to vibrate and that
vibration is going to go through my
cheek bone and then to my cochlea which
will allow me to listen to the music

Oh
this is Leo two minutes and she's out
but you you've been trying for two hours
I'm sure you've tried every trick in the
book like trying to stop thinking stop
thinking stop thinking stop crap I
thought or trying to relax
oh it's not that these techniques are
useless in fact they're actually pretty
good
unfortunately you probably had more
important things to learn at school
this here is history relaxing fast is
his thing just look he focuses on his
breathing and he progressively slows it
down and by slowing his breathing all
the way down to about six breaths a
minute
he stimulates the barrel flicks
physiological mechanism that allows him
to become completely calm in just a few
minutes and when it comes to not
thinking he's pretty good at that too he
can concentrate on his breathing for a
really long time and remain undistracted
by buzzing thoughts but you are not his
room even in bed he struggled to focus
on your breath for more than twenty
seconds at a time
actually your attention span is probably
more like balls than his runs
that's why we've designed dota it helps
you fall asleep by making you almost as
chill as a shrimp I'll have one of those
you synchronize your breathing with the
light projected on the ceiling by
focusing on something outside your own
head you'll pay less attention to the
thoughts that are keeping you awake at
the same time just like a metronome dodo
helps slow down your breathing from 11
to 6 breaths a minute which helps to
relieve your anxiety and so in less than
eight minutes you'll find yourself ready
to doze off dota won't turn you into a
Buddhist monk but it will help you fall
asleep faster and that's probably all
you need for several days last year my
home city of Seoul had a worst air
quality in the world areal stayed inside
where sometimes the air was even worse
my team was already working on probable
indoor air quality monitor but this
inspired us to make one that's even
better that's how I created

one tiny I mean really tiny packs that

your laser based particle sensors for
measuring cancer closing p.m. 10:00 and
PM 2.5 find us sensors for carbon
dioxide and VOCs on hygrometer for

thermometer for to measure we made it
