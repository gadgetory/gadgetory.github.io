may look normal but it'll do what other
padlocks cannot enable smarter instant
remote access it's designed to make
everyday life easier and more secure
nothing's more secure than a lock right
at least not until you lose the key or
forget the combination it's such a
hassle to get replacement keys or call
an expensive locksmith to break it open
well there are already Bluetooth
padlocks out there but unlocking usually
requires an additional app download and
account registration not so easy
that's why we've developed the igloo
home smart padlock it's versatile and
user friendly and there's no need to
download an app to receive access you
can securely receive a code via tax or
messenger as an owner you can easily
grant time-sensitive access directly
from the igloo home app and you can do
this wherever you are hi I'm Matthew as
Airbnb hosts ourselves we started igloo
home to make smart locks and lock boxes
that would provide our guests with easy
and secure ways to enter on rental
properties since then we've gone on to
win awards for our design and technology
which has been rolled out in over 80
countries and Counting we're now
launching a smart padlock focused on
sharing access and everyday use the
igloo home smart padlock is jam packed
with features remote deployability
is built around the igloo home pin-code
algorithm a similar system is used by
banks and in RSA tokens so it's very
secure with our unique remote PIN codes
users simply receive a text instant
message in real time or an email from
the lock owner no additional app
download is needed users can request
access by scanning the QR code on the
lock plus you don't need to be nearby
the lock to create these pin codes the
smart padlock recognizes the dedicated
code that's been generated by the app
codes can be one-time duration based
recurring or permanent you
for example you can grant recurring
access to your dog walker every
Wednesday morning or if you have a
shared storage with others you can give
each person a unique code to access the
space you can also track who unlocked it
and when it was done the smart padlock
also has Bluetooth capabilities you can
unlock via your smart phone when you're
within Bluetooth range you've worked
hard to strike the right balance between
security and community please support us

teeth plural to singular and this is a
toothbrush as in for a single tooth it's
in the name and in the design with a
typical toothbrush head you're basically
brushing only one tooth at a time it's

seconds per two

all 32 of your chompers with the EZ

to brush your teeth meet Bessie the
world's first fully waterproof NIT shoes
on average it rains over 150 days a year
this inspired us to create a shoe that
adapts your lifestyle without
compromising functionality and style
whether it's rain snow or mud your socks
will stay completely dry over the past
two years we've developed a waterproof
material never before seen using our
proprietary knit blend and the unique
nano filtering process we created a
membrane that keeps the water out but
allows the moisture escape nothing Vesey
is naturally breathable sweat wicking
and provides incredible comfort it gives
you the adaptive support with its tight
made four-way stretch
whether you're hiking in the summer
trekking in the winter Vesey will be
with you every step of the way
that's amazing guys that would be
perfect for London honestly that's very
good when I had the initial idea several
years ago it was about developing the
best product for your daily commute it
started with a passion for electric
mobility and now we've founded a company
and we've developed an entire vehicle
thermal turbo is a small light and
foldable electric vehicle it is self
balancing very easy to steer and it's
the perfect solution for your last mile
in your city self balancing vehicles
totally makes sense they are very easy
to learn
you just stand on and most people just
need 2 to 5 minutes to learn how to ride
it and if you suddenly find yourself in
front of some stairs simply pick it up
and carry it and since it's so compact
you can take it on a train nowadays with
the trend of urbanization traffic in
cities gets worse and worse first part
of your journey into the city with your
car is rather quickly but when you enter
the city it comes almost to a complete
stop this is where mo comes into play
you can take mo in the car with you you
will arrive at your destination much
faster and of course happier
when you enter your company in the
morning you can use mo to skip all these
long hallways and just drive from the
entrance to your desk in a few moments
with one lift and within two seconds the
Irmo transforms from fully functional
electric vehicle to just briefcase size
so how did we achieve the low weight
well one part of the story is to use
advanced materials such as carbon fiber
and aircraft grade aluminum another part
is we developed all our electronics in
the last two and a half years from
scratch so we developed our own main
boards our own battery modules and so on
at the end of the day Emma's not only a
clever vehicle it's also fun to drive
drive of Mo wherever you want on the
street and curb or cobblestone mo goes
up to 15 km/h and is created for your
hands to be free if you feel
uncomfortable with the balance there's
always the possibility to add an
additional handlebar and still have your
hands-free for the coffee to go
when you come home after a long day just
plug a memo into any power outlet and
after two hours it will be ready for
your commute the next day at Earl with
three founders Felix and Jacob are the
engineers and in charge of the
mechanical and electronical development
of Mo Sebastien takes care of the
business and the financing part

and working on our vision we have
partners and suppliers from all over the
industries and we really have the chance
to change mobility together with the
rest of the team we are really sure to
bring our MOU to you as fast as possible

city of the world and to ramp up our
