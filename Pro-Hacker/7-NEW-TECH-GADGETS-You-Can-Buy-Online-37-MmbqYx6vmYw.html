Oh
hi Kickstarter I'm Dan engineer and
founder here at monkey electric the
monkey light Pro is the world's most
advanced bicycle wheel display you may
have seen one of our prototypes at Maker
Faire SIGGRAPH Dragon's Den or at a
museum
it's got 256 full-color LEDs and can be
mounted onto any standard bike wheel
molded out of solid rubber the monkey
life pro is waterproof and durable
the graphics are stabilized from 10 to
40 miles per hour while you ride it
makes a stunning semi-transparent
display that is visible from both sides
use the web interface to organize your
images and animation then download them
via bluetooth wireless light up the road
and share your message with the world
this is where we design and manufacture
our products say hi to fill teh
Kickstarter Aaron and Katie Katherine
does sales for monkey electric we were
able to build all of this through the
success of our last Kickstarter the
monkey light Pro also lets you display
your own artwork logos and animations to
get you started
we've pre-loaded an amazing collection
of art for you to use artists like David
Opie and yoshi saudi oka and more have
created artwork specifically for the
monkey light from many developers have
already done amazing things with our
prototypes the Fukushima real project
outfitted a bike with pollution sensors
as you ride around and collect data from
the environment and displays it on the
wheels
now with the success of the monkey light
210 and monkey light 232 and after five
years of product development and over
nine different prototypes we're ready to
bring the monkey life Pro to market but
we need your help
hi I'm Laurent
I hope down out with sales and marketing
here at monkey electric we asked a
couple our friends what they would do at
the monkey light Pro and here's what
they came up with
we're very excited about our monkey
light Pro and hope you are too it's
truly a unique project we had built a
lot of prototypes which have been used
in wide variety of applications all the
footage in this video was shot using the
monkey light Pro from the success of our
last Kickstarter we scaled up our
in-house manufacturing and proved our
capabilities our smaller monkey light
products are now being sold worldwide
and are known for their quality we'll be
making the monkey light Pro in the same
US production line as our other products
that's right we're made here in the USA
we need your help to make this happen
please support our Kickstarter if you
want to help us build the monkey light
Pro there are significant costs for us
to create production molds and purchase
the needed parts
if we succeed here on Kickstarter we'll
be able to manufacture the monkey light
grow and light up the world I hope you
enjoyed our video please support our
project
Peter's interpreter
do you travel and when you do your
device's travel with you then you know
plugging your devices in different
countries can be a challenge whether you
travel often or once in a while you've
probably used one of these at least once
in your lifetime simpler travel adaptors
only plug into one type of socket
Universal adapters aren't the most
travel friendly because they're big
bulky and can be quite heavy
well after countless prototypes
extensive testing and customer feedback
we created a better solution to help
travelers like their devices anywhere in
the world introducing micro the world's
smallest universal travel adapter with
surge protection compacting all the
benefits of a bulky universal adapter
into a cool gadget this small the single
socket adapter bringing over a hundred
and fifty countries from all seven
continents into the palm of your hand
squeezing all plugs from around the
world into a compact space for maximum
versatility micro is super small weighs
only 40 grams is durable then very
travel friendly plugging in the micro is
easy micro accepts all major plug types
from around the world the adjustable
integrated casing makes it easy to cover
any third pin safely
the release mechanism is spring-loaded
and easy to use top slide the plug into
the Americas and over 54 countries
simply twist to use in Australia and
over 29 other countries and when you're
done push to store and block bottom
slide the plug into Europe and over 125
countries simply connect the integrated
modular third connects tension for
access to the UK and over 47 other
countries when you're done you know the
drill
push door and lock the built-in fuse
protects your devices wherever you
travel because a blown fuse is always
better than a fried to laptop phone or
tablet simply replace the fuse and
you're ready to go wherever your travels
may take you the world's smallest
lightest universal travel adapter keeps
your gadgets safe and makes plugging
your devices easier than ever before
let's improve the way we plug our
devices when we travel back our campaign
and help us bring micro to life
the magpie is the smartest tracking
device in the world
it's a rechargeable very very cheap unit
with over a hundred countries available
to support tracking
before starting map I worked on several
projects I've built a car out of Legos
build my own jet propelled bicycle
I've also launched a pulley in outer
space for under thousand dollars someone
showed me the video once I saw it and
once I met roll I knew we had to find a
way to put something together a primary
driver for me is is moving away from the
world I'm creating products and
experiences for for big companies that
don't necessarily add any value to the
world with my fire we definitely want to
build something that actually improves
people's lives something that is always
there always on you don't have to even
think about the possibility but whenever
you need it it's there for you I kept
reading about people going missing and
you always succeed you will for a
neighborhood pets go missing this is one
of these tiny little problems that seems
to perpetuate the world and that's
essentially how we got to magpie it's
removing those moments of anxiety and
tension seamlessly with a simple piece
of technology
magpie is built to last that's
rechargeable has a long-lasting battery
and it's waterproof and dustproof it's
based on GPS technology which
essentially unlocks the world that's the
main differentiator between Bluetooth
device which is 30 50 maybe 100 feet and
something that's powered by GPS it sits
on top of a cell Metro so the
Kickstarter really is the beginning of a
larger vision we want to bring on people
who can be part of the community to
evolve this product into what it could
be
med C is the next generation first aid
and rescue kit designed specially to
help you in case of emergency or any
other unpredictable situation the
creation process was based on knowledge
and experience of professional travelers
doctors soldiers rescuers and survival
experts the minimalistic case design
combines three sections and the main
court the core lights up the inner space
of the case and can be used as the
tangible torch in case of emergency it
also has a built-in power bank to charge
any device or even jumpstart your car's
engine the Corps has a magnet so that it
can be placed on any metallic surface
the top is a multi section organizer
designed for storing must have first-aid
medicine it consists of five separate
compartment for instruments dressings
and bandages medicines and antiseptics
dental supplies and custom necessities
the middle section is designed to store
bigger medical and rescue tools as well
as other people's necessities by the way
there is the pocket-sized rescue
container to fill containers and two
pocket-sized boxes that can be built
with small first aid items the bottom of
the case includes cables for a power
bank jump starter and lightweight pouch
that can be used in situations where the
Med Z case is bulky and inconvenient the
back side of the case has four velcro
pads to keep it inside your car's trunk
and prevent meds from a shaken
gathering researching about we examine
most major emergencies that can occur to
any of us
moreover I've seen those situations and
truly know how important it is to have
all the necessity and how vitally
valuable is time that's why we've
decided to create the most complete
functional solution and we call it
medicine
