this easy Stars world first holographic
smartphone so how do we generate glass
free holograms on smartphones when we're
looking at our smart phone a camera will
quickly track our I mu I tracking data
is sent to our on trip signal processing
unit it's quickly processed by our eye
tracking system which will lock on to
where our eyes are looking this is very
important our eye tracking system will
adjust the hologram generated based on
where your eyes are looking and you'll
immediately see the holographic effect
this is the world's first holographic
smartphone with our pioneering eye
tracking technology an innovation
dedicated to the smartphone application
we call this smart holographics you'll
find four cameras on our holographic
phone a perfect air interface the dual
lens camera on the back is not just for
taking holographic images but more
importantly it's designed to collect and
process holographic data
so what new user experience will such an
innovative holographic smartphone bring
us no more dizziness or narrow viewing
angles when watching tourism freely a
truly immersive way to watch videos and
3d game playing becomes more fun and
thrilling distance is no longer a
problem lifelike product displays for
online shopping
complex traffic systems become easy to
navigate education is no longer boring
but fun and lively anytime anywhere 3d
scanning and printer well this is just
the beginning
East our we'll continue to create new
technologies for holographic
applications we make the impossible
possible and create better lives
technology is growing every single day
every single R and every single minute
today to make it big in technology you
need to have great idea we love
technology technology has brought a
little perspective in our lives but have

you
you
any jock whatever huh hey what's up with
you and Carla has she left you yet
oh she did hello hello
oh okay my ten technology it's my thing
well I need to get going wow that's
amazing oh can I see that yeah
all in a day's work for Samsung
awesome
hey you should join me for coffee
sometime it's my card cool hey for
handing out business cards
bye-bye Oh thought you never leave
whoa that's amazing
whatever happened to the days in Mobile
when companies were constantly pushing
the boundaries of innovation and design
putting out products so where sometimes
even considered wacky we needed to
design a device that was not only an
incredible phone but also an amazing
wearable I used to repair a lot of
phones I had crack screens or water
damaged and did it quite frequently and
when I took apart a lot of these phones
I noticed that a lot of the brand's
shared similar construction and design
techniques and oftentimes used materials
that were obsolete like screws and using
rigid and fragile materials like glass
and even steel and thought to myself
there had to be a better way we first
started with a lot of different types of
concepts and designs and after a lot of
iterations and testing and vetting we
really kind of narrowed it down to two
designs which was a large and a small
and before you knew that reporte was
born
we needed to ensure that it was not only
waterproof but also flexible
shatterproof and where we needed to
build a team of incredible people with
the wide range of skill sets who are all
unified to pursue our mission and break
the mold of the mobile market the
problem with the mobile market right now
is that the phones are all the same and
what little differentiation they have is
that some are less user-friendly and
some are less durable things like this
still happen so we're here to change
that with the vibrant pallets clean
typography and easy to understand icon
set the portal UI is experience it
cannot be missed why be stuck with the
same old design when you've got a new
refreshing interface to play with the
interface that helps you interact that
knows what you want and works with you
in the way that you want it to work the
portal not only has all the features you
would expect such as Wi-Fi Bluetooth and
NFC but also has a waterproof Kevlar
infused polyurethane body a six inch
flexible display wireless charging and
unlock network and so much more
you
you
some of the biggest challenges of
starting a smartphone company are all
the licensing and government
certifications involved which you can
probably imagine is enormously expensive
all of us here at a Rubik's truly
believe that we can change the world
with our innovation even if you can't
help back us please help spread the word
so we can revolutionize the mobile
industry every day we throw away
millions of electronic devices because
they get old and become worn out but
usually it's only one of the components
that causes the problem the rest of the
device works fine but is needlessly
thrown away simply because electronic
devices are not designed to last this
makes electronic waste one of the
fastest growing waste streams in the
world and our phone is one of the
biggest causes so this is a new kind of
phone
it's made of blocks detachable blocks
they are all connected to the base and
the base connects everything together
electrical signals are transferred
through the pins and two small screws
lock everything in place so if for
instance your phone is getting a little
slow you can just upgrade the block that
affects the speed or if something breaks
you can easily replace it with a new one
or update it with the latest version
another great thing about this is you
can customize your phone so let's say
this is your phone and you do everything
in the cloud why not replace your
storage block for a bigger battery block
if you're like this guy and love to take
pictures why not upgrade your camera or
if you don't care about any of this
stuff you can keep it simple and get a
bigger speaker you can choose the blocks
you want support the brands you like or
even develop your own blocks phone
blocks is built on an open platform
where companies work together to create
the best phone in the world to set up
this platform we need to get the right
companies and the right people involved
they will only get started if there is a
lot of interest in a phone worth keeping
so this is the plan to show them there
is an interest for this phone we need
your voice you can donate your social
reach on the website
we gather as much people as possible on
the 29th of October we send out the
blasts all at the same time spreading
all your voices to show the world there
is a need for a phone worth keeping the
more people involved the bigger the
impact please visit phonebloks com to
raise your voice and spread the word
