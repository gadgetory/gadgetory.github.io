Treadway and I am CTO and co-founder at
Acton Acton is a company that designs
and manufactures personal transportation
we are introducing a longboard the likes
of which the world has never seen
carbon fiber pressure cast aluminum
extruded aluminum CNC cut we are using
four hub motors all wheel drive people
all wheel drive the one that will get
you up most of the steepest hills in
America and around the world
but wait there's more if you're looking
for something a little more affordable
we've got you
we have two more models what we call the
blink s and the blink s - it's a
different construction than the Quattro
it's made of wood but it has an aluminum
extrusion along the bottom and aluminium
plate on top to kind of sandwich the
batteries inside of the deck so there's
actually a hole that goes clear through
it the S 2 version of this board is a
little bit longer than the S and that's
because it has the extra motor and it
goes a little faster and just needs to
be a little longer for more stability
so you get to choose from three boards
you get the cuatro or the blink guess or
the blink s2
now we're releasing three products at
the same time here so of course this is
why we're on IndieGoGo but we have
finished the development on these and we
have of course factory minimums that we
need to meet and that's why we're here
and that's why we need your help help us
out and get yourself onto an active
board and glide uphill into the future
of personal transportation thank you
bite just take out your phone and start
painting the light in the desired
direction the more light you paint the
brighter it gets and you don't have to
worry about the position of your phone
as the app rotates with your movements
the right painted on your phone is
always aligned with your land simply
paint and enjoy you can save your
personalized light scenes and switch
between them with a simple swipe the
lamp uses different colored LEDs so you
can choose between warm and cool whites
warm light to relax cool light for tasks
such as reading because it helps you
concentrate when you leave the room it
turns itself off to save your money and
the environment when you enter the room
the lamp uses presence detection and
smart algorithms to predict which light
scene is best suited creating a new
light scene is easy just pick a color
and start painting your light
once you are satisfied save the setting
as a new light scene with the colored
indirect light you can create the
perfect mood for any situation where you
want a touch of color but the lamp gives
you much more than just beautiful mood
lighting it can easily illuminate even
larger rooms for example if you are in a
hurry and looking for your keys get the
perfect light for any situation with
smart lighting from Luke Robert's planet

his son
Hoggett power is a compact self-watering
rotatable garden tower that can fit in
any home apartment or office tiger tower
brings the joy and health benefits in
gardening
closer to home hi I'm daya and I'm Cyril
via father-and-son team who brought the
tiger tail to life so everyone could
enjoy a fresh and organic produce grown
at home we used to live in the Maryland
countryside where gardening was an
important part of our daily life we grew
fresh fruits and vegetables in our
backyard and enjoyed the results in
every meal we loved their family time
spent garden together and always had
plenty of fresh and organic produce to
share with others all throughout the
year when we moved to the Bay Area we
had to say goodbye to our home garden we
quickly mr. joys and benefits of having
fresh produce so we began working on
what would become the title tower people
who have been big cities have limited
space so we knew we would have to build
up we began with the tower idea to
accommodate for gardening and apartments
offices or patios where efficiency is
key we also know that people don't have
a lot of extra free time so we created a
system that automates a lot of the
gardening work and requires minimal
daily attention we built three layers of
plant boxes to space and sunlight in the
most efficient way possible for even
distribution of sunlight
we had a 360 degree rotation which also
allows you easy access to all the plants
or interior rooms we included LED lights
to deliver the best spectrum of light
for optimal plant growth watering is
very important but easy to forget so we
made the target our self watering
internal sensors can detect when the
soil is too dry and can activate the
included water pump to distribute water
to each plant box the taiga tower can
connect to regular garden hoses to make
refilling the included water basin a
breeze the rotation watering and
lighting can be controlled manually or
automatically scheduled using the
built-in motors and sensors you can get
as specific or creative as you want
through the target our mobile app you
can discover new plant ideas or growing
combinations from others through the app
you can even download specific growing
schedules for your ideal mix of flowers
or organic produce and let the target
our take care of the rest
we began no agenda blue the taiga target
number
prototypes at each stage in the process
we improved up on the design and the
features our prototype towers have
demonstrated the value and joy of having
a compact home garden that requires a
minimal care we tested our design in
homes backyards and offices and it's
been a wonderful addition to every
setting we place today with the tiger
tower you can roll all the organic
produce you want for your family
regardless of where you lay your pledge
gets you the photog entire system which
includes the tiger tower on wheels with
nine full-size play boxes water base and
pump LED full-spectrum lights integrated
sensors for water and light control the
target our mobile app and a starter kit
including seeds and planning
instructions after closing this campaign
and listening to your solutions we will
submit this model to be manufactured and
delivered to you next year we're excited
to share this project with you and with
your help we're even more excited to
make it a reality
plus today to get your Tiger tower at a
Kickstarter discount and to bring the
amazing benefits of home gardening to
your family office to the classroom got
it
you
yeah waking up is never easy
thanks to bixie one move and they can
stop their alarm and that's just the
beginning they can also control all
kinds of connected devices with simple
gestures it's very useful when alex is
on his bike and can't focus on anything
but the road or when lisa is so busy
working doing stuff that she just can't
touch her devices just like them any
time you want to do many things at the
same time Big C can help it's smart
seamless and easy well easier than
cooking apparently no need to stop doing
what you're doing
no need to reach the device you want to
interact with you can even switch from
one function to another from one device
to another with a simple gesture told
you it was smart
and because fixie is full of surprises
it also lets you control your
environment believe me that's something
you will like well you know almost
everything hi this is Vijay I am Luigi
we are the founders of Big C we know how
busy hands are challenged to control
connected devices I had the idea of bixi
a year ago and my wife and I wanted to
control our smartphones and tablets by
cooking and biking with like then I
started out to design this intuitive
personal companion vixy that can be used
by anyone anywhere we have a sample of
talented and experienced team that is
working hard at bringing Big C to you
now to make it happen we need your
support
pre-order your Big C today and be among
the first ones to enjoy the simplicity
that it brings to our connected lives so
what are you waiting for
good morning selfie time to wake up let
me sleep five more minutes it's not a
great day to have in Lyon you've got a
meeting at 9:00 a.m. we're always here
to make your morning easier he's going
to change the way you like it every day
no more buttons it's so much easier what
about the traffic on the road to Memphis
the road is clear but it's gonna get
busy in 40 minutes
I advise you use public transportation
smart networks then Caltrain okay I'm
gonna
don't roll down the temperature earth
meatballs Rome to smother I'm shocked
you talk to
we founded Hawley four years ago our
mission to make your morning's bright
found him as of fifty years of
experience in answering devices from
product design to manufacture for more
than a year we've been working on
Bonjour software from AI to voice
recognition we worked with award-winning
designers to offer you a breathtaking
design masterpiece hey James he didn't
walk much today tomorrow is Saturday how
about going for a run
wake me up tomorrow morning at 7:30
there was as good it's not let me sleep
we dreamed up a product that knows what
you want before you do more room play
something relaxing the gathers
information such as weather traffic news
do you have anything to tell me hey
James you should check your security cam
after a year of hard work we need your
support to produce BOSU on an industry
scale and to learn on the market
we've completed the design out so the
manufacturers and develop the software
we need your support to make Bordeaux
and reality thanks for your support
welcome to the modern lifestyle we rely
on our tech every day to empower us to
make a difference but our tech relies on
us for one thing does this look familiar
forget that this is eclipse the new
neater way to charge your devices with
its compact and round design it can live
on your nightstand desk or even your
wall eclipse is more than just a three
port USB hub it's the only charging
station that you won't want to hide away
setup is easy up to three of your USB
cables around into their own
precision-engineered channel so you
don't have to worry about them tangling
or overlapping unlike cable boxes and
charging stations that just hide the
mess Eclipse keeps up to 24 feet of
cables neat and easy to access it comes
with a braided power cable essentially
extending each of your charging cables
by an extra four feet now you only need
one power socket to charge all of your
devices better yet you can use the
cables you already have
it doesn't just look good though
unlike lots of underpowered USB hubs out
there the clips intelligently ensures
that your devices are charging at their
maximum speed it uses an advanced
transformer to deliver safe and stable
currents that won't damage your precious
devices batteries and for your early
adopters it even has a USB C port now
for the magic with a single touch
Eclipse Rises and emits a subtle halo
forget having to turn on the lights to
find that dreaded cable tap it once more
and it's halo fades away along with your
cable frustration almost three years ago
we launched our first lease on the
campaign the gem cable with the legal
about 10,000 units got priceless
feedback from our backers helping us
bring an exciting new product to market
since then we've been designing and
producing a full line of charging cables
none of this would have been possible
without the Kickstarter community
however no matter how much effort we put
into making the best possible charging
cables there was always one issue that
wasn't addressed we ran a survey and
quickly learned from thousands of people
that this was a pain shared by almost
everyone so we got to work we've been
living in breathing eclipses for a year
now selecting the best materials and
working closely with industry leaders
refined every single digital after
multiple design iteration and prototypes
we finally have the solution we've been
looking for now we're back on
Kickstarter the community that helped us
change the way people think about
charging with the clips we're not
launching just another USB hub we're
trying to enhance the way people live
with their tech only you can tell us if
this is worth making are you sick of
cable clutter so are we
let's make it a thing in the past there
are many different leaning product
available today but they all have the
elements and are often not able to be
used in certain areas the ZBrush is the
universal Wacom clean attachment that
knows no limits the principal is
Jr in contrast to the most commonly used
where completeness dusty brush does not
have one latch to blow receiver opening
but instead has many tube through small
openings the suction is the true way of
optimally among all the tubes so you
don't have a decrease in suction and the
way Campina will not be overloaded
Justin who the brush the chips are worth
flexible and fit perfectly onto all
evening services it doesn't matter if it
is a small roof hidden corners or
delicate items thanks to a special high
molecular weight thermoplastic polymer
much pressure can be used dust brush
when that breath blows returns to its
original position dusting brush is
universal there's an adapter ingredient
in the handle which makes it possible to
attach the brush to working cleaner
tubes with openings from 32 millimetres
to 42 millimeters this attachment boxer
suitcases with small parts like toy
swing needles or screws can be cleaned
in no time at all
it used to be very time-consuming to
clean them in the future using dusty
brush all kinds of boxes holding small
pots can be simply awakened out nothing
will be sucked away and no small part
will get lost the boxes and contents
will be quickly and easily clean with
little effort in the car are also
similar difficult areas to clean
colourless know this when delayed
recruits see tracks traced seat cushions
all these areas can be cleaned the
father's Lee with dusty brush dust brush
sucks the dirt from deep within cracks
and riches and fits perfectly between
the seat cushions the small area between
the window and the door fittings will be
effectively clean even the dirty areas
between the seat tracks into the
smallest snacks and crannies can be
easily cleaned
some of the biggest us collectors are
electric equipment especially computers
dust collects on them they overhead and
do not perform well in combination with
the anti-static power we can use that
see brush to remove the dust without
compressed air or special equipments
difficult to reach areas will be easily
freed from dust even cables and
sensitive electronics can be cleaned
this way with no problems at the same
time no dust gets out into the
surrounding areas your PC will thank you
even our best friends are also blessed
with the dusty brush over time lose hair
and dead skin cells met up the firth
dust brush can wake him the hair and
skin cells deeply out of the fur the
tubes act like a brush and comb the fur
at the same time
after several usages the fur fits much
smoother there's enough suction when
used in the Ferelden direction to wake
him up the desk in thirds without dust
approach attaching itself to the skin
the tubes remove loose hair from your
pet before it can spread into the room
instead it gets sucked directly into the
vacuum cleaner that is really great
this is the new generation of controller
shift it is the world's easiest
controller ever you just need to move
your thumb and then the drum will follow
in the same direction there is no need
for you to think about it beforehand it
is simple and easy
you can play with it 24/7 even while you
eat a sandwich it can be used with only
one hand and still have the best
performance now you have an extra hand
available while flying your drone
what's more shift is compatible with
other existing drone models using our
application the old drone you already
own is now ready to go
and of course with your free hand you
can even answer the phone at the same
time you can also use the advanced mode
by adding the simple T ie extension
there are extra customizable keys for
experts like MPD racers and advanced
camera users
simply put it's for everyone men women
and children and even first-time drug
violence
