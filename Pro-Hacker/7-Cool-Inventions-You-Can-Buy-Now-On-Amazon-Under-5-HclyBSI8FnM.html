at oxy we love to solve pet peeves one
of our pet peeves was the weak plastic
ties that hold bread bags close which is
why we created the bag since the October
sense replaces weak and cumbersome bread
tags and twist ties just squeeze the
clip and grip onto any twisted bag such
as bread and bulk food bags for a tight
seal the generously sized non-slip pads
on the ends make for a secure soft grip
when clipping bag plastic teeth on the
inside of this cinch hold bag securely
and bright colors make it easy to find
in the drawer here's a good tip while
these senses are excellent for bread
bags they are equally as good for
holding frozen bags of peas and other
fruits and vegetables closed hi I'm Greg
from oslo and today i'll be
demonstrating a three and one egg
separator this handy little tool keeps
bowls and countertops clean when you're
cracking eggs to use just hook the
separator on the side of a bowl it fits
both thick and thin rims bowls this
raised edge is the perfect surface for
neatly cracking eggs the base doubles as
a separator to divide the yolks from egg
whites in one easy step
finally the separator catches unwanted
shells when you're done just pop it in
the dishwasher for easy cleaning
reusable and incredibly versatile gear
ties can be used to bundle organize or
secure just about anything you want to
keep some handy around the house in the
garage at the work site and on your next
outdoor adventure the bendable wire
inside provides strength and holding
power with a simple twist no knots
required making them easy to put on and
take off the durable rubber coating
won't mark or scratch your gear and is
comfortable and easy to manipulate in
your hand will make the gear tight
clothing truly unique is the patented
design in which it is extruded over the
wire and bonded to it at the molecular
level
this means that the rubber won't pull
away from the wire even under high
tension and after hundreds of uses
available in a wide variety of sizes
there's a perfect ear type for any job
wrapping headphones and power cables
securing bread bags and foam courts
Frankling pool noodles and garden hoses
organizing extension cords and tools
packing sleeping pads and fishing rods
walking down coolers and tackle boxes
and so much more
the different colors can help you locate
the right table on the bottom of your
bag or help to sort out who's fortitude
waterproof and stay for use in
freshwater and saltwater these here ties
are tough enough to withstand all of the
elements pick up some gear type and
you'll wonder how you ever got by
Woodhouse up
I never really thought it was a problem
I'd always suspected those around me had
seen my pen clicking me shaking and desk
tapping but I had no idea how bad they
got me
I just figured it all the time with
anything I could get my hands on any
matter what
and bubble wrap a bubble wrap
the way a pop pop pop I just couldn't
get enough that was probable
thankfully my Kickstarter community
from the people divisions 2n comes into
the counter to get you to satisfy any
urgent to click roll band and under
column H be insulted without dragging
your polygon delay
if you it appears that you suggested
fidgeting increases focus and improve
productivity
I want to mess with
the cocoon this doesn't mean to allow
you the opportunity in anything
digicube like he's a spy my kid Janine
without endlessly annoying those around
me I thought I could stop at any time
and now I realize I don't want to just
you can help take the first step to
fidget in freedom today okay so in all
seriousness we make joke about fidgeting
we give our friends or coworkers a hard
line for the pennant working and the
nail-biting
but what if they're on stencil what it
means a coping mechanism
Oh a crush please focus and more
pleasure than a moment one science is
smarter than us believe that we have
this thing called floating attention
which makes it hard for us to focus in
certain circumstances okay hey Marc
Jenna yeah Ashley fidgety has been shown
to be able to help keep that Borden
attention ah slide which helps you
better fill from the task in which maybe
even a little crazier is that some
recent studies have suggested that
students who use fidgeting as a
mechanism during SAT and to perform
better on those than when there are to
himself
bridgett cube has been a project we've
dreamt about for almost four years now
and we're excited to finally be bringing
this to you it's been a long road with a
lot of prototypes but we can prevent a
little bit when designing fidget cube we
wanted to ensure two things first the
functionality needed to truly satisfy
visiting me it needed to be an entire
toolbox of fidgety options while staying
small and compact which leads us to our
second and equally important priority we
wanted physic u'b to be a premium best
toy that could be discreetly used in any
situation from a classroom to a
boardroom
the fidgets cube of course has six sides
we really think digicube has so many
different applications and we're so
important you try not want to thank you
so much for your support</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
