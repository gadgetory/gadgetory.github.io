hi I'm Adrienne passionate storyteller
and creator of victory tripod because
I'm always on the go I've been looking
for an ultra portable and
multifunctional tripod that works with
my smartphone DSLR camera and GoPro and
that's ready to use wherever I travel
victory stands apart from the pack
because of its compact size unique
design and extendable legs fast to set
and easy to use
victory will help you capture the moment
like never before
forget flimsy selfie sticks that have
limited angle versatility and often end
up visible in your pictures
no more improvisations and no more
compromise other tripods on the market
are heavy bulky and inconvenient to
transport to location and halt to the
site victory is sleep light and
comfortable to carry you can now be part
of the picture part of priceless
memories have perfect control over your
images and get the best angle without
interrupting the moment don't ever miss
out on a great photo opportunity no
matter where you are

Hertz IMU including an accelerometer and
gyroscope and the latest 10 Hertz GPS

durability
