honey
I approve yep pretty much does
everything introducing the cool box the
world's most advanced tool box hi I'm
Mike and I'm Chris the history of the
modern tool box is over a hundred years
old but today there have been very few
truly remarkable enhancements or
improvements made to this commonly used
carrying case that's what motivated us
to develop the cool box we've assembled
the team of some of the best product
designers engineers and business
development people in the industry the
cool box product combines many commonly
used tools and workshop items with some
of the most recent and popular
technological enhancements all for the
purpose of making projects easier and
more enjoyable we've created our first
two prototypes and are extremely
satisfied with how they turned out
our warehouse fulfillment center and
manufacturing facility are all set up
the cool box is ready to go now we need
your help IndieGoGo with your support we
can revolutionize the way you work on
any job thank you
measuring tapes help us measure
distances and the dimensions of
different objects but a measuring tape
doesn't work in every situation why
isn't there a single tool that lets us
measure everything now there is
introducing beigel the smart tape
measure bagel lets you measure just
about anything at home and at work
bagel has three different modes string
mode wheel mode and remote mode string
mode is great for measuring straight
lines curves and around corners wheel
mode lets you measure irregular or odd
shaped objects and it also makes taking
measurements with one hand much easier
remote mode lets you measure objects
that are far away and out of your reach
after you're done measuring you'll need
a way to record your measurements using
pen and paper can be a real hassle with
bagel you can quickly and easily save
your measurements with voice
descriptions just take your measurement
push the Save button and then tag a
voice memo to it the future ADA when
you're done bagel will send your
measurements to bagels mobile app via
Bluetooth this mobile application lets
you review your saved measurements and
share them with your friends bagel is
precise it uses our patented technology
to make sure you always get an accurate
measurement also bagel has an easy to
read digital display that's viewable in
most lighting condition
in the past few years also some
measuring devices have become smarter
and made our lives easier it's math
skills smart thermometers and even smart
watches but when it comes to measuring
size we still use a tape measure which
is more than a century old
why don't you innovate the way we
measure size so we created bagel a smart
a measure we put a lot of effort into
creating vago our team worked night and
day to make the best quality product
with this pendulum design we have our
final prototype that is ready for mass
production now we need your help to
deliver this amazing product to everyone
please help us bring this bagel to life
thank you
size matters

nite ize products stand for innovation
creativity and quality discover your
solution visit nite ize calm hi I'm Sean
Riley and I'm the designer of the Kiwi
the Kiwi is an ergonomic cutting tool
the concept came about after hours and
hours of model beating and the pain that
was associated with the pen knives that
are on the market gorilla we created
multiple versions of which were tested
here in Boston after hundreds of
prototypes and test beds you combine
that information into a seal okay Alan
is our version more comfortable doubles
on the market it's better for your hands
keys organic court allows to hold it in
writing different ways that are all
grammatically superior to a typical
animal it's also bilaterally symmetrical
so that means it works for both
right-handed and left-handed people
which design cubes have as few moving
parts as long while we can changing our
blades quick easy and safe Cuban has a
magnet and a fastening mechanism that
locks the lid in place fasting mechanism
prevents ablated getting stuck thicker
materials while the magnet makes it so
they play up any surface in your current
we will be offering full solid wood
Kiwis as well as injection with their
plastic chemists the would handle knife
is perfect for the artist or craft loves
and the plastic handle is the affordable
and accessible option which we want to
make available to every part marketer
student he works with Xcel blades
exactly as well as all other major
brands and precision reasonably
the quality product can be cheap it'll
meet here in the US there's a
significant other cost and that's what
we need your help with your contribution
to get the first production miles around
the design is done it has the thoroughly
test and we'll use the money for a CNC
machine to produce the women with knives
and for the other to link up to the
matarese objectionable demands I spent
two years working on this design
Canadian truffle under prototypes
because I wanted the design be perfect
before asking for your support
if you're an architecture student like
me or maker or blueburger
that makes precise cuts you know how
hard those traditional methods are our
games help us get better tools to you
