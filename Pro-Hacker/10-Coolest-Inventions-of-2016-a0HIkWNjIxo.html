that's crazy that's like really good
sound to the music very very clearly as
well oh my god these are just like
really you can't hear it okay here we go
away what's that
what's its brand called what is it
called this is sungki listening to music
and answering phone calls are available
jungle Panther yo what do you have -
nothing much just hanging on my place
right now what's up yeah I'll be right
over in a little bit cool later
bone conduction speakers transmit sound
waves to the skull via vibrations
thing should keep up to yourself so tell
me why
this is how I tell you
now listen you
why do we keep it all to yourself now
who try to sing this telling you
you
yeah it's really good volume I can yeah
everything it's amazing it's amazing how
I hear the sounds coming through yeah so
funny well Otto hey dress nobody music
yeah oh wow that's really cool
that's crazy
yeah
ah
you
well nowadays people take thousands of
pictures with their cell phones but they
never look at them so we decided to
create an object that will make them
able to share pictures with their their
friends and family in a tangible way
print is the first smartphone case that
prints out pictures instantly you just
have to create your smartphone snap a
picture and imprint instantly we worked
during a year on about 15 different
prototypes to come up with one product
that's really easy to use for example it
doesn't use Bluetooth technology or
Wi-Fi you can take a picture but you can
also use pictures from Facebook
Instagram any picture that is already on
your smart
my biggest design challenge was to
create and objects that will work with
different type of smartphones who are
compatible with the iPhone 5 the iPhone
6 and also the galaxy s4 in galaxy s5
and we're trying to bring it to more
smartphones we don't need any ink
cartridge all the ink is already in the
paper you just have to hit it and the
picture will appear like like magic like
I said what we really love about instant
cameras is the whole experience so we
try to capture it by recording your
short videos at five six seconds just
before you take a picture this video
will play automatically on the paper
through augmented reality when you scan
it with our app
we wanted to go further than just
printing pictures we wanted to bring
memories that you could hold in your
hands and that you could give away
whenever you wanted print is for
everybody because everybody likes a
printed picture that you can hold in
your hand you know it's like a memory
that you can give away Trista Stowe must

water is one of the world's most
fundamental elements
it makes them about 70% of the Earth's
surface and a similar percentage of our
bodies each day we have an intimate
interaction with water for most of us
this starts with our showers our showers
are deeply personal our lone time to
wake up to think to rejuvenate to unwind
at Nebbia we set out to see if we can
make this important part of our daily
rituals better in every way we started
with a nice Carlos one of our
co-founders ran a large Fitness Club
company and was deeply concerned about
the high use of water together with his
father Emilio a search for a solution it
turns out showers are one of the highest
wasters of water and there hasn't been
any meaningful innovation over a century
nearly five years later dozens of
prototypes built we've had 500 people
try it and now we think we've built
something pretty special imagine being
totally embraced by water from the
moment you step into your shower imagine
an experience with water so moving you
never want to step out your skin feels
soft and hydrated maybe is about
experiencing water in a way that you
never have before
to innovate on the shower experience we
had to look outside of the current
industry and approach the engineering
problem from a completely new angle the
last half century of nozzle technology
has completely changed what we can do
with droplet sizes and distribution
however this technology has only been
applied to very specialized fields like
rocket engines and medical devices we
use these same tools and technology to
develop Nebadon what we do is atomized
streams of water into millions of tiny
droplets by doing this we can achieve 10
times the surface area of water
compared to a regular shower while using
a fraction of the volume I just got out
of my first nevia shower it was a
totally unique experience and I loved it
I was getting hit with these little
water droplets I love the feeling all
the droplets hitting your skin it's like
you're being enveloped by water and as
an Airbnb host there are a lot of
showers going on in my place and this is
important you know this thing is it not
only make the experience better for my
guests but it saves me money I felt
great it was a really fun comfortable
experience the whole thing just felt
awesome I could take that shower every
day we put nebula to the test on average
Americans take about eight minutes to
shower for the normal shower that's over
20 gallons of water for the Nebbia it's
only six that's seventy percent less
water we built Nebbia to be easy to
install you simply unscrew your existing
shower and screw on Nebu with a wrench
some plumbers tape and included adhesive
you don't have to call the plumber or
break tile in addition Nivea slides up
and down a couple of feet pivots at an
angle and includes a portable wand which
you can position wherever you choose
Nebbia provides a totally new and
refreshing shower experience we've
partnered with world-class design firm
box clever to create a design that is
both beautiful and intuitive yet offers
a totally new degree of adjustability on
top of that the water and energy savings
just makes sense we've set out to build
a company that will transform the way we
interact with water over the course of
the next few decades we've assembled a
team of thermal fluids experts to solve
some of the difficult engineering
challenges that have prevented
innovation in showers for a long time
and finally we're ready to bring that e
to the world

oh hi I'm Alex uh a year ago my friend
Jonathan and I started working on a new
type of computer care
we call it can oh and we're really
excited to show you it today we designed
it for all ages all over the world and
it gets you coding right away
hi Alyssa hi
as kids we loved playing games and
building things with Lego
but today the tools are different today
we have cheap computers we have free
software and we started Kanno
in order to make these tools accessible
for everyone for fun and purpose now the
Challenger Kanna was said by Mika Alex's
seven-year-old cousin I want you to make
this a simple and fun and Becca make out
a point and it's not just seven-year-old
I think a lot of us you know we're
amazed what an amazing time to be alive
we're fascinated by this but we we have
no way to get in the available resources
they're tough there isn't a simple fun
way to get starving we wanted to do
something different so we went around
the world we talked to hundreds of kids
parents teachers educators artists and
we came up with Kanna it's based on
three principles simple steps
storytelling physical computing and
tying them all together a sense of play
and exploration you plug in the pieces
you build a computer your own computer
you build a case you customize it with
your own designs you build an amazing
DIY speaker you code games like snake
and pong you dive into the command line
and explore you get to know your
computer you hack up games like
minecraft and at the end of it all you
look back and you realize wow you've
actually learned something you've got a
new type of skill a new way of
expressing yourself and one that's going
to be very very useful we think in the
future as computers have gotten more
complicated they've grown harder to
understand it's more important than ever
to give kids away in or they won't be
ready for the future but it's wonderful
to see the kids making a changing call
with the Kano with the kind of computer
gives the power to crate back to the
people it gives people the tools to
create it gives people the mindset to
think that
okay this was once closed but now was
open we made it consistent we made the
crudest confusion it felt like you were
actually the person who made it so like
you you weren't just playing it you felt
like you actually made it so as you can
see we got great feedback and now we're
coming to Kickstarter because we want to
make a bigger production and we want you
to help us shape it and make it happen
we spent the last few months working
with the right suppliers preparing our
production schedule and most importantly
building a team of people from six
different countries that are going to
help us make it happen and bring counter
to you we've designed new plug-and-play
Hardware for this amazing simple
out-of-the-box experience it's so much
fun and we think you're going to love it
on top of that we powered up the pie
with these great software game's levels
projects and also fixes an interface
that's more intuitive and more familiar
we want to make more kits of course but
we also want to push these updates back
into the open source community we think
that together all of us we have the
chance to do something really cool we
can give a new generation the ability to
create with technology rather than just
consume it and that's something that we
think is really worthwhile
folding bikes haven't changed in over 30
years they use small wheels and hinged
frames that sacrifice performance and
ride ability in order to achieve a
compact size they are heavy awkward to
use but worst of all they don't actually
fold that small we wanted to create a
folding bike with big wheels a bike that
looks strides and feels like a normal
bike but could still fold small smaller
than any other folding bike it also had
to be lightweight easy to use and
exceptionally safe introducing helix
helix is a revolutionary new folding
bike it has 24-inch wheels but one piece
titanium frames and a patent-pending
locking system that is free of hinges
and clamps seelix can go anywhere ride
it to work
put it in the trunk of your car for your
next road trip take it on your next
vacation set out to design the modern
whole device that didn't compromise ride
ability for sides using patent-pending
helical hinges we were able to put the
wheels is nice the frame and between the
crank arms helix was created using
modern computer aided design and
manufacturing process these uses the
latest bicycle technology helix improves
on decades-old folding bike designs in
every possible way it rides better fold
smaller and a safer and easier to use
Manufacturing a folding bike is
difficult Manufacturing a folding bike
that pushes the limited performance
compact Ness and usability requires a
hands-on approach and a high level of
control over the entire process
that's why helix will be made in Canada
we're a group of designers engineers and
manufacturing experts we're also
passionate cyclists
our goal is to make the best folding
bike in the world
we will oversee the entire manufacturing
process right here at home we're ready
and excited to go with your help we can
make it happen
I always felt that watching a record
spin is just mesmerizing
what's more iconic than the record
player it's beautiful to truly
experience vinyl we have to see it what
if we could create a record player that
played vertically what if we could
create floating lap
yeah
let's be the stars and bring space to
smile and Grandma box is an audio design
startup based out of Chicago we
reimagine vintage audio design with
modern technology creating a good
turntable on its own is challenging
creating a high-performance turntable
that functions vertically is a feat at
grandma Vox we have some of the best
designers engineers and audio files out
there we sought to create a high
performance record player meant as much
for the first time vinyl listener as the
person with their $10,000 so no
compromises it wasn't just a design
piece or technology piece it was a
marriage of beautiful design and
innovative technology coming into one
something that was inviting and that was
simple beautiful but functionally it had
to be an all-in-one well you didn't need
to buy additional cables preamps and
speakers we wanted to create a vinyl
listening experience that was ready to
go right out of the box we had to have
full range dynamic drivers for great
bass response and allowing you the
option of bypassing the internal
speakers and connecting it to an
existing audio setup we were ruthless in
the engineering too sure every part of
the product that works in a horizontal
context worked flawlessly in the
vertical format
somehow going through a bin in a record
store getting an actual album the sleeve
the inserts the typography the whole
notion of discovery that is all an
extension of the final experience that
this role experience just gives you
goosebumps
let's turn
something we can see
artists both indie and mainstream are
releasing their albums on vinyl in
addition to digital formats vinyl is not
a fad it's here to stay because it's the
best way to experience music
I fell through
I moved in to save I see let's
you
you
you
