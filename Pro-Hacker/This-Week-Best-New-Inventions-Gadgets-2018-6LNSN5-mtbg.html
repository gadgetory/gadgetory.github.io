and of course we want to do everything
on the go
so we fearlessly use public Wi-Fi
networks in restaurants airports
shopping malls coffee shops you name it
but are these networks safe while we
enjoy the convenience of these public
Wi-Fi networks we forget how much they
can cost us on a bad day by creating
fake hotspots or hijacking public
hotspots hackers can view all of your
private communications what's more they
can access your valuable data including
your bank account your passwords even
the photos you have stored on your
device hello my name is Aslam O'Toole
I spend the last 30 years in
cybersecurity I was searching a way to
protect myself in others when we connect
to private all public Wi-Fi networks I'm
proud to announce that I finally created
a device that will keep us all safe it's
small and fit into your pocket
it doesn't require any software and it
constantly monitored the network traffic
to and from our devices so it can stop
the attack before they happen
Wi-Fi wall is a standalone software free
device that's always on the lookout for
Wi-Fi hack Wi-Fi wall constantly
monitors all traffic on whatever network
you connect you and if it detects any
malicious or suspicious activity it
automatically alerts you to the problem
and most importantly immediately
disconnects your device using Wi-Fi wall
is easy just turn Wi-Fi wall on when you
leave your house and you can surf the
web with confidence wherever you go the
device fits on your keychain or in your
pocket doesn't require any new software
cables or cords and has a rechargeable
battery that lasts all day every year
millions of Wi-Fi users lose data to
hackers the truth is that while using
these devices on the go may be
convenient
it isn't always safe but with Wi-Fi wall
we can change that after a long period
of intensive testing we've developed a
working prototype of our product the
next step is to get into production and
into the hands of users all over the
world but to do that we need your help
support our campaign today so we can
manufacture Wi-Fi wall on a large scale
and bring this product to market at a
price everyone can afford backers of our
campaign will get Wi-Fi wall first and
at a reduced price but most of all they
get the assurance right away
that they're surfing the web safely
welcome back never before with son sock

alarm clock that uses not only sounds or
light but also fragrances that
stimulates your sense of smell to gently

selected by Google to be one of the top
inventions just to change a wall Google
helped me showcase my invention and make
it blossom company called sensor Wake is
developing an alarm clock that wakes
people up is in various smell the sensor
wake and I was like I'm an order that
immediately that's what I did in 2015 we
launched the first on cycle on clock on
Kickstarter supported by over 1500
backers will receive the sensor back in
2016 but we didn't want to stop there we
wanted to improve to enhance to innovate
based on feedback from our early backers
our new team is back on Kickstarter

with cents a week trio we have evolved
from a simple centrist alarm clock to an
all-in-one device that stimulates your
senses smell light and finally sound

starts off with your selected smell the
minute to the soothing light and finally
minute three a motivating melody snooze

and with four color options the
possibilities are endless the only limit
is your imagination
turn your wall into a wonder wha with
scribble today we need information but
we spend too much time in from the
screens for our smartphones computers
TVs so the question is how do we get
information and data but without adding
more screen sterilized what I love about
scribble is that it can literally turn
every surface you have around you into
something dynamic surfaces that can show
data art or murals that remind you of
the good times and it's an amazing way
not just to help you work leave but also
to interact with other people and to
interact remotely as well with other
people of your life really what you can
do is limitless
think about having a super gifted hand
it's a robotic hand and doing whatever
you want to do all you can think about
basic information as you know the
weather forecast or the things need to
buy it's like having an infield library
of apps allow you to turn anything in
life into something on your work whether
light the most about scribble is that
the enhances everyone's fertility and
let you transform your house in a more
beautiful place to live
scribble kinds in the wall with just two
tiny wires and it moves thanks to its
two motors also we identified a new end
which is completely here is a
we eat a fundamental part of Scribus
user experience is the platform that
allows people to upload share and the
world contents to display on their walls
the whole concept behind scribbly is to
create a community and everyone is
already excited about it I can't wait to
see where our system people will do with
the platform imagine drawing share with
scribble the disabilities are endless

clear immersive sound you can experience
your music safely without disturbing
people around you and since they're
fully stereo and open air the music will
feel like it's right next to you and all

microphone so you can jump on hands-free
