very own device for storage and charging

own where did the idea come from
well I'll show you look at this what an
epic day out a bonafide selfie time as
they say just need to squeeze a teeny
bit no up oh never mind ah more
manageable group just two guys actually
they want to take a selfie to remember
this wonderful place well I guess they
can just describe the view to their
friends back home right okay one more
try this time a good old barbecue

friends let's try the selfie stick
strategy still can't fit everybody in
annoying situations am i right we've all
been there buddy
that's how air selfie was born a perfect
team gathered together working in London
Milan and Shanghai to combine micro
flying technologies ultralight HD
cameras with in flight stability systems
our selfie can travel in a 20 meter
radius and hovers for up to three
minutes it's easily controllable from
both iOS or Android smartphone apps it's
only 52 grams and it slots into its
phone cover and recharges so what if the
guys had an air selfie with them they
make it hover find the perfect angle and
leave the controls finally snap an
amazing photo with the selfie delay
timer mode while it is autonomously
flying and keeping its position in the
air awesome
what about the two explorers they select
the classic flying mode from the three
options available control layer selfie
through the app by holding the phone
horizontally and take both memorable
photos and videos and what would have
happened at the barbecue enough with the
squeezing just select the selfie mode
use only two buttons to find the right
distance to shoot and take a great
picture
what about an indoor location whatever
it may be a party at somebody's house or
a night out in a club there are no
issues there selfie fly's easily it's
simple to control and very safe and once
you shoot a great picture don't keep it
to yourself it's so easy to share it
right from your phone as easy as
grabbing the air selfie safely while
it's still hovering in the air so this

before heard that sleep is important or
that we spend a third of our life in bed
but quality sleep is really what we need
and it seems harder and harder to
achieve these days what if your pillow
could be an active participant in your
sleep rather than just a dumb rectangle
what if your pillow could help you fall
asleep
if you could analyze your sleep
intelligently wake you up or even react
to when you snore here we believe a
pillow should do that that's why we
invented Zeke
the world's most sophisticated pillow
the easiest way to think about what Zeke
does is to walk you through how you
would use the before you go to bed
you'll open up the Zeke app you're going
to set your alarm answer a few optional
questions about your day even choose
what kind of music you want to listen to
Zico wirelessly stream your favorite
music whether it's iTunes Spotify or
some of the included sleep tracks to
eight precision placed speakers inside
once your sleep timer goes off
Zeke starts monitoring and analyzing
your sleep as well as listening for
snore if Zeke detects you're snoring too
loud it'll subtly vibrate to encourage
you to change sleep positions
additionally when it's time to wake up
is equal vibrate again to make sure you
wake up exactly when you wanted to but
what's really neat is with our smart
wake feature since we're already
analyzing your sleep we can tell if you
should wake up a little earlier than
your alarm I needed music to fall asleep
at night but my wife needs absolute
silence so one night I took a pot a pair
of wireless headphones and shoved them
inside my pillow and to my surprise I
was able to hear the music but my wife
wasn't I knew I was on to something so I
began to figure out how I could make
this pillow better Zeke's packed with
amazing innovations in technology in
order to make all of this happen we use
eight speakers inside of Z so the
sleeper can experience their sleep
playlist no matter how they lay on their
pillow Zeke also features a 3-axis
gyroscope to analyze motion in
three-dimensional space this is going to
allow for detailed analysis of your
sleep the microphone in Z is so
sensitive it can determine to the
decibel level how loudly your snoring
if you do begin storing Zico used its
vibration motors to gently nudge you to
encourage you to change sleep position
you can wake you up either at your set
alarm time or using smart wake wake you
up
based on your sleep cycle all the xik
settings can be personalized to your
specific sleep needs in the app any time
we went through many different component
designs to come up with a pillow that
was not only smart and sophisticated but
also incredibly comfortable for the
sleeper comfort is one of the most
important aspects when choosing a pillow
and as we tested various fabrics for the
outer cover of Zeke we found that
tensile was the perfect choice we spent
the last two years making Zeke out
favorite pillow and it's nearly ready
for you all the hard work is being done
the prototypes finalized the supplies
are lined up we just need your help to
start mass production please help us
bring Zeke to you thank you for your
support is your drinking water safe
recent studies have found water
contamination is a much more serious
issue than previously thought and
governments around the world
