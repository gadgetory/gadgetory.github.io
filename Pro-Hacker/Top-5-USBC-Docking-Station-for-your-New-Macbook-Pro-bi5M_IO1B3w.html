with many groundbreaking features like
the touch bar only to discover it
doesn't work with any of your devices
you would practically need a dongle for
everything what if there is a sleek
compact adapter for your macbook that is
able to provide all the ports you need
introducing hyperdrive the adapter that
replaces all other dongles now you can
connect an HDMI display and a
thunderbolt display USB C data SD memory
card micro SD card USB 3.0 flash drive
and a USB 3.0 hard drive all while
charging your macbook pro at full speed
stop figuring out how to store and carry
your dongles with hyperdrive just pack
and go don't look silly with dongles
just go with hyper drive hyper drive
gets you up and running in no time
hyper drive is the first hub
specifically designed for the new
macbook pro utilizing two Thunderbolt
USB C ports to provide more bandwidth
than any other dongle in the market
hyper drive is made of precision milled
aluminum available in both silver and
Space Gray to match the MacBook Pro and
the same hyper drive works with the 13
and 15 inch macbook pro
these three plastic dolls cost over $100
from the Apple store but you can get the
sleek ultra compact aluminum hyperdrive
with all the same ports and more
starting at $49 but only through this
campaign so pledge now and be the first
in the world to get the hyperdrive
know where we can go
we're pluggable technologies and we do
docking stations and what we're excited
to show you in this Kickstarter is our
new pluggable ultimate type C docking
station so why do we call it ultimate it
actually has its own power source is
able to charge any of the coming
generation of USB type-c tablets laptops
and phones it's really the first time
that you're able to have a universal
power supply or Universal docking
station that works with everything the
other thing that makes the docking
station ultimate is the ability not just
to connect one display out to your
laptop or tablet but actually connect up
to three additional displays to any
Windows or Mac laptop or tablet that
uses the type-c connector this is really
great for information workers people
doing video editing if you just want to
edit photos at home you're not trapped
on a small screen of your laptop or
tablet it's pretty amazing you can do
all of this over this single USB type-c
cable all the while your laptop is
charging off that same cable in addition
that has network it has audio and it has
a bunch of extra USB ports both the
existing type-a style and new type C
style so that you're really our future
proved we need your help Kickstarter
backers this is a big project there's a
lot of engineering that goes into it we
have a lot of work to do in refining the
prototypes that we have by backing this
project not only do you get one of the
earliest us being type C docking
stations and we think the best one that
you're going to see in the coming year
you actually help make that technology
happen and I know for a lot of people
right now that have purchased the Apple
MacBook which just has a single type-c
connector you know they're really
searching for that docking station that
will help them make the most of that
MacBook so we're excited to get this to
you we hope you'll be one of our first
backers and take advantage of
of the earlybird discounts that we have
and we look forward to working with you
over the next few months to deliver this
exciting pluggable ultimate USB type-c
docking station
you've got the hottest new computer but
now you can't plug in any of your stuff
your new MacBook shouldn't make the rest
of your hardware obsolete
and some things just can't be connected
via the cloud introducing hub plus
connect all your devices to the new
macbook hub plus is compact and durable
so you can take it with you charge up
your phone no matter where you are we
developed hub plus in palo alto and
designed it with our team in germany our
manufacturers are on standby and if you
back us today we'll be ready to deliver
on time + select Kickstarter backers

hub + ports power portability
okay you have a new 12-inch MacBook and
it's absolutely amazing
except that single little USB type-c
port is causing you all sorts of
frustration on the go
the MacBook is in its element wirelessly
handling anything you throw at it but at
some point it's time to sit down at a
desk or table and connect to actual
wires you know for things like displays
scanners disk drives printers flash
drives SD cards Ethernet audio and video
components and more our Hydra dock 13
port docking station makes all of that
completely seamless just put down your
MacBook and connect one plug everything
else is already sitting there wired and
ready you need to understand that the
whole USB world is in a massive
transition from the established 3.0
standard to a whole set of completely
new standards including 3.1 type-c ports
and cables a new power delivery standard
new device configuration standards video
alternate modes and more altogether it's
an astonishing step forward and Apple
was the first to put a completely
standards-compliant new USB product to
market with the new 12-inch MacBook we
started working in 2014
developing circuitry and establishing
supplier relationships for the rare
first generation chips when the MacBook
was announced the next spring we had the
circuitry ready
for a 13 port dock which we sampled
input on Kickstarter we had over 1200
backers on Kickstarter and backer kit
helped us push past all sorts of
challenges and get to the world's first
and only fully standards-compliant
multi port USB 3.1 type C dock those
backers finally began receiving hydro
docks from our January 1,500 unit pilot
production run
now you can get one from our next full
mass production run if you want to
proven solid future ready fully
compliant new USB dock for your MacBook
the Hydra dock is ready and can be in
your hand soon just place your pre-order
here and we'll add it into our total for
our next mass production run
there are many misrepresented products
out there right now with USB type-c
plugs on them but underneath inside
there just older USB 3 products with a
new plug that means they don't support
the new standards ours does and you can
see it working for yourself right here
right now do you deserve a great product
and we've put over a year into getting
it ready for you we thank you sincerely
for your support and backing of the
Hydra dock
