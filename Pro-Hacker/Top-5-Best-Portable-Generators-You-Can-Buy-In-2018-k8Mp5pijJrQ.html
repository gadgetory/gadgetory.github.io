smart clean mobile power it's a portable
lithium ion battery with the world's
most comprehensive array of charging
ports and one of the highest total
energy outputs of almost any storage
solution on the market it's designed for
everybody from outdoor activities and
indoor leisure to industrial
applications and emergency services
River releases you from the shackles of
an outlet so you can power a free life
the unit is equipped with 11 independent
charging ports which can all be used
simultaneously for a total output of 500
watts to put this in perspective that
means you get power to iPhones to iPads
to MacBooks
a mini-fridge a lantern a drone battery
a mobile Wi-Fi unit and stereo speakers
all at the same time without limiting
the output on any port with the storage
capacity of 416 watt hours rever gives
you more power than almost any battery
of its time you can jam on your electric
guitar for 20 hours straight
or you can watch a 10 hour marathon of
your favorite TV show by campfire
rivers battery can be recharged in three
different ways a standard outlet or a
car charger can replenish the battery to
full capacity in just eight hours with
eco flows portable solar panels River
can be recharged with absolutely zero
carbon emissions in just 12 hours the
real-time display allows you to monitor
the battery's current output power
remaining capacity and charge time being
a documentary filmmaker a lot of my
shoots happen outside a lot of times our
locations are way out in the middle of
nowhere first time I use River I was
really surprised at how much these
little units can accomplish on location
everything runs on batteries we have to
set up a DI T station a battery charging
station and we could even run our LEDs
when we need extra light and never have
to worry about the noise and the
pollution of a generator applications
for battery power are endless River
isn't just an accessory it's your power
companion for harnessing clean energy
anywhere so you're free to go everywhere
and by the way this isn't just a concept
river has been tried and tested and as
you can see this entire production has
been lit by River
look at that thing
sleek space-age 50 done high-tech the
heck is that hmm the evolution of
portable power okay
the Grendon is of interest to everyone
because everyone uses power my title is
the mad scientist and I'm being better
of the grameen okay you're right mad
scientist everyone does use power
well I create this thing generators are
actually enormous polluters the amount
of carbon monoxide that a generator puts
out in one hour is the equivalent of
thriving the Honda Civic from LA to
Atlanta hell hate to Atlanta that's
crazy
I had no idea they were that bad for the
environment and how does the Granton
compare compared with a drench in which
is zero emission obviously it's the best
bang for your buck it costs you nothing
when you charge with a solar panel the
real change factor I think was when
working with Brad our industrial
designer we came up with the stackable
interchangeable power system Brad is our
Lego master bedroom he does most of the
engineering and back-end of putting
those products together is that Brad the
nerd gotta have a nerd product design
and development has been yeah for my
skills and that's what I've been working
on both mechanical and the electrical
design the Gretchen is different from
other types of solar generators
currently on the market with our system
you simply swap batteries you can have
as many batteries as you like or you can
stack them that allows you to work
virtually indefinitely
some of the things you could use the
grunge in for our general uses like
camping construction sites and kind of
general power tools are often very good
use for these a big area is definitely
home backup you could do just about
anything you can think of because it can
go with you anywhere this is great so I
could boost my buddy's truck my friend
Ashley can use it to play music on the
corner and I can hold a popcorn filled
outdoor midnight horror show screening
for my friends nice how do I get one
we're launching an IndieGoGo campaign in
order to complete the production of our
Grinch and make a genuine impact on the
environment yeah it's just something
that's so much better than what's
already out there I'm excited to see
this keep going I'm excited to keep
developing and I see us making this
being the flagship of possibly many and
I've lost my new industry okay mad
scientist Connie top reasons for picking
up a grungy
go we all use power you need it it's
silent and it's admission free and when
you use a grunge in you're using
something that's not just good for you
it's good for the whole planet tada
indeed Brad any last coming right Brett
okay the world's first and only
emissions free silent solar generator
with a stackable interchangeable battery
system go engine the evolution
affordable power
it's a moment we all fear we're sitting
in our home and all of a sudden the
lights go out while a backup fossil
fuel-based generator is certainly an
option it's cumbersome loud and has
damaging effects on the environment
fortunately spark box has arrived to
help you take your first steps into the
future of eco portable energy it's a
mobile and powerful electric battery
with two AC and USB ports packing three
kilowatts of power able to keep all of
your devices and appliances ready and
running while staying charged for up to
six months of standby power it will
become a vital tool for small business
owners looking to power their operations
without relying on astronomically priced
energy sources
it can charge an electric car for up to
10 miles ensuring you'll never have to
worry about getting home safe
meanwhile families looking for a day out
can power both their small electronic
devices and more powerful appliances
like electric grill absorb sound systems
our simple app allows you to connect
through Bluetooth and keep updated on
your power supply with the push of a
button
join us on IndieGoGo and help us make
this standard for portable power
possible
if your outdoor activities require
electricity a portable generator is a
must
Generac sock you 2000 portable inverter
generator is perfect for tailgating
camping hunting or anytime you need to
power up your outdoor adventure inverter
generators use a different type of
alternator than standard portable
generators a digital inverter module
converts raw power produced by the
generator from DC to AC power best of
all the IQ 2000 varies its engine speed
based on electrical demand which
significantly reduces noise levels and
fuel consumption one of the main
considerations with any generator is
noise a loud generator can ruin your
party or a good night's sleep the IQ
2000 is quiet
in fact when tested in a third party lab
the IQ 2000 ran quater than its
competitors when you're out at the game
or at the campsite there's nothing worse
than running out of fuel when you least
expect it you don't have to worry about
that with this handy run time remaining
display which shows how long before you
need to refuel that's just one of the
helpful features on the IQ 2000 that you
won't find on any other portable
generator for starters this thing is
super easy to use the power dial could
start run and stop functions right at
your fingertips and the simple switch
lets you choose between turbo standard
or economy power modes choosing the
lower modes reduces noise and fuel
consumption status indicators alert you
to low fuel low oil overload or
overheating the exclusive power bar
monitors and instantly displays the
wattage you're producing at any given
moment
the generators mm starting watts is
enough to power all your tailgating or
campsite appliances of course there are
times when you need more power
fortunately the IQ 2000 is parallel
ready just make two IQ 2000 generators
using the optional parallel kit to get
almost twice the power
setting it up is as simple as plugging
in and appliance the IQ mm weighs in at
less than 50 pounds making it very easy
to carry wherever you need it portable
generators bring comfort and convenience
to your outdoor activities package
Interac IQ mm portable inverter
generator to power up your next
expedition
the devices we carry help us enjoy our
lives that little bit more our cameras
smartphones tablets and maybe even our
drones the speaker for the party the
headphones for the Train or even the
bubble machine for the park often we
have to compromise how we use our
gadgets we take less photos Russian
email or dim our screens all to save
power before our device dies nukes power
plant was created to stop exactly that
power plant is a portable wall outlet
that is with you all the time
it's splash proof lightweight and
durable design allows you to carry it
anywhere its power on-demand power plant
includes a universal power outlet that
lets you charge your technology with US
UK and European plugs you can also fast
charge multiple devices and recharge
your power plant in under two hours when
power plants internal battery runs out
the internal battery can be swapped out
and replaced with another this gives you
an endless supply of power for your tech
power plant has enough to charge a
typical smartphone over ten times a
tablet four times and a Macbook once it
will power anything up to 65 watts
including a 50-inch TV
power plant is ready never miss a moment
never run out of power again
