experience how many times a day do you
type in your password can be both easy
to remember and secure enough to protect
your computer well choose a short and
simple one and your online security can
be compromised
choose a long one and it's just not
convenient and we aren't talking just
one password here right how many do you
have one for your local account one for
the mail one for the Facebook don't you
just hate we need to memorize every
single one of them they may seem to be
necessary evil to ensure your privacy
but in reality all protection you need
isn't the tip of your finger fingerprint
identification is not a new technology
for years it has proven itself to be a
reliable method of securing valuable
things from military facilities to
smartphones but as of now in order to
use it you either need to buy an
expensive laptop with pre-installed
scanner or a separate skimming device
and all of them are just too big and
clunky they rely on old swipe technology
plus if you need to use your device you
have to plug in or connect USB cable and
then disconnect it and keep it
separately but here is another way I
present to you the I touch ID it's the
first fingerprint scanner that is secure
and efficient on the inside while being
small and compact on the outside yes I
touch ID the world's smallest USB
fingerprint scanner edge is 6
millimeters thin is easily the world's
slimmest scanner it is incredibly thin
you can plug it in and keep it plugged
in forever the body of the device is
made out of
single piece of aircraft aluminum with
hard anodized finish and laser-cut
sapphire glass when creating eye touch
ID our priorities were security
reliability is a usage compact size and
best quality materials all these are
parts of a new philosophy of using a
fingerprint scanner for computers I
touch ad has no buttons or cables you
just plug it in and start using scanning
of our fingerprints takes only half a
second and the fingerprint data is
stored inside the I touch ID security
core where it cannot be accessed by
anyone as I touch ID you'll be able to
access your computer's user account your
Facebook Twitter Instagram or any other
website online accounts that you
previously would lock onto the password
and all of it with just one touch you
can use much stronger and longer
password 12 or more symbols without any
problems just put your finger on the I
touch ID and you're in you don't need to
worry that people around you your
classmates colleagues business partners
buddies your wife or husband would see
your password your private photos videos
documents and any other information will
always be protected even from hackers
from North Korea the eye touch ID is
compatible with both Windows and Mac
operating systems everybody has a unique
identifier which gives you the new level
of security and ability to encrypt your
data or communication with two level
authentications with just a touch of
your finger high touch ID is made with
stand both digital and physical dangers
the devices impact scratch and
water-resistant so it will always
maintain its functionality and dialogue

kind but in order for it to become
reality we need your help by supporting
