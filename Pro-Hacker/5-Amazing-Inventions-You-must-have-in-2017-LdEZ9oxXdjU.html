sounds coming through yeah so funny well
Otto oh I just nobody music yeah oh wow

I
we
ah
with my girlfriend every day is an
adventure this one starts with a puppy
the pups out of the beach cell I power a
probe my new dash top computer Rev keeps
me connected but I can keep my hands on
the wheel and my eyes on the road I say
the address and it shows up on rob's
clear screen with real-time traffic data
and alerts Rove cuts way down on
arguments traffic ahead turn left and
take the bridge it's good having a
traffic guru on your side I get a text
from my buddy max wanna help me move I
don't text and drive so I hit him up
with an auto reply sorry dude robes are
personal DJ stringing loads of music
apps to keep us jamming it also has its
own 4G connection so it doesn't need to
be synced that's clutch when we need the
phone for something else ro finds us
some amazing typhoon my girlfriend takes
a selfie and our post get some love next
rope gets us to a place where we do a
little navigating of our own finally
time to meet the puppy needless to say
we believe in love at first sight the
perfect end to the perfect day all right
road to take us all
I was surfing I was only person out was
four thirty in the morning everything
was pretty dark on land because the way
the moon was shining but they said they
saw a light turn on and they saw me take
off drop down the way you know it was
like couple hundred feet away and
they'll just like who we said and what's
going on they could just see me going
through the barrel and down the line and
I had this amazing session I just on my
own to capture those moments and to be
able to share it with the world I
wouldn't be able to do it we had the
light a torch my name is Anthony Walsh
I'm a pro surfer go for athlete and
bodyguard ambassador we started working
with Anthony wall about two years ago we
set out to make the world's brightest
action sports LED light what would make
the perfect life its water / if it's
drop for it's a lot like a Swiss Army
knife that fits all my needs
there are a lot of lights out there on
the market and not all lights are
created equal we have 2200 lumen LEDs in
the single torch and for something that
fits in the palm of your hand that's a
lot of light
the electric torch fits exactly into one
of these GoPro cages having just a small
little lot that I can use with all these
different accessories that I already
have it's no brainer for me this light
is really the perfect companion to a
GoPro it was designed to keep up in
battery life and beam angle it's
waterproof up to 10 meters it's drop
proof it's dust proof in addition we
have two quarter twenty we have a magnet
we have a clip so there's a lot of
versatility built into our design and
accessories to go along with
I think it stimulates everyone's
imagination yeah you have a camera you
have a go for you have a iphone or
whatever you shoot with every person is
different everyone has their own
technique and their own style and
there's so many things you can do with
it's just being of a shot you can get it
you just have to think how you're going
to get it in fact this video shoot is
lit by three torches right now
the team at lycra has been designing
high-end LED lighting solutions for top
brands for the last six years we've
selected the best LEDs for the
brightness for the color temperature
with the right email and we've designed
it at a very affordable price I've made
it every day and I charge my phone i'm
charging my guitar and my torch cuz
they're the three most important things
i use every day so I've done all the
hard work we just need your help to get
it out there and in your head we've had
a lot of fun over the last few years
designing and testing this product and
we think it's ready come to market the
limited quantity we're offering the
light and accessories at cost so please
consider supporting us tell your friends
and family thanks for watching
every single day on this planet someone
is injured or killed by a landmine
removing them is very time-consuming and
dangerous millions of landmines
leathered landscape of the war-torn
countries around the world my name is
Massoud Hassani and I want to change
this our mission is to solve the
landmine problems within 10 years in
2012 we have launched our first
Kickstarter campaign it is called the
mine kafon a low-cost wind power and the
landmine detonator had rolls along on a
desert when it hits a landline it blows
itself up and storage the land mine at
the same time after three years of hard
work we brought our mission to the next
level
now we are very excited to introduce you
our newest robotic invention than mine
kafon drawn it is an airborne de-mining
system which aims to reduce landmines in
less than 10 years globally mine kafon
drone flies above a dangerous area it
generates a 3d map then it detects
landmines with a metal detector and GPS
coordinates the drone has a robotic arm
which places detonators on top of a
landmine and blows them up from a safe
distance these three methodologies
combined makes the main cap on drones up
to 20 times faster than the traditional
technologies at the saver and up to 200
times cheaper imagine if we could fly
with hundreds of mine kafon groans all
over the affected landscapes worldwide
and free the world from land mines now
it's our final goal to bring the
microphone drones to a pilot in order to
be able to test them on different
environments and weather conditions this
is needed to prove and show to the
demining organizations the demand on
drone is faster cheaper and safer than
the existing technologies with such a
deceptive approach we could save
thousands of lives
we need your support to make this happen
please join our campaign and let's have
a landmine free world because one less
land mine means one safe life you're
looking forward to collaborate with you
on this project
