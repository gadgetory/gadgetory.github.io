ring light and a gravity gimbal in one
what does that mean
just mount your camera in the center and
gravity will keep the camera level with
the horizon no matter what's going on
outside you can finally focus on the
world around you and let hoop do the
rest and when it gets dark poops
powerful ring light lets you keep
shooting hoop comes in two sizes Pro is
for larger cameras and mini is perfect
for your smartphone or GoPro hoop mini
and pivot on two axes and can switch
directions easily making it the perfect
tool to capture your daily exploring you
can even use it to create perfectly
level panoramas hoop pro is strong
enough to hold any DSLR or two cameras
at once for 3d and 360-degree video it
also features adjustable color
temperature both versions of who will
last for 90 minutes at full brightness
even though they're lighter than the
cameras you'll use them with even when
the action gets hectic hoop lets you
focus on what you're capturing not the
camera you're holding but you don't have
to stop using hoop for stationary shots
just mount it on your tripod for an
awesome light source two years ago
Kickstarter helped bring our first
product goal apps to hundreds of backers
around the world the many lessons we
learned during that campaign will help
us make hoop even more successful but we
aren't here just to sell a product
we know that the feedback we'll get from
all of you will be what makes hoop
something special I hope you like hoop
and will join us on this adventure by
backing our campaign
my life is just
always mysterious and surprising
around the next corner
around the next more
so keep enjoying what you know anytime
anywhere
