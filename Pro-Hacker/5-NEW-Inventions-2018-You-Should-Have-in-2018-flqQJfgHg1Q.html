of this the security camera for your
home makes sense which got us thinking
would it be nice if we could take that
idea and hit the road that's how we came
to build the first security camera for
the car we call it al
owl has a forward-facing camera and an
inside facing camera owls cameras are
always on an owl is connected to its
cloud service 24/7 by a fast reliable 4G
internet connection just like your phone
which means you can check on your car
with live video streaming anywhere
anytime an owl sensors let you know
immediately if something happens to your
car and sends you an alert with an
instant video clip report and here are a
few other cool things about owl owl is
always on even when your car's off
it's very presence and it's pulsing
security beacon keeps away the lurkers
and the sticky-fingered and since owl is
always recording the cameras will be
rolling even during traffic stops owl
protects you from contentious crashes
because the camera never lies
unlike that guy that were in the
intersection and since whatever does
happen is recorded you can go back and
check it out later whether it's the
weird the wonderful or the outrageous it
all happens all around us when we're
driving an owl captures it all when you
see something you want to share just say
okay presto an owl will send the clip
right to your phone owl sets up in about
five minutes with just a few simple
steps and all video is protected so no
one except you can get to your video
unless you choose to share it so that's
al the world's first security camera for
the car now get out there and see what
you'll catch on
owl
you
how protected is your home from burglars
and thieves do you have the world's
strongest door or the best security
system even if you do it won't matter to
someone that wants to gain access to
personal information record audio and
video of your family and even unlock
your doors how by accessing any
connected device that isn't secure such
as tablets baby monitors webcams and
smart TVs to name a few
without the right protection everything

Portage's is armed with a cloud-based
artificial intelligence security
platform so if your 4-digit senses an
attack or notices some odd traffic it

Portage's uses the cloud to tell all of
the other footages devices on the planet
to be aware of messages coming from a
certain IP and domain address or for
traffic containing a particular threat
basically if hackers attack one footages
every four to just get smarter no need
to worry about downloading an update or
