not they locked their door they end up
wasting precious time to return home and
check the door or risking potential
burglary meet sure key it's the world's
first add-on for your keys that gives
you the peace of mind that your house is
safe with sure key you don't need to go
back and check the door you just need to
look at the sure key to get to know if
your door is locked
it's easy affordable and much safer than
smart locks
Shirky notifies you if the key is left
in the lock whether it's on the inside
or the outside of the door are you sure
you lock the door with jerky you are the
modern world is dealing with a very new
and universal problem our kids are
hooked on smartphones and tablets and
when parents try to manage screen time
it can cause major conflict in the home
how can we encourage our kids to
disconnect from their devices and
connect more with their family their
friends and the real world
the answer is Tecton we have created the
first ever product that combines an app
the parents use to manage screen time
with a physical home for our kids
devices that also serves as a secure
charging station it's a home to
healthier screen habits and we call it
the den within the app parents can set
up schedules for their kids screen time
when the time's up the child puts their
phone or tablet back in the den where it
is charged stored and locked away by
setting up predictable schedules on the
app kids can anticipate when they next
allowed on their devices and for how
long
well before they have to return the
device to the den the child will get
regular notifications on their device of
how much time they have left when the
device informs the kids that their time
is up that parent-child conflict is
reduced dramatically when a device is
out of sight is out of mind when a phone
or tablet is put away inside the den it
can no longer serve as a visual cue that
can trigger the desire to use it
together parents and children can set
goals and rewards for on-time returns
it's another way that the child feels a
part of the process and at the same time
develops habits for healthy device use
only by combining an app and a physical
home for devices can we as parents feel
that we have a complete solution
the managing devices in Alpine

cannot wait for you to have one in your
own home back us today on Kickstarter as
