hi I'm theis Freud designer and this is
lead away book work together we came up
with the perfect product for reading in
bed Lily light is a bookshelf reading
light and bookmark combines into one
smart product
it works like this when you pull your
book from the peak a sensor
automatically turns the lamp on Lily
light illuminates your book from perfect
angle when you finish reading and put
the book back on the peak it doubles as
a bookmark the sensor now automatically
switches off the light again as an
established product designer with more
than ten years of experience I have
developed dozens of products in the past
over the years I've mastered production
techniques in order to produce the
highest quality products on the market
the Shelf itself is made of a single
piece of steamed pressed plywood
finished with a beautiful American oak
veneer the plywood is precisely cut and
the lamp cap is injection molded to
ensure everything fits perfectly and
lasts for years to come
Lily Lodge uses energy-efficient LED
bulbs that can be easily interchanged
the Lily light sensor automatically
turns on or off by detecting when a book
is placed on the peak if you want to use
the lamp when you are not reading a book
there's also a manual switch in the
cable - Lily lights can be hung
symmetrically above a double bed you
won't need a left and right version you
can orient it as you wish when attaching
it to the wall the Lily light is not a
prototype or concept anymore it has been
thoroughly tested and is ready to be
shipped
we need your help in order to scale
production with your support we can
deliver Lainey like this fault so
everyone can have this top shelf
