to explore remote destinations climb new
heights make new friends and experience
epic festivals but there's always been a
catch after sunrise tents are often too
hot or too bright so many of us don't
get enough sleep now imagine the
possibilities if we had all the rest we
needed we'd have more energy to explore
further be more adventurous and have
even more fun that's why we created the
siesta for a revolutionary new tent
engineered from the ground up to give
you the best possible sleep outdoors
even in blazing sunshine when the Sun
comes up our game-changing ultra
reflective fly fabric blocks infrared
visible and ultraviolet light
dramatically reducing the temperature
and brightness inside the tent
for extra comfort you can add our
ultra-quiet
8 inch USB fans that zip right into the
custom vents drawing in fresh air from
outside the full-length fly provides
maximum protection from wind and rain
while the breathable inner tent prevents
condensation and closable mesh keeps out
dirt and cold drafts this gives you
incredible all-weather versatility
inspired by the cold nights and
sweltering early mornings when camping
in the Australian outback we set out to
solve the problem of bright overheating
tents once and for all
and so the siesta was born we spent the
past year designing developing and
testing from fabrics to fans every
aspect of the tent has been meticulously
thought-out to ensure the highest
possible standards we've selected only
premium quality materials and partnered
with one of the world's leading tent
manufacturers now with the prototypes
finished we're ready to launch but we
need your help to meet the factory
minimums so if you like what you've seen
please tell your friends and if you'd
like a seriously badass tent just back
our project
have you ever thought about how much
energy lies around you in a forest in
the woods and all the waste you can find
did you ever wish you could use that
energy instead of carrying uncomfortable
gas tanks or find ignited bonfire
there's definitely charming but there's
also smoky and dangerous
now you can stop dreaming about it
because we made it real Anke still wild
is a revolutionary campstove which could
run with any kind of dry biomass all you
need is some branches small battery or
even a solar panel what makes all the
magic possible is a well known
technology named pyrolysis but unlike
traditional pyrolytic stoves we found a
way to make the process simple stable
smoke-free and totally awesome take a
traditional fire it burns strongly but
it wastes a lot of energy and smoke
while smoke itself has a lot of energy
what we do is transform all the biomass
into energy this way you get a clean and
reliable flame wherever you want and for
free yes free energy I'm talking about a
powerful and professional flame you can
use to cook for real and grill as a pro
do you know which is the best part of
all this
using your stove you're not only saving
the environment all the waste produced
by the gas tanks or the production of
charcoal you're also avoiding the
production of any pollution responsible
for the greenhouse effect the wait
there's more but remains inside your
stove when the fire is gone is a
wonderful biochar an incredible active
charcoal that makes the ground better
and more fertile we designed our stove
to be the best companion that our
outdoor adventure it is minimal it is
compact and all the design features are
strictly linked to its operation we made
it in two sizes to let you choose
between portability and personal use or
base camp and a lot of power everything
is made in Italy using the best
materials to create a product that is
really gonna last forever
Anke stove wild has been made to let you
live their adventures with a deeper
contact with nature environment is our
greatest treasure and taken care of it
is no longer a privilege but important
duty with Anki stole wild you can do
your part in saving our planet by taking
no compromises
new technology is making life easier in
many ways but it hasn't really been
applied to outdoor and camping equipment
until now this is the world's first
outdoor smart lantern from o2 tech first
I hope you agree that it looks great
your granddad may have taken you camping
but your equipment doesn't have to look
like his the lantern can be adjusted
here but it can also be controlled by a
Bluetooth app on your phone at the end
of a long day outdoors you don't have to
keep getting up and down to adjust the
lanterns brightness you can do so from
wherever you're seated you can adjust it
to a range of 16 million colors to suit
your mood or later you can even turn it
off remotely without getting out of your
tent or sleeping bag that's great when
the weather is freezing or you have
something else to do have you ever been
hiking and had trouble finding your tent
now it's easy just set your life to
flesh but at otech we have gone much
further the lantern comes with built-in
weather sensors temperature humidity
barometric pressure it will even give
you weather alerts our smart Lantern
comes in two sizes the 200 lumen and the
powerful 400 lumen that illuminates to a
range of nearly 10 paces at full power
it will last eight nights at low power
30 nights the lantern is strong durable
and lightweight it is water resistant so
no worries with spray on a boat with
full batteries even the 400 L is just
over three pounds or 1.6 kilograms it
also has a built in tripod for uneven
surfaces and the handle it won't break
it uses rechargeable batteries or four D
cell batteries you can even use it to
charge your mobile phone or other
devices because it has a built-in USB
port Oh to tech is developing a number
