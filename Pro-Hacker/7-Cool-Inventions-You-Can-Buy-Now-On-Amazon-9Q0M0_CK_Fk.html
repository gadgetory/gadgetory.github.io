looking for something right we've been
able to continue innovating and created
something new and exciting
introducing the awarded marito smart UV
for your phone the smart UV camera lets
you see into the UV light spectrum and
reveals amazing discoveries people all
over the world are reacting to this
incredible innovation from total shock
and excitement to being in awe or even a
little grossed out the smart UV captures
what lies beneath the skin so you can
see what it really looks like we've all
heard numerous times how important skin
care is but until it becomes real for
each of us we rarely do anything about
it if you could see your own skin and UV
light maybe you'd start making better
decisions for us this is what we call
seeing smart so we can be smart so how
does seeing smart actually work there's
more to life than what the human eye can
see when you look at the light spectrum
you see the visible light measures from
about 400 to 700 nanometer in wavelength
we call this visible light because this
is the only light humans can see UV
lights it's next to it in the spectrum
between 200 and 400 nanometers invisible
to humans but interestingly cats can see
from the 300 nanometer
and up which means they have UV vision
when observing your skin visible light
bounces off the outer layer which is
what we see every day but because UV
light has a smaller wavelength it passes
through the outer layer and only bounces
off the second denser layer showing us
what lies beneath that's what makes a
smart UV so great it not only lets you
see in UV but also lets you take a UV
selfie the first of its kind in the
world now we're going to look at how
smart this device really is it fits in
your pocket connect via a reversible USB
connector has a photo and video camera
works by an app is iOS and Android
compatible and has the same lens
technology as professional UV cameras
we've made it really easy to use you
download the app on your smartphone and
attach the device to your phone check
that you have natural light or UV light
source then take a picture or video and
be amazed at what's been right in front
of your eyes this entire time what makes
us different than other UV cameras it
works with your smart phone giving you
access to a bigger screen it's much more
affordable than professional equipment
the camera orientation allows you to see
yourself you don't have to charge it
ever it makes your smart phone even
smarter and it uses your phone sharing
capabilities letting you share in real
time
being smart to be smart with smart UV
will help you keep track of your skin
like a skin diary so you can be aware of
your skin's aging process it also helps
you take proactive measures to prevent
further skin damage and it helps you
find uncovered spots when applying
sunscreen while we're talking sunscreen
did you know that high UVA Factor
sunscreen and UV coated glasses block UV
light completely the result is that it
looks black when seen with a smart UV
how fascinating is that and now for the
best news we've already made and tested
our prototypes and the results have
blown us away in fact all the UV footage
in this video was shot with an actual
smart UV prototype we've gathered people
to reactions from all over the world and
now we want to make it accessible to
everyone that's where you come in we
need your help
your pledge will help pay the
manufacturing costs needed to
mass-produce and get the smart UV in the
hands of as many people as possible
we've completed the 3d designs of the
final production version doesn't it look
incredible and we've even added a robust
phone connector to the slick design now
if you're excited about what the smart
UV can show you about your skin just
imagine what it can reveal about the
rest of the world more about that in our
stretch goals pledge now and help the
world see in UV

what we want to do is bring the physical
experience of music the energy the
impact that you get at a concert or club
into the real world where you can have
it everywhere and anytime you want bass
is really the part of the music that
connects you to the music physically in
a club you get that big energy from a
big sound system if you put on the music
the next day and you just have
headphones on you're just missing that
part whatever music you're listening to
it adds a physical element to it which
is something that you're totally missing
normally in a home listening or
on-the-go environment people are pushing
the envelope of what they can get out of
those Sloot's systems
what's the way that they make this music
when we put put the based on someone's
arm and we turn on the music and soon as
the beat kicks in they have to speak
smile in their face because it really
pulls you into the music you listen to
it but you can also feel it in your body
oddly no it's just so intense this song
is going like more and more aggressive
sort of on the bed and you wouldn't
think that you know the same pace and
you know the same intensity that the
bass that would be able to match it but
it is it's pretty rare so I really feel
the kick drum which is nice and then
like in the sustain bass notes coalition
I think that's really the power of it is
the ability to get that you know tactile
physical immersion that you get with
like sub bass and yet in the end it was
just fun I didn't want to take it off
you know the baselet has very high
fidelity it matches exactly the wave
form of the bass
for us the main challenge was no
technology existed that could do this in
this such a small size so we had to
create our own differentiate between
this and the Nordic baseline and hard
kicks so even if the music is a melody
and a kick in between you can feel the
difference the drums you can actually
kind of feel like toms and Carrick and
stuff I felt bit more like us on the run
with it inside the baselet is amazing
technology we've built our own haptic
engine which takes up roughly half the
space we've got the other half which is
battery to give a really long play time
and we've managed to squeeze the oil
joints around the battery and I have two
genji so there's hardly any room for the
electronics and it was a tough job to
get it into this size the base is really
designed as an everyday companion you
can hook it up to a smartphone to a
computer you can hook it up to a laptop
or VR headset you can really use it with
anything that you would use for for
listening to music or playing games or
watching movies the basics designed to
be really easy to use you just plug and
play basically there's no app to load
there's no software to configure ideally
in the morning you leave the house you
put it on you put on your headphones
when you commute to war when you add for
whenever you want to listen to music out
and about I think that's when the beta
comes in this actually has a really
powerful energizing impact on you and I
think it's going to be great when you're
out about jogging or doing sports that
it really elevates you can activate you
and keeps you going
one of the cool things about the basis
is that it hooks up to anything that has
a headphone out of it and so what I
tried right away is hooking up to a
synthesizer and you play a bass line and
suddenly you have that physical impact
on bass you can feel the beat of the
music you're creating and if you're a DJ
you can also use the bass that to get a
sense of how the music will feel on a
big sound system in a club as well as
for music lovers I'm really making the
basic for myself I want to use it every
day and we're already at this stage and
I'm really really happy with that music
is certainly
the most important content in people's
lives so whatever chance I have to make
that experience better I'm going to
going to use it when you jump in it I
wouldn't take it off to be honest if you
look around buttons are everywhere
steering color shape size style and in
many other ways there's one thing in
common to make the more you push what if
you can push them without physically
being where they are what if you can
make them work automatically on their
own micro ball push Italia Wireless the
robotic finger that could push any
buttons I can push this with your
smartphone which is very easy to install
in use star succession on a surface
where the button you want to push it
okay they pair with this companion help
corner box and user smartphone to push
it from anywhere anytime even from
outside no wires no tools required with
push you can control your light switches
turn on your home computer for more
playing music
start making coffee electric bang and
many other things it's only limited by
your imagination push is simple yet very
sophisticated we design the gears and
PCB from the ground up to the lowest
possible part of something and the
maximum torque to push most of the
ordinary but in fact you don't even need
a smartphone users it just works
total box is between four microphones
and it's what automates some other
filtration services using its
groundbreaking you do this
all you need to do is turtle note that
describes how you want to automate your
micro the autocomplete feature will also
jumping like moves the total box you can
start making coffee when you leave done
if things on your desk ready when you
enter your office and on lights with the
Sun Goes Down and a lot more all
automatically got your smartphone
