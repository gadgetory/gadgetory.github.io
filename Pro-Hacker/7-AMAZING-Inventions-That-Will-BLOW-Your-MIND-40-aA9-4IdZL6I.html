arrives right before our eyes
moments when our idea of what is
considered modern and stylish even
alright the ends of what is possible in
terms of performance and technology are
completely transformed it is an ease
moment there's a world as we know it is
forever change
this could very well be one of those
times today we introduce you the future
of modern speakers the callee of sound
our cutting-edge Bluetooth speaker takes
the form of a futuristic polygon or
humanoid for the last two years we've
been working through every conceivable
detail for the most qualified experts in
design and sound engineering it was our
mission to create a true representative
of the hype of modern technology
integrated into what is no doubt a
show-stopping speaker but the striking
design of this piece is just the
prologue of the story you'll be blown
away of what's inside sound Hiro is
packed with next-generation features
such as
and wireless charging dock charging
adaptors for those who haven't yet made
the leap to wireless a Wi-Fi range
extender right a battery life MLS of
eight hours when all the features are
being used 48 hours on standby
top quality tweeters and subwoofers for
crystal-clear highs and a-growling low
range 10 color option in either Mac or
metallic two sizes suitable for any kind
of setup pair multiple sound heroes as
home cinema or desktop speakers remote
controlled ambient light branded often
slow dispenser kalium sound hero can
mesmerize the entire room as its angular
features reflect over 16 million colors
emitted by the RGB LED light and it's
not
so back our project today and take a
trip into the future of Cali and sound

minute power nap in the middle of a busy

on a lazy Sunday morning and have
breakfast in bed with the one you love
Manta sleep mask will be there for you
I really want people to understand how
profound this is okay this is not just
another device that is going to count
something for you
this is life-changing and it's already
been life-changing for thousands of
people my patients needed solutions
outside of the office to reduce their
stress response and what it came down to
is when people's nervous systems are in
fight-or-flight nobody's at their best
fight-or-flight kills all of our
rational thinking it inflames our body
it creates 90% of chronic health
problems and I think we need a solution
that's simple effective and that anybody
can use so that everybody can be their
best touchpoints our neuroscience
wearables that decrease stress levels
and as little as 30 seconds the devices
used gentle vibration on either side of
the body to help you calm down focus
optimize your performance and even sleep
better touch points come in a set to be
worn on either side of the body and can
be purchased at any one of four colorful
options they can be worn as wearables on
your wrist clip to clothing hidden in
pockets or socks are held in each hand
making them useful at any time of day
just 30 seconds of using touch points
can reduce stress by up to 71% we're
currently using the touch point in the
preoperative evaluation so when a
patient comes in for surgery that day we
ask them to raise their level of anxiety
about having surgery and if it's at a
level of 5 or greater we give them the
touch points to hold during their pre-op
evaluation of like their history and
physical process of getting their IV
started has been phenomenal we've had
really great success and the patients
are loving them and want to buy them to
use at home I purchase touch points you
know because I have a child in the
autism spectrum last year we went
through a very tough time where she
would even get out of the car for her
favorite activity so I saw the touch
points and I decided to try it it was
very easy to use our third day with
touch points she just ended up coming
out of the car and we were back to our
routine
so that was an amazing experience for us
I'm in grade five at San Tan charter
school in their gifted program I use
them right before tests and sometimes in
class oh they they help me a lot with
anxiety and I just hope you relax a lot
my name is Justin white I work for
Arizona industries for the blind as the
touch point solution Account Manager my
specific responsibilities are I make
sure that order stayed out on time I
also handle billing and then any other
customer service inquiries seventy
percent of people who are visually
impaired or blind are unemployed I've
been visually impaired all of my life
touch point Solutions has been wonderful
about choosing us as a partner to help
bridge the gap so we have pre-existing
scientific research then we have
something called archival clinical data
where I have years of clinical data then
we have the neuroscience
electroencephalogram data which shows a
reduction in the high frequency waves
that are associated with anxiety in less
than 30 seconds now that we know this
works and we've got user data that
confirms all of my prior scientific
findings
we're listening to our customers and
they're really asking us for a simpler
solution that's more affordable you know
when you change one hit from going into
fight or flight every day in the
classroom you're affecting that whole
classroom and when you're affecting all
those classrooms you're affecting the
whole school and when you're affecting
entire schools you're affected
entire community and it just goes on
from there
