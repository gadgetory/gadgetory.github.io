what matters
according to a recent estimate 85
million people in the United States
alone are involved in jobs that
primarily involves sitting this couldn't
be good for your health could it have
always been a health freak the sitting
disease first hit me when I started
working at a large corporation where I
fat most of my day I spoke to a number
of people and realized it wasn't just me
this is why it's not surprising that
Wired magazine cause fitting the new
smoking and you're probably doing it
right now and that's why we built QB QB
is the world's first under desk
elliptical device designed specifically
for your workplace it's sleek modern and
sexy making it a true delight to use and
stink over the last 12 months we need
multiple iterations to ensure the
perfect look feel and posture this
ensures that your QB lets you get some
basic exercise without any distractions
from regular water the right alignment
ensures that your need to not hit the
desk there are many fitness trackers out
there but we wanted to make something a
little different we wanted to create an
actual source of exercise QB comes with
bluetooth which wirelessly connect with
their mobile app and this lets you keep
track of your progress and share it with
friends and family on social networks
and you're already using a fitness
tracker the app connects with those as
well so all you need is one there were
concerns about sweating and getting
distracted while using cubies so we did
a beta test and got very positive
results I used to get restless at work
sitting for long periods of time to my
desk just working on my computer but
actually the QB smooth motion actually
gave me something to do and concentrate
on which allows me to concentrate on my
work and improve my productivity to
spend less time sitting even are now
switching to solution
the treadmill desks and standing desk
well they tend to be very expensive
costing anywhere between a thousand two
sometimes even four thousand dollars and
secondly the requires complete change in
your office furniture and you might not
have the space to do that I love how the
QB is so compact it fits right under my
jaw and the best part is that it's
affordable I could purchase it myself
without needing any approval from my
manager or HR QB also comes with an
adjustable resistance allow you to
easily stick and exercise intensity of
your choice based on my prior experience
and my degree in kinesiology I find that
a product like the QB would be an
excellent solution for a very large
population of people approximate the QB
would be ideal for individuals working
in an office setting we want to be able
to burn a few extra calories as well as
stimulates their entire metabolism while
it works as well as complet as we do not
realize but advances in technology
actually promote an inactive lifestyle
we really have to get off our seats for
anything anymore human beings did not
evolve to sit for prolonged periods of
time with QB we hope to make sitting
healthier even if you go to the gym
every day for an hour it's not enough if
you're sitting for more than six to
eight hours you need to stay active in
order to stay healthy Jimmy sleek design
make Fitness fashionable it not only
makes your workstation feel more alive
energetic but also more model and state
of the art usually cannot help but fall
in love again we've been working on QB
for the past 12 months and we are proud
to say that we finally have a prototype
ready now all we need is your help to
redefine fitting you may not always have
time to exercise but you will always
have time to sit and be fit
