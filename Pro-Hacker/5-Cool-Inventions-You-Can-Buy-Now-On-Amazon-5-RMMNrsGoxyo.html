bonds to almost any other material
overnight it turns into a strong durable
rubber one of our customers describes it
best when they said super glue and
play-doh had a lovechild than this would
be it it soft enough to mold into any
shape yet durable enough to fix almost
anything I invented it to make fixing
and making easy for everyone over the
last few generations we've grown out of
the habit of fixing stuff and has
aspired too much waste in this world
what if we could have a more thoughtful
relationship with the stuff we own and
their environment so buying new things
all the time whether we fixed improve
and reimagine that we already have the
works better through I grew up on a farm
another client fixing is a way of life
when something breaks you don't go to
the shop you get the well direct
I thought everyone left like this when I
realized it if I wanted to do something
of it I decided to go to school in
London to become a product designer I
was so excited about it but a few weeks
in it wasn't what I'd imagined designing
more new things for the world just
didn't seem like the right thing to do I
felt totally lost one day I did a random
experiment mixing silicone polymers with
sort of hot lead and dick look like wood
but it's been like a ping pong ball back
to me was magic I really wanted to
finance with this curious thing could be
but I just couldn't figure out what it
was for until one night my boyfriend
James said I said follow me to the
kitchen look a what is doing you've been
using your leftover Imperium 6 model is
normal for everyone the six and
redesigned it stuff like this I was like
wow that's an amazing idea that's when
my mind went wild
I started to imagine the countless
things that people could do with it so I
could make this work it could be so
useful for millions of people so it
seemed up with some amazing scientists
who helped me get started I had a lot to
learn and I needed to get hands-on again
this time can allow we had to learn
about silicone polymer chains designing
a cross linking process that could be
catalyzed simply by exposure to air how
to make something that could be a
pleasure to mold in your hands it bombed
like crazy almost any other surface and
then we have cigarette
could be industrially robot and produce
two packs of scale thousands of
experiments and engineering errors later
we have made the world to versatile glue
this material is absolutely amazing
because of what you do really is the
world's most versatile tools services
that allows you to see anything to
anything you can mold it into any shape
to fill those weird gaps between things
creating a strong secure bond method all
got some pretty cool property to its
strong but flexible cold and heat
resistant sticky yet removable
waterproof and UV resistant good for
indoors and a grippy and even shock
absorbing just stick it shape it and in
24 hours - turns into a strong flexible
rubber and can make your cables last
longer we can make handy hooks to hang
anything anyway fix broken plastic and
even fix my favorite drinks mug it helps
keep your feet warm and dry it's
waterproof he's in cold resistance but
you can easily fix a broken field until
washing machine
sugar is super durable to perfectly use
indoors and as people log servers
because fixing things just make sense
feels great the customizing PlayStation
controller or like Stefan who
transformed an old digital camera into a
kick-ass kiss-cam or like Zoe who's
given a new foot made with sudras these
ideas come from people all over the
world we're using suru to make their
stuff last longer works better for them
they've grown into a community it just
people who love to share their ideas and
stories help inspire the world to get
fixing again sue grew the world's most
versatile glue come on over to see recom
join in and get excited we depend on our
smartphones more and more everyday to
conduct business to connect and share to
listen to our favorite music and to
watch our favorite videos so how come we
never seem to have a charging cable when
we need one maybe it's because our
phones are portable but are long and

Able's or not well now there's a new
class of charging cable introducing
lifelink by plus the world's thinnest
ultra portable cable finally charging

airport or hotel room on your laptop or
gaming console in your car on the back
of your TV your life link will always be
there to keep you charged and connected
incredibly life link is the same length
as a credit card and as soon as just two
cards stacked together but when opened
life link extends to more than double
its length so you can still access and
use your device while it's charging or

engineered with durable teflon
