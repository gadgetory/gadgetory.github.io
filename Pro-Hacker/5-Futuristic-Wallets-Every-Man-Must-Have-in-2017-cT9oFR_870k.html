we set out to create the sexiest easiest
use minimalist wallet in the whole world
and I think we've done just that but
it's time to find out for yourself
we don't like that the wallets do we
care so we don't matter so we made that
the Micra wallet was conceived as a
joint appreciation of minimalist design
was read through frustrated with
traditional leather wallets and we
lasted several months instead of several
years as designers we knew we could do
better we set ourselves a pretty
challenging brief to design a minimalist
wallet it was not only aesthetically
beautiful but functionally superior to
anything else on the market our years of
industry experience enabled us to
quickly evaluate our designers taking
them from initial concept to distorting
manufacturing partners mass production
our use of PVD coating with rival most
high-end watches this provides an
extremely high scratch resistant finish
we had concerns about our product
strength so we decided to test it
ready kick
we fitted our wallet with a low-friction
TPU strap this prevents it from sticking
to your clothes
holding audio cards securely you no
longer have to remove them to make a
payment one of our proudest achievements
is full functionality of a regular
wallet without the bulk believe it or
not we've even managed to find space for
your change we've sought the suppliers
we've manufactured our prototypes
we've tested them to their limits and
this is where we need your help
the Kickstarter community to help fund
this campaign and make this first
production run at the micro wallet
thank you for watching thank you
everyone is talking about smart wallets
and which one holds the best future but
there's adding a tracker chip to the old
traditional wallet really make it smart

throw the tracker chip out what about
solving the basic problem ensuring that
only you and your loved ones can access
your wallet introducing kashew smart
wallet the world's first smart wallet

you and your loved ones can access your
wallet and with Bluetooth connectivity

safety of your contents
