it takes strength patience and even a
little imagination to get the perfect
shot and not all shots are perfect
what's even worse the sophisticated
operations and cameras can confuse even
the most seasoned photographers
introducing case air chase air is the
smallest Wi-Fi DSLR remote controller
when you connect your phone to the case
air you can adjust the parameter of the
camera with the app and the distance so
you no longer get anxious with your
cameras complex functions using case air
photos can be taken nice and easily
all you have to do is just set up and
wait the case air also works great with
a robotic camera mount and tripod and
experience the Handy accuracy through
the app
once you are done the photos will be
automatically downloaded to the app
using the Wi-Fi connection case there is
not just for photography using the case
robotic camera mount you can remote
control the movement to the camera
during the video recording with a touch
of a button and share your photos
instantly the case air is small as a
size of a key size is 2.4 inch by one
point six inch by point four inch only
50 grams is convenient and portable you
can mount it anywhere you like
que ser is equipped with a six hour work
time and nine hours standby time it is
compatible with three camera USB
interfaces and supports for operation
systems who years ago we launched the
teacher in Ottawa on India go go with
the potowa backers we improve the
software architecture and added a video
control and photo transfer functions
then spend as a software from iOS and
Android for Windows and Mac now the
software has been updated to version 2.3
and has more than 20,000 users our
product received lots of feedback from
case community based on that we started
to challenge the limitation of
electrical and mechanical design we
decrease the size by 70% improve the
structure and the makings are more
reliable for the first generation the
Wi-Fi signal will not activate so we
took a six month to optimize the antenna
although we made the four samples and
fill the fourth hand finally we made it
at the fifth time now the new product
life and the work excellent so we named
it Keith yeah but his air is a complete
and ready for mass production
it is designed by taste community and
develop the best hearing tech without
the support of our unit it will never
been completed so join this wonderful
community help us to develop innovative
products my name is Roy I'm a
photographer and I love my gear
I love the scratches bruises and stories
my gear carries
I love knowing how many clicks I need
from each lens for the perfect exposure
my gear is irreplaceable that's why I
created deer I see I had a nightmare
shoot where I didn't take my macro lens
and ended up losing a memory card full
of great pictures I'll never capture
again that's when I realized there had
to be a better way to manage my gear I
partnered up with Yulia she's a super
smart engineer together we create a DRI
your gears commander and cheese your
eyes a small device that stays in your
bag uses RFID to scan your badge from
inside and make sure all your gears
there your eyes tells you if all your
gears with you and it's not what's
missing okay something is missing here I
helps you locate it and it's not just
about what's missing it's also about
tacking light and only taking what you
really need and the gear I app you can
create lists where the equipment you
need for different types of shooting day
and year I will also tell you if there's
something in your bag you won't be using
today it shows to use RFID stickers and
tags because there's no need to charge
them and they last for years they're
also super affordable and come in many
shapes and sizes
so you can tag all of your gear all of
it we've created gear I for
photographers but it's really for anyone
who cares about their equipment from
sound engineers to makeup
and even travelers reparent gear is the
solution for any worried mind pack light
keep track of your gear don't spend
money on we buying it and don't worry
that's what key arise about so if you
care for your gear as much as we do help
us fund Iraq let's take care of our gear
as much as our gear takes care of ein
gear I
you
hi Kickstarter's my name is Ivan from
custom s alarm now I'm really excited to
introduce our next project we call it
the pro dot a tactile shutter release
button for cameras the product instantly
enhances the most critical engagement
point in your camera the shutter button
as it turns out camera shutter buttons
often require your finger to fully
depress to capture a shot this often
results in delay or necessary vibrations
leading from this shot the pro dodging
Hans's your shooting experience and puts
their fingers in that instant engagement
so you can capture better photos is
built with a vibration free material
reduces shaping and improves comfort
originally designed for cameras we also
found more useless from Pro dot
Kickstarter's we need your help to get
this project going
they explore new applications from the
tro god thank you through your support
to have a great day
a wide-angle lens is a basic very
important part for every photographers
bag there are a lot of wide-angle lenses
in the market but most of them are
suffering from either dramatic barrel
distortion or corner sharpness or a too
bulky to carry over the last two years
Venus optics has launched a number of
lenses meet the unique needs program
today we are launching the low wire 12
millimeter at 2.8 an incredible ultra
wide-angle lens with close to zero
distortion we have spent a lot of time
to design and develop a rectilinear lens
which can overcome the weaknesses of
existing wide-angle lenses on the market
we also need a lens to be fast and wide
enough for all types of photography from
landscape architecture interior
to travel and astrophotography
the low wire 12 millimeter at 2.8 gives
you an extreme 122 degrees angle of view
allowing you to compose an impressive
landscape photo within it also allows
you to capture the beauty of
architecture which close to zero
distortion even if you are shooting a
small house it will still look spacious
and impactful in your photos
keeping barrel distortion add some
images from ultra wide-angle lenses
challenging the ultra wines in the
market can suffer from two to five
percent distortion the wider the lens
the higher chance of distortion our
design team took on the challenge and
came up with an optical design which can
successfully minimize the distortion to
an extremely low level you'll struggle
to see any straight lines which have
been distorted and what about the sides
Keebler amazed at how small and light
our low wire language went repairs other
ultra wise and fast lenses on the market
you can insert a hundred millimeter
neutral density filters and the 105
millimeter circular polarizer into our
optional filter holder to create the
best landscape photo ever it weighs two
six hundred and ten grams and has a
front diameter of 77 millimeters our low
wire lens is currently the fastest 12
millimeter lens in the market for
full-frame cameras the large aperture is
perfect for astrophotography wear a
shorter exposure time is really critical
for that perfect Milkyway shot and of
course it is also extremely convenient
for shooting action in limited light or
in an indoor environment in order to be
the fast mulcher wide-angle lens an
outstanding optical performance cannot
be compromised house with 16 lens
elements including three extra low
dispersion elements and two aspera
torment elements are a low wirel and v
excellent sharpness and contrast from
corner to corner chromatic aberration is
also extremely well controlled
lots of millimeters F 2.8 is the best
ultra wide-angle lens that everyone has
been German for and now the prototypes
are ready we need your support to
realize this dream and send the length
to cereal production thank you for
supporting us to develop extraordinary
lenses thank you
photos and videos immortalize our
memories capturing our ever changing
lives is exhilarating and beautiful but
it's looking back on our moments
distilled so artfully through our unique
vantage point that is the true reason to
stop and document we hold on to them
those moments we protect our memories so
that no matter how life changes we can
relive those unforgettable times as if
we were there once again this is the
reason we capture and create introducing

connects to any computer with fast USB
3.0 download your backups to the
computer or get started on your work
right away by accessing the files from
flash border directly I remember when I
was a kid less than 10 years old my dad
used to have a camera the compounds are
stolen again and it started to take
photos with it I have always enjoyed
taking pictures the editing part that's
not always funny to me editing always
felt unpractical economically poor and
very time consuming so I started to
search for a tool that could solve these
problems and bring me closer to the
professionals and their workflow I
didn't find anything but then I got the
idea of littleneck an ultimate editing
tools
I didn't know how to start how to build
such sexual but I know Nessa he had a
very strong background from Nokia and he
would be the right man for the job
Oh clean background is Nokia very decent
smartphones to the football market I've
been using Lightroom as my hobby and I
got Nikolas idea right away
our engineers got so excited that we
actually built the first prototype in
just a few days to show how the product
can be built I've been an advertising
photographer for the past 12 years and I
like to think that I've seen it all but
a little thick is something I really
haven't seen before because it's totally
different to just use your fingers it it
makes it makes you feel like you're
doing handicrafts it's just fun it's
good fun
a successful startup is a combination of
three things the team the idea and the
market fit two of those we have and now
we are testing the market fit in the
IndieGoGo crowdfunding campaign
this is the trance take your photo
editing to the next level
