pet ownership can be one of the most
fulfilling experiences in life our pets
enrich our lives and incredible ways and
we strive to give them the best light
possible but no matter how hard we try
to avoid it our pets love to get dirty
and it can be a struggle to keep them
clean my name is daniel lense and i want
to tell you about an innovative pet
bathing product i've been working on
called the aqua ball it combines your
bathing brush and your water sprayer
into an intuitive bathing glove it's one
size fits all straps onto either hand
and it's activated by simply pressing a
button in the center of the palm the
Aqua paw allows you to soak your pet by
essentially petting them and at the same
time you have both your hands to keep
your pet under control and thoroughly
rinse their coat and because the glove
is soft and flexible it can be worn
during the entire bathing process even
while applying shampoo it's also a
scrubber so it helps you lather your
pesco even delicate areas like their
neck and underside you can bathe most
pets in less than five minutes the Aqua
Paul quickly connects to an outdoor
spigot or to any household shower using
our simple to install splitter our goal
is to make the bathing experience as
enjoyable as possible for both you and
your pet and by using the Aqua ball you
can drastically reduce the time and
chaos involved in bath time and spend
more time with your freshly cleaned back
I professionally develop products for
brands like KitchenAid Cuisinart and
specialized bicycles and the Aqua ball
is a personal project I've been working
on for years I've developed countless
designs and prototypes and we've tested
with dozens of pet owners and
professional dreamers to refine the
design and now I'm proud to finally
offer this product to you we're already
working with a very capable manufacturer
we've organized the logistics of
delivery and have taken extraordinary
measures to ensure the production go
smoothly the only thing that's missing
is you I'm asking for your support to
bring this revolutionary pet bedding
product to life with your contributions
will pay for tooling and satisfy our
minimum
or requirements thank you so much for
watching I hope that you'll pledge your
support and please share this video with
all of your friends on social media
thank you
that dispatch we're young company we're
a small company we're moving very very
quickly some of the remote people and
also us internally or sometimes nervous
is in the loop if that's not this app
lets me focus on a certain place I think
it's great that you can see the entire
room you can see everything that's going
on if you're having like a roundtable
discussion and the person who's remote
is also part of that discussion it's
like me I'm remote a lot so I feel like
when people are talking to each other
they're also talking to me like I'm not
not part of that conversation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
