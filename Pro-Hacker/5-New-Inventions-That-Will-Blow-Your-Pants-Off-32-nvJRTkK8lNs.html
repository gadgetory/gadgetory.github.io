Germany capital Berlin we are
specialized in creating quality hardware

helped many happy customers all around
the world get the most out of the DSLRs
developing the unleashed we had one big
design goal it's tiny time you can leave
the Unleashed on the camera at all times

hutch will stay is free so you can keep
using your external or pop-up flash LED
channels or shotgun like it never needs

the Unleashed is the first wireless
remote that gives you complete control
over your DSLR as if it was still in
your hand you'll experience a
professionally designed app that lets
you change all the important settings

the camera to change settings trigger it
or start and stop video recording this
is vital for vibration free long
exposures breathtaking star trails as
well as epic time lapses the Unleashed
even supports carefully controlled
exposure ramping for smooth a two-night
transition the holy grail of timeless
one of the biggest advantages of digital
photography is the possibility to
instantly see results this is too cool
to miss when shooting remotely so the
Unleashed will send a thumbnail to your
smartphone for quick review and checking
exposure the unleash can use your
smartphone's location or a Bluetooth GPS
receiver for direct geo-tagging the

shooting a video you could be behind the
main camera but with our app you can
control up to six cameras at once

synchronize settings beforehand don't
worry about missing a moment or an angle

made in Germany we make sure the
unleased is produced locally because in
our experience a close relationship with
manufacturers is what makes the
difference we design develop built
prototypes and have spent months working
on the program what we still need is the
capital for tooling certification and
other costly parts of mass production
while we do the final development
and that's what we need you have
absolutely smartest DSLR accessories so
that we can help you become an even
better photographer we actually uh
