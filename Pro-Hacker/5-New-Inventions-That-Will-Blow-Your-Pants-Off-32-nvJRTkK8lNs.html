time together such a dream only is not

child understand it's okay to get up

what if you had full control over your
DSLR setting but Wireless from your
smartphone we're introducing the unleash
the first smartphone DSLR remote control
that you won't even notice is there
we as photography are a small team in
Germany capital Berlin we are
specialized in creating quality hardware
refined to the last detail and have
helped many happy customers all around
the world get the most out of the DSLRs
developing the unleashed we had one big
design goal it's tiny time you can leave
the Unleashed on the camera at all times
even when packing it into your bag the
hutch will stay is free so you can keep
using your external or pop-up flash LED
channels or shotgun like it never needs
to be charged and automatically
recognize your smartphone via bluetooth
low energy but you don't need to
reconfigure your Wi-Fi settings each
time you shoot promoting its
plug-and-play and always ready to use
the Unleashed is the first wireless
remote that gives you complete control
over your DSLR as if it was still in
your hand you'll experience a
professionally designed app that lets
you change all the important settings
aperture shutter speed ISO white balance
and much more you won't have to touch
the camera to change settings trigger it
or start and stop video recording this
is vital for vibration free long
exposures breathtaking star trails as
well as epic time lapses the Unleashed
even supports carefully controlled
exposure ramping for smooth a two-night
transition the holy grail of timeless
one of the biggest advantages of digital
photography is the possibility to
instantly see results this is too cool
to miss when shooting remotely so the
Unleashed will send a thumbnail to your
smartphone for quick review and checking
exposure the unleash can use your
smartphone's location or a Bluetooth GPS
receiver for direct geo-tagging the
exact GPS location of where you take the
photo is saved in its metadata
immediately relive your vacation by
viewing your photos on a map or find
pictures of your favorite spots by
simply zooming in on their location
without having to remember exactly when
you were there almost every photo
management software already supports geo
tagging there are times when you have to
work with more than one camera even
you're taking photos at a wedding or
shooting a video you could be behind the
main camera but with our app you can
control up to six cameras at once
start recording at the same time trigger
all cameras at the right moment or
synchronize settings beforehand don't
worry about missing a moment or an angle
even if you're missing a crew we believe
in reliability to reach our expectations
of quality our unleased is completely
made in Germany we make sure the
unleased is produced locally because in
our experience a close relationship with
manufacturers is what makes the
difference we design develop built
prototypes and have spent months working
on the program what we still need is the
capital for tooling certification and
other costly parts of mass production
while we do the final development
and that's what we need you have
absolutely smartest DSLR accessories so
that we can help you become an even
better photographer we actually uh
