product comes along that changes
everything I'd like you to meet the
bubble here it all started five years
ago when I was working for a company
called immersive media at that time they
were working with Google to create what
is now known as Street food a problem
the market that I saw was that spherical
technology was only being used for the
mapping you could probably use it for
some other things like panoramic photos
and filmmaking interactive videos which
side of the power ourselves to make
something special the bubble cam doesn't
just capture photos or videos but also
streamed live videos we want to make
this technology portable small portable
and available to every people are
accustomed to shooting panoramas with
their mobile phone there's a problem
with that it's inherently at a sync with
the bubble can you press the button once
and boom you've got your photos your
video and you pop it in our software you
can look all around it's amazing we've
designed the camera in a tetrahedral
orientation venture there are no blind
spots because each camera overlaps the
joining camera no other camera that
we've seen on the market is able to
handle that as well as put it in their
form factor that's the size with
baseball that's light portable and easy
to move around a few in any environment
that you want to record with bubbles
patent-pending tetrahedral design you'll
get 14 megapixel photos h.264 video
capturing 1080p at 15 frames per second
in 720p at 30 frames per second wife I
live streaming a microSD slot and USB
streaming I really think people are
going to want to buy the bubble camera
just because of the ability to shoot in
many different directions the fact is it
takes in all views in real time whether
it be security and surveillance action
sports gaming real estate
teleconferencing I really do think the
opportunities are
Liz with bubbles fckn API our goal is to
allow people to experiment and explore
with this new technology and we've seen
it used in music videos before with the
black eye peas back we've seen the
commercial used for ikea and budweiser
one of the most exciting things that i'm
looking forward to is seeing how
filmmakers are going to be using 360
video it's a whole new way to shoot
things and create interactive
experiences and a new way of telling
story body-mind change is a
co-production between tip and the CSP
media lab we can start to figure out
what we can do it in and I'm really
excited about the insulation where it's
the video work the interactive work that
you can do a technology like this dudes
dudes on to public em to be ready and
available to everyone you're going to
have to make a choice sometimes you want
that straight on shot that one angle but
they're going to be moments where you
want to see everything with your help
we're going to make 360 degrees of your
world available at any time
hello I'm Chuck Martin general manager
of innovation here at Bissell if this
will we know pets and the message they
make around the home and when it's time
to bathe them the message they get even
bigger we focus on cleaning up the
message that life brings including the
pet messes now we're bringing these
insights to the dog mating process the
Bissell bark bath truly is the next
generation of baiting your dog a faster
easier and less messy way this will
strengths are really around
understanding the consumer in the needs
of the consumer especially the pet
parent we know pets we know how pets
interact with the household and the
messages they make it at home we
realized that people are very frustrated
with the baiting process and we took a
look at that we thought well if we're
cleaning up after the dogs when they
come into the house and they leave spots
and stains on the carpet and upholstery
and when never really addressing the
animal it felt that his dirty we started
taking a look at the technology and the
knowledge we had of both pets and
cleaning and we found this great new
idea and its new concept about saving
your animal anywhere in your home so
marrying the insights that we have
around the consumer experience and
around the consumer with the engineering
now which is the perfect match as we
know pet you know pet parents we know
message we know dirt bark bath is really
important because it gives the consumer
a new way outside of their traditional
way of bathing to actually bathe their
dog anywhere in the home that they want
whenever they want what it also allows
people to do is clean more frequently in
10 minutes I can have all three dogs
just just a slight cleaning and the
smell goes away and everything I mean it
works great because you could actually
bathe your dog every other day if you
wanted to and it wouldn't be a chore
where were before it was a charger bade
three dogs you can use it in your
kitchen and just within less than 10
minutes you can wash your dog this is
different because we're actually
changing the way that you wash the
animal normally you would walk from the
fur down and what we're doing is we're
cleaning from the skin up that's how we
can actually use less water because in
the traditional bathtub method of
washing your dog you use about 19
of water to Washington 80-pound dog we
use less than 48 ounces of water because
we're much more efficient at the process
so our no rain shampoo is really unique
because it doesn't have a lot of the
harsh chemicals that other shampoos
mighty and it's really safe and
effective on the animal are you going to
give yourself a ball it was perfect
there was no mess and that was about an
hour shorter than what it would have
taken me to give him a normal bath it
was great and he dried a lot faster you
disagree when I first saw the product I
thought that there was no way that this
was actually going to work on Oreo she
just got too much care it really really
worked good it's better for the
homeowner because they'll use a lot less
water better for the homeowner because
they won't have to wrestle the dog to
get them in and out of the bathtub and
it really delivers on the promises
supposed to give to the pet parrot which
is we're going to take care of your dog
in a way that's never been done it's
easier for you and easier for your dog
please join us in this new adventure and
caring for your dog be one of the first
to get your bark bath order now and keep
checking back with us as will be posting
new videos and updates
