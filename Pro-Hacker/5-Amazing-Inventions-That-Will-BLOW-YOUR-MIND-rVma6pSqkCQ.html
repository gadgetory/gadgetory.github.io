SpaceX engineers and a super collapsible
form factor the helmet implements
next-generation materials and looks like
a baseball hat my sister is riding her
bike through the intersection of Park
and Diamond when she was hit by a car
she spent the next four months in a coma
as two engineers we knew that if we put
our heads together we could do something
about this problem
helmets aren't worn because they're
uncomfortable and inconvenient
people don't want to carry around huge
chunks of foam it became more important
now than ever to have a helmet that's
comfortable attractive portable and safe
