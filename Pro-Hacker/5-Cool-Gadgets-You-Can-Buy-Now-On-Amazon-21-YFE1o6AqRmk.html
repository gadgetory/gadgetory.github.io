motorcycle rider John knows that safety
is important which is why he at least
wear this and this and of course this
but what if you could prevent an accent
altogether well that's Jane hi Jane and
this is break free just like John she
too is an experienced rider and she's
all about safety she knows and being
visible at all times is the key it's a
smart LED light that does sophisticated
things unlike your motorcycle tail light
breakfree is at eye level so all drivers
from nvidia it'll grow brighter to alert
drivers around you when you're slowing
down no matter how breaking down
shifting or engine brake turn it on and
it stays on no need to connect it with
wires or use an app and that's what jane
and riders really care about being seen
to prevent an accident in the first
place whether you're this this this or
even this kind of writer you'll still
want this this bridges the gap between
safety and style this is break free a
smarter way to be seen I've been writing
for the past 10 years and I loved every
second of it i also have a wife and two
beautiful daughters so my safety is
always my top priority shortly after I
graduated college I got the opportunity
to apprentice under a successful Silicon
Valley entrepreneur while working on one
of his new ideas and autonomous brake
lights cars I quickly realized this is
the perfect product for motorcycle
riders so if break free we're trying to
use advanced manufacturing techniques
from companies like IBM viendo you and
bring those to the consumer market to
deliver a safety product that is like no
other one of the biggest hurdles for the
design process was trying to make our
unit fit on as many how much as possible
and the way we did this as we took
we could yet and we 3d scan the back of
them and what we're trying to get at is
a shape that's going to work for males
as possible and also maximize the
surface area of the light because the
surface area life is obviously important
and how much you can see them products
that have been on the market already our
old mounted fix on a vehicle that works
well and can detect acceleration but as
soon as that the head of the writer
start moving a lot of these devices give
false readings what's special about the
break free device is that we can detect
deceleration in the direction of travel
even though the head of the writer where
the lights mounted may move sideways and
tilt forward then go lat break free is
to increase safety for writers we do
that in two ways first create a device
that people will want to wear and the
second make something that works one of
the most important aspects of our safety
is our visibility and it's also one of
those things that's most neglected
currently in the market there's some
high vis gear that's neither in helmet
or vast or in pants and to me I mean
it's definitely a step in the right
direction but they're a static piece
they're not going to really get the
attention they're not going to really
capture kind of a semi glazed driver if
you will what's nice about this product
is it illuminates and flashes so it's
something that is dynamic and it
definitely can make a difference between
saving the life breakfree is something
that's really unique never seen anything
like it before cars have a triangle of
life these days modern cars the two
taillights the light that's up in the
back window motorcyclists taillights are
generally small and they're designing
them to look even cooler and smaller and
they become even harder to see the break
free brings a light that is going to be
noticeable by drivers up into their
basic field of vision this is why brain
needs tix
breakfree is bridging the gap between
style and safety I dedicated the last
two years of my life get break free to
where there's been days and this is
where we need your help now we need the
tool to manufacture our first large
order we get break free into the hands
of writers everywhere thank you

the bike is in emerald park my life and
what makes a day a good day cruise bike
absolutely enables that because I tried
on upright and it was miserable my body
was falling apart and it was not
something I want to give up so to find
the decrees bike was amazing it enabled
me to live this life that I enjoyed over
the past years have become passionate
about pursuing a self-propelled
lifestyle trying to avoid motor
transportation as much as possible three
spike has enabled me to do that has made
it really fun and 40,000 50,000 miles
later I excited for the next
the first time I rode the soft rider was
so fun was like I was a kid again and it
truly did bring joy back into riding
that's huge because I haven't really
been able to do it I have also had a
special needs child and he's required so
much work in the last 14 years that I've
finally been able to get back out enjoy
being outdoors get a break that I need
and come back refreshed had a bike
accident bike forks failed and i broke
my neck for two and a half years i
basically i'm not going to ride the only
person who believed i would ride again
with my life
concern for me was finding something
that was comfortable enough that doesn't
irritate the neck if I ride a
traditional bike within about five
minutes my neck is numb my hands hurt
and I can't ride the bicycle I have to
get off the cruise bike I can get on it
and I can ride for nine ten hours and i
can get off of it and it's not like i've
written for five minutes it gives me
back the writing that i didn't live in
half again
having mr. spike says that
between me feeling like I was confined
to the house and just bring my mind and
it's wonderful to be able to come home
and be refreshed and be able to take on
measures event
