capture your own funny moments although
tracking is critical however how to try
out all the tracking stabilizers in the
market we found out there's a lot of
room for improvement it is too easy to
lose sight of a target when object is
shaded or simply moving fast
that's where taro comes in
Carroll is an auto tracking device you
can truly count on that are always keep
you in a frame
all you need to do is put on the
infrared tag and leave the rest to taro
our tracking camera will instantly
identify where the object is and our AI
algorithm will pinpointed exactly at a
blazing thirty calculations per second
that's 15 times faster than our
competitor now with taro moving as fast
as 50 miles per hour with taro zero
lagging tracking feature your object
will be constantly locked in
even during very sharp turns Taro's
dynamic tracking works perfectly even
when you yourself are also moving back
because it sees and captures fast-moving
moments so smoothly you won't even need
to look at the screen with three high
torque brushless motors and racks and a
mercy video jitters are now a thing of
the past and with our app breathtaking
action sequences pictures and videos are
just a single click away as a group of
AI software engineers we've poured our
heart and soul into getting our
prototypes just right we are now so
excited to be releasing not just one but
three devices
taro t1 for smartphones and GoPros taro
TX for DSLR cameras and taro m1 a
separate tracking module that's
compatible with all stabilizers whether
you're a vlogger sports freak animal
lover or whatever now at last you can
put yourself in the frame and
confidently capture every moment that
matter whether you already have a
stabilizer or perhaps looking to buy new
one the taro
bringing your shooting experience to a
whole new level is badass today
very oh sorry good work
what if your phone could do more capture
more create more what if your phone
could transform into a powerful
storytelling tool this is movi your
personal cinema robot in just five years
free flies redefined the art of camera
movement at our headquarters just
outside of Seattle we've designed the
drones and cinema robots that have
powered everything from Game of Thrones
to the Tour de France and we've taught
movie all our trips shooting with movi
is simple flip your phone into movies
clamp-and-run
ride slide skate climb and capture
everything you focus on the story while
movie turns every bump jolt and shake
into smooth cinematic footage each movi
ship is preloaded with our favorite
methods for creating stunning films
majestic mode turns bumpy moves into
smooth cinematic shots users can quickly
toggle between presets and turn on or
off horizon leveling with a single click
Eco mode allows you to select your start
point end point and Moby takes care of
the rest
this means a single user can execute
shots that would normally take a small
crew
time lapse mode enables you to compress
time while executing dynamic moves well
we can look up down left and right very
slowly and precisely so that when played
back and five to 20 times speed your
time lapses will be even more dynamic
mobile apps is a moving timelines
it allows you to cover huge distances
and time spans and compress both to show
your world in a completely new way
sometimes to get the perfect shot you
just have to hold still
we built the smart pod mode into mobi
that enables you to manually point
wherever you want and know that mobi
will hold that position perfectly great
for family portraits checking your squat
form or perfecting your golf swing mobi
was designed to play nice with a wide
variety of cases and cinematic lenses by
building on Apple's powerful framework
mobi is able to track objects points and
features to let you create shots with a
single touch of your finger historically
these kind of shots would take three
pros on set with at least six cups of
coffee movi doesn't even like coffee
combine your phone with Mobe to create
the world's most portable capable and
intuitive cinema robot get movi tell
more moving stories
stabilization is one of those things
that once you see the video from it you
immediately understand why you need it
with karma we're giving you a
world-class stabilizer to ensure that
you get the best most stable shots
possible in the air and on the ground
the Karma grip enables you to take the
stabilizer from your karma drone place
it on the Karma grip and use it for
super steady buttery smooth handheld
footage on the ground no matter what
movement you do with your body or your
skateboard or the car it creates this
perfectly stabilized image and enable
someone to capture footage of someone
walking and have it be the smoothest
highest-quality image that they have
captured ever with a GoPro and then the
Karma grip becomes an extension of your
GoPro it gives you the ability to start
stop the camera change camera modes you
can change the stabilizers angle you can
highlight your best moments on the fly
and provides two hours of battery life
so that you can capture any activity
you're doing and you can obviously power
on and off the camera
and then furthermore you can take the
Karma grip and mount it into the full
GoPro ecosystem of mounts so that means
you can take a beautiful stabilized
image by mounting on to even the karma
case that the system comes with or you
can put it onto a bike you enter the car
you can put it onto a helmet
we didn't focus on creating just a
flying camera we set out to make a
system that allows you to capture the
best GoPro footage ever
you
are you still shooting unsteady videos
with your phone capture smooth and
steady cinematic videos at a breeze with
3G yet simply slide in your phone or
GoPro and turn it on and all the
creation is at your fingertips for many
stabilizers it is impossible to record
videos using the underslung position
without rotating to portrait mode region
it can continue to record the video in
this position with its easy to use
control panel you can easily switch
between photos and video mode front and
rear camera and zoom in and out reach
yet can also charge your phone or even
better plug a power bank so you can
charge reach yet and your phones
simultaneously so that you can use our
app to livestream all day within the
region app we've built an auto track
function simply drag any object on the
screen and read yet we'll take over
create amazing slow motion and
time-lapse videos
shoot amazing panorama photos with free
jet with a total of three different
panorama modes you can even shoot better
photos than any other stabilizer you had
ragia is the most advanced stabilizer to
capture your life
