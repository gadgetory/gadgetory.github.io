with great Mother Nature and staying
connected with family and friends I love
sharing my adventures but I've realized
that it's really hard to get access to
electricity to stay connected outdoors
the thing is today's mobile devices use
significantly less power than
traditional consumer electronics so one
day I came up with the idea what if we
could convert every energy resource into
personal power I want to introduce you
to e stream it's a portable water power
generator it converts any type of
running water into stored energy you can
get personal on-demand power with
nothing but water energy oh this is how
it works
remove the cover unfold the turbines and
lock them
hook and release eastream into running
water let it come freely to generate
electricity and it charges the built-in
battery it takes approximately 4.5 hours
to fully charge one eastream
which can charge up to 3 smartphones
GoPros or tablet PCs 2 times faster than
charging through an outlet you can also
use it as a lantern with 4 different
modes even underwater
these stream works well even in weak
current or behind a kayak and regardless
of the weather or time of day
it fits perfectly into any size backpack
it's ideal for use while you enjoy
camping fishing kayaking biking pull any
other outdoor activities we didn't start
it just to charge a smartphone at the
campsite we wanted to provide a personal
on demand energy our goal is to discover
every energy resource around you and
convert them into your own power we've
been working hard to get here to meet
you

thank you
the world is getting smaller and more of
us are traveling to distant and remote
places when we travel one of our biggest
challenges is how to guarantee but the
water we are drinking is safe
there are currently dozens of personal
water filters and filter bottles on the
market that claim to solve this issue
the problem is that water filters only
trap bacteria and cysts that then remain
in the filter and continue to live and
multiply this can add up to a major
health concern in addition water filters
do not eliminate or even trap waterborne
viruses that are really the biggest
concern of all to be truly protected
from bacteria and viruses water must be
purified not just filtered meat pure to
go the most advanced unique and
multifunctional true water purifier in
the world compared to go kills bacteria
and viruses instantly on contact and on
demand while also completely eliminating
waterborne cysts such as crypto and
Giardia
there is absolutely no waiting time or
preparation required as contaminated
water passes through pure to go it is
purified instantly without the holding
timer procedures other true water
purifiers require here to go can be used
by one person or multiple users
with cleanable and replaceable insert
cartridges it can be used over and over
again for many years and more
importantly it can be stored for long
periods without the same danger posed by
filters how do we come up with this
design over nearly half a century water
one has provided ultra pure water to
Science and Industry and premium bottles
drinking water to customers throughout
the world an industry innovator we
developed a proprietary water
purification media pyro back that kills
bacteria and viruses on contact and on
demand so why is this different here to
go to insert cartridges provides three
tiers of filtration and purification
with a flow rate of up to 16 ounces per
minute contaminated water undergoes
three separate filtration and
purification steps ensuring the water is
completely safe to drink with no danger
from any pathogens including viruses the
period ago comes in two convenient
packages first the pure go travelers
kiss it fits in a small travel pouch
that takes up minimal space in any
suitcase or backpack inside comes a 27
ounce collapsible water bottle that
screws directly into the pier to go the
second package option is the pier to go
kit like the travelers kit it includes a
collapsible water bottle and a purifying
filter but also a lot more the go kit
also contains a 2 litre gravity feed
water bag a hand pump suitable for water
or air and lots of other accessories for
incredible versatility here we go can
even adapt inline with hydration
backpack now we may not be the most
well-known producer of water purifiers
yet but we are confident that with the
pier to go we have made the most
advanced unique and multifunctional true
water purifier in the world we invite
