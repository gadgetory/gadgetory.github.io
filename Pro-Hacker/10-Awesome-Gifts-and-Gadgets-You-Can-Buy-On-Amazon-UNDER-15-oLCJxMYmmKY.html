we were inspired to invent the luminaid
light while we are graduate students in
architecture school it was two weeks
after the 2010 earthquake in Haiti we
were looking at what was being
distributed and we saw that they were
distributing medical supplies and
shelters and other types of supplies but
there really wasn't a lighting product
that was being shipped in volume and we
saw that a lightweight portable light
that was rechargeable could really add a
lot of safety and comfort to those
victims
typically after disasters the lights go
out and the alternatives are something
like flashlights which require batteries
and oftentimes people in certain parts
of the world have to use kerosene
lanterns or candles which are dangerous
and our fire hazards portable solar
lighting like our luminate lights
provide a clean and safe alternative to
that
the luminaid light is a compact solar
rechargeable lantern that packs really
small and weighs just a few ounces
there's a solar panel for chargeable
battery and an in place to diffuse the
light and reduce the glare on your eyes
so if you press the button it provides
over 30 hours of light and then you just
recharge it in the Sun it's totally
waterproof and it's made of a really
durable and weather resistant material
we sell our lights all over the world
online and in camping stores voters
outer recreationalists hikers and
campers they love our lights because
they're super lightweight they're
durable they're easy to charge compact
to carry and environmentally friendly
since that first light we've grown our
company and reached tens of thousands of
families across the globe but we're
still just a small group of dedicated
people passionate about working together
to empower people with life besides our
partnerships with NGOs such as unfpa
shelter box and Doctors Without Borders
we are also passionate about other ways
to give back so we designed the give
light gal a program which allows
luminate supporters to help us make
light accessible to all participants
receive one luminaid light for
themselves and sponsor a light to a
family in need we've sent more than
20,000 lights to families and more than
50 countries across the
we believe that a little light can have
a huge impact
luminate is proud to help Renton lives
around the world
