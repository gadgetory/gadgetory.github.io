engineered and manufactured talon
multi-tool by tactical compact enough to

weigh you down
heavy duty enough to get things done
talon in your hand enough said
two years ago we bought you tactic is
first crowdfunding campaign the one
bottle opener and now we have our latest
innovation ready for you talon pushes
the limits with materials technology and
functionality its patent-pending design
is made possible by using an advanced
composite material this makes it super
strong and enables the unique unibody
design that increases strength and
hardness
we've also created a dual-purpose
storage compartment into the design to
function as a socket something that
hasn't been possible in a multi-tool
until now we make the Talon in Melbourne
Australia and over the past few months
our team has worked closely to perfect
the design for manufacture it's great to
be involved again with the same factory
that produces our popular one bottle
opener this kind of collaborations make
sure that everyone involved has a deep
understanding of the project and the
high standards we expect having a local
manufacturer also reduces the risks
usually associated with overseas
manufacture no waiting on shipments
faulty products or delivery delays will
be right there in front of the Machine
as they come off the line it doesn't get
any more personal than that importantly
tooling has already commenced yes that's
right we've made the decision to launch
straight into the production process
because we reckon you're gonna want one
or two in time for Christmas we're
tooling the mods now and we'll be ready
for full-scale production well before
Christmas thanks for the support and
look forward to getting a talent in your
hand soon

with villa 'the your ability to achieve
peak performance really just boils down
to how badly you want it
no matter who your family is we all want
to keep the people we love safe and
that's why we made salt the first safe
gun for a safe home
hi I'm Adam this is Andy we're the
creators of salt salt is a gun but it's
not like any gun that you've ever seen
it was designed around the belief that a
firearm shouldn't have to take a life in
order to protect a life from that simple
idea we started by completely rethinking
the bullet instead of LED salt was
designed to shoot a specialized round
filled with a powerful toxin so instead
of killing the target salt opens up on
impact in a cloud that instantly causes
respiratory and visual distress so while
an intruder or a curious child will be
incapacitated the encounter wouldn't be
fatal this rethink also lets salt be
used not only offensively but
defensively as well so if an intruder is
kicking down your door
salt allows you to shoot the area around
it before the danger is on top of you
this creates a protective cloud of toxin
between you and the intruder before he's
ever a threat to you or your family our
last big idea was to make salt easy to
use for everyone so we replaced the
violent bang of black powder with the
silent power of compressed air the
result is a fear free user experience so
the only person that should have
anything to be scared of is an intruder
and that's all a safe gun for a safe
home so if you're is intrigued by the
ideas as we are we'd love to make you
one just click our support button and
together we can make the world just a
little bit safer
what if it was simple to use a regular
pen and paper notebook while saving
everything in the cloud perfectly
organized the way you want and what if
after you saved your notes in the cloud
and filled your paper notebook you could
just erase it with the push of a button
and use it again that's not magic
that's the rocket book wave notebook
with the wave notebook and the rocket
book app you instantly blast your notes
into the cloud using your mobile device
in a fraction of a second rocket book
machine vision scans enhances and sends
each page to the specific destination
they belong on the cloud services you
already use each wave notebook page has
seven symbols set up the rocket book app
to assign each symbol to a location
within Dropbox and Google Docs Evernote
OneNote or simply to your email inbox
let's see how Jake has his setup he
marks the diamond symbol and the rocket
book app sends the notes to his customer
meetings notes in Evernote when he's
brainstorming he marks the star symbol
which he decided are for the notes that
belong in his ideas folder in Google
Docs now that your notes are in the
cloud when your notebook is filled
there's no need to go buy another book
or let use notebooks clutter your life
here's how you can reuse your wave
notebook multiple times with the mere
push of a button take your notes using
friction pilot pens available in many
office supply stores and amazon.com
friction pilot ink turns clear under
heat and the wave notebook is specially
designed to be microwave safe that means
you can clear your entire wave notebook
your microwave in the same amount of
time it takes to make a cup of tea when
our specially designed thermal logo on
the cover turns from blue to white your
wave notebook has been cleared and is
ready to be reused and with your notes
in the cloud an empty notebook has
endless possibilities the utility of the
cloud and the joy of pen and paper
that's rocket book
