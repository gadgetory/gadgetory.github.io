outward reducing audio distortion and
doubling the richness distance and
detail of your audio the levitating
tweeter speaker unimpeded by surface
friction faces upward providing
crystal-clear
high-pitched audio a full range woofer
faces downward perfectly balancing the
tweeter plus a separate subwoofer
providing the sort of bass you feel in
your bones hi I'm Alan I'm the founder
of a suite in 2014 we invented the first
levitating speaker using magnetic
repulsion to the speaker up in the air
because of zero friction helping to
bring our speaker's best performance we
spent the past two years developing our
own electrostatic diver and drivers
traditional dynamic drivers need to have
a chamber to create resonance
electrostatic diver and drivers is very
thin and only a chamber which can only
be found in the most expensive and best
headphones ever built
and rarely in compare speakers with our
own pattern technology Sparkle can give
you the best detail in sound you feel
like you are actually inside the scene

bone conduction speakers transmit sound
waves to the skull via vibrations
blender thing should keep up to yourself
so tell me why
this is how I tell you
you
why do we keep it all to yourself now
who try to say missile I'm telling you
I thought it was coming from the two
speakers and when you revealed what was
actually happening I was very surprised
it's good it's like kind of nothing I'm
really hurt before I was aghast and I
haven't been that in a lot of years
really expert on rock the core is the
most advanced wireless speaker system
ever developed five digital signal
processors allow us to render the audio
in a way that is totally revolutionary
you're getting stereo sound from this
one tiny little box the convention right
now is that for true high-end listening
you have to have two speakers the core
changes that you can have one and it
truly sounds like tuned for a little box
like this so trade although imaging is
very impressive leveraging a combination
of wave field synthesis and beamforming
allows us to create an acoustic bubble
in the room so that the image stays
stable no matter where you're sitting
you can almost see each person in the
band in the room with you I can move my
head around and the location of the
sound source remains intact as if it was
you know a hologram
there's no speaker that can do anything
like this
everything is smart but sound systems
aren't and this is the thing that we're
doing at mass fidelity is creating truly
smart sound systems if you have an NFC
enabled phone just touch the top of the
core and you're automatically connected
a high density battery gives the core a
solid 12 hour battery life the core is
built-in microphone allows you to
remotely answer calls without having to
touch your phone and if that phone is
about to die the cores USB connector
will recharge it for you the cores
control input makes it home automation
in fact the core has all the inputs
you'll ever need any smart device will
work instantly via bluetooth hook up
your Apple TV to a pristine sound
quality to all of your favorite music
and video streaming services you can
even connect your turntable and
regardless of where the music is coming
from you can broadcast it and up to
eight rooms at once for the past 18
months we've been developing the core
