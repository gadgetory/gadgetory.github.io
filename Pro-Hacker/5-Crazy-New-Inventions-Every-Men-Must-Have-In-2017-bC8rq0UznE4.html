yet
there are still few things holding us
back poor banks external hard drives
countless adapters and of course the
chunky charges that's what living in a
modern life was until now this is line
duck the world's first device offering a
powerful battery full connectivity fast
SSD storage and active cooling all this
in a 9 millimeter cable free shell the
massive internal battery offers up to
1.5 full charge of any USBC laptop
simply connect lined up using a USBC
cable and free yourself from power
outlets and chargers lined up slides
perfectly in your backpack for a laptop
sleeve thanks to quick charge technology

device faster so that you never run out

gigabytes of SSD storage at the office

charging pads just place your smartphone

the most
instead of carrying a myriad of adapters
on daily basis line duct provides
everything you need right under your
laptop it's smart format allows for zero
square inches loss on your workspace
we've been developing lined up for over
a year
using the most advanced technologies and
materials we teamed up with the best
engineers to come up with a symbiotic
and reliable device technology should
make life easier
we took a step further with a special
attention to design and portability a
single device for seamless digital
experience
lined up organizes your day while you
organize your thoughts
are you a light sleeper night owl or
frequent traveler are you just working
too darn hard to get enough rest sleep
masks are a great way to instantly
upgrade your sleep but most are
uncomfortable or don't fully block out
the light so as industrial designers
with over 10 years of experience we
created something better the Manta sleep
mask the key is in the adjustable
eyepieces simply lift adjust secure and
you have a personalized fit that's
comfortable with 100% blackout the
hollow eye contours prevent pressure on
your eyes which encourage REM sleep the
type of sleep that makes you feel well
rested we also did sweat the details
adding anti slip gel for better grip
integrating elastic stretch bands for
comfort and using micro velcro that
won't stick to your hair so whether
you're embarking on the most epic and
memorable adventure of this season and
need to catch a bit of sleep whenever
and wherever you can or you just need to
recharge yourself with a 30 minute power
nap in the middle of a busy day or maybe
you just want to sleep in on a lazy
Sunday morning and have breakfast in bed
with the one you love Manta sleep mask
will be there for you
many of us use RFID technology in our
daily lives these digital key cards
often provide easy and convenient access
to all of the places that we frequent on
a regular basis our home office parking
structure pool etc but until now there's
been no easy way to copy these devices
leaving you vulnerable to expensive fees
should you lose one and inconveniencing
you when you need to share access with a
spouse friend housekeeper or dog walker
and having a different key card for each
location can be a hassle enter key Z a
small device that fits on your keyring
allowing you to copy up to four RFID
devices the process of copying an RFID
credential onto key Z is simple first
hold down the button you would like to
copy the RFID credential to when the LED
light turns red simply hold key Z over
the key fob or keycard the LED will
blink red while key Z is reading the
device when the process is complete the
LED will turn green to use it simply
press the button near the reader and it
will work just like the original easy
works with the most popular low
frequency RFID devices from many
manufacturers using different protocols
and if you move or no longer need access
to an RFID credential you can simply
reprogram that button to copy another
device and if you need to give access to
anyone it's as easy as holding your key
Z to theirs and holding down the button
the simplicity and convenience moves
with you Kesey the RFID duplicator
