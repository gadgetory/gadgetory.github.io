comfortable with 100% blackout the
hollow eye contours prevent pressure on
your eyes which encourage REM sleep the

comfort and using micro velcro that
won't stick to your hair so whether

memorable adventure of this season and

you just want to sleep in on a lazy
Sunday morning and have breakfast in bed

many of us use RFID technology in our
daily lives these digital key cards
often provide easy and convenient access
to all of the places that we frequent on
a regular basis our home office parking
structure pool etc but until now there's
been no easy way to copy these devices
leaving you vulnerable to expensive fees
should you lose one and inconveniencing
you when you need to share access with a
spouse friend housekeeper or dog walker
and having a different key card for each
location can be a hassle enter key Z a
small device that fits on your keyring
allowing you to copy up to four RFID
devices the process of copying an RFID
credential onto key Z is simple first
hold down the button you would like to
copy the RFID credential to when the LED
light turns red simply hold key Z over
the key fob or keycard the LED will
blink red while key Z is reading the
device when the process is complete the
LED will turn green to use it simply
press the button near the reader and it
will work just like the original easy
works with the most popular low
frequency RFID devices from many
manufacturers using different protocols
and if you move or no longer need access
to an RFID credential you can simply
reprogram that button to copy another
device and if you need to give access to
anyone it's as easy as holding your key
Z to theirs and holding down the button
the simplicity and convenience moves
with you Kesey the RFID duplicator
