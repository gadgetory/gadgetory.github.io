every year in traffic jams and moan
about it because you're not getting
anything from life the fact doesn't help
at all you don't want to get to the
office all sweaty that's for sure
you have no time for exercise because
you waste your life in your car hey your
life is outside not in your car you just
have to reach out and get it leave your
car in the garage because your bike can
be electric with by Moses if more people
had more fun on bikes and things would
be better on the road for our
environment and for you too and if more
people switch to bikes the better off we
will be
Deimos has the power that you don't have
in the morning your gateway drug your
strong ally on the slopes and against
head with your trainer if you want to
ride up mountain on the flat it listens
to your heart when you're training you
and your bike become one
it shows your friends where you went and
if you want you can do something good
for others by describing your roots and
sharing them with your friends
I must it's not heavy not complicated or
expensive how can this all work well
because the Primus is a smart direct
drive the most incredible stuff can be
done with a little intelligence and it
fits almost any bike in a few minutes
it's ready child's play
remove crank put on the battery pack put
on by most put on the fix ready
any other questions
it goes with the power on the bike needs
to be not on the rear around the front
wheel but in the middle where it should
be no transmission no gears no gadgets
oh junk you do not need any machine
noises to get up a mountain and it works
vamos turns you into a super hero
because by most keep to the fearing that
the power comes rear legs somehow
between a tail wind and a slight
downhill on the mountain but only if
that is what you want without the drive
your bike is your bike you can ride it
like your bike and on the whole it looks
just like your bike you can remove the
battery you can charge it at home now
it's your turn there are a million
things you'd rather do than sit in a
traffic jam discover fruits that you
don't know put your life in motion do
something with yourself
almost every bike and electric with by
most even yours
hey but I only want you to have more fun
in life and to make the world a little
better goodbye
it would be really great if you could
support the BIOS idea and share our
videos
surely you know someone or whom by most
is perfect
hi
are you an expert in killing plants I
know I used to be and it was because I
didn't have the time or the skill to
keep them alive I wanted to solve this
problem so I teamed up with you Alice
and Mario together we created both
hanging
it is an automatic yourself watering
plant but lets you grow effortlessly you
can have fresh shirt without giving up
your life in Betania you can grow herbs
like basil sign for it minutes you can
also grow vegetables like tomatoes for
Chile ruthenium is a complete kit for
growing your own plants from seeds this
is how to not kill effect pour water
into the tank and some nutrients they
left with the included globally plant
the seed connected to an outlet and let
the paintings take care of the plant for
you the roots really thrive in the
pinion which makes the plant grow larger
and faster than in common sorry if you
fill it up it can last up to a month so
you don't need to worry if we go away
we're a group of entrepreneurs engineers
and designers we know what it takes to
make a product we have done it before
we have made many prototypes and are now
ready for mass production to do that we
have a big startup cost and your help to
back this project
you
this is I grew the world's smartest home
brewing machine beer is the oldest and
world's most widely consumed alcoholic
beverage with thousands of years of
history and brewing tradition but time
has changed with iGoogle now everybody
can prove me I guru keeps the brewing
cooling and fermentation processes in
one single machine all you need is the
Machine and the right ingredients you
can easily create your own beer stuff
with simple operations all brewing
processes can be tracked monitor and
control with a simple LCD screen user
interface after filling the ingredients
the user can select a recipe from the
library based on the Styles grains hops
and yeast
the users want to use my Gullu we'll do
the rest of the work automatically our
system also allows you to use different
mini cakes for fermentation in your
fridge with I gurus mobile for Android
and iOS you can connect control and
monitor the whole EEPROM stay informed
for every single step and even receive a
notice once the
completely the I Gullu social platform
provides you there's hundreds of
standard recipe well built by excellent
Brewers around the world you can order
different recipes through the app with
receive ready to brew packages now you
can taste the beer from the other side
of the world just at home if you want to
be more creative and following recipes
is too boring for you and just create
your own recipe yes you can play around
and once you found the perfect mix just
save it for next time or share it on the
platform with other you create the color
strength and individual flavor you want
there are no limits to your creativity
iGoogle maintains the integrity of the
natural ingredients you can also use
hops and malt from your local farmer and
try to create a regional tape machine is
designed with a lot of passion and focus
on detail it looks great in any
environment our electrical and
mechanical engineers have spent
countless hours on this project to test
and optimize our initial design again
and again
now we are ready for mass production and
have a fully working prototype to tap
with recipes including an online store
for the ingredients it's not only our
goal to create an excellent project but
also to find the best recipe and create
a platform for fearless
therefore we also work with excellent
breweries we did a lot of experiments
for different recipes handcraft appear
to be in art for thousands of years
professional brewers have been trying to
optimize the recipe now everyone can
brew all you need is Mike
we are going to make a great change for
fearless it makes it easy and fun for
everyone to brew their own beer place
your bid invite your friends and impress
with your own hand
rapid beeping cheers - I go
you
there is nothing that excites the senses
like hearing our loved ones the music we
enjoy every day the messages we
communicate to each other the rhythm of
the neighborhood we live in or the
sounds of nature when we seek solitude
unfortunately according to the World
Health Organization over 350 million
people suffer from disabling hearing
loss in the US alone there are over 14
million with hearing loss and the vast
majority can benefit from using a
hearing aid but only one in five
actually use one hearing loss can occur
due to exposure to loud sounds or to
aging as we use our hearing sounds
become muffled and words need to be
repeated especially in noisy
environments the quality of life
degrades as we continue to lose our
hearings
hearing aids can be outrageously
expensive an average hearing aid cost
$1,700 and most people needed pair
it's simply unaffordable for most you
can pay less than $500 for a laptop
computer but why should you pay much
more for a hearing aid that has far
fewer components and features my name is
Adnan shanab I'm the founder and CEO of
I hear medical I am a biomedical
engineer with passion for applying
technology to hearing solutions I have
been inventing and developing advanced
hearing devices in Silicon Valley for
over 20 years
unfortunately the advanced products we
have developed in the past simply never
reach the majority of people who need
them so we started I hear Medical to
remove the barriers preventing people
from getting high quality hearing
devices and here's how we did this we
invented a highly miniaturized curing
device that fits discreetly inside the
ear canal the modular design allows the
user to customize the fit and less than
them secondly we invented a USB device
that enables you to test your hearing
ability at home and also to
electronically calibrate the hearing
device according to your hearing loss
and preferences thirdly we developed
innovative online tools which empower
the consumer to manage the entire
fitting process of a convenient to their
home the unique online process
dramatically cuts down on the cost of
delivering an advanced hearing device
our discreet in-ear hearing device has
been clinically tested with impressive
results in sound quality and
inconspicuous where I hear the
fluorescent light another computer I
hear your watch I hear everything best
of all the I hear device costs as little
as a hundred and ninety nine dollars I'm
one of those guys that grew up in a
working poor family and therefore we
couldn't afford hearing aids and so I'm
excited the fact that this is going to
be something that your average consumer
can afford our mission is to create
advanced hearing devices that are
affordable and accessible beyond that we
want to provide the gift of hearing for
everyone
this is why we created the hearing for
all initiatives to donate a hearing aids
for every I hear device you purchase
help us provide here and for all by
ordering one of our products for
yourself or for a loved one who suffers
from hearing loss or by contributing to
our hearing for all campaign thank you
for your support
we've been in the home solar business
for many years and we decided we wanted
to try to build a smaller lighter system
basically take a whole home system and
compact it down into a really small
portable package that you can still run
major appliances with and that's what we
did we made a very small ultra
lightweight portable system that can run
you know so much of your home your home
appliances and other systems that you
would need in the power outage
Oh mom what happened
movie when we decided to develop Cody I
do want to make sure that we hit all the
right used scenario and we were looking
at how people really would use it in
real life and does including us the idea
was to make something that was so small
and lightweight but powerful enough to
do the work needs be done that it would
be something that anybody even a child
could pick up and carry off someplace
the Kodiak and Power refrigerators
freezers microwaves grinders mixers all
kinds of kitchen appliances and CPAP
machines some some oxygen concentrators
are a whole bunch of your medical
equipment
you
our solar panels are made from a
high-tech lamination process we put
ruggedized corners on it to allow us to
slide them together and to pass power
back and forth a traditional solar panel
is made of glass and aluminum and it's
really heavy
we know that the Kodiak generator and
the predator panel will change the world
on behalf of energy thank you

powered by the incredible I Viviane have
outdone all other video surveillance
services the last six years just so you
know threw up on the world we have an
experiencing diverse team from five
countries the u.s. broad China Russia
okay poor but that's still pretty good
right the camera is ready to be
manufactured help us to crowdfund the
first bunch of oco-2 production unit
you'll be the first to get a camera and
for half price
our dream is to bring fully feature an
affordable security device every home
jumping together we can let's do it what
are you waiting for kids let's do it
come on come on guys one day you'll tell
your grandchildren that you helped these
great guys launch this really cool thing
Asian Chinese listen belief that
drinking tea to help self recognitions
richer peaceful mind after Salman's of
years the wisdom have transferred in GT
culture can be in part of the life warm
calm put tea in fifty and faculty at a
four basic steps in traditional tea
ceremony who wish to bring a design that
duplicates the chosen but as simple as
using tea bag
here comes take account a thermometer a
teapot three single pieces can provide
an experience that traditional tea
ceremony could first add boiling water
into teapot up to the guideline applies
the moment you're on GG pot and wait
until water temperature drops to
corresponding requirements the
thermometer is design temperature
visible that shows different including
temperature of certain type of blues tea
as desire amount of Lucy into ink
readers the infuser is designed as a
measurement for different kinds of tea
command infuser - thermometer by magnet
for the metal pop back into teapot and
wait and tea tea is ready
the inclusion time for each loose tea is
stated in many instructions take of
thermometer and place upside down the
disc can prevent water from running off
with hey you can enjoy the best tea with
minimal skills now let's begin to
explore the wonderful tea adventure it
takes over one year from an idea to be a
prototype
we have hundreds of experiments to
finalize change shape in size which is
easing clay as main material that
contains a variety of mineral components
enables better taste of tea we combine
missing clay with metal in one teaspoon
to show the mixture between traditional
culture in modern lifestyle pay is
designed adapt to our daily life by
using hey everyone could create their
own tea experience under different
ambiences in Chinese painting flags
which represents the tranquil mind the
peaceful a in :
it is the power we want a to free
anytime anywhere hey is always there
with
at our practical real of high-voltage
shooting spark and lighting up the party
after bringing the test boil to life
we knew it was time to put one in
everyone's pocket introducing the
sparker a plasma lighter and flashlight
and one the flashlight is a 1 watt
dimmable LED background for 4 hours at
full price the removable lid doubles as
a diffusers transforming the light into
a lantern the plasma lighter uses
electricity to create a windproof
solution that requires no claim using or
fuel
the sparker is great for any of your
outdoor adventures why did your barbecue
around your house or simply being
prepared
Barger is also USB rechargeable we sack
or share our project and light it up
your back it takes care of every move
you make but how do you take care of it
most of us sit for over nine hours every
single day and being honest it's hard to
avoid slouching eventually it results in
back pain stress affecting both
professional and personal life but don't
worry spino has got your back whether
you are sitting on the chair or floor
spino takes care of your posture it
provides constant support to the lower
back and let you sit comfortably for
hours Spiner
is pretty simple to use place the back
pad around the lower back knee time
around your knee and adjust tension in
the belt that's it
automatically you will sit in the
perfect posture but the best thing it
can be attached to the chair as well we
did the extensive product testing with
people from various backgrounds and here
is what they think about Spiner ah I
could feel free to go to my lower back
alright actually because that taking the
complete pressure off the lower back
like Suzy rabbit I can easily pull the
straps like oh I'm sitting up straight
now you don't really notice it so you
put it on then either our celebrity
comes all because of it I don't even
need the back part of this chair I'm a
cyclist so throughout the day our spines
are in danger basically because we're
always slouching so at the end of the
day I would love to keep this on for
like a long period of time yeah
we're able to figure out either like
loosen or tighten so it's crazy
I would totally use this wall gaming I'm
going to use it at work to definitely
help posture our we referred with search
materials from highly credible sources
like Herman Miller worked closely with
amazing designers physiotherapy and yoga
teachers to create a simple solution for
today's on-the-go generation when your
back feels good everything is better you
will be more confident and healthier
it's all about the strength and
confidence that you carry in your
posture life is not about surviving a
day anymore but to enjoy every moment of
it and now with your support we can
bring the spinal in reality
thank you so much
you
Oh
fun
you
Oh
you
Oh
you
