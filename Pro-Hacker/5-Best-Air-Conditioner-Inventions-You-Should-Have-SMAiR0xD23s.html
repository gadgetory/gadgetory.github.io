production now we need your help to
bring it to your home nowadays there is
something wrong with the market of
climate equipment on the one hand there
are plenty of absolutely inefficient
small devices that don't prevent
suffering from heat on the other hand
there are overpriced bulky solutions
that consume tons of energy
they require complicated maintenance and
to be honest not always provide you with
desired level of comfort I don't know
about you but I would like to have a
device that combines portability of
desktop gadget with efficiency of modern
technology meet next generation of evo
polar smart personal air-conditioner
this multifunctional device cools
humidifies and purifies the air creating
a perfect microclimate around yourself
the report is easy to use as one to
screen fills a water tank adjust the fan
speed enjoy it if a polar walks on
poverty of operation it literally
creates these natural refreshing breeze
one can feel as the Seacoast
and I found their dry hair and skin of a
polar produced moist air taking care of
your house and beauty everybody has
their own temperature of comfort and
optimal humidity level this is
definitely not something that central
air conditioning systems respect also
cooling effect spreads and evenly and
those who are close to an air
conditioner always feel too hot and
others always feel too cold during the
summer season fully air-conditioned
spaces become unbearable and regular
heat waves make it much worse even best
climate systems often can cope and he
needs some extra cooling power
Eva Poehler makes you feel comfortable
in any conditions improving your
productivity and helping you to achieve
more the core technology behind of a
polar is a breeze especially developed
operative metamaterial based on my
neural lattice models this allows a
reporter to be both compact and powerful
unlike traditional materials have a
breeze doesn't contain any organic
elements this prevents bacteria and most
read were always there is no free or
know any other toxic port this makes
have a power technology absolutely safe
to use and eco-friendly thank you

consumes less energy than light saving
bulbs significantly reducing your bills

meet Emily James Ethan and Max they are
a delightful family but they have one
problem their air conditioner is not so
delightful in the summer months when it
is hot and humid outside it takes 15
minutes for the a/c to cool the room in
only another 15 minutes the a/c makes
things way too cold and James is forced
to find other ways to stay comfortable
this frustration continues throughout
the day and into the night as outdoor
temperatures fall conditions in doors
also get cooler which is just fine with
James and Max who like cooler
temperatures but not so great for Emily
not to mention that sometimes finding
the remote itself is a problem until one
day Emily finds out about ambi climate

your a/c just plug it in and it will
deal with your AC for you
