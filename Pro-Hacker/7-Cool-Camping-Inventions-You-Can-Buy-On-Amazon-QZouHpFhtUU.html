life makes a difference we were inspired
to assess illuminate life while we're
graduate students in architecture school
it was two weeks after the 2010
earthquake entities we were looking at
what was being distributed and we saw
that they were distributing medical
supplies and shelters and other types of
supplies but there really wasn't a
lighting product that was being shipped
in volume and we saw that a lightweight
portable light that was rechargeable
could really add a lot of safety comfort
to those victims typically after
disasters the lights go on the
alternatives are something like
flashlights which required batteries and
often times people in certain parts of
the world have to use kerosene lanterns
for candles which are dangerous and our
fire hazards portable floater life like
ours in a life Irvine and a clean and
single
many lake is a compact solar
rechargeable lantern that packs really
small and weighs just a few ounces
there's a solar panel for chargeable
battery and it inflates to diffuse the
light and reduce the glare on your eyes
so if you press the button it provides
over 30 hours of life and then you just
recharge it as a son it's totally
waterproof and it's made of a really
durable and whether it's material we
sell our life all over the world online
and campus tours voters outdoor
recreation with hikers and campers they
love our life because they're super
lightweight they're durable they're easy
to charge contacts to carry and
environmentally friendly
since that first light we've grown our
company and reached tens of thousands of
families across the globe but we're
still just a small group of dedicated
people passionate about working together
to empower people with life besides our
partnerships with NGOs such as UNSC a
shelter Bach and Doctors Without Borders
we are also passionate about other ways
to give so we designed the give light
gal a program which allows so many
supporters to help us make light
accessible to all participants receive
one lumen eight lengths of themselves
and sponsor a light to the family
we've spent more than 20,000 lights to
families in more than 50 countries
across the globe we believe that a
little light can have a huge impact
luminate is proud to help brighten lives
around the world
