life makes a difference we were inspired
to assess illuminate life while we're
graduate students in architecture school
it was two weeks after the 2010
earthquake entities we were looking at
what was being distributed and we saw
that they were distributing medical
supplies and shelters and other types of
supplies but there really wasn't a
lighting product that was being shipped
in volume and we saw that a lightweight
portable light that was rechargeable
could really add a lot of safety comfort
to those victims typically after
disasters the lights go on the
alternatives are something like
flashlights which required batteries and
often times people in certain parts of
the world have to use kerosene lanterns
for candles which are dangerous and our
fire hazards portable floater life like
ours in a life Irvine and a clean and
single
many lake is a compact solar
rechargeable lantern that packs really
small and weighs just a few ounces
there's a solar panel for chargeable
battery and it inflates to diffuse the
light and reduce the glare on your eyes
so if you press the button it provides
over 30 hours of life and then you just
recharge it as a son it's totally
waterproof and it's made of a really
durable and whether it's material we
sell our life all over the world online
and campus tours voters outdoor
recreation with hikers and campers they
love our life because they're super
lightweight they're durable they're easy
to charge contacts to carry and
environmentally friendly
since that first light we've grown our
company and reached tens of thousands of
families across the globe but we're
still just a small group of dedicated
people passionate about working together
to empower people with life besides our
partnerships with NGOs such as UNSC a
shelter Bach and Doctors Without Borders
we are also passionate about other ways
to give so we designed the give light
gal a program which allows so many
supporters to help us make light
accessible to all participants receive
one lumen eight lengths of themselves
and sponsor a light to the family
we've spent more than 20,000 lights to
families in more than 50 countries
across the globe we believe that a
little light can have a huge impact
luminate is proud to help brighten lives
around the world

the highest level filters can be tested
to so we're confident these are the
highest rates of filtration available
the sawyer mini moon harmful bacteria
and protozoa like Giardia and
Cryptosporidium but it won't remove
chemicals and viruses however viruses
are rarely found in the water in North
America and in foreign cities the mini
can be used the following ways attach it
to a so your squeeze pouch and drink
directly from the filter or dispensed
into a water bottle use it as a personal
drinking straw to drink directly from
the source or scoop up a bottle of water
and drink instantly the mini screws

bottle which is great for suspect water
overseas use an inline on a hydration
pack this allows you to fill your
hydration pack directly from the source
and filter water as you're drinking
through the bite valve so your filters
are so robust they can be back washed
with high pressures and reused over and
over again
cleaning the sawyer mini is really
simple you just take the included
cleaning plunger and fill it up with
some filtered water
then take the mini and insert the tip of
the plunger into the end of the filter
opposite of the flow arrow and then
forcibly push the water back through the
mini you repeat this process a couple
times until the water comes are clear
and easy if you have a clean filter if
