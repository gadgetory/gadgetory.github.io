world's first smart camera to defy
gravity the unique stabilized levitation
technology coupled with advanced
wireless resonant charging capability
allows the moon by one ring to not only
endlessly levitate above its stand but
noise ously rotate in any direction with
a simple swipe of your finger
leaving no spot unnoticed we have
equipped the camera with the latest
generation Full HD c MOS sensor with a
pixel area much larger than that of any
ordinary home security solutions
combined with a bright white angle lens
the moon by one ring captures
considerably more light than an average
home monitor camera resulting in
incredibly crisp and clear images even
in dimly lit conditions - built in
precision microphones on each side of
the lens automatically detect the
direction of incoming sound and adjust
the cameras field of view accordingly
making sure it captures every moment we
have also integrated a high quality
loudspeaker and an additional third
microphone for HD noise cancellation so
you'll not only see and hear what
happens around the camera but can also
communicate making the moon by one ring
a natural choice for video calls both at
your home and in your office for over
two years our team has been dedicated to
designing the moon with a single goal in
mind to create the most advanced and
versatile smart home solution in the
world to achieve this we have opted to
combine the major home automation
standards of z-wave zigbee and bluetooth
smart with a beautiful easy to use and
feature-rich camera giving you an
unparalleled flexibility in building or
expanding your very own smart home or
office the moon by one ring has
temperature humidity co2 and light
sensor integrations so it will not only
notify you whenever it's a good time to
let in some fresh air or turn on the
air-conditioner but can share this
information with other smart home
devices
additionally thanks to its integrated IR
blaster the moon by one ring can also
control your legacy appliances like the
air-conditioner stereo system or
television integrating them into your
personal internet of things all of the
crucial electronic components are
integrated directly into the camera so
you can also use it independently from
the base unit the built-in battery
enables up to five hours of autonomous
operation while the USB type-c port
makes charging on-the-go fast and
convenient we've engineered the moon by
one ring as the most sophisticated smart
camera for your home and office support
our project and make the dream of a
truly flexible and easy to use smart
home come one step closer

Nancy Navarro got it also a suture or
the authority Google
GoPro videos are always shaky and
stabilizers out there are too complex
heavy and too big to be mounted anywhere
at new on matter we wanted to create a
solution that was so convenient that it
would become part of your camera
so we developed Clarke the world's
smallest waterproof stabilizer for your
GoPro that stabilizes your camera to
keep it leveled and create amazing
cinematic shots no matter what Clarke is
so small that you don't need to remove
your camera anymore it becomes an
extension of it allowing you to mount it
on the camera mounts you already have
just turn it on with your camera and you
are ready to go
work is a lot more than a stabilizer
it's a real tool with built in moving
time-lapse feature it brings a new way
of creating content and empowering you
to be more creative
developed by engineers and athletes we
went through many iterations of
prototypes to develop a product
optimized for your camera
together let's start a new era in
personal video making so we are now
ready to bring that product to market
but we need your help
so Bacchus today any questions from the
way you create
if you're a new MacBook user you may not
know how lonely this only port feels but
you know how inconvenient it is your
mobile lifestyle can't be limited so we
created Ruby box the ultimate all-in-one
company for your lovely MacBook an
all-in-one from charging to connection
think about how many devices you may use
and how many times you can't find a
power plug when your MacBook is dying
Ruby box charges your MacBook as well as
connecting and powering an incredibly
wide range of devices all-in-one as the
lightest to the size of a notebook movie
box is 56 grams lighter than the
lightest competitor and it's prettier
all-in-one for 4k HDMI display whenever
you need a presentation to gain your
business movie box has your back the 4k
HDMI port for both TV monitor and
protector shows people the best of your
work all in one for power for charging

the SD card slot and USB ports 10
gigabyte per second for the type-c ports
your working files can be copied in a
finger snap port hub plus power bank
all-in-one this is will be box the only
companion your MacBook deserves
so what in the world is ballistic Rd
ography good question
you've probably heard the expression
your heart beats like a drum well forget
it your heart is more creative than that
your heart is jazzy syncopated and
affects everything in your body think of
it as the music of your heart that
inconsistency between the beats it's
called heart rate variability as this
sweet symphony plays on inside you your
body is producing thousands of data
points about your health but until now
you've been missing a maestro to read
the music of your heart and translate it
into meaningful information that can
have a huge impact on your sleeping
habits and your life cue matrix the
first ballistic Rd ography smart madness
that lets you track heart rate
variability in addition to sleep quality
breathing movement stress and sleep
cycles all within an easy-to-read app
traditional sleep trackers rely only on
movement and are less accurate
whereas our sensors were originally used
in the medical field and are so
seamlessly integrated they're
undetectable we created matrix to be the
first smart mattress that measures heart
rate variability because the music that
your heart makes each night has been
deemed by doctors and scientists as one
of the most useful ways to measure your
overall health and fitness levels
factors like stress poor diet and sleep
deprivation decrease heart rate
variability while factors like exercise
reducing alcohol consumption and getting
quality sleep increased heart rate
variability
now tracking all of this information
without losing any sleep is pretty
powerful stuff but we also wanted to
create a mattress that was ridiculously
comfy we spent countless hours testing
and designing the world's smartest
mattress the foundation keeps the spine
aligned throughout the night while the
ply tech foam layer provides an even
level of support to prevent pain from
pesky pressure points traditional memory
foam has a tendency to sleep hot but
we've combined our cooling polar
performance fabric with a top layer of
copper infused phone to regulate your
body temperature relieve joint pain and
promote healthy circulation you wake up
cool comfortable and sweat free while
experiencing the healing benefits of
copper not a morning person maybe you'll
become one with matrix our innovative
smart alarm wakes you in your lightest
phase of sleep allowing you to ditch
that groggy feeling even when you don't
get a full eight hours the app tracks
your sleep quality overtime to make sure
you're not just sleeping but recovering
our team of engineers scientists and UX
designers are committed to helping you
sleep better so that you can make the
most of your days and nights that's why
your mattress and app will keep getting
smarter as the world gets smarter by
integrating with other IOT devices in
your home to join the future of sleep
and increase your productivity and
performance support our IndieGoGo
campaign today because it matrix we want
to power your dreams through smarter
sleep
