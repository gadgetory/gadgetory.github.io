the market of climate equipment on the
one hand there are plenty of absolutely
inefficient small devices that don't
prevent suffering from heat on the other
hand there are overpriced bulky
solutions that consume tons of energy
they require complicated maintenance and
to be honest not always provide you with
desired level of comfort I don't know
about you but I would like to have a
device that combines portability of
desktop gadget with efficiency of modern
technology meet next generation of Eva
polar smart personal air-conditioner
this multifunctional device cools
humidifies and purifies the air creating
a perfect microclimate around yourself
Nepal is easy to use as 1-2-3 fills the
water tank adjust the fan speed enjoy it
Eva Poehler works on power of water
evaporation it literally creates these
natural refreshing breeze one can feel
as the Seacoast and I found their dryer
hair and skin a report produced moist
air taking care of your house and beauty
everybody has their own temperature of
comfort and optimal humidity level this
is definitely not something that central
air conditioning systems respect also
cooling effect spreads and evenly and
those who are close to an air
conditioner always filled to hot and
others always feel too cold during the
summer season fully air-conditioned
spaces become unbearable and regular
heat waves make it much worse even best
climate systems often can cope and you
need some extra cooling power
Eva Poehler makes you feel comfortable
in any conditions improving your
productivity and helping you to achieve
more the core technology behind the
report is a breeze especially developed
operative metamaterial based on minor a
lot of others
this allows a reporter to be both
compact and powerful unlike traditional
materials have a breeze doesn't contain
any organic elements this prevents
bacteria and most read we're always
there is no free or know any other toxic
port this means have a power technology
absolutely safe to use and eco-friendly
thank you however polar is a truly smart
device it consumes less energy than
light saving bulbs significantly
reducing your bills with a variety of
tools for automation smart home
integrations and application control
ever polar will easily become a natural
part of your office or home eka system
we are founders of ever polar here you
go we came to you with the idea of
personal and conditioner we are grateful
for the support of southern bakers who
helped the dream come true we didn't let
you down delivered product in a record
time and now we are ready for the next
chapter of our journey the most valuable
thing for us was your feedback it
allowed us to spread the boundaries of
Climate Technologies even wider in this
new advanced device we believe that
climate technologies are becoming
personal and we invite everybody to join
this revolution and once again thanks
for your support
you
did you know the women are four times
more likely than men to say that recent
sex was unpleasurable in fact studies
have shown that men are twice as likely
to have an orgasm during sex than their
partners we call this the pleasure gap
and we're out to fix it
IVA is the first hands-free strap free
non intrusive control vibrator which a
woman can wear during sex it is unique
design features dynamic wings which tuck
under the labia allowing the vibrator to
stay on top of the clitoris without
getting the way of penetration research
shows the two most important
contributors to women's pleasure and
climax are physical contact like kissing
and touching and control simulation 70%
of women knee control simulation to
orgasm but most vibrators are
distracting or creative barrier during
sex between the partners because even
small hands-free and completely external
it allows you and your partner to keep
the focus on each other
the problem with holding a vibrator
during sex is that it can really get in
the way and detract from the experience
this was just not obtrusive at all it
was like as far as he could tell there
was nothing you know there was nothing
in his way I definitely notice when
she's enjoying herself more and I get a
lot of pleasure out of that I didn't
have to think about holding it down you
know I could focus on my partner and
doing stuff with my partner while also
having that sensation at Dame products
our missions to create phenomenal sex
toys the study of sex has been Alex's
lifelong passion and I'm an established
mechanical engineer who decided if I
want better sex toys I guess a better
making myself with our powers combined
we think we have a unique opportunity to
bring you an original sex toys that fit
the real needs of women and the people
they have sex with
Eva doesn't work like anything else in
the market so it doesn't look like
anything else
we used our fleet of 3d printers to be
able to iterate quickly on form and get
a lot of user feedback to get Eva to the
shape fit and strength that it is today
engineering Eva's wings is an
interesting challenge because they have
to be flexible enough to fit a range of
women and arrange positions but also
sturdy enough to hold the vibrator in
place we selected a small motor with a
powerful kick then gave it three very
distinct speeds from gentle to almost
fifty a day Eva sits in the right place
the vibration is always comfortable if I
had this product I think I would
probably wear it all the time
we believe that innovative designs
commit to better sex and happier couples
that's what we're so excited to bring
you Eva your support will allow us to
order tooling in our first round of
production any additional funds will
enable us to grow as a company and a
brand to bring you even more awesome
products we're just trying to make the
world a happier place one vagina at a
