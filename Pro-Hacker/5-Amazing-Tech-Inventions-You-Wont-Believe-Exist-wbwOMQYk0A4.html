whole new perspective from the palm of
your hand that you're suing her
incredible heights of the waves and
float out of a hot air balloon sharing
breathtaking medals this is Mike
McBurney when we began on micro drone
our aim was to create a small sized
personal drone that was affordable
durable easy to fly that works straight
out of the box a drone for everyone
whether you fly micro drone in extreme
conditions like on a windy beach or in
delicate ones like inside your home with
its precision control flexibility and
durability you can fly it anywhere no
matter your age or flying experience
there's no other drone like it we're
doing really innovative stuff we don't
cut corners waving it for the long run
we launched the first edition micro
drone in 2011 and the feedback was
incredible
we redesigned the second addition around
a modular architecture to support a
unique range of plug and play modules it
received rave reviews in the technical
journals online blogs and even TV shows
these little drones that are like I
think they're awesome man have you seen
the micro drone ship boy yeah that's
probably my favorite one it's incredibly
nimble perfect if you're filming extreme
sports
it is very rugged and if anything did
break its modular design means it's easy
to replace any parts now after two years
we're ready to make micro drone 3.0
micro drone 3.0 is designed with drone
enthusiasts and excellent engineers from
around the world components are easily
expandable upgradable and replaceable
it's also the smallest drone to
currently carry a mechanical gimbal the
HD camera streams live footage to your
smartphone the batteries slide in and
out for quick hot swapping and the plug
and play smart modules simply snap on
with magnets since everything either
snaps or slides in the structure is
sleek aerodynamic and beautiful so now
it's possible using a 3d printer
technology like the old tea maker - you
can print out your own custom frame
similar to the dragon or the wasp I was
super excited when the when the micro
drone team reached out and wanted to
make a first person view drone
technology using the DODOcase VR viewers
very few people could use first-person
view drone technology even a year ago I
mean the fact that the microcurrent team
is making this technology available is
really a revolutionary
we want to make the quintessential drone
the drone market is evolving and
together we can drive the technology
forward we need your support so no
matter who you are we're making sure
that whoever opens the box finds a
simple reliable affordable durable and
fun drone
thank you and we look forward to making
with you the next the one and only micro
drone
I'm Zakir and I want you to be seen meet
I'll slim the world's thinnest Bluetooth
tracker tile slim is as thin as two
credit cards which makes it perfect for
wallets pockets and passports attach it
to anything choose a ringtone with the
tile app and then rest easy knowing you
can always find your things
just ring your laptop and find it fast
if it's your phone that you're looking
for press the button on any of your
tiles and your phone will ring even when
on silent
and if you lose your wallet and it isn't
where you last had it tile can still
help you find it just ask to be notified
when your wallet is found and when any
user in tiles global network comes
within range of your missing wallet the
tile app will notify you of its most
recent location
tile slim the world's thinnest Bluetooth
tracker get tile slim today and never
worry about losing your wallet again
tile find what matters hi we're the team
behind Tico as inventors we constantly
use 3d printers to create and test our
ideas but every 3d printer we used fell
short of our expectations they were
heavy over complicated and unreliable
we often spent more time calibrating our
printers than printing our inventions so
we came up with a simple solution
unibody this is Tico the unibody 3d
printer most 3d printer frames are built
using separate rails unibody means the
rails are built into the chassis
creating one solid piece one solid piece
you in it body and with this simple
shift in design all the problems that
came from separate rail systems
disappeared more reliable and accurate
Tico sets a new standard for 3d printers
and it doesn't stop at unibody Chico has
an internal filament tray and closed
bill chamber auto safety shutoff a large
print volume a flexible base wireless
connectivity and cloud-based software so
you can print from almost anywhere on
any internet friendly device with Tico
we've not only set a new standard for
design but for price too
Tico is only 179 dollars
yup one seven nine that's the beauty of
unibody design it's better and it cost
less to manufacture we could set the
price higher but we want everyone to
have a Tico this is where we need your
help we use 3d printing to create chico
imagine all the ideas that could become
realities imagine what you could build
back us today and let's find out
introducing Robo Ming your personal
robot fellow featuring a cool sleek
design innovative technology and
advanced motion sensor functionality
Robo Ming is not just a robot to play
with it's a buddy that is there when you
need them because our goal to create not
only a robot to play but also friend
something that you will find useful and
in the same time brings a lot of fun
Robo Ming has a built-in module that can
scan and recognize rooms so you can play
around with different voice commands
telling Robo Ming where to go get you it
comes with a lot of features can
recognize its masters voice and will
come when you call avoiding obstacles
along the way
the Robo Ming fellow can give you
different emotional responses by its
movements and lights for example agree
or happy it can use its innovative
camera and motion sensor technology to
take photos
always the helpful companion your
roaming fellow can carry small objects
or play with your pets even when you are
not there monitor what is going on in
your house when you are not at home for
better security it can detect movement
you can always get a live view about
what is happening in your house or in
your office row bombing fellow can
communicate wirelessly via Wi-Fi or
Bluetooth a real conversation piece
roaming fellow will be a hit in your
office as this helpful friend will carry
items from desk to desk
if the battery is running low it will
automatically return to its home
charging spot
it took us a lot of efforts in the last
year to develop all our ideas into what
we've got now working on the visual
design and the technical features have
been a big challenge and we are proud to
bring Robo Ming alive now we want to
bring Robo mean fellow up to this work
and meet a lot of new friends so please
support us and among fellow well serve
you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
