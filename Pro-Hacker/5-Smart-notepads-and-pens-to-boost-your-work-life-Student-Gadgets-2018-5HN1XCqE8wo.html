journal as you want
do you wish there's a way of doing so
without spending a fortune on printing
photos and without ending up with a
messy Journal
we've worked with hundreds of journaling
fans and they all agree on the
limitations of paper journals we tried
dozens of digital journaling apps and
although there are many great apps out
there nothing can compete with a good
old paper journal so we decided to find
out something that can bring the best of
both worlds together and after thousands
of hours of researching and testing
different ideas we came up with rev Oh
journal the journal itself is a
high-quality notebook that comes with a
leather coated hardcover and plain
premium quality paper but what makes Rev
our so special is the Associated mobile
app imagine that you're writing in your
journal about a great trip you made and
on that trip you took hundreds of photos
and you have them on your mobile so you
use the Rev oh a pan the code on the
journal page and attach all those photos
and videos then any time you're going
through your journal and you want to see
those photos you just open the Rev Oh
app and scan the code again and you will
see all of those photos and videos one
of the difficulties we always faced with
paper journals is searching through all
those journals to find something we were
previously with the attach keyword
functionality rev o allows to add
multiple keywords to the page you wrote
and then anytime you're looking for
something you just search for that
keyword in the rev up and you will get
to know in which journal and on which
page you will find what you're looking
for I built software and mobile apps for
living and I've been building computer
software for almost two the key
and to bring revel to life I partnered
with building a logistic partners with
many years of experience to make sure
that you get your River on time and get
it with the highest quality and in order
to do production at volume prices I need
your help by getting as many backers as
possible I'll be able to make repo a
reality and put it out to the world
where many journalling enthusiasts can
benefit from it by plunging to this
project not only will you be getting
your own rev o at exceptional prices but
also you will be participating as a
founding member in bringing this
disruptive idea to life and be among the
first in the world to use it thank you
did you know that 65% of people around
the world are visual thinkers people who
love to write and sketch and make notes
we seek the simplest possible way to
plan our lives but haven't figured out
how to put events from our paper
planners into digital calendars while
searching for the best visual way to
plan we chose the circular diagram
because it looks like a clock face and
it takes less effort to focus on what's
going to happen and when it's going to
happen
so we designed the slice planner the
undated handcrafted paper planner made
from all natural materials and premium
Swedish paper and developed an app that
merges paper events with your favorite
digital calendars how would you like a
paper planner that enables reminders
invites and locations synched on all
your devices that's what the app does
it's easy to use and it's powered by
Google Cloud vision for optical
character recognition like that even if
someone just scheduled a meeting in your
digital calendar but you don't want to
merge your events from a physical
planner into it we've got you covered
our app has an augmented reality mode
that shows whether you have any
conflicts and events so that you can
resolve them after all there's only one
you you can't be in two places at once
whether used as a stand-alone planner
with various designs or together with
our app slice planner would provide
flexibility that wasn't there before
for thousands of years humans have been
filling their notebooks and then just
buying more see the notebook industry
has given up on innovation hey what's
this
the notebook Hemingway wrote on that's
cool I guess we're from rocket book and
we make notebooks from the future at
rocket book we are already famous for
inventing the wave notebook the smart
notebook that can be erased in the
microwave we've shipped 100,000 waves to
satisfied customers around the world
others may stop there but we're maniacs
obsessed with blending old fashioned
notebooks with future and awesome so
we've spent a year in the rocket lab
designing a new notebook that feels like
pen and paper but is endlessly reusable
and completely integrated with your
digital lifestyle
introducing the Everlast notebook from
rocket book the Everlast brings cloud
scalability to pen and paper simply
write scan and erase imagine 1000 of
your favorite notebooks in one sleek
design that fits in your backpack here's
how it works
Everlast pages look and feel like paper
but they're actually constructed from a
polyester composite rather than would
you write on the Everlast
using any pen from the pilot FriXion
line which are available in-store and
online writing on the Everlast feels
perfectly natural and smooth and as the
ink dries it forms a complete bond to
the polyester page so it won't rub off
but what makes this formulation so
unique is that each page can be wiped
completely clean with a moist towel so
it can be used over and over and over
again the ever last notebook is also
compatible with the rocket book app so
before you wipe your notes off the page
you can blast them online to your
favorite cloud services
in a fraction of a second rocket book
machine vision scans enhances and sends
each page to the specific destination
they belong on the cloud services you
already use each Everlast notebook page
has seven symbols set up the rocket book
app to assign each symbol to a location
within Dropbox Google Docs Evernote or
many other services you could configure
your diamond to send meeting notes
directly to your shared team folder in
Dropbox or students could configure
their star symbol to send notes right to
a math folder in Google Drive so you can
make your list break out that diagram or
color in that drawing then tomorrow
start your day with a brand new notebook
with the ever last one notebook becomes
one thousand notebooks the utility of
the cloud and the joy of pen and paper
that's rocket book</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
