there don't you know that plastic straws
are bad for the environment what is this
oh if you're gonna suck suck on this
this is final straw the world's first
collapsible reusable totally badass draw
straws are supposed to be convenient
right so we decided to do something
about it this is final straw final straw
folds up to the size of a car key and
fits in this sexy case final straw is
small enough to fit in your purse or
pocket but if you don't have pockets you
can just uh-oh where'd it go if you can
remember your keys when you leave the
house you'll remember your straw it fits
on your keychain so there's no way
you're gonna leave it in your car and
there's no need to worry about keeping
it clean included in each straw is a
specially-designed squeegee simply pull
it through the straw to make sure it's
squeaky clean
final straw is BPA free dishwasher safe
and with our patented design the ends
are soft so it's safe for human children
and their adults there you go little
buddy this straw may seem small but
because of its size it's actually very
harmful to the environment
straws can't be recycled so they're
often left here in the ocean where they
hurt and kill my friends in the sea Rico
go be free since you've hit play on this
video we've discarded this many straws
in the US alone pretty bad right
included in each straw are some of these
little cards next time you're at a
restaurant leave one with the bill and
let them know to only serve straws upon
request there's a movement happening and
you can be at the front of it together
we can make a really big impact and save
our oceans one straw at a time this is
final straw suck responsibly
you take beautiful images of everything
Sunday's breakfast
Monday's breakfast Fido's breakfast but
when someone enters your home the image
you get is this when it really matters
you need a really good security camera
neat nest cam IQ it doesn't just see
incredibly well it's got serious brain
power so we can tell the difference
between your dog and your dog walker
then nest cam IQ will zoom in and follow
the action for you and with Nestor we're
nest cam IQ gets even smarter with face
recognition so you can get an alert if
someone's there who shouldn't be or if
your kids just came home from school it
also has HD talk and listen
so they'll hear you loud and clear with
nest cam IQ looking out for what matters
you can get back to doing the things you
truly love nest cam IQ the security
camera that outsmarts
other security cameras
if you always snore loudly I'll make
choking noises while you sleep
or you have morning headaches and don't
feel rested after sleeping if you have
excessive sleepiness I believe that you
have sleep apnea what this means is that
your heart and other vital organs become
starved of oxygen that can lead to a lot
of health problems normally you will
need a series of tests and an overnight
sleep study in a sleep clinic go to
sleep is the new way to monitor your
sleep and screen sleep apnea to use go
to sleep all you need to do is put it on
before you go to sleep at night and take
it off when you wake up in the morning
it's the smallest home sleep test device
on the market it weighs only about six
grams and looks like a capsule held in a
soft silicon ring the battery can last
three whole nights and the memory can
record seven nights sleep data
go to sleep keeps a track of your blood
oxygen saturation heart rate perfusion
index tossing and turning during your
sleep and you will get whole night of
sleep monitor to test the severity of
your sleep apnea it was fascinating to
see such a detailed analysis of my sleep
pattern I've always had a snoring
problem but I didn't know my blood
oxygen levels dropped from 96 to 80 to
20 times in an hour
which was really scary but this could
change it all sleep apnea can come with
a range of clinical issues such as
feeling constantly sleepy in the daytime
fatigue and high blood pressure stroke
and heart attacks in rhythm years and
diabetes all this can seriously weaken
the immune system a classic sleep apnea
patient that we think of is an
overweight man with a large belly and a
thick neck however it can affect anyone
9% of women and 24% of men suffer from
sleep apnea unfortunately over 80% go
undiagnosed and untreated the condition
really needs long-term management go to
sleep provides continuous data instead
of just a snapshots that clinical
monitoring provides by continuously
collecting and mining your sleep data
the correlation of some chronic disease
with your sleep quality can be revealed
I've gone from wearing all this at night
to this tiny little ring I just
literally put it on at night wake up in
the morning check the app and it's all
done cannot believe it I really want to
get one use go to sleep every night to
get a better night's rest and to improve
your overall sleep health and lifestyle
