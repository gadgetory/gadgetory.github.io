hey Mycroft what time is it 3:15 p.m.
and all the things you would expect from
a voice assistant things like whether
it's 78 degrees and sunny calendar you
have a 10 a.m.
team meeting and conversions there are
three teaspoons in a tablespoon a
computer remind me to get my winter
clothes out of storage other voice
assistants can use your conversations to
sell your data and send you ads Mycroft
never sells your data or send you ads
the new screen is great for features
like setting multiple timers hey Mycroft
you've sent another timer for 10 minutes
second time I started nailed it

customized widgets choose your wakeup

multiple systems in your home with a
single command hey Minecraft it's game

help with that our open source community
is expanding the capability of the mark
to supporting things like Roku and other
devices mycroft private custom open
hello I'm Joshua Montgomery the CEO of
Mycroft AI in 2015 we launched the
world's first open-source voice
assistant right here on Kickstarter in
July we delivered the mark 1 to backers
in 56 countries and 38 states the
software that we built for the mark 1
now runs anywhere you can download and
run it on the linux desktop or the
Raspberry Pi this is the first step
towards our larger goal an artificial
intelligence that runs anywhere and
interacts exactly like a person an AI
that understands context can communicate
naturally and hold a complete
conversation with our second Kickstarter
we're looking to expand the community
and work with them to build software
that allows you to voice enable anything
software that's customizable and lets
you rename the assistant and change its
personality and appearance to fit you
the mark 2 uses an advanced microphone
array so it can hear at long distances
even when music is prey we've also added
a screen so you can see things like
calendar entries timers even security
camera feeds to bring the mark 2 to life
we need your help we need to invest in
tooling optimize our design for
manufacturing and continue to improve
the software that's why we're asking for
your support we need you to help us
bring an open transparent privacy minded
intelligent personal assistant to life
you can begin helping us now by going to
voice stop Mycroft I and donating your
voice installing minecraft on your
Raspberry Pi or backing our Kickstarter
