attack because there are tiny hidden
cameras watching and recording us all
the time everywhere even in our most
intimate moments without our knowledge
these tiny cameras are found all the
time in dressing rooms hotel rooms
public bathrooms apartments locker rooms
and places you didn't think possible the
spy Finder Pro puts an end to concerns
of privacy invasion by instantly
uncovering all hidden camera lenses
which are spying on you this easy-to-use
pocket-sized detector can go along with
you anywhere to use the spy finder Pro
look through the viewfinder while
pushing the button on top to activate
the 6 super-bright LED strobe lights
these special red lights are
specifically engineered to bounce off of
the reflective surface which all camera
lenses have no matter how big or small
they may be now with maxy boost
technology there are three LED intensity
modes that allow you to better control
and hone in on the area you are sweeping
high is best for larger rooms and Open
Office or living spaces and blow is best
for smaller rooms bathrooms dressing
rooms and shiny surfaces such as plastic
or glass in a slow sweeping motion scan
the room looking at all surfaces until
you are confident the room is clean and
free from potential hidden cameras even
if the camera is turned off you'll
clearly see that the camera lens is
blinking back with you up to 45 feet
away Buddhist stops the invasion of your
privacy of the forest funds get your spy
finder pro now well isn't it about time
someone thought of this the security
camera for your home makes sense which
got us thinking would it be nice if we
could take that idea and hit the road
that's how we came to build the first
security camera for the car we call it
al
owl has a forward facing camera and an
inside facing camera
owls cameras are always on an owl is
connected to its cloud service 24/7 by a
fast reliable 4G internet connection
just like your phone which means you can
check on your car with live video
streaming anywhere any time an owl
sensors let you know immediately if
something happens to your car and sends
you an alert with an instant video clip
report
and here are a few other cool things
about Elle owl is always on even when
your cars off it's very presence and
it's pulsing security beacon keeps away
the lurkers and the sticky-fingered and
since owl is always recording the
cameras will be rolling even during
traffic stops owl protects you from
contentious crashes because the camera
never lies
I'm like that guy that were in the
intersection and since whatever does
happen is recorded you can go back and
check it out later whether it's the
weird the wonderful or the outrageous it
all happens all around us when we're
driving and owl captures it all when you
see something you want to share just say
okay presto an owl will send the clip
right to your phone owl sets up in about
five minutes
with just a few simple steps and all
video is protected so no one except you
can get to your video unless you choose
to share it so that's out the world's
first security camera for the car now
get out there and see what you'll catch
on
owl
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
