you
meet I'd Oh
what can I do you today
Ida was a part of your family good
morning he's an intelligent capable and
affordable companion he can do just
about anything
the help you've always wanted a handyman
a teacher
a friend he's perfect in every way he
can be just about anyone
a care
a home made gray
he's a personal Butler who's trustworthy
he is whatever you want him to be
I started off as an idea to make
cutting-edge robotics friendly and
useful to the home while being
affordable I have been overwhelmed by
all the love and recognition I've
received so far now I need your help and
support that make me really great adopt
me as your new companion at home idle
from engine dynamometer home this is
Khoa robot r1 a fully autonomous smart
suitcase that follows its user while
avoiding any obstacles in its path the
coma system is the brains of the r1 in
charge of sensing the environment
planning reasonable paths and avoiding
obstacles all while following its user
the sensing ability of the coma system
is made possible by multi sensor fusion
technology
which is mainly based on a set of sonars
a depth sensor coai and cliff detect
sensors that allow our one to avoid
stairs and other dangerous drop-offs a
customized bracelet will be provided
with each r1 the como system ensures
that r1 rolls along within an arm's
length distance to the bracelet on the
user at all times
a pair of active wheel units where they
retract will design similar to aircraft
landing gears propels the suitcase
forward point both wheel units deploy
the active wheel units will retract as
soon as you touch the handle switching
our one from autonomous mode to manual
mode r1 follows at a maximum speed of
4.5 miles per hour sufficient for most
daily needs the wheel units are powerful
enough to tackle any and all kinds
terrain co-starred intelligent walk will
automatically lock its own to ensure
your valuables remains in
a simple DoubleTap on your bracelet to
activate the find me function and r1
will intelligently plan around to make
its way back to you with the code smart
intelligent lock proximity alarm and
embedded GPS your belongings are
guaranteed to be safe the coast Mart
intelligent lock also integrates ATS a
lock and a traditional combination lock
which ensures that luggage lock tsa
approved and can function properly even
without the power supply the proximity
alarm will notify you if your luggage
leaves your area if you accidentally
lose or misplace your luggage don't
worry with the onboard GPS you can
easily find its location on your app our
one uses the 96.5 one our portable power
bank has its power source you can easily
charge devices directly from the power
bank or integrated USB ports for
on-the-go charging if the power bank is
plugged in with a suitcase the power
bank is easily removable making airport
security checks a breeze the front
storage space allows for one-click
access to remove electronics during
airport security checkpoints without
having to repack your back while the
spacious main compartment is perfect for
the compact storage of other traveling
systems
wherever you go whatever you do r1 will
be with you every step of the way
co-op r1 make travel less of a drag
starting a business nowadays is easy
everyone has great ideas but sometimes
it takes a lot of repetitive work to
realize them this is where do bot m1
gets in do bot m1 is an industrial level
robotic arm production platform it's
precise fast and extendable and also
affordable it can be your 3d printer
laser engraver soldering machine or
whatever else you build upon it yes you
can build one do bot m1 has 0.02
millimeters repeatability and 1.5
kilogram payload with these standardized
easy to change heads you can easily turn
this power into productivity like 3d
printing it can print your product with
fluency and details to colors no problem
or use laser to engrave your unfading
masterpiece or do sophisticated
soldering customizing your PCB circuit
board better than a pro besides being
multifunctional do bottom one is also
easy to master and develop doo-bot m1
supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connection
you can connect to multiple arms at once
and control them via our app on PC or
smartphone with a force-sensitive 3d
mouse you can control do bot m1 as
precisely as you want no more trying and
guessing on a confusing software with
its hand whole teaching feature you can
input coordinates in the fastest and
most intuitive way
do bottom one is programmable via the
integrated api's you can use official or
self built developing environment or use
this visualized programming interface
making things a lot easier but we don't
stop here do bottom one is highly
extendable there are no limits to your
imagination on it the maximum reach of
do bottom one is 400 millimeters which
is enough for most of the situations but
why don't we think bigger when it can
actually go further or use a camera for
visual with it's fast and accurate image
recognizing algorithm it can distinguish
colors without making one mistake do
bottom one loves companions they can
work seamlessly together processing
paperwork way faster than humans could
ultimately do bottom one is built to
replace manpower and production line
working day and night non-stop the
built-in mapping and path planning
system provides this excellent mobility
providing inventory management service
in your warehouse to be able to create
so much value to bottom one has been
built with extraordinary performance the
perfect calibration of the high
performance DC servomotor
harmonic reducer and kinematic algorithm
has brought out the best of both
strength and speed repeatability of 0.02
millimeters maximum payload of up to 1.5
kilograms angular speed of up to 200
degrees per second it's also a steady
player never slips up
everyone loves creating things and
having a robotic arm is awesome with do
bottom one it's no longer a giant
business's privilege to use professional
robotic arms everyone can now benefit
from a cost-effective user-friendly
robotic arm technology so when a new
idea hits you do bot m1 will be ready
all you have to do is say yes
marry Megan sent a new photo would you'd
like to look at it yes please who he's a
gem would you like to respond to Megan
