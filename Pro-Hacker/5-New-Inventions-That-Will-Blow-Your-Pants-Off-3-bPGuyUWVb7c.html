including four items flooded and warming
it up with a heater heating has always
been regarded as a domed utility some
people may have chemists at in their
home but after programming it once must
forget about it and never touch it again
these natives realized that a thermostat
is a widely unloved product and we
decided to change it
so we tried out different prototypes in
order to come up with the best design
the one is simple elegant and practical
we presented our cross prototypes to the
people and asked for their feedback and
direction was wow what is it people find
it really fresh
illusion consists of smartphone app for
iOS and Android devices central unit or
a bridge and thermostats
one for each room so how it works the
information about desired temperature
gives from smartphone to central unit
that disturbs the signal to every room
equipped with ecozy thermostat you can
SAP the precise temperature for every
room and ecozy will remember it with eco
Z there is no need to hit up an empty
home whenever you are on the vacation or
on a business trip so you greatly save
on your energy bill EKOS a hidden
solution installation is so easy that
you can do it on your own the most
responsible but let easy is because a
thermostat installation approach your
water radiator take off the old
terrorist possibly you would need some
additional instruments to do this take
one eco Zotero set out of your starter
kit and tightly attach it to your water
idiot switch it on it should find the
Eco central unit that should be
previously connected to your Wi-Fi
now said the West temperature pressing
on the lab to set the temperature down
and I'm on the right to heat it up once
you decided on the West temperature the
thermostat will remember it you can
change end time manually or remotely
through the app now proceed to other
rooms and follow the same easy steps
the idea of intelligent thermostat is to
help users save energy and thus the
money through much smarter home heating
system the coolest thing about a cozy
and that it does exactly that without
compromising unfortune allottee design
or comfort finally thanks to e cozy
there's an intelligent solution a
solution which empowers the consumer
saves energy that looks real great a
truly modern solution for the modern
times
dear bakers we arrive in France to bring
a cozy into the mass production who's a
help we can make it much faster and you
can really help us to take a step
forward thank you so much for watching
this video and for supporting cuisine
spread the word on social networks and
remember easy home only isn't it
here we go
I miss my childhood those days when I
could paint without a care in the world
I don't know when life got so busy I
just don't paint anymore there's never
any time then I found just what I needed
to relive my passion the vivid color
sheets a tiny booklet of 16 of the
hybrid transparent watercolors which
easily open into a full palette they dry
instantly and are so tiny that I can
safely carry them around in my purse and
the best part is that I can paint
anywhere inspiration strikes in the park
over a cup of coffee or even in the
subway while traveling to the office
it's not easy the colors mix beautifully
and they are highly saturated so that
you just need a little bit for a rich
stroke
so one set goes on for several paintings
it's amazing to relive all those
childhood memories once in a while but
without all that mess vivid color sheets
paint anywhere hello IndieGoGo I'm
Aditya the founder of the vive colors
I'm attorney and medical student
studying in Mumbai I've always been
passionate about painting but ever since
I joined med school
these big fat books have made sure that
I do thing to be honest I'd still do it
if only I had the colors in me that I
wish to paint it is just so inconvenient
to carry the colors the half pans tubes
ballets and the bottles and so to fix
this I developed the Reviva color shifts
I've been working on these colors for
the last two years now trying to get
them just right as you see they're
specially formulated so that they're dry
but are still easy to pick with a wet
brush let me quickly show you how they
work
all I have to do is wet my brush a
little bit pick the color and that's it
you get this rich vivid color on paper
it's literally that easy so in these
last two years I sampled about 200
products to artists across the world and
based on their feedback went through
different iterations improving design
after design and I'm proud to present to
you the final and the best Reviva color
sheets
this is a set of 16 transparent
watercolors which are specifically
chosen for urban and outdoor buildings
they are indexed at the bottom which
helps navigate quickly and easily
between pages the shade between two
colors is specially formulated so that
it repels water and prevents them from
sticking and one final thing I've made
this really beautiful premium wooden
case for the color sheets which you can
personalize mine scribing your name and
a message or a quote which makes it a
great gift idea by the way and
especially for your folks you can unlock
this reward for free by simply sharing
this campaign on social media as you saw
the product is ready for production now
all I need is to buy the raw materials
in bulk to get the right price which is
where I need your help so please support
this campaign and we live the childhood
joy of
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
