future clothing these shirts were
created within minutes with a new spray

sprayed the solvent evaporates and
allows the material to harden just like
existing fabrics the material can be
washed and reward but it can also
quickly be transformed into a new
clothing item the material M sells after

the same solvent andrea spray again and
again
