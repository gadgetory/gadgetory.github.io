you
breathing is the most natural and
important thing we do and every day
almost 3000 gallons of inner fill our
lungs air is everywhere where we live
where we work where we sleep but do you
really know what's in the air you
breathe you might think that pollution
is only on the side but it's the
complete opposite many studies have
proved that indoor air is up to five
times more polluted than outdoor air
this is why we created Theory Cleary is
the most amazing natural air purifier
powered by real plants that helps people
in reducing indoor air pollution and it
will be the best design object you will
have ever have on the market right now
there are only traditional electronic
air purifiers made in plastic very ugly
big and bulky and in early where thanks
to filters this is why we thought about
something revolutionary and we created
the perfect synergy between nature
technology and design so how does Clery
work we designed a smart flower pot that
amplifies the natural properties of fans
our idea started from a research of NASA
they found out that some plants have got
the ability to eliminate toxication
the problem is that a single plant isn't
that effective so we created a
technology unit that allows more air
flow through the soil and the roots this
is where the filtration happens we use
plants as biofilters roots and soil
generate colonies of microorganism that
trap and filter the toxic agents in year
in a natural way clear in fact filters
93% of toxic agents immediately it's
very silent and has a very low energy
consumption less than 50% of an LED bulb
you can manage it with your smartphone
and the best thing is that there are no
filters so you don't have to change them
in waste money what happens inside is
not magic but a scientific fact and we
proved it we did many researchers and
prove the effectiveness of Clery at
Limburg one of the most important
research labs on plants in europe and
peanut a spin-off of the University of
Florence based in Italy Cleary is also
proudly an Italian design product we
work hard for a year to design it in
every
we developed multiple sketches and
prototypes to make the design perfect we
presented it at CES 2016 and had great
success we have a super team with two
brilliant industrial designers and a
great advisor team that helps us Italy
has a long tradition of craftsmen
especially in the ceramic field this
Italian culture is an inspiration for us
we use a ceramic first for the statical
quality but mostly because it's
eco-friendly and it doesn't release any
toxic agents in the air obviously we
also work really hard on the technology
part of our product we came to the
Silicon Valley to make something really
powerful we've developed our technology
working close with engineers and
manufacturers in the Silicon Valley to
improve the functionalities of Clery
thanks to our technology unit in our
smartphone app with health and air
quality sensors clear is able to track
the toxic agent in the air and give you
real-time pollution intelligence
analytics of it and also temperature in
humidity monitoring Clarey

revolutionary power bank that combines

have to carry every day when we started
to think about the cube we look at the
existing technology Ilana
and we quickly noticed that most of the
available devices were not complete and
what he was a friend
together with fear our head designer we
developed the cube we went through
several prototypes to find the best
design community a designer the elegans
compact and practically it was so
challenging with all those
functionalities together into a small
and cool design with a significant
battery capacity it was something that
had never been done but we made it and
we're so proud and excited to bring it
to you cube is the world's first compact
and lightweight device that combines the
functions of a power bank a memory
storage and a sinking quick charging
cable you'll also agree it's one of the
