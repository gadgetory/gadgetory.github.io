glory people
I've looked away for visionaries
bhim used to a thousand artists
the powerful found piece the people I've
moved have changed the world
and walk the road announced address
for more than a century
I've watched and witnessed people emerge
into the light of a new day
we began to move together
turning waters into what's next we
imagined the future
and made history
those who pursue perfection forge their
own birth and this journey has just
begun welcome for the next 100 are you
ready
you
please go ahead

Alesi pro the concept car from the
company now it's going to be electric
it'll have autonomous capabilities in
fact when you put an autonomous mode the
steering wheel disappears into the dash
like magic eventually you'll be able to
share this vehicle with other drivers so
it's like a sharing process where a
bunch of people buy the car and then use
it when they need it most likely when
you're confusing the autonomous features
because if you're the only person with
an autonomous car it still sit in the
garage about 90 percent of time

Integra Thomas good so step yo bizarre
Anika tiara modern are hazardous design
is all about connecting people but
technology kind of overtaking the world
we try to connect people with technology
and design
with fun be the project came about is
the future scenario project look at a
vehicle that's maybe twenty years out
full of that encompass you know will
that look like how to integrate
potential technology in the future into
a vehicle today
you think physical connection is very
important so this vehicle allows you to
be connected constantly with whomever
you want in the past it was very
physical it's just a vehicle physically
you know it'll take us from point A to
point B we came up with a scenario of
the future the most important thing we
felt is the connection between the
driver and the car
that's where fun became what could be
more flexible on the vehicle and I did
without it the digital skin both inside
and out typically today you buy a car
that's red it stays red forever until
you go to the paint shop in this case we
can change color
maybe there's messages like to be sent
as you're driving digital skin
technology will help the driver to
really show off the personality pure
expression there are times that you just
want to relax maybe in heavy gridlock
and use that time to do some of the
stuff that you can do without having
your hands on the wheels maybe enjoyed a
nice periodical connect with your
friends or a family but then also to
provide an experience where if you do
want to drive you can it's a fun
experience
the funby is TV has a little motors
that's exist today and that's what
innovation is about integrating all
those kind of geek technologies and make
it possible for the near future it's a
combination and balance of digital
expression and physical exertion
what you feel is the key thing in future
silent
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
