window is dirty and you can't reach it
you can try to climb up a high ladder or
you can take a walk on the roof or
simply use the glider the glider is a
simple perfect solution to clean the
outside of windows when there's no easy
access to them
the glider is equipped with a powerful
magnet and comes in three models
designed for window thickness from 4 to
28 millimeters the uniqueness of the
glider lies in its ability to spread the
cleaning liquid from the part of the
window that's nearest to you across the
entire window
the glider washes the dirt off both
sides of the window at the same time the
glider has four wipers layered in a
perfect way to pull the liquid across
the glass leaving it clean dry and
shining the microfiber cloth can then be
used to wipe off any remaining streaks
on the window after the gliders
operation for safety close your window
on the white string or where the
security ring the glider is part of a
line of prestigious cleaning tools from
T roller a leader in the market for over
25 years
the single-use plastics Razia just right
there don't you know that plastic straws
are bad for the environment what is this
if you're gonna suck suck on this this
is final straw the world's first
collapsible reusable totally badass draw
straws are supposed to be convenient
right so we decided to do something
about it this is final straw final straw
folds up to the size of a car key and
fits in this sexy case final straw is
small enough to fit in your purse or
pocket but if you don't have pockets you
can just uh-oh where'd it go if you can
remember your keys when you leave the
house you'll remember your straw it fits
on your keychain so there's no way
you're gonna leave it in your car and
there's no need to worry about keeping
it clean included in each straw is a
specially-designed squeegee simply pull
it through the straw to make sure it's
squeaky clean
final straw is BPA free dishwasher safe
and with our patented design the ends
are soft so it's safe for human children
and their adults there you go little
buddy this straw may seem small but
because of its size it's actually very
harmful to the environment
straws can't be recycled so they're
often left here in the ocean where they
hurt and kill my friends in the sea
thank ou go be free
since you've hit play on this video
we've discarded this many straws in the
US alone pretty bad right included in
each straw are some of these little
cards next time you're at a restaurant
leave one with the bill and let them
know to only serve straws upon request
there's a movement happening and you can
be at the front of it together we can
make a really big impact and save our
oceans one straw at a time this is final
straw suck responsibly
