hello my name is Kirk kjellberg and i'm
here today to speak to you about the
pistol that i invented called the ideal
concealed we're here not only to address
the functions of the pistol but also to
address some of the negative critiques
we've been receiving so i have the
pistol with me or at least
representative of it this is a plastic
model to demonstrate the size it is
approximately the size of a galaxy s
selling with a protective case and what
will happen when you go to use it
there's a spring-loaded safety you know
this again is a model so it's not going
to operate correctly but you'll depress
this safety and this handle
spring-loaded load the toy itself and
snap open at that time you'll be ready
to defend yourself to reload or low the
pistol it's very simply a Derringer it's
a two-shot derringer so there's only two
bullets second going here at a time and
then you close that up and to return it
to its safe mode that also disconnects
the safety mechanisms on the inside the
reason for this pistol is because a lot
of folks are finding the need to carry a
gun with them to feel protected in
today's environment for me I have my
permit to carry and only because I do
sell real estate and so I am traveling
in a lot of different remote areas
throughout North Dakota as well as
Minnesota and so I like to be able to
have a pistol with me at all times
sometimes the holsters whether it be in
your lower back or whether it be in your
boot I like the ideal conceal because I
can put it right on my side it looks
like they were so full with me everyone
seen the news incidents where random
violence just breaks out around you and
you can't find the time to wait for the
police for it to be solved and a lot of
people are having to do things
themselves to protect themselves one of
the other comments that we've been
receiving is how this will make things
more difficult for police knowing if
you're holding a cell phone at them or a
pistol and again
I think it's our responsibility to act
responsibly and respectfully towards
police if you're in an interaction with
police officers you know don't reach for
things make sure they know where your
hands are act accordingly I mean I've
been pulled over before and when I get
pulled over I roll my window down I put
my hands on my steering wheel and I wait
for the officer to approach and then I
let them know that I'm going to be
reaching into my glove box and I also
let them know that I have a pistol and a
carry permit so that they know a lot of
law enforcement folks are interested in
having this gun has a backup some folks
has a primary if they're an undercover
work we have a protective agency that
wants them we have some government
agencies that are interested in them
this is a four-year safety and for your
self defense I highly doubt you'll see
it used in any criminal capacity and I
wanted to bring that up as well one of
the things about this gun and why it is
safe is when it is in its latched
position the safeties are in place so it
can't be fired it can't be fired in its
closed position and even if you drop it
the firing pins can't go off secondly
I've had a lot of concerns from people
about this be coming in contact with
children and maybe I'm starting to get a
little bit old but in my time it was our
responsibility to keep things away from
children and if you can't keep a gun
away from children you probably
shouldn't have a gun we firmly believe
in personal responsibility and the mark
I have a pistol at home I don't leave my
pistol laying on my counter on my
kitchen table either I make sure that I
always have that now in a safe spot you
have to treat this was a regular it's
done because that is what it is you
can't just let it lay out in the public
just because it looks like shuffle I
mean I am a mom again and I don't want
something to happen to me when I'm out
showing property a lot of times I take
people with me as a second person for
safety reasons but sometimes it's just
not possible so that i do feel protected
by having that you never know exactly
when you're going to need it i also want
to make sure folks understand that this
is not representative of quality that we
will be selling in the end the polymer
case will be very well finished the fit
and finish the lines would be very tight
it's going to be quality manufactured
will have a lifetime warranty so you can
feel comfortable buying this gun and
know that it will perform for you we
we'll shoot it approximately 500 times
in the prototype phase before it goes to
production to make sure that everything
fires without malfunctioning and that
everything is working appropriately we
really believe in safety first
