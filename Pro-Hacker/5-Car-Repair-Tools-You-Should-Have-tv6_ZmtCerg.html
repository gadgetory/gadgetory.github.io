closer look at this light let's check
out the full line of lights offered by

some what features you probably never
even knew existed plus lights like these

and doesn't take up much space
plus it has a swiveling magnetic base to
help direct at 200 lumens of light
there's the palm light that will run for
up to eight hours making it a good light

these lights is also perfect when you're

spotlight which is a water-resistant
housing so beyond the typical uses it's
also good to carry in your boat now
let's take a look at the under hood
light when you're working on a car you
know how hard it is to get enough light
so you can really see well we've all
tried these old drop lights they're
never nearly bright enough and they
don't light up a big enough area and
when you hang them up what happens it
just shines right into the bottom of the
hood and if you hold the light so you
can aim it and really see what you're
doing now you can only work with one
hand and have you ever tried this
holding it with your chin so you can try
to aim it and then have both hands to
work with plus the cord wit runs all
over your fender and scratches your
paint not to mention the fact that these
lights get really hot and they can burn
you or worse your interior well we've
got the solution with the Eastwood
professional folding LED light it
stretches from 48 all the way to 68
inches so it'll fit everything from a
small car to a large truck it puts out
fourteen hundred lumens that's twice as
much as a common LED
look how bright this is and I've got
both hands-free to do work the pads
protect the paint and I'll have a drop
cord scratching the side of my car you
can use it under your car or even to see
when you're working in the interior it
even makes a nice shop light over your
workbench plus with this light the
center section folds 180 degrees so you
can really angle the light where you
want it in fact each tube rotates 180
degrees which really allows you to aim
the light exactly where you need to see
whether it's under the hood or in the
interior it will operate for three hours
on the low setting and one and a half
hours on the high setting giving you the
light you need to do the job right plus
it only takes six hours to fully charge
and you can even operate the light while
it's charging so no matter what your
lighting needs are from the home garage
camping business or even just to keeping
your car in case of an emergency
