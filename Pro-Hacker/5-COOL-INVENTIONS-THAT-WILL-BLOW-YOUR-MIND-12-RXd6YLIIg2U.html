the market of climate equipment on the
one hand there are plenty of absolutely
inefficient small devices that don't
prevent suffering from heat on the other
hand there are overpriced bulky
solutions that consume tons of energy
they require complicated maintenance and
to be honest not always provide you with
desired level of comfort I don't know
about you but I would like to have a
device that combines portability of
desktop gadget with efficiency of modern
technology meet next generation of Eva
polar smart personal air-conditioner
this multifunctional device cools
humidifies and purifies the air creating
a perfect microclimate around yourself
the report is easy to use as 1-2-3 fills
the water tank
adjust the fan speed enjoy it Eva
Poehler works on power of water
evaporation it literally creates these
natural refreshing breeze one can feel
as the sea coast and I found there dry
hair and skin a reporter produced moist
air taking care of your house and beauty
everybody has their own temperature of
comfort and optimal humidity level this
is definitely not something that central
air conditioning systems respect also
cooling effect spreads and evenly and
those who are close to an air
conditioner always feel too hot and
others always feel too cold during the
summer season fully air-conditioned
spaces become unbearable and regular
heat waves make it much worse even best
climate systems often can cope and you
need some extra cooling power
Eva Poehler makes you feel comfortable
in any conditions improving your
productivity and helping you to achieve
more the core technology behind the
report is a breeze especially developed
operative metamaterial based on minor a
lot of others
this allows a reporter to be both
compact and powerful unlike traditional
materials have a breeze doesn't contain
any organic elements this prevents
bacteria and most read we're always
there is no free or know any other toxic
port
this makes him a power technology
absolutely safe to use and eco-friendly

consumes less energy than light saving
bulbs significantly reducing your bills

distortion when compared to similar high
performance drivers you will be able to
experience the most natural audio with
the cleanest bass so if I say about me
all your body is that as a very neutral
balance to it you don't see too much of
the highs interfering with the lows and
it's right there in the middle so you
get a clean refreshing and also almost
like surround sound like for you well
the sound for this is quite good the
bass is really strong
is very sturdy the AI acts as the
listening guardian for your ears it
continuously monitors your volume
exposure every five seconds and
communicates with you when it feels you
are at risk of noise induced hearing
loss
utilizing a decibel warning alert or an
automatic volume adjustment as per the
user's preference the advanced noise
cancellation actively harmonizes your
surroundings by blocking out unwanted
noise immersing you in a pure audio

day keep in touch with friends and
family and for most of us they even
support our work day but all these fun
functions come at a cost
battery don't you just hate it when your
phone runs out of battery
our current solution includes carrying
around our power bank plugs cables and
everything else we need to ensure we
don't run out of juice imagine if there
was a smarter way to save your precious
phone battery from running out all the
time something lightweight and easy to
use
say hello to cube it's the world's first
revolutionary power bank that combines
three features in the one compact device
power bank memory card reader sync and
quit charging cable you don't even need
your USB flash drive anymore cube turns
into a memory storage device and it's
compatible with any laptop via the USB
port there's no need to carry around any
other accessories ever cables are often
messy but not Hugh simply wrap it into
this tuck away slot and you're good to
go
how really does the cube work well it's
a simple concept just plug your cube
into your phone and into the power
source it detects when your smart phone
is fully charged and redirects the
charge to its internal battery unlike
your power bank that must be charged
separately cube automatically charges
itself while charging your phone so you
always know that cube is there for you
and will never let you down hi my name
is question as every busy person I was
often on the road and almost every day
my phone was running out of the battery
in the RTO instead of messy wires and
power bank I wanted to have only one
small device that can replace the number
all accessories I have to carry
everything when we started to think
about the cube we look at the existing
technology on the map and we quickly
noticed that most of the available
devices were not complete and not
user-friendly together with fear our
head designer we developed the cube we
went through several prototypes to find
a place design community the designer D
elegans compact and practical it was so
challenging with all those
functionalities together into a small
and cool design with a significant
battery capacity it was something that
had never been adopted but we made it
and we're so proud and excited to bring
it to you cube is the world's first
compact and lightweight device that
combines the functions of a power bank a
memory storage and a sinking quick
charging cable you'll also agree it's
one of the coolest looking power banks
around simply put it's an amazing piece
of technology that we can no longer live
without let's bring it to the world so
get yours now and be one of the first
few boulders
