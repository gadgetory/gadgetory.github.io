development 16 US patents thousands of
thrilled beta testers it's for wine real
quick one thing we all share on this
planet it's paint I'm show you this dude
trumpet elbow this hombre saddle-sore
these kids all have headaches they
except for this kid need peace fine you
know why no one smiles an old photos
they were all in pain and sooner or
later we'll all experience it too young
whole athletic it doesn't matter I'm
Bart da delay 48:20 your husband 3 kid
dad and I'm a coach I know a little
something about pain the pain seems like
one of those constants in life but how
do we get to 2019 with just this stuff
we can do better and a few my friends
have done better
this is kylo and it's the future of pain
relief
kylo is different than anything you've
seen before because it's the world's
first nano tech developed specifically
for relieving pain unlike other products
kylo contains zero medication instead of
adding something into your body
kylo uses billions of charged nano
capacitors to work like a bio antenna
kylo supports your body's natural
ability to relieve its own pain you
simply place kylo on your body between
your brain and the paint and within
seconds you'll experience relief by the
way it really works for me my family our
players - I could go on but let me show
you some stoked cattle users so I have
really bad knees from running for years
and years it's like in the back of my
knee like on the inside
so if you were to rate it like 1 to 10
where would you put it probably like a
seven and a half so it's pretty bad yeah
so I'm gonna put it right here it was a
team oh it can some people will feel
that yeah so your pain was that would
you say it seven six isn't any different

foreign Fords 39 I want to see if we can
give it even lower than the four
this is better this oh yeah that's
probably out of - this is freaky
oh my gosh it's like gone it's way
better I can't believe that what is this
okay hold on hold on
I would say it's definitely drastically
decreased the feed level huh it's kind
of weird this would have been nice to
have this morning when I was cleaning it
is where I don't throw it out so oh wow
that's nuts I feel like it's gonna jump
right now they're just targets they see
oh that's awesome
before I would get up go okay let's see
if I can walk for a minute and getting
up like this that mean it's like wow
that it's not there it is not there your
eyes see the waves your ears hear my
voice but does your nose smell the ocean

introducing violight a bookmark light
engineered to compliment your night use
bio light as you conduct your favorite
nighttime activity reading
special low blue lights minimises the
quality of high bioactive wavelengths
other artificial lines and digital
devices research shows that these low
intensity and furballs
don't trip your brains melatonin shutoff
switch paper thin printed unconditioned
film nanoparticles are added to the
silver conductive be designed as an open
circuit until you place it in a
nightstand position
BioLite is our second generation product
and our trusted manufacturing partners
are ready to go feet they really don't
get the appreciation they deserve
they're the most basic form of
transportation and a lot of us also have
to stand on our feet all day for work
plus we rely on them for our recreation
all of that subjects our feet to
incredible punishment forcing bones out
of alignment and stretching ligaments
collapsing our arches and causing all
kinds of painful foot problems including
heel pain hammertoes bunions plantar
fasciitis corns and calluses and when
your feet are out of alignment your
entire body is out of alignment causing
pain in your knees ankles shins hips
even your back hi I'm dr. Gary brisket
and during my 30 years in practice I've
treated tens of thousands of patients
with these types of problems the most
effective way to relieve their pain is
to prescribe a custom orthotic created
specifically for a patient's individual
foot structure orthotics adjust your
feet and bring your body back into its
ideal alignment but here's the problem
most people can't afford four to six
hundred dollars for a custom orthotic
it's a lot of money and in most cases
not covered by insurance that's why my
partner dr. Bob Bavarian and I are so
excited to introduce you to our new
orthotic called super thot except
orthotics are the first and only truly
affordable and customizable orthotic
available without a doctor's visit
flimsy drugstore shoe inserts provide
little to no support and can never
balance and realign your body like a
real orthotic su Perth Onix give you the
benefits of a custom orthotic including
a bio lock heel cup to stabilize your
heel and your ankle putting your foot
into its proper alignment a metatarsal
arch that distributes the force of
constant impact across the foot
support for your arches plus these
customizable inserts which correct the
angle at which your foot hits the ground
relieving your pain with every step you
take super orthotics are so unique they
have received two US patents now for the
first time you can get all these
features without paying up to six
hundred dollars for a custom orthotic
and succour thought except in
comfortable and designed to fit easily
into all types of shoes this is not true

journeys air loops charging case adds 80
