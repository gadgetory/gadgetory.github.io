getting a whole new perspective from the
palm of your hand
picture soaring to ncredible heights of
the waves and float out of a hot-air
balloon
sharing breathtaking memories this is
micro drone when we began on micro drone
our aim was to create a small sized
personal drone that was affordable
durable easy to fly that works straight
out of the box a drone for everyone
whether you fly micro drone in extreme
conditions like on a windy beach or in
delicate ones like inside your home with
its precision control flexibility and
durability you can fly it anywhere no
matter your age or flying experience
there's no other drone like we're doing
really innovative stuff we don't cut
corners we're in it for the long run we
launched the first edition micro drove
in 2011 and the feedback was incredible
we redesigned the second addition around
modular architecture to support a unique
range of plug and play modules it
received rave reviews in the technical
journals online blogs and even TV shows
these little drones that are like I
think they're awesome man have you seen
the micro drone ship oh yeah that's
probably my favorite one it's incredibly
nimble perfect if you're filming extreme
sports
it is very rugged and if anything did
break it's modular design means it's
easy to replace any parts now after two
years we're ready to make micro drone
3.0 micro drone 3.0 is designed with
drone enthusiasts and excellent
engineers from around the world
components are easily expandable
upgradable and replaceable it's also the
smallest drone to currently carry a
mechanical gimbal the HD camera streams
live footage to your smart phone the
battery slide in and out for quick hot
swapping and the plug and play smart
module simply snap on with magnets since
everything either snaps or slides in the
structure is sleek aerodynamic and
beautiful so now it's possible using a
3d printer technology like the ultimate
cure 2 you can print out your own custom
frame similar to the dragon or the wasp
I was super excited when the when the
micro drone team reached out and wanted
to make a first person view drone
technology using the DODOcase VR viewers
very few people could use first-person
view
drone technology even a year ago I mean
the fact that the micro drone team is
making this technology available is
really a revolutionary
we set out to pioneer the future of
robotics we've unlocked the power of
advanced mobile processors that enable
us to run cutting-edge AI algorithms on
it with this technology we created hover
camera which allows anyone to capture
photos and video from unique
perspectives to use harbor cameras very
simple powered on Flippa open like this
and you can hold anywhere when you let
go it just hovers automatically we have
a camera you can take 13 megapixel
photos and 4k video we've replaced a
traditional gimbal with electronic image
stabilization so that your shots are
always steady our camera is the first
truly autonomous flying camera that
anyone can use and is powered by our
groundbreaking embedded AI technologies
we built a ton of sophisticated AI
algorithms into this small circuit board
it runs a powerful Hong Kong snapdragon
2.3 gigahertz quad-core processor this
enables us to run complex calculations
locally without the need for a remote
server the AI was developed in such a
way that it reduces the learning curve
so anyone can operate it out of the box
that's why we've designed a
revolutionary user experience that
centers around hovering
hovering is actually more difficult than
just flying the reason it hovers so
steadily is because it's running optical
flow on its downward viewing camera and
visual slam from the front viewing
camera that's how it gauges its own
speed and position at all times on top
of that we're running advanced fly
control algorithms at 1 kilohertz it's
so intelligent that it follows people
automatically as they move around it
does this without GPS but instead using
real-time facial and body recognition
this is the most compact and elegantly
designed flying camera on the market it
is so small that it could easily fit
into a purse but you wanted to make sure
that this device is safe we've geared up
with the suit of armor this entire
protective enclosure is made out of the
most durable and lightweight
carbon-fiber material the radical design
allows users to grab throw and catch
hover camera yet it lets just enough air
to flow through without sacrificing the
ability to hover or fly Tony and I we
both graduated from the Stanford
engineering ph.d program we have about
80 plus people now and a very diverse
background we're fortunate enough to be
surrounded by a team of passionate and
experienced adventurers who share our
vision
we're setting new standards for aerial
robotics Pawel camera is always around
capturing those unique moments in
reaching your vision of the world
introducing the redesigned nano drone
from morrison innovations we took the
world's smallest quadcopter and made it
even easier and fun for beginners to fly
our new patent-pending design provides a
more forgiving flight process while
protecting the blades and motors at the
same time there will be three
introductory colors to choose from on
IndieGoGo all nano drones will now come
with our new packaging that also doubles
as a protective storage case the all-new
three speed calibration system provides
smoother lift and maneuverability
reducing the pogo stick effect that new
Flyers experience with the previous
design we have also improved the six
axis stabilization which allows the Nano
drone to hover remarkably well it can
now hover less than an inch off of the
surface below in addition to higher
altitudes our patent-pending blade guard
design allows the new nano during the
lightly bumps ceilings and walls without
causing the blades to fly off which
previously resulted in short flight
times devastating crashes and the need
for repairs while not indestructible the
new design is certainly more popular
software upgrades provide smoother 360
degree rotation also referred to as
y'all allowing you to easily adjust the
orientation of your drone mid-flight we
have designed what we believe to be a
perfect learner drone that will save you
thousands of dollars while you protect
the mechanics of quadcopter flight
before moving on to larger more
expensive equipment thank you for
viewing our campaign we hope you'll
decide the fact the all-new nano time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
