bully lock company something you may
know that we launched our high security
lock company a Kickstarter about 18
months ago with our first product which
is our deadbolt and after a really
successful campaign we went on to sell
thousands of locks around the globe
direct to consumers on our website we've
been really fortunate to have our lock
technology challenged by some of the
most talented and well-respected pickers
on YouTube people like Bosnian bill lock
man 28 and the lock picking lawyer the
consensus among all of them is that our
lock technology offers some of the
highest resistance of tampering
available in the market today in fact to
date our lock has never been compromised
we get a lot of requests to broaden our
product line people asking the bulding
law company what are you guys gonna
start building safes what are you gonna
build gun lockers or hey I'd really love
you to come up with a bike lock and well
someday we'd hope to build them all the
number one request we get right now is
for a padlock so with that I'd like to
introduce you to the bully lock company
model 543 this is the highest security
the biggest baddest padlock that we
could conceive of it's got a broad range
of applications you can use it to lock
up anything from a bike or a motorcycle
to a storage shed or even an industrial
facility it competes with the most
high-security padlocks on the market
today but those locks simply don't
compete with our price
we started out planning another 4th to
the key and another rule of opposing
pins the key enters the bottom of the
lock at 45-degree angle and can only
enter the keyhole in one orientation the
dual Forks on the key pass around the
dual shields in the lock until they
alive if the pins the key is then pushed
in and the nine pins fall into the key
and unlock the cylinder once the key is
turned 90 degrees the lock cam allows
the lock balls to slide in and free the
shackle which can then be totally
removed from the lock the shackle is a
full 7/16 and diameter hardened steel as
protected from cutting attacks by the
large lock 20 shrouded our new 9 pin
design offers 2.3 billion key code
combinations given our 5 pin deadbolt
has never been compromised some may say
this is overkill but we say a lot can
never be too severe Billy bars is a
space-saving device it helps people have
their bike comfortably fit in their
lifestyle
it's a detachable handlebar system to
install it you just simply push it in
and twist and to remove it you move the
color back rotate and remove it by
removing the handlebars you actually
save over 14 inches the idea of Billy
bars was to take that bike that you
loved and just make it a little bit
better but I be able to make it fit and
where you live
we're starting off with three main
handlebars we have the Straits we have
the bullhorn we have the drop down we do
have a fourth style which would be up on
the cruiser bikes along with your
handlebars you have the stem so this
will be easily mounted to your bike all
the handlebars are completely
interchangeable with this stem and then
we also have a wall mount which will
allow you to convert your handlebars
into a mount to hold your bicycle the
real goal with Billy bars is to help
people love bikes more I think a lot of
good can come from more biking when I
see somebody biking it a little bit more
hope for Humanity
you
I hate metric
she hates imperial and we both hate when
drawings aren't to scale imagine a scale
with the ability to generate an infinite
amount of possibilities imagine being
able to create your own scale to read an
out of scale drawing or switch back and
forth between Imperial and metric with a
touch of one button introducing the
smart scale architects designers
engineers builders artists listen up
this is for you there's a drawing it's
not to scale and you can't measure
anything on it there's a drawing in
imperial and your brain only works in
metric or vice versa don't panic it's
going to be okay with smart scales three
innovative functions the primary
function of the smart scale is its
ability to create a custom scale from a
single reference point if you know that
a distance is 9 feet use the slider on
the drawing and with the number pad
could tell it that distance is 9 feet
based on that reference the smart scale
will create a custom scale so now you
can measure anything on the drawing if
your industry or national standard is
Imperial or metric or you just feel more
comfortable using Imperial you can set
the smart scale to do the conversions
for you this is the secondary function
of the smart scale it even works if you
had used the custom scale function now
there's nothing standing in the way of
you sharing plans between different
industries and/or countries finally the
smart scale can be used as a simple
digital divider if you want any space
divided into sections select the space
and the number of sections you need
and the length of this Marseilles can be
divided into your desired number of
segments saving you the time and
frustration of having to do the
calculations yourself I career the smart
scale because I've been in one too many
unproductive meetings where people came
in with drawings that were out of scale
printed on the wrong paper size had no
dimensions or had dimensions they're in
metric and we need an imperial or vice
versa
one of the first architects I work with
used to use these little paper scales
which is what inspired me and this is
ultimately how the smart scale works but
on a digital level making it highly
accurate and easy to use I approached a
product development company with the
experience to help me create the smart
scale we spent about a year working
towards the prototype smart scale has a
unique 12 inch wide display screen with
long battery life and its use be
chargeable for durability it has an
aluminum powder-coated body with a clean
simple design making it incredibly
user-friendly despite living in a
largely digital world it will always be
a tactile one the smart scale combines
those to be more efficient meetings
sherry clients they are up to date and
can deal with any obstacle
testing malfunctioning electronic
devices with the traditional multimeter
is a hassle
dials switches tethered leads and
technical jargon add complexity and
difficulty and keeping track of
measurements can be a real pain as well
now there's an easier way introducing
violin the world's simplest Bluetooth
multimeter vayan simplifies testing
electronics for malfunctions it can
automatically measure electrical output
and send data to smartphones and the
VAIO an app provides you a live feed of
all the electrical measurements taken
with vion ions unibody design makes it
lightweight and easy to store perfect
for your workshop your home or your car
connect via onto your smart phone using
bluetooth and measure values in real
time by on reads back stored
measurements through voice guidance so
you don't have to worry about looking
down at your phone
vayan gives you a simple good or bad
result indicator so you'll know right
away in real time if your device is
working properly
vayan has colored LEDs built into the
handles for quick visual reference as
well flashing lights for connectivity
status use vien to check if your
batteries are running low if your
electronic devices are working correctly
or if their wiring problems in your home
Bayan caters toward both experts and
novices and supports most functions
found on traditional multimeters so
contractors and electricians can use it
on the job as well as a boy trying to
fix his RC car reading measurements that
Bayan collects is easy but for those who
like data you can review all the
detailed information displayed on the
vion app you can automatically detect
the error of the device and have the
measurements saved on the application
Bayan is the easiest and safest way to
troubleshoot problems with electronic
devices
Veon eliminates the hassle and expenses
of calling for repair services anyone
can easily use it for countless
situations unlike other multimeters
Bayan has no body making its paired
probes easy to store and carry
vayan the world's simplest bluetooth
multimeter the conventional mattress pad
does not allow for breathability it does
not prevent against suffocation it does
not prevent against any kind of
bacterial build-up so therefore we
designed a waterproof and breathable
crib mattress pad it was very obvious to
us that if parents were going to add
this layer of waterproof protection to
their mattress that we should give them
the comfort and peace of mind for safe
sleep and add that breathability
component to the mattress pad the AAP
has developed guidelines for parents
including always putting them to sleep
on their backs the reason for this is to
help reduce the risk of suffocation but
after three months or so babies start
rolling over onto their bellies and some
even prefer to sleep this way
what's a parent to do they can't stay up
all night watching a monitor when our
first son was born and he was having
difficulty sleeping
he would finally get to sleep and then
we'd look in the monitor and see that he
was sleeping face down and we'd stare at
the monitor wondering whether we should
go in and turn him over and risk waking
him up or take the chance of allowing
him to sleep in that position every mom
is going to add a waterproof pad to
their crib why not add a layer of air to
protect the baby what we realize is that
parents need better sleep - and the
beauty of our products the safety the
ability for babies to breathe through
the mattress means that parents can have
peace of mind we conducted a balloon
test showing that the amount of air that
would dissipate or go through our crib
mattress pad as a
to the amount of error that dissipates
with a conventional mattress pad through
this test you can see that the amount of
error very quickly dissipates on the
Newton baby crib mattress pad whereas on
a conventional crib mattress the air
does not dissipate parents tell us all
the time how much they love their Newton
they're finding that they're sleeping
more comfortably they have the peace of
mind knowing that should their little
ones roll over in the night that they
can breathe safely that they're sleeping
soundly longer they're finding that
their babies aren't tossing and turning
as much because of the wonderful
temperature regulation with the
breathability of the mattress pad
