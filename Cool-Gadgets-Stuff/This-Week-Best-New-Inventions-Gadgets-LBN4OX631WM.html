today we are delivering on that promise
it takes off and lands vertically it's
fully electric this is the lilium jet
mrs. Furr first time that we have a
full-scale full-weight prototype of that
five seater version this is the next
step in mobility as we perceive it what
we're trying to achieve here is an air
mobility revolution we look at what is
possible by the laws of physics
our principle of maximum simplicity
combined with a level of safety it is
really something that makes us unique
this is the product there's nothing like
this
there's always a risk if you do
something you
at some point you have to say we have
tested everything now let's fly this
aircraft
there's this one moment where everything
comes together and where it's
make-or-break this is the everything
defining moment for all of us taking off
the tree
first flights are always crucial but the
launch of course for us is just a small
piece in this whole process the testing
will go on the refinements the
engineering will will continue
from the innovators who created the
world's driest baths man comes the
world's cleanest dish drying system
isn't it time your dish rack caught up
with the rest of your kitchen
life has changed since the 50s
we no longer source our vegetables from
a can women are portrayed in roles
outside the kitchen and there's an app
for everything so why is the dish rack
stuck in the past the old-school dish
rack was designed to drip Drive plates
cups and silverware leaving puddled
water and bacteria behind why are we
still using the same rusty metal baskets
and funky-smelling kitchen towels too
dirty just wash dishes
built upon the enthusiasm for the dry
bathmat we created the world's first
mold free dish drying system the dried
dish rack and dish pad are the first
kitchen products to integrate our
trademark dial mat technology made of
diatomaceous earth or fossilized algae
die o mat prevents bacteria by
dispersing the water throughout for
rapid evaporation the dried dish rack is
designed for your lifestyle whether
you're an aspiring chef working on your
mad knife skills a new mom with an
endless supply of bottles or a fitness
enthusiast with containers and shakers
for every activity side rails
accommodate modular accessories
customized to fit your most frequently
used dishes the aircraft-grade aluminum
frame holds a cutting board with plenty
of space for larger pots pans and bowls
have heavy duty cookware and ceramics
stack away without bowing or bending the
sustainable food safe dial mat
evaporates moisture from the base in
seconds how about those occasions when
you don't need a full rack but simply a
sanitary space to dry your dishes while
protecting the countertops we've got you
covered with the dry foldable drying pad
the eco-chic Durai system instantly
eliminates pooling water a perfect
replacement for your arsenal of squishy
foam offenders and perpetually smelly
hand towels
the silicon wrapping helps promote 360
degree airflow while protecting your
delicate items
when you're done drying just fold and
store
a team of researchers designers
engineers and germaphobes Durai has
spent the last 10 months brainstorming
prototyping and testing to create the
perfect dish drying system you want to
hear a bad cat joke just kidding it's
your cat missing the litter box does it
feel like torture having to clean and
replace your kitty litter introducing I
cuddle the smart litter box that self
cleans tells you when your little feline
friend leaves a chocolate delight and
Auto packs at your convenience for
disposal the I cuddle knows when your
little Panther does his dirty business
it uses sensors to detect win and how
often they go after that a timer starts
that self cleans the litter removing
only clumps and Auto packs into a small
bag which is super convenient and saves
money when ready simply press the auto
packing button on the litter box or the
convenient I cuddle app which notifies
you when the bag is full ever walk by a
litter box that smelled like ammonia and
your mother's disapproval the I cuddle
is great for multiple cats and comes
with a deodorizing system that filters
out the smell of your cats but ruffles
and eliminates odors keeping your home
smelling fresher than cookies coming out
of the oven
delightful the I cuddle app monitors how
often your baby tiger visits the I
cuddle litter box and collects data that
displays on your app unlike most
self-cleaning litterboxes the I cuddles
modular design allows you to detach the
components for easy cleanup it has a
built-in lithium ion battery that lasts
for 15 days or plugin cable that lets
you use it practically anywhere Simba
you silly little lion not bear back us
today and be one of the first ones to
get the eye cuddle so you never have to
scoop your cat's tootsie rolls ever
again
there are too many kids staring at a
screen instead of talking to the person
next one screen time consumption by the
time a high school student gets home
from school is almost 5 hours too much
technology introduced prematurely is too
dangerous
studies are clear smartphones are bad
for kids mental health and development
the average teen is spending up to nine
hours a day staring at a screen and most
of that time is on social media
sixty percent of teens admit that this
is a major problem because of the
increase in screen time there has been a
52% increase in depression in teens my
name is Steven dowdy
I am the founder of gap Wireless but
more importantly I'm a father when my
son turned 12 years old I felt like it
was time to get him a phone we just
wanted to be able to communicate call
text just so that we knew that he was
okay and that everything was fine so I
went to one major carrier and I was
blown away as she pointed to this line
of expensive high-tech smart phones and
she said those are all the phones we had
we've decided to create an entire
cellular network that would be dedicated
to safe devices for kids the first gap
phone is as you can see very simple it's
a touchscreen phone it's a sub $100
device it's not expensive but most
importantly it's safe the gap phone
looks like a regular smartphone but has
no internet browser no social media no
games and no App Store it also comes
with a five megapixel camera but don't
worry we've removed MMS capabilities so
they can send texts but they can't send
or receive photos or videos with gap
your kids can have what you want them to
have freedom freedom to explore and play
freedom to enjoy healthy relationships
and freedom from the overwhelming
pressures of social media with gab they
can develop healthy relationships with
your family with their friends and with
technology one of the other benefits of
the gab phone is that interpersonal
communication that takes place we want
kids to be kids we want them to talk and
communicate parents would no longer need
to worry about downloading apps with
inappropriate content because there
would be no app store parents would no
longer need to worry about addictive
games because there wouldn't be on the
phone parents would no longer need to
worry about
sending and receiving inappropriate
images which is becoming more and more
prevalent because MMS capabilities could
be dissolved we've also added a calendar
an alarm clock a calculator and an FM
radio with gab you can get them a phone
they want with features that you can
trust one of our primary purposes is to
give parents an opportunity to be put
back in the driver's seat what I'm
asking for today is for your support as
a parent and as a father so that we can
provide better options for kids we need
to be doing more to protect children so
welcome to gap waves
hi this is Torah I'm a gamer every
enthusiast and the founder of wall cover
a device that lets you physically move
in virtual reality games and
applications years ago I was really
excited about to launch or focus however
years past but we experienced virtual
reality almost in the same way it was
built there are a couple of tracker
sermons there is a head mounted display
you put on and in use the controller to
moving games controlling your game
moments by pressing some buttons is not
only bad experience but also causes
motion sickness and nausea you need to
include your physical presence in your
gaming to make it more immersive and
comfortable that's why we developed
walkover
which walk over more in almost any way
our game anytime anywhere you wish it is
a modular affordable and Mirabal motion
capture system specifically used to move
in newer games you play you may simply
use this through no diversion we may
extend it with externals
for better and more precise game control
or you may even use it with existing
omnidirectional treadmills
these notes track your physical body
capture your moons and transfer them to
our software our software is integrated
to steamer when you open your VR game
it recognizes the game you're playing
and handles the rest based on your game
it enables proper walkover settings and
let you enjoy your game without anything
else needed on your side it is Wireless
and already compatible with many Triple
A games moreover it has also keyboard
and gamepad modes which makes it
compatible with mobile VR solutions
animators copy 3d solutions such as warp
X today and for the future we work on
many prototypes and countless intern
versions we were able to test our
solutions with hundreds of games we got
a feedback which leads us improve our
technology and software walking is
another thing because it makes the
immersion in a whole new level
all your body was engaged in the game
that was fantastic
the wearable was crazy fun and just is
that exercising fun in the same thing
like oh really cool running in a game is
something else it's it enthralls you in
the game like you really feel like
you're playing as the character you're
playing with the teleportation it's kind
of just like a point-and-click is way
more immersive when you're actually
running alongside your character instead
of just using it like a controller yeah
by able to move my legs I didn't have I
could control the speed at which I was
moving like at the end I was tired I was
literally sweating not normal for a real
game
today it is time to make this flexible
solution available every we are empty
chests it will cover you can increase
the immersive experience by physically
moving in place we believe mirror should
be for everyone
and it's true power will be revealed by
our physical interactions our primary
physical interaction is more in our
whole body physically in October than
one's if you also believe then please
support Volkov we need your support to
change the way we play thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
