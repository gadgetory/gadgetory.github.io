level sawmill the frontier OS 27
with the frontier OS 27 you can unlock
the hidden value in your own trees work
with exotic species of wood create
unique dimensions like veneer or super
wide planks and beams and you can build
the projects you've been dreaming about
two years of design went into this
rugged little song
the result its
versatile and affordable take a look at
the frontier
27 in action
quickly see the possibilities
the OS 27 is a workhorse
it can handle logs up to 27 inches in
diameter
billboards and beams up to 22 inches
wide standard you can know lumber eleven
and a half feet long no longer boards by
simply adding available extensions
the frontier is operated at ground level
for easy loading of logs leveling feet
are standard two sets of long and short
blog posts are provided for square
timber built in backstops securely hold
your timber in place and can dogs clap
down low these features allow you to
mill within one inch of the bed
the OS 27 shares
many of the same features as the fly
nor would sawmills such as the patented
self-locking saw head that eliminates
tedious and time-consuming labor each
complete turn of the handle provides
precise one-inch Ward's the scale with
built-in kerf allowance eliminates the
guesswork simply set your height and saw
what could be easier a lumber production
scale to calculate your board production
is also included an additional depth of
cut adjustment system is provided to
help judge first cuts safety systems
such as an emergency stop are built in a
rugged 13 horsepower Briggs engine
muscles through softwood and hardwood
logs alike
a blade lubrication system is standard
to keep your blades pitch free and cool
a single action control simultaneously
throttles up the engine and blame the
same as the Norwood Mills duel guide
rollers support the blade
and are fixed to suit the full capacity
of the No
move the blade through the and feel
your board smoothly and effortlessly
coming off your mill and consider the
versatility you can transport your
frontier sawmill from one site to the
next equipped with the optional trailer
package the OS 27 tows easily behind
your ATV car or truck the trailer comes
complete with subframe adjustable
support legs and removable tow bar add
the trailer system now or get it later
either way your options are over
update your sawmill to be fully portable
when
time is bright for you
making things should be easy shaper
origin is a perceptive handheld power
tool that make sure your cuts are
exactly where you want them so you can
focus on turning your idea into a
finished product Origen uses a visual
marker system to orient itself to the
workpiece simply apply shaper tape
around the area to be cut and scan the
surface to generate a map once you place
your design origin knows what you want
to cut and watches the workpiece to stay
oriented to the plan
precision motors continuously fine-tune
the spindles positions as you follow
your design keeping cuts precise and on
track origin remembers its position so
you can pause and restart your work if
you move too far off course the blade
automatically retracts leaving you with
a clean result there are three ways to
create with origin select from the
standard design software you already use
download plans from shaper hub or design
with the tool itself no computer
required
origen acts as a drawing tool so you can
intuitively design directly on the
workpiece
bring an Origin anywhere work at any
scale with a variety of materials simple
smart small introducing the world's
first handheld CNC
when you're building cabinets cases and
boxes holding the pieces in position
during assembly can be one of the
biggest challenges the Craig 90-degree
corner clamp simplifies the assembly
process by aligning and holding corners
and partitions at perfect 90-degree
angles so you have both hands-free to
add fasteners
unlike some corner clamps that can be
cumbersome to use the 90-degree corner
clamp is simple plus it works with
ninety degree but joints and T joints
used to attach shelves and partitions
all you have to do is squeeze the padded
handles and the clamps cast aluminum
wedge and V shapes draw tight against
the inside and outside faces of the
joint this holds the two pieces at
exactly 90 degrees a reversible corner
style makes it easy to align the mating
pieces in the clamp while edge stops
cast into the outer V help ensure that
the edges will be flush and aligned too
with the clamp holding the joint
securely together you can add the
fasteners the 90 degree corner clamp
works great for building with Craig
pocket all joinery and even as access
points in the Honor VIII that allow you
to drive a Craig screw with the clamps
still in position openings in the outer
V also make it easy to attach the joint
with the brad nailer or even to drill
and drive conventional wood screws the
90-degree corner clamp is great for
building drawers cases boxes and more
because it works with thin materials and
lumber up to 1 inch thick and thanks to
Craig's automax
Auto adjusting technology you never have
to readjust the clamp when you move from
one material thickness to another just
squeeze the clamp handles and automax
technology does the rest applying the
perfect amount of easy to regulate
clamping pressure to the joint every
time and with every material thickness
remembering how to smooth out those
joists when you needed to easily fix a
stubborn door or make two uneven boards
flush now you can do all this and more
with the win electric hand planer the
six amp motor provides up to thirty four
thousand cuts per minute through even
the hardest of woods while most of our
competitors have a maximum depth of 5/64
of an inch the wind planer exhibits 16
positive stops in one 128 inch
increments to fine-tune your cuts
anywhere up to 1/8 of an inch deep the
win electric hand planer also comes with
a handy dust collection bag that can be
attached to either the right or left
hand side of the planer an adjustment
wrench with onboard storage a kickstand
to protect your blade a rabbiting guide
to help measure the depth of your
rabbits and a parallel fence for making
perfectly straight cuts the base of the
plate even has a v-shaped groove to help
make chamfering the corners of your wood
easier than ever and if you have a dust
extractor you can plug it right in to
either side of your unit to maximize the
collection of sawdust and see your work
area clean remember when you had a
reliable planer that gave you years of
quality service remember when
the secret to great projects is perfect
cuts and with the Craig ank you cut
making those perfect cuts is easier than
you ever imagined with the AK you cut
you eliminate the hassles and accuracies
and inconsistencies of needing to mark a
long cut line and then trying to
freehand the saw along it just make a
couple of marks and then align the edge
of the Anka cuts precision guide track
with the marks whether you're making a
cross cuts rip cuts or angled cuts the
yank you cut transforms your ordinary
circular saw into a high-performance
track guided cutting system that you can
use to make straight accurate splinter
free cuts in plywood MDF and other large
sheets quickly accurately and
effortlessly and because the enqueue cut
is portable you can make these
high-quality worry-free cuts
anywhere by taking your sod of the
material instead of having to bring your
material to the saw in most applications
you don't even need to clamp the track
down thanks to anti slip strips that
hold the track in place exactly where
you place it that track guides the Accu
cuts Universal sled it accepts most any
circular saw whether the blade is on the
left or the right and mounting your saw
is quick and easy the universal sled can
also be used on the Craig rip cut with
your saw mounted to the sled and the
precision guide track in place on your
plywood cutting with the Accu cut is
simple all you have to do is guide the
sled along the track grooves in the sled
ensure that the saw tracks perfectly
straight plus the sled positions the saw
blade so it hugs tight to the edge of
the guide track that way your cut is
perfectly aligned with the edge of the
sled the strip's that hold the track in
place also provide an anti chip edge
that hugs tight to your saw blade that
strips minimize rough chipped out edges
by holding the fragile face layer in
place to prevent your saw blade from
lifting and tearing the surface as you
cut to make cutting even easier the Accu
cut is also equipped with a convenient
starting block it positions and aligns
your saw so you can start your cuts
confidently with these great features
the Anki cut makes cutting plywood and
large panels easy and
predictable whether you're cross-cutting
Sheets making rip cuts up to 48 inches
long or you're cutting across the sheet
at an angle all you have to do is set
your saw on the track and make a
straight accurate splinter free cut
every time the bench top bench cookie
the new non-slip bench pad that lids
grips
and protects your work
bench cookies work well around sawdust
and even hold a workpiece securely by
belt sanding with a sixty grit belt they
raise the work piece of one inch above
the work surface to provide clearance
for bearings on a rounded end while at
the same time holding it securely so you
can route the edge without clamps bench
cookies are the perfect way to provide
clearance for staining and finishing an
edge
the brother certainly protects the
workpiece from damage during sanding
finishing or during assembly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
