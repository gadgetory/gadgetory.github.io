up in a more natural and relaxed upright
position
now imagine controlling it not only with
your hands and hand along with your
whole body
bridging the gap between man machine and
dance now relax
free your mind forget everything you
know about bikes and prepare for a
completely new experience this is our
sweet escape from the hectic everyday
life our reverse button back to basics
back to nature back to our true selves
what's yours
at first glance this appears to be a
standard road bike but take another look
no chain and no sprockets less drag less
maintenance longer pedal cranks
more leverage more torque vertical
motion more gravity more speed cycling
is a sport where the leg is attached
directly to a machine the bike with
linear motion there's less stress to the
body so less blood oxygen requirements
to the legs less strain on the heart and
less flexing of the hips knees and
ankles
fifteen years ago this was just an idea
to go faster but with the help of
competitive riders engineers medical
professionals production machinists bike
retailers and experience in designing
and building an experimental aircraft
what I became is faster simpler and
safer riding pedal cranks over two times
longer delivered twice the power to the
rear wheel and vertical pedaling takes
advantage of gravity throughout the
entire stroke the prototype frame weighs
under three pounds a new computer design
weighs even less improves its strengths
and simplifies production the gearbox
that converts linear pedaling to
rotation of motion weighs less than the
chain and sprockets of a ten-speed and a
built-in mechanism prevents
horizontally-opposed lockup of the drive
levers by advancing one pedal at the top
of the stroke and retarding the opposite
pedal at the bottom it also provides for
a smooth natural transition from one
stroke to the next removing the rear
wheel is quick and simple open to quick
release levers and disconnect the
shifter cable that's it and for
transporting it all fits easily and
securely in the back of a car so here it
is new bike or benefits selector lubra
disc is the revolution in bicycle care
you're gonna love taking care of your
bicycle chain no more dirty hands the
lube reduce is smart small and always
with you
weathering your commuter bag or on a
bike tour it only takes a few seconds to
prepare your bike for the next ride
simply hold the lubra disc between your
fingers press it lightly on your chain
and let your crank turn backwards
everything else happens automatically
with the lubra disk you save oil up to
90% good for you good for the
environment no oil flows into the cloth
no oil splashes around not on the ground
not on your bicycle frame and certainly
not on your fingers
also the pros down at Mike's bike shop
around the corner are convinced by the
lubra disc selector looper disc the
smartest tool ever for you and the
environment
but you still got to work on your cash
man
never miss a beat
no matter your adventure introducing
revs to high-performance sunglasses
powered by revolutionary bone conduction
technology
different from any bone conduction
products in the market revs delivers
premium stereo sound through the
cartilage behind the ear the open ear
design not only is natural to sunglasses
but also keeps you aware of the world
around you by sending vibrations through
the ear cartilage revs bone conduction
sound is richer with more bass
revs helps you stay connected via
bluetooth and allows you to enjoy music
listen to podcasts and make calls on
your adventures we pioneer the bone
conduction into a headphones category
with aftershocks the experience of open
year music is so amazing and useful we
integrated the technology onto
performance optics built by the
aftershokz team that leads the bone
conduction audio industry with over 200
patents
Rebbe's showcases the behind your
transducers that make bone conduction
sunglasses possible powered by
aftershocks leaks layer technology revs
suppresses sound leakage and allows you
to enjoy music discreetly boosted by six
hour battery life and ip55 sweat
resistance Rebs is the ideal eyewear
companion for an active lifestyle
offering complete UV 400 protection and
interchangeable polycarbonate lenses
Rebs fits into your daily activities
there's no sacrifice and comfort with
the Rebs
lightweight nylon frame the bendable
pivot point arms assured gentle contact
between the transducers and ears
see the world
here the world and listen to your audio
all day long hi I'm Fabien
the creator of Eddy the smallest and
lightest add-on kit for bicycles that
converts any bicycle into a powerfully
bike within seconds you simply mount the
drive unit to an existing bike attach
the battery switch it on and off you go
three years ago we successfully launched
the first version of Eddy since then
thousands of bikes all over the world
have been equipped with Eddy making the
owners pasta and happier
the reasons why Eddie is so popular
clear it is extremely light extremely
powerful very compact and you can use it
on any existing bike the only downside
of a friction roller Drive is this it
can be quite noisy however the new
generation of Eddy will sound more like
this and that's not the result of our
sound engineer playing around with
volume control it's the result of a
solid one-year Austrian engineering
process that has led to 90% noise
reduction like in the previous version
of Eddy there is no friction in standby
mode in all mode you can choose between
five support levels once your pedal
Eddie starts wooden half a second if you
stop pedaling Eddy stops automatically
one battery can last up to four hours in
constant use and can be exchanged or
charged easily another big step forward
of this wireless sensors not only
because they're much more sensitive but
to make the installation so easy no
matter which bike you're using
in case you still want help with the
installation
we do have an extensive and permanent
grow spot network we're a small team
based out of Santa Cruz California
previously we successfully launched an
electric folding cruiser and city bike
and now we're launching our most
exciting bike to date an electric
compact cargo bike we call it the pack
with the pakka you don't need a card you
can bring everything with you all while
enjoying the outdoors and building an
active and healthy lifestyle running
errands heading out for the day taking
the kids for a playdate easily carry the
things you need the ones you love
you can pack it all choose from over 200
ways to customize your ride
using pakka's unique multi modular
racking system with smart mounting
points in both the front and rear you
can carry up to 200 pounds of cargo with
one of the lowest frames ever designed
for a cargo bike getting on and off the
bike is a breeze no matter what kind of
rider you are with its compact design
the PACA offers the perfect balance of
convenience and rider friendliness
perfect for storing and making turns
easy the dual battery system
automatically uses both batteries to
ensure you never have to stop when one
battery runs out giving you twice the
range for long riding with heavy loading
it's powered by a 750 watt motor using
direct drive technology for high
durability now you have the freedom to
go wherever whenever cruise up to 20
miles per hour with five levels of pedal
assist to choose from and a throttle to
use on demand safety is a key component
in the overall design the packet is not
only incredibly easy to ride it also
features an automatic power cutoff when
you brake an integrated brake light and
a front light mounted to the fender
so it moves with you when you turn bring
the fun back experience more with the
pakka</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
