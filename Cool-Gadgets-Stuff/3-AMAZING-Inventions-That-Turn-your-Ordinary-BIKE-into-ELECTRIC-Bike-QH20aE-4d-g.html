smallest lightest add-on kit for
bicycles that converts any bicycle into
a powerful Lee bike within seconds you
simply mount the drive unit to your
existing bike attach the battery switch
it on and off you go
he bikes are fast eco-friendly and they
take you to your dog's wedding but
conventional ebikes
are quite heavy and bulky they're not
meant to be used as normal bikes that's
why we created Eddie it offers a super
efficient Drive while keeping your bike
pure eggl and absolutely smooth running
Eddie consists of three parts the
mounting plate the drive unit and the
battery all made of high quality
materials as you can see Eddie is almost
invisible and it's a true lightweight
champion while most other systems have
between five and ten kilograms Eddie
with only two kilograms including the
battery and Eddie is smart in off mode
you don't feel it since there's no
friction or conduit in all mode you can
select various support levels once your
pedal Eddie starts within half a second
if you stop pedaling Eddie stops
automatically therefore Eddie is safe
flight and a great companion for your
trips
after two years of development we are
proud to have a fully working first
version of Eddie all tests are completed
and Eddie is doing great since September
we are producing Eddie on a small scale
with stunning feedback of our customers
this feedback helps us to make the new
version of Eddie even smarter this is
the Copenhagen wheel it turns your
ordinary bicycle into a smart electric
hybrid by simply replacing your back
wheel connect it to your smartphone
download the app and you're ready to go
bicycles are a great way to move around
it sometimes distances are too long
pills can get in the way and hard
journeys to work may leave you covered
in sweat the Copenhagen wheel is here to
change all of that the technology was
developed over several years at MIT
together with the city of Copenhagen one
of the world's most innovative places
for cycling its original inventors
licensed the technology and founded
super pedestrian the startup where we
are now working around the clock to
bring the wheel to you like the best
riding companion the Copenhagen wheel
learns how you pedal and integrates
seamlessly with your motion it captures
your energy when you break or go
downhill and gives you a push when you
need it with three to ten times your
regular foot power it's easy right it
just like a normal bike as you pedal the
motor automatically kicks in with no
additional throttles or buttons all
technology for the Copenhagen wheel is
contained within the red casing
including motor removable batteries
wireless connectivity smart locking
multiple sensors and an embedded control
system use your smart phone to customize
your ride monitor your physical activity
gather information from your environment
to share with your friends and fellow
cyclists and if you're a software
developer you can even create your own
biking apps so whether you carry
yourself your kids or your gear pills
seem flat distances shrink and you can
cycle just about
anywhere so transform your bike and
transform the city the Copenhagen wheel
you
imagine adding an electric wheel to your
bike travel 20 to 50 miles on a single
charge at all when you want
sit back when you don't he'll no sweat
it's 500 watts of power available at the
press of a lever easy to install and
intuitive to operate designed in
Cambridge Massachusetts and built a New
England two years ago is watching Tron
thinking about all that empty space
inside the orbital wheel really kept me
up at night why don't we put a motor
when we put a battery in that spin I
managed to make a mini prototype but I
basically have two left thumb and a
limited knowledge of engineering 18
months ago I was working as a propulsion
development engineer at SpaceX when I
met Mike and saw the Geo orbital wheel
prototype I loved the concept and one of
the help make it a reality
since then we've created five
generations of prototypes given hundreds
of test rides and logged thousands of
miles from all that user feedback we've
integrated all sorts of features into
the wheel installation takes only 60
seconds and requires no tools the
battery is easily removable even the
tires are made of high-density foam they
ride just like a normal tire but they'll
never go flat the motor will take you
zero to 20 miles an hour in six seconds
the feature set goes on and on we've
only just got rolling how many years I
work driven and rode at ridiculous first
forward and then a bike store involved
and I first saw the gerbil wheel I was
hooked we've got this advanced design
sleek an iminium frame and simple
operation
you just pop on the wheel clip on the
throttle and go it's bloody brilliant
wouldn't it be great if you could use
your bike whenever you want it to
without sweating all the engineering is
done we've got a great product got a
great team
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
