of course it does eventually but we
waste valuable time checking the pot
repeatedly or forget about it completely
until it's too late time is valuable and
so are our pots and pans the solution
boiling Biba it floats in the pot and
poops when it's hot with boiling pepper
you can multitask
whether it's preparing the rest of
dinner watching TV checking in with
friends or playing with the kids just
place boiling paper in your pot of water
turn up the heat and wait for the beep
no wasted time checking the pot
repeatedly Nomad panic
it's like having a whistling teakettle
for your food whether you want the
perfect hard-boiled egg a way to prevent
boil overs or just to enjoy a few extra
moments for what really matters
boiling vapor is an innovative and
useful kitchen solution that makes
everyone's life easier
ferm lock is the first true one-piece
waterless airlock for mason jars
fermentation all you have to do is screw
it on and you're done
it's airtight keepin oxygen out and has
two one-way valves for the release of
carbon dioxide the two valves rest above
a six channel system that front of the
accumulating carbon dioxide towards and
through the valve allowing the proper
quantity to escape at the proper time if
carbon dioxide cannot escape it can
actually build up and cause the jar to
explode and if exposed to oxygen the
batch of food can become contaminated
other airlocks work okay but require
maintenance water and multiple pieces
even the one that claims to be a
one-piece requires a second piece firm
lock is a true one-piece replacement lid
for any wide mouth mason jar for gourmet
fermented food in the comfort of your
own kitchen all you have to do is prep
your food and pack it into any wide
mouth mason jar weigh it down with one
of our new ergonomic handle weights to
ensure the food stays beneath the brine
next screw on a firm lock and you're
done leave it in your fridge for the
following weeks or months you can truly
set it forget it and come back to it
when you're ready to enjoy it firm lock
is BPA free and can be cleaned in your
dishwasher along with the weights thanks
so much for backing and happy healthy
fermenting
this campaign is all about you the
backers customers and fans who've waited
years for us to create two things tongs
and whisks and now they're here
you might be wondering why we chose to
make these products out of metal instead
about a silicon the truth is we love
silicon as you probably know but metal
in this case was really the best
material for the job with the tongs we
were focused so closely on the
innovation of a brand new mechanism had
to be made out of metal with the whisk
we were looking for huge tension a lot
of vibration in the whisk wires and
covering them in silicone dampened a lot
of that in our tests so for the first
round we're doing both of these products
in metal
I remember when I came to Sam what I
thought was the big idea it was to take
the best selling product that we had our
spatula and split in to give it some
teeth and voila we would have a talk but
that wasn't enough we had to do it the
same way let's do the impossible in
designing these tongs in pretty typical
gear fashion we wanted something that
was classic but it also had some
attitude to it we wanted to do something
different with the tongs we eventually
came upon a mechanism that's so
elegantly done that the entire thing
fits within the hinge itself it had been
for years dozens of prototype engineer
is calling us crazy all we knew was that
we wanted a pair of tongs that could
squeeze the lock and squeeze to unlock
we had one thing in mind we wanted them
to be incredibly simple and easy to use
instantly when you want it to lock it is
we finally did it
all you want to talk about the whisk
whisking is hard work but we've tried to
make it easier to design this kitchen
icon we got down with some science when
we started looking at other whisks we
found that the key to a great whisk was
actually vibration each wire is evenly
spaced so it can move independently and
vibrate as long as possible
we've created a handle that's
comfortable in a number of classic grips
including pencil paintbrush and pecan
we've placed the center-of-mass far back
on the handle to counterbalance the
whisk wires this reduces fatigue
allowing you to whisk for as long as you
need to
we're so proud of what we've done here
we've brought metal to life in a way
that we've kind of didn't think was
possible we hope you love it we can't
wait to hear what you think there are
generally four elements to a great
cocktail glassware ice liquid and
garnish
while most cocktail lovers wouldn't
settle for less than perfect ingredients
our glassware they're often forced to
settle for cloudy impure ice that looks
bad melts quickly and dilutes the
hard-earned drinks for the past four
years our team at Winter Smith's has
harnessed the power of clear ice to
bring cocktails cold brews and cold
beverages of all kinds to a whole new
level we were thrilled to have launched
two crystal-clear ice boats here on
Kickstarter the ice baller and the ice
chest after getting some great feedback
from our backers we have found a way to
take everything you already love about
winter Smith's and give you more of them
Phantom is a complete ice system that
can create seven clear ice spheres six
clear ice cubes eight clear Colin Spears
and sixteen clear standard cubes and the
best part
all these crystal-clear ice shapes can
be made with regular tap water and your
everyday freezer look out for more shape
choice coming soon - here's how it works
one fill the stainless steel container
with ordinary tap water to insert shape
tray and place in any freezer three
remove in about 24 to 30 hours and twist
the shape tray out of the container for
serve or store the ice for later
phantom increases the amount of ice that
you can create it also includes upgraded
double wall vacuum insulated stainless
steel which means improved quality and
durability in case there are any
slip-ups
now let's get a little nerdy and talk
about the signs that play clear ice is
created by controlling the freezing
process and removing any air bubbles or
impurities this also makes it denser so
it won't crack apart
keeping your drink cold for longer
another thing
Speirs have the lowest surface area to
volume ratio it will melt very slowly
while several small cubes have the
highest ratio and will provide faster
dilution for stronger drinks phantom
solves this with its variety of shapes
and sizes we could not be more excited
to be back on Kickstarter with phantom
your support has made winter Smith's of
reality and your incredible feedback
over the past four years helped us
develop phantom if you're looking for an
easy to use device that improves the
experience of enjoying any cold beverage
well you've come to the right place
Cheers cast iron has proven its value
for over a century but it didn't really
make sense to us that my grandmother
could buy a Griswold skillet for two
dollars and have it in the family for
generations
but when we set out to buy cast iron of
our own we had to spend 100 or $150 to
get the same quality yeah so when we set
out to make cast iron around we knew we
had to match the quality of the classic
brands but also the affordability that
made them accessible to everyone our
biggest challenge was to match the
smooth cooking surface of a century-old
well-seasoned skillet so we developed a
multi-step process that includes machine
edging sanding and polishing that unlike
others continues all the way up the
sidewalk this etched surface is perfect
for our USDA certified or
flaxseed oil bonding during the pre
seasoning process this particular oil
polymerizes to create a hard non-stick
surface that's a natural alternative to
the cheap sway based oil or paint other
skillets at this price point use the
long gurga nama candle settles in your
hand naturally while the thinner
connection points transfer less heat
from the pan to you we even added a
groove to hold the utensil Hana
thoughtful design elements like this one
are seen throughout the skillet in the
accessories
we really care about making great things
and together with our team a grater
goods
we've been successfully launching
products online and the major retailers
for years so we know we've made a great
skillet and the initial tooling is
finished but we need your help to scale
our manufacturing capacity so support
our campaign and whatever tier you can
and will be able to expand our
production levels which will solidify
our ability to keep these heirloom with
affordable and accessible tab
