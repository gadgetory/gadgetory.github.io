us are curious to see the mysteries of
the universe but most of them often the
most amazing ones are simply too blurry
and faint to our eye even when using a
large telescope but still we wanted to
see them so we worked to create the IVA
scope the enhanced vision telescope is a
new kind of instrument its power its
accuracy can show you objects millions
of light-years away in all their
glorious colors and details what I saw
was this vivid intensely covered
planetary nebula just like the
photographs you see in books I thought
it was amazing I actually majored in
physics and was really interested in
astronomy when I was at MIT and really
you used to look through a lot of hobby
telescopes and this was some of the best
that I've seen
I have always been passionate about
astronomy as I was a teenager I would
lie on the grass for hours at night
looking at all those stars imagining all
those objects I saw in my books I had a
telescope but still I felt
disappointment years later I thought of
an instrument capable of accumulating
light in a unique way
so we could finally see those nebulae
those galaxies all in a matter of
seconds and directly through its lens
that way we could create an incredibly
powerful telescope that is compact so
you can carry it anywhere thanks to its
sensors GPS and its internal map of
millions of stars it can pinpoint and
identify any object in the sky so it is
also easy to control with your
smartphone thus making astronomy easier
to share
but there is more Davis Cup experience
not only connects you to the sky it also
connects you to the scientific community
what's really exciting about the unis
talent project and our partnership is
the ability to leverage the telescope
this could be a very powerful tool for
astronomers who can basically engage
citizen scientists who have this you
know stellar instrument and ask them to
contribute to the research they're doing
what we'd like is a networked system of
cameras the sort of thing that eunice
teller is planning on where we can go
back and search through the raw data
from one or many cameras with thousands
of Eva scopes distributed all around the
planet will be able to increase our
knowledge in astronomy to be able to
study asteroids comets supernovae and
even this unknown astronomical events
with the Eva scope contributing to
science is simple and entertaining all
you need to do is activate campaign mode
on our app it will allow you to receive
observation requests from scientists
directly on your smartphone then
transfer the coordinates to you Eva
scope at the touch of a finger and
harvest data about an event all the
while seeing it happening directly
through the eyepiece for instance you'll
be able to see and track a near-earth
asteroid while helping its study
well I'm also an animator astronomer and
I have my own 8-inch for flector
telescope which I truly adore but I'm so
excited by the you know stellar
instrument and its ability to do much
more in terms of like gathering this is
an opportunity to look at the sky in in
new ways after three years of
development we now have a free working
prototype that we demoed all summer but
we need a support to go further
join us and transform astronomy forever
you
introducing B B is pioneering a whole
new category of toothbrush that has the
performance of an electric toothbrush
combined with all of the benefits of a
manual toothbrush imagine never having
to deal with charging messy cables
adapters and batteries but still get
that diamond clean that you and your
dentist have grown to love today people
are carrying around more electronic
devices than ever before in history and
unfortunately these devices come with
enormous baggage did you know that 15
billion batteries are sold every year
and that 87% end up in landfills 12
percent get incinerated and only 1
percent of them actually get recycled a
good majority of these batteries go into
items for personal care and 7.3 billion
people generate a lot of waste so we
started to ask ourselves is there
another way two and a half years later
we can finally say there is our patented
B clean technology makes it possible to
transform the energy from a simple twist
into over eighty-thousand tartar
fighting brushstrokes no batteries
cables adapters or chargers are required
if you love to travel enjoy the great
outdoors always on the go for business
want to make your home more eco-friendly
look no
this toothbrush was made just for you be
empowers you to enjoy the best dental
hygiene no matter where you are in the
world regardless of grit our mission is
to deliver a toothbrush mequivalent
are better than your electric toothbrush
and for you from meeting electricity
batteries cables or adapters when it
comes to your dental routine Plus every
bee comes with a snap-on travel case to
keep your brush safe and clean it also
comes with a one-year supply of 100%
biodegradable refills
Americans are busy people and more than
half of us are fueled by coffee in fact
the average coffee drinker drinks 3.2
cups of coffee per day
but we can waste nearly an hour of that
day just waiting for our coffee to cool
down we'll need to forget about it and
find a cold cup later or we heard you
drink it and burn our tongues ruining
our day
that's why we've developed thorough the
thorough magic mug is the fastest way to
have your coffee and drink it too with
ceramic mugs and paper cups it takes
almost 15 minutes for your coffee to
reach the ideal temperature and with
your dad's insulated travel mug it takes
well forever
thora will have your coffee perfect in
just two minutes
because as a team of Millennials we'd
forget about it if it took any longer
even better it'll keep that perfection
for hours so that your coffee is ready
when you are the secret behind thorough
is our space great insulation material
our non-toxic phase changing material
can quickly absorb any excess heat and
slowly release it over time to keep a
drink at the perfect temperature we
design our lid with bpa free
polypropylene to be as convenient as
possible with easy single-handed use and
a 20 degree slope that lets you get
every last drop without craning your
head best of all it's both spill proof
and leak proof so you can carry it
around worryfree Theroux fits into most
standard cup holders and is completely
non-electric allowing you to bring that
perfect cup of coffee with you anywhere
on the go all of this culminates with a
beautifully designed travel mug thanks
to some help from our friends at the
Rhode Island School of Design
this is the print pocket turn your phone
essentially into a Polaroid camera
snapping a photo and printing out a
physical version of that image
instantaneously the app itself allows
you to look at an image and it plays a
video clip that can trigger a video clip
from the moments surrounding that actual
image
hi Kickstarter four years ago you backed
our first product the print case this
year we released our second generation
the print book ad for iPhone which is
the smallest instant camera ever but
with thousands of Android users reaching
out to us we decided it was time to go
back to work and design their product
that's why we're here back on
Kickstarter we want to work with or
committee to make the print pocket for
Android the best possible
our goal was to create the smallest
instant camera on the market to achieve
this we remove the need for an ink
cartridge and switch to zero ink sticker
paper the colors on the paper reveal by
using thermal heating technology by
incorporating an expendable adapter
print pocket for Android fits any
smartphone with the USB supports our
product is the easiest to use it's very
simple interests and you plug your phone
in select a photo from your gallery or
Instagram snapchat and print our product
is portable so users can share photos
anytime anywhere it small enough to fit
in your bag your jackets and can even
attach to a neck or wrist strap so you
can carry it with you at all times it's
not all about the hardware though when
you started designing the print app it
was important for us to provide as many
customization options as possible from
filters frames captions and emojis users
have the creative freedom to tailor
their moments to their lifestyle to
fully experience the moment captured
we've integrated the ability to embed
videos into your photos the videos we
play inside the paper when you hover
over your photo with the app we've seen
users from all over the world using
print to inspire your projects from moon
decorations to DIY your creativity is
really the limit
if you're sitting with poor posture
you're not just creating chronic back
pain you're cutting off circulation of
blood lymphatic fluid restricting
digestion and creating a true health
problem for yourself the Center for
Disease Control confirms it by calling
sitting the new smoking you need to sit
correctly and you need the right chair
to do it for you introducing the back
strong chair the revolutionary
advancement to sitting in health while
making yourself stronger this novel
design was created by renowned doctor to
celebrities and the Los Angeles Clippers
Denis colonnello DC of Beverly Hills and
Jim Grove industrial designer whose
reputation at BMW design works and la
design are legendary the back strong
chair was developed with your actual
body mechanics in mind you will sit in
comfort you will sit in motion and you
will virtually eliminate your ability to
slouch hunched and sit wrong the back
strong chair instantly addresses every
issue first sit and it saddle hugs your
pelvis and gives you lower thoracic
support fitting to your physiology that
gets your hips and pelvis forward
upright and in an athletic position
putting the natural S curve in the spine
for natural support and second the form
fitted back is contoured for an ideal
supported sitting position to keep that
posture correct third is where the
unique sit and motion technology takes
over most chairs have stagnant saddles
attached to the post under the chair
the back strong saddle actually hangs
from the arms of the chair and moves
with you like a swing it attaches
precisely in a location that mimics the
ball and socket of your hip joint that
allows movement that means you hunch
forward and the chair reacts organ
amelie putting a gentle supportive
pressure in the small of your back and
the chair assists with your posture lean
back
the support increases the
in holding that nice s-curve lean
forward and the support follows you
it even assists you with a supportive
push when you get up being able to
naturally move your pelvis torso and
back while you sit with great posture
encourages muscular stretching core
strength lymphatic movement blood flow
the result less back pain more
flexibility and feeling great when you
get up without the stiffness when you
sit better you live better</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
