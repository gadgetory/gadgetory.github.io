now you can - with game ban the first
SmartWatch for gamers game band atari
edition puts the action right on your
wrist with watch optimized versions of
classic Atari games but game band
hardware is far from retro a methide
game band with an AMOLED display crystal
clear input the Qualcomm Snapdragon 2100
processor Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.2 the
Snapdragon wear 2100 takes on everything
that you need to have in a wearable
processor it's 30% smaller than its
predecessor it's 25% more power

smartwatches in the world and we didn't
stop there
game band supports upgradeable microSD
storage so you can carry your music
photos and files our micro sd solution
is really easy you just plug into any
computer and launch pixelfurnace and
place full PC games direct from the
driver brain risky with game band
terraria addition you can adventure on
your PC and then unplug and carry your
world with you on your wrist so you can
play from anywhere
our team pioneered this concept back in
2015 when we helps create a hugely
popular minecraft wearable we know what
it takes to build a great SmartWatch
that you'll want to wear every day I've
been designing wearable over a decade
where will is a very difficult space to
design within it needs to fit on the
person and be comfortable to wear
waterproof shockproof so we designed
this product using the best thing cost
construction approaches from the
watchmaking industry really what we were
trying to do was to create a physical
device something that exists
world that feels like it could exist in
any number of the sort of magical and
mysterious Wonderland that we see an
experience in every kind of game well
I'm really excited about game band in
part because I'm a game this is a
product made for me of course it's a
full-featured SmartWatch but it's more
than that as a storage medium that
allows people to take their games to
their friend's home or take it to
another PC it's not a generic SmartWatch
it's something that speaks to a gamer
for me it's kind of a no-brainer from
San Francisco to Barcelona our team's
been working really hard to maintain now
we need more support to get game on
channel please check our award backer
and help
my first impression of the taste-wise
tool is it fits great and it looks good
on my wrist each little point that you
touch it's very specific and I like how
it goes from being a traditional type
function looking down on it to being
able to interact with my first
impression was that it was a neat watch
but outside of that I didn't really know
that I'd explore the functionality or
could be use it in the real world
normally I wouldn't consider answering
in phone calls while I'm riding my bike
but with the tick watch - you just flip
your wrist twice answer the call with
another two times and hang it up it
tracks my workouts and it fits with my
lifestyle I'm not really what you call
tech savvy but good kick watch - and
really easy to use okay you go we want
sushi I can ask it to find a nearby
restaurant and it shows the rating and
the review and how far away it is
whenever I want to go for a run I can
always track all my fitness goals on it
it's really important for me to be able
to track how I want to do my workout if
I want to use it by calories or with
distance or based on my heart rate I was
really impressed with how convenient it
was the schedule tasks and meetings they
responded my voice commands very easily
okay Kiko schedule a meeting with Bob
Williams for 7:00 a.m. tomorrow I
thought it's pretty awesome that you
call an uber vibe just saying : Eber
into your watch and it would request one
for you it's great to be able to focus
on the tasks I have at hand instead of
having to check my phone all the time I
receive the text I simply glanced at my
watch I can just miss it until I'm ready
to respond later you know I don't see
how I've really been able to function
without it it really helped me be more
efficient it's made my life a lot easier
when it comes to my workouts or even
just my daily life okay Chico how's the
weather when I'm selecting a watch it
actually matters to me how it looks it's
cute I like it overall I was really
impressed with the take walks Q it's
fast it's intuitive it recognized my
voice faster than the other SmartWatch
have ever seen so I get to keep this
right
introducing Starbucks the first for
watch with integrated walkie-talkie
especially designed for outdoor
activities invented during the Second
World War
walkie talkies have always looked heavy
in both design for function and not for
assessed we wanted to change them and
develop a product that is different a
walkie talkie that is small enough to
fit into a SmartWatch without
compromising on the technical features
and design if you're an outdoor
enthusiast you know the situation and
you do not have cell phone signal when
it's just not convenient to dial numbers
or OpenX
sometimes it's just easier to come just
the button to push and calm
communication is important you don't
want to get lost when you're leaving
your comfort zone and trying to discover
new area Starbucks is not just a walkie
talkie
but a smart watch designed for outdoor
sport enthusiast star box comes with a
lot of features useful for your daily
life and improving your security
it's important for us to build up a
community of like-minded people so we
have included and after sharing your
experience with Starbucks Starbucks is
compatible with other walking toxins and
can also help to spread your message to
a group of people me or a team of
outdoor sports entities and it happened
and we got lost in nature we like to
travel to the untouched parts of nature
and found out there were a lot of places
with no bones so we wanted to create
something that helps us in this
situation
still it's convenient in daily life and
not having to care engineering and
design with a big check we wanted to
bring the technology into such a small
gadget and had to find a solution to
implement the antenna in the wristband
we have been working with different
suppliers for the housing and
electronics and trying to modify details
again and again
now we are ready to bring Starbucks
alive please support us today
and
you

customization of their watch to
encourage their creativity they can
match their clothes color by customizing
the waffle band and their watch face the

a huge part in the waffled construction
designed by an if' design awarded
designer and our attention to detail
ensures that our user interface is super
easy to use and feels incredibly natural

rubber which is durable and stretchable
