the
hello everybody I'm Dutch and this is
the chameleon
I threw like the entire Appalachian
Trail and a hammock and I've never been
satisfied with various hammocks that
I've camped with over the years so I
decided to engineer design and build
from the ground up what I believe to be
the perfect timing
the chameleon the chameleon will adapt
to your environment and is truly a
revolutionary piece of equipment and
will improve the way people camp forever
the tonic can be used in all season
while allowing you the flexibility to
adapt your comic delay in any direction
and to enter and exit either side of the
hammocks our patent-pending vision
zipper was specially designed by us for
hammocks the zipper is separable and
reversible so you can either have no bug
net to save weight and close the hammock
for a bug free experience for a touch a
vented top cover that will retain heat
inside the hammock most importantly you
can flip the bug net or top cover over
so you can lay in any direction for the
hammock body we started with our own
fabrics that is known for being light
strong and extremely comfortable with an
inner woven six-way ripstop grids that
was the first for the industry we offer
different options of this fabric to
accommodate a wide range of body weight
and with a large selection of colors so
you can design the perfect hammock for
your style the bug net invents are made
from ultralight no-see-um mesh to keep
the bugs at bay while still enabling
ventilation and visibility the top cover
is made of our lightweight 15 denier
argon 90 fabric which is water-resistant
retains heat and comes in a wide variety
of colors there is a specially designed
vent that not only allows the moisture
of your brush to exhaust but also gives
you a window to the world
I designed the titanium beetle buckle
for the chameleon and it is extremely
adjustable and detachable so you can
pack your wet suspension separately with
this system you can hang two hammocks
side-by-side with a spreader bar using
the same trees and under the same tarp
we are using our own proprietary Dyneema
webbing which is up to 30% lighter than
the standard polyester webbing of the
same
breaking string the numerous d-rings
inside and outside the hammock will
allow you to attach storage pockets pee
cloth and tile points that can be
adjusted from inside the hammock on the
outside there are multiple paths cooks
for securing different lengths under
clothes the chameleon is made by
dedicated craftsmen and is of course
made right here in our Lancaster
Pennsylvania facility hi I'm Cody Guster
I'm an avid outdoorsman father of five a
husband at a major line and the founder
of Google pack so the time our show but
every waking moment I could amount from
hiking to exploring the hunting I fished
on four continents hunted on three and
going to most remote areas is what
drives me what pushes me
it's what I'm all about I bought
backpack after backpack in search of one
thing what product or brand do I need to
have to enable me to go longer further
off the beaten path when I was much
younger I could handle the back stress
and shoulder pain only now to pay the
price of my younger transgressions my
upper and lower backs have permanent
damage and it makes it very difficult go
on many of the longer excursions I long
through I needed a solution that allowed
me to continue to follow my passion but
take the stress of the pressure point
and we're living that's how the Google
packs were started a system to put the
heavy weight from my essential gear on
the strongest muscles in my body
my legs when I say remote I mean hike in
20 miles the camp from camp and then go
from there to find the objective
the leg pack system can replace a
backpack or become a very strong
complement to your hunting gear as you
see in the photos I still use my
backpack and now it's missing in our 20
to 45 pounds retail I put that on my
legs as I designed this I always kept
versatility in line because I have hiked
out of the 60 and 70 degree angle cannon
I voted over many rockman giving to my
advantage point with a unique four point
attachment system and the versatility of
the pack of justice system nothing's
ever de limits my movies I've been in
the prototype phase and testing for over
10 years every hunt or fish trip I try
to improve the pack design I have tested
this at most people who know me have
also been broadened the testing and
feedback of the packs you haven't gone
anywhere with me in my family about
testing the or being a scientific study
whether they want to or not passionate
about the group pack system and helping
knows who also suffer from the pains of
an uncomfortable backpack allowing them
to get in the game on the trail to the
news pass and exploit our great
wilderness I have spent countless hours
with fabrication companies researching
bauble thread design average sources
eating a product that I know could keep
up with the environment and the
wilderness I am confident that you will
see and understand the work and hard
work of the fax system yourself and when
you receive yours this is just the
beginning of a journey and where you
will begin and
as outdoor enthusiasts we know how
important good Footwear is and it
deserves our full attention as YouTube
packing for a trip is as important as
the trip itself space is at a premium
what should I bring
what should I sacrifice this problem is
what inspired I would to develop its
unique hiking footwear content you can
now leave home and head for the trail
knowing you have all you need I breed is
a fantastic hiking shoe but that's not
all it is and this is a huge distinction
it's also a great hiking sandal and a
comfortable kick around camp shoe all in
one if it were as easy as strapping a
sneaker to a sandal the convertible shoe
would have been invented years ago I've
read is so much more than the sum of its
parts
cleverly designed and engineered by
uncompromising hard-headed outdoor
enthusiasts who demand more from our
Footwear ibrid has innovated a
breakthrough component system creating a
totally new Footwear category that
builds on the strength of the shoe and
the salmon reinventing what great
Footwear is all about comfortable and
sturdy our sandal is a trailblazer
it's unique council grips to any surface
from riverbed to mountainside this shoe
is a tank and a slipper tough yet
comfortable from Seoul to laces the
ibrid is a strong comfortable
multi-purpose hiking shoe that can take
you the distance perfect for hiking
fishing traveling or simply enjoying
life help us help you get a better
footing because that's what it's all
about
the ibrid concept is a natural
combination of comfort and versatility
it's a hiking shoe when you need it and
a sandal when you feel like it
from here on nature will be even more
friendly and enjoyable Darwin may have
said life is a struggle but ibrid lets
you decide who comes out on top
at our proactol we love high voltage
shooting spark and lighting up the party
after bringing the Tesla coils alive we
knew it was time to put one in
everyone's pocket
introducing the sparker a plasma lighter
and flashlights and one the flashlight
is a 1 watt dimmable LED Becca run for 4
hours at full price the removable lid
doubles as a diffusers transforming the
light into a lantern the plasma lighter
uses electricity to create a windproof
solution that requires no claim using or
fuel the sparker is great for any of
your outdoor adventures
light in your barbecue around your house
or simply being prepared
Barger is also USB rechargeable feedback
