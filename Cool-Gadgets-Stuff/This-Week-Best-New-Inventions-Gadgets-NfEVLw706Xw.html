dinner cooked in your own kitchen from
scratch all with just the simple tap of
your finger some might describe it as
the future others a lifesaver
we call it Suvi the refrigerated
multi-zone kitchen robot cooker plus
smart meal kit delivery service life is

providing nutritious fresh flavorful
meals for our families has become such a
challenge the time and energy it takes

don't have it our fresh chef inspired

raw ingredients that can be customized
to your tastes and delivered straight to

weekly zoovie automatically detects your

algorithms tell the appliance exactly
when to start cooking
so everything is ready for you at the
same time all you have to do is load
your soupy in the morning go about your
business and come home to enjoy a fully
cooked dinner no prep no stress just to
perfectly prepare dinner that's ready
when you are imagine the freedom and
time you'll save hi I'm Kevin a former
Apple engineer and I'm Robin founder of
review.com two years ago we set out to
design a revolutionary cooking appliance
that was beyond anything on the market
we were tired of takeout and delivery
and we found that traditional meal kits
took too long to prep and cleanup we
knew there was a better way and that's
when we invented Suvi the smart
refrigerated multi-zone cooker that
works with meals of fresh raw ready to
cook ingredients we estimate that with
Suvi you can save an average of six
hours per week that's six hours you
could be spending with your friends or
family or just be more productive and
getting more things done you can always
put your own food in Suvi but if you
order Suvi meals
there's no prep required you can pick
one of our chef's design meals that
serve two to four people
or customize your own from over 10,000
combinations meals are made up of raw
proteins fresh vegetables raw starches
and delicious sauces created by our
gourmet chefs to cook your fish chicken
and meat Suvi uses the French MasterChef
technique of sous-vide
heating them vacuum sealed in a water
bath to the perfect serving temperature
pastas and grains are boiled and steamed
vegetables are cooked flawlessly using
steam and then roasting and soomi even
automatically Dreams pasta for al dente
perfection unlike traditional sous-vide
systems su V has a broiler that roasts
your vegetables and proteins right
before it's time to serve your meal and
our award-winning chefs have created
sauces and garnishes to give your meals
a five-star finish growing my own
organic food and sharing it with my
loved ones for me this is the essence of
a good life yet for one of our most
important vegetables there is no
satisfying solution for home production
and that is the potato I love potatoes
and I want them to be fresh and organic
just like my other crops but growing
potatoes the traditional way requires a
lot of work and loads of space and with
pest problems harvesting can easily turn
into a very disappointing experience as
professional designers of raised beds
and smart guarding solutions we thought
it's really time to change the way we
grow potatoes so we created Paul potato
the ready to plant potato tower
compared to traditional planting methods
it allows you to grow up to ten times
the amount of potatoes on the same space
this is the result of an intensive
two-year research in cooperation with
leading gardeners and the University of
Natural Resources in vienna paul potato
is easy to set up and offers various
ways to plant potatoes the modular tower
has a sophisticated water distribution
system a bill to involve protection and
a space-saving design that work together
to maximize efficiency and yield the
handling of paul potato is really simple
you just fill the compartments with
potting soil and put in the seedlings of
your choice after planting all you have
to do is water your potatoes once in a
while and watch them grow
after 16 to 20 weeks it's time to enjoy
the pleasures of harvesting your very
own potatoes
Paul potato is designed to make it
simple and easy for you to grow and
consume organic potatoes right from your
own backyard back us now and we promise
once you've tasted the incredible
flavors of freshly harvested biological
homegrown potatoes you'll want to have
them again and again till then happy
planting and bone Appetit

Portland
does your bedroom look like this
what's creeping you awake
oh that's it that's the sound of knowing
you won't sleep tonight you are not a
born snore it can develop at any time up
to 64 percent of couples have a snoring
partner and it makes 25 percent of
couples sleep apart and it's not just
your relationship that's in danger
your health is - when you fall asleep
your jaw relaxes and drops back closing
down your airway to the point where it
vibrates as you breathe this doesn't
just keep the whole house awake it also
stops you from getting the deep
refreshing sleep you need and that can
have serious implications for in your
life such as fatigue irritability
headaches restlessness poor
concentration diminished productivity
and adverse effects on your heart and
brain you could spend hundreds of
dollars on quick fix solutions with bold
claims and disappointing results
you could just grin and bear it or even
try Snorlax these super simple strips
are easy to apply and comfortable to
wear and they're quick and painless to
remove 100% cotton and fully
biodegradable Snorlax keeps your jaw in
its normal position and your airway open
stopping your snore in its tracks our
prototypes have already rescued
countless relationships restoring health
and harmony but we need your support to
get Snorlax into full production back us
on Kickstarter and help us ensure
Snorlax isn't just the best solution on
the market it's the most affordable - we
can't fix everything but a good night
sleeps a great place to start
sleep soundly with Snorlax
breathing it's great it feels so good if
you're watching this video you're
probably breathing right now you know
it's not great congestion not breathing
properly hurts look at this guy holding
his eyes he's trying to tell you that
he's congested and aches all over we
even added circles behind him to
emphasize his pain
good job circles if you suffer from
congestion you have two options stop
breathing which is not really an option
or uses steam device yes those blender
looking things they're big too big to
carry everywhere and maintain a constant
treatment meet a via a steam device with
two main advantages it uses
nanoparticles for the most effective
sinus allergy and congestion treatment
and it's portable
what's nano steam it's steamed downsized
to the smallest particles possible while
a typical steam inhaler produces thick
particles of steam that cannot penetrate
through the walls of the nose into the
sinuses obvious nanoparticles are less
than five microns these micro particles
can easily penetrate beyond the nasal
walls and into the sinus cavities
clearing everything that stops you from
getting your best breathing in just 10
minutes you'll be breathing clearly all
you need to do is add saline adjust the
temperature and then place the nozzle
under your nose here's the guy from
before after he you stopping now he's
showing you that he's breathing great
nose circles around him
thanks to obvious adjustable temperature
controls if you feel your steam needs to
be warmer than just adjusted and since a
via is small enough to fit any bag and
it's also chargeable you can take it and
use it anywhere breathe clearly in the
office and the park breathe as you bike
yeah you can go back to doing sports
because ah via has lied enough to carry
anywhere besides clearing congestion a
via can be used orally to humidify the
vocal cords dampen a dry throat or just
improve breathing in general oh look a
surfer guy he doesn't have any
congestion just wants to breathe men
obvious created by or medical a
long-standing company the field of
respiratory devices in its essence a via
is patent-pending tech created with the
components of an already working system
but measured down to a portable easy to
use all-around perfect device so if you
to feel that better breathing can
improve your life
get off you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
