searching for the best way to complete
every part one thing in particular was
material press I thought they were far
too many tools needed to complete such a
simple job I wanted one tool that could
do it all but it didn't exist so I
decided to invent one it's called the
Rufus offering over three hundred and
fifty percent more functionality than
any other line tool it took me seven
years but I finally figured it out
it also has applications in other fields
such as field fabrication and roof
plumbing I was a little girl um but she
go to the game your plan for the game
you're playing
see again girl I was
she called the games all day
my old lady
pinger la climbed off we all that
mountain
then the bonus tussle drop
and I can see her all the smiley
falling she don't stop she don't stop no
I was
those are the gay dog
I wanted to but cheaper for the game
you're playing
a game Konami
so true
wasted on
just tryna get twelve inhale
under three lies
away
you talking long
hi i'm mike scully creator of the lever
gear tool card I founded lever gear to
design products that solve real problems
look great and will last forever
we all have little projects that pop up
in life and they don't always happen
when our tools are handy it's annoying
that to spend time chasing down tools
for a job that should take 10 seconds if
you're like me it usually ends up
getting added to your to-do list that's
why we created the lever gear tool card
it's a multi-tool the size of a credit
card that has 40 different tools always
with you so you can get things done I
like to be prepared to handle any task
but I also hate the idea of carrying
around a lot of extra stuff a credit
card size tool that could disappear in
my wallet seemed like the perfect
solution we developed the tool card with
a simple premise the real estate in your
pocket is precious so you should own
stuff that's actually worth carrying we
began our design process by
brainstorming all of the functions we
could pack into a credit card sized
multi-tool we also tested every card
that existed on the market we thought a
lot about the design and layout of the
tool card by nesting the tools we were
able to add tools and reduce weight
without sacrificing strength we've kept
the edges smooth so it feels great in
your hand when you're using the tools we
chose not to have an exposed blade so
the tool card is TSA compliant and it
won't damage your wallet instead we
added a blade protected by the can
opener you can cut cord but not your
fingers the tool card weighs only one
ounce flips easily into your wallet so
you won't notice it until you need it or
ditch the wallet altogether innovative
money clip is designed to snap on with a
click and disassemble with ease no extra
tool is required
no fasteners to lose so you can quickly
switch from wallet card to money clip
tool card is made in America from blade
quality 420 stainless steel which is
then heat treated for excellent strength
and hardness
it's then bead blasted for a
professional finish and laser etched for
rich permanent graphics
Hey
hi I'm Terry Scott
thanks for dropping in the solo you may
have heard the saying that you never
have more time than you do right now in
some cases this may be true
imagine having a product that can
maximize your time and be more efficient
over the next couple of minutes I'm
about to introduce you to an amazing
product that I've designed and been
working on with my dedicated team six
years ago I was working on my car tools
everywhere frustrated then the light
bulb went off and I had this fantastic
idea all shed warriors know when new
tools are in their toolbox we all know
where to find them when we're immersed
in the job at hand our tools end up
anywhere and everywhere when you tools
it all over the place
shouldn't your eyes be on the job
instead of looking for your tools do you
find that your phone always ring when
your hands are due or using the handheld
light you can't find the right spot for
it or someone to hold it for you not
only is this frustrating a waste time
and it's your time it could be better
spent doing something else now I'd like
to introduce you to my product Neto
comprising of three flexible arms with
interchangeable attachments in a
nutshell Neto is quality there's a
magnet board magnet tub phone holder
work light and the funny and in the
future many more exciting new products
and attachments let the seed oil vans in
ask at whether you're working on a car
or something as intricate as a laptop
pretty much anyone using hand tools is
going to benefit from Neto with an
adaptable base that can go everywhere
Neto gives you a third or even a fifth
hand
it's a highly functional product
delivering performance and convenience
with safety in your workspace now that
you've seen Neto you can see how you'll
become more efficient with an extra set
of hands on
afternoon chef after six years of hard
yard and development I'm really excited
that people all over the world are about
to use neato
I spent seven years working as a
mechanic so I saw firsthand the kind of
handheld lights and area lights that
were being used they were cheap with dim
underpowered bulbs and flimsy
construction I'd constantly be buying
new ones because they always fell apart
even with newer LED lights the
electronics often broke creating an
unreliable life
I remember thinking then that car shops
deserved a better life and so did
truckers electricians first responders
anyone else who works with their hand
when I started working at the gas
solution I knew this was a project that
I wanted to pursue I came up with a
rough concept a handheld area light that
was bright cordless portable durable a
light that was over engineered to stand
up to years of abuse and harsh condition
I pitched the idea to our CEO Carrie
Smith and he actually encouraged me to
pursue this project and see where it led
and now after two years and countless
hours of work we have the big-ass light
bar we wanted a light that was bright as
hell with five thousand lumen at maximum
output it's everything you need up to 48
hours of continuous light on battery
power the light bar itself is made of a
chemically resistant die tell glass
filled nylon that means that you can
spray it off with common chemicals the
shape of the light itself was actually
designed to prevent it from rolling away
if you dropped it or set it on the hood
of a car with this ip66
rating you can take it outside and not
worry if it gets rained on
we know that you were going to toss
around the life on so we overmolded it
in key areas with the technology called
versa flex to be shock absorbent
now we're closer than ever to making the
big-ass light bars a reality we need
your help for the final stage though
production if your assistant will be
able to begin manufacturing and start
shipping the light bar to all
contractors first responders soldiers
police officers and anyone else who
demands a product that they can take to
hell in that in return you'll be the
first customers to receive the
revolutionary big-ass light bar this has
been a passionate project to me it's
something that I've worked on for years
and I'm very proud of what we've come up
with it is absolutely the best handheld
area light in the world bar none
we are the tool masters the tinkers the
mechanics and the craftsmen we are the
people who work with our hands fixing
building and creating we know that
detail matters every second productivity
counts revolutionize the way you work
with a grid lack streamline your
workflow and get the job done
hey Kickstarter I'm Tom I'm an f16
mechanic in an Air Force and I'll tire
to my tools lighting off the aircraft so
it's that out to create a product that
would keep everything you need to do
your job
at your fingertips so after two and a
half years of prototyping in my basement
I came up with a grip a flexible
non-slip tool tray with the ability to
hold tools at extreme angles for variety
of work surfaces we launched the product
four months ago at the world largest air
show and sold out of the original grip
mat within the first week because we're
not only love the product with a
reinforcer decision there going into
other markets and expanding our product
so I got to work and design three new
grid mat a large medium and small we are
excited to launch these three products
to the Kickstarter community never chase
to run away screw again the small grid
mat is comprised of six compartments
that will keep your hardware organized
within arm's reach the medium is
designed to help keep your hand tools
together in close proximity such as
under the hood or on top of the ladder
the large is designed for more involved
jobs where a handful of tools just won't
cut it
aggravation industries we believe that
complexity of T our grip mats are
comprised of our unique formula
specially designed to provide high end
friction and chemical resistance thank
you for watching our video and please
help us make this a reality by
supporting our campaign and sharing our
story
