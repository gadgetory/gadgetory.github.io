my name is Henry I am CEO and founder of
impossible technology let's talk about
bikes weathering piles on the sidewalks
or in the rows upon rows of sleek
branded rentals bikes they are all about
what you see introducing the bike of
tomorrow it's all about what you don't
see you don't see heavy automatic
batteries you don't see rusty tangled
metal you don't see tricky locks and Len
to change and when you are not riding it
you don't see anything at all that's
because it's the world's smallest
folding electric bicycles inside out
every piece is revolutionary a circular
frame distributes the riders weight
evenly across the ground a
state-of-the-art brushless motor keeps
you going
it's made of lightweight carbon-fiber so
we can carry it with a few well-placed
feet of steel so it can carry you
charges anywhere and store it in the
waterproof cover it's as durable as your
bike as easy as your electric scooter
and as portable as your laptop
impossible has a removable batteries
installed in the buddy frame that makes
it invisible so you can enjoy your sleek
and clean design you can simply take it
out and replace it with not a pair this
makes impossible the best travel
companion you can take it with you in a
car train boat and even an airplane
it's transportation from the future 40%
of its parts are customizable including
handlebars and wheel we have removable
covers of all colors and for all
personalities available in white black
and exclusive colors of red blue and
original carbon-fiber it won't cloud
your courtyard or bother your mind with
a carbon-fiber frame that fits into a
backpack and the motor that allows you
to cruise at a reading speed for almost
an hour you can get everywhere from
anywhere and nobody needs to know how
you did it
we
you
you
do you love biking have you ever run
into the situation of needing to fix or
adjust your bike on the road but since
the tools were too bulky you do not have
them with you introducing our
award-winning next generation product
locate 2.0 which replaces 28 tools that
weighs only 130 grams now you can have
your mind at ease while you're out there
riding with only a couple moves you
already have a fully functioning tool
that can fix any prop on your bike hello
my name is Bryan Borchers and I russian
river cycle service I've been in the
bicycle industry for a good 20 years
never created by an a specialty tool
when I need it for the job this tool has
everything that you could possibly need
I would probably use this primarily in
my shop not just out on the trail the
idea of it is to have everything in your
pocket when you're out on the road it
has pretty much every tool you can
imagine that you would need so you've
got flat blade Phillips blade torque
Allen pocket has a bottle cap opener
quarter inch drive ratchet driver starts
a two millimeter allen and goes up to
six millimeter has a Philips a flat
blade and a chain rule once you take out
the attachment you assemble it for
whatever it is that you're working on
flip it into the carabiner
turn it over lock the carabiner down on
it and it's ready to go
this tool is made out of chromoly steel
they use the same materials in axles and
gear fabrication what I have here is the
15 millimeter open end wrench when
you're holding it in your hand it fits
really nicely you could definitely put
legitimate full-on torque on this wrench
you pretty much could disassemble eight
things on a bicycle on the roadside and
put it back together more important
waited extremely important effect I
won't get way down by this school you
can take it anywhere you can forget
about it even because you can clip it to
your belt inviting in the Napa Valley is
an unbelievable experience
it helps me connect to nature saving
weight is what every cycle is me you
don't have to bring the whole toolkit
five to seven tools you just need one to
compact and lightweight and easy to take
out so it really just gives the
opportunity to fix any problem you won't
even notice that commuters in pocket
are you the type of person who enjoys
the freedom of using your bike loves
going for an adventure through the
forest or takes pleasure in going for a
ride on the sunny day then you know to
be an efficient biker you need to be
organized thankfully Zeljko has created
the wing barn the wing bars is a smart
handlebar connected to your smartphone
with the wing bar you'll never get lost
anymore thanks to its turn-by-turn
navigation system the wing bar can guide
you through any adventures by the
blinking of its lights connected to your
smartphone this easy and safe navigation
tool will tell you when to turn left
right go backwards or even if someone is
trying to call you as we all know bike
theft is a major problem in many cities
and getting your bike stolen is not
exactly what you had in mind that's why
we created a global GPS solution in case
of theft you will get an immediate alert
on your phone and will be able to track
its location on a very precise scale
thanks to the dedicated wink app you
simply need to identify yourself using
Bluetooth or tag that's it
now you're free to control your bike via
your smartphone and if by chance you
can't remember where you parked your
bike the app gets you straight to it the
Wang bar is also a fitness tracker that
will give you a summary of your rides
even in the darkness you can show up it
integrates smart powerful headlights
which will help you to be seen by others
and as we know that you care about the
style of your bike we've designed two
different types of handlebars to meet
your expectations today we can provide
the best technology on the market
because it is firmly attached to your
bike making any bike smart look no
further the wing bar is here
you
