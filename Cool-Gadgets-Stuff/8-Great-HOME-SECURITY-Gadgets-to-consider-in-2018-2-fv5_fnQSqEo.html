hello Kickstarter my name is Nils three
years ago my team and I came to you with
an idea we wanted to let you know your
home was safe without invasive cameras
or complex security systems that's why
we designed point thanks to you the
point is now used by thousands of people
across the world today we're launching
the next generation we've learned from
our community and we've seen of families
and neighbors come together when the
unexpected happens that's why the new
point is fool home alarm sign for
collaboration we think you'll love it
meet Susan Bob and Judy Anderson and
their neighbor Alex this is their home
with point point consent smoke
point can sense noise
point consents movement
traditional alarm systems rely on many
individual devices and sensors the point
combines sound motion and environmental
sensors in one device through machine
learning it identifies what's happening
in the environment much like a brain
when point detects something important a
message is sent to a group of people
chosen by you so you can help each other
out when needed keeping our home safe is
important to all of us getting your
house broken into sucks it's not just
the stuff that you lose but because your
home feels violated what you want is to
keep it from happening in the first
place that's why we created Kuna help
you prevent break-ins
this is Kuna Kuna is a smart Wi-Fi
camera built into an elegant outdoor
light fixture it detects people and
alerts you so you can see and talk to
them on your smartphone hey could you
leave the package out front we're a
little busy it's the best way to
actively prevent break-ins most
burglaries are crimes of opportunity the
burglars were actually knock on your
door to see if you're home and when they
realize you're not home they'll attempt
to enter your house keeping them outside
is the most important thing you can do
and Kuna allows you to
you can deter burglars by talking to
them or setting off Kona's alarm yeah no
thanks
they'll leave and all this happens when
they're still outside before they even
try to break it making your home safer
it shouldn't be a chore for one of these
you have to climb in the Attic run wires
drill holes it's a pain and it's not
cheap that's why we built Kuna into an
outdoor light just replace your old
light fixture and use your existing
wiring connect Kona to Wi-Fi and you're
done it'll take 15 minutes
do we want Kona to look good no matter
where it is so we're making it in three
different styles to match your house you
can put kuna anywhere
front door back door even the garage to
watch your car oh and your light gets
smarter too if you can control it with
the Cunha app turn it on turn it off set
a schedule or just let it turn on
automatically when it gets dark when
there's a person you only want to get
alerts that matter Cunha ignores trees
and small animals and it recognizes
people's behaviors so if you don't want
to know every time your spouse goes out
jogging
you can tell Cunha to alert you only for
visitors waiting at the door and it'll
learn and get smarter over time
