communication between drivers on the
road can become a better place this idea
led to our creation of car week your
faithful little driving continued car
wink reinvents the way drivers
communicate with each other car wayne
pedestrian cross the hands-free voice
control function allows for a safe and
convenient communication between drivers
fueled by the power of the sun car wink
solar charging means you will never have
to worry about running out of juice
built on the foundation of driver
interaction car wink is here to relay
your message and enhance driver
relationships going
we aim to minimize road rage and stress
for drivers let car we smile open up
your horizons and show you a brand new
adventure
but amazing journeys will you create
this is out of Herman compared to the
other car extinguishers it goes up the
veteran track let's see what exactly it
can do
generally speaking car fire always
secure firstly around engine usually the
driver cannot that is in time and the
situation become more serious
ten minutes past the situation will end
like this
if you have out of Herman the situation
will be completely different now I'm in
saline and out of Herman in the engine
compartment
these two magnets will be attached to
the engine compartment
the installation is within 30 seconds
not only the installation is fast but it
also can put out fire quickly when the
temperature in the engine compartment is
up to 600 Celsius
the pillion sensor will detect the high
temperature or up and higher it will
activate the auto extinguisher and start
to release the extinguishing the car
fire can be put out within 30 seconds
the air bubble is the first proven
technology that effectively removes more
than 95% of both nitrogen dioxide and
particles from inside a car it's now
well known that air pollution affects
our health especially those living in
cities however what most people aren't
aware of is just how bad the air in your
car can be nitrogen dioxide levels
primarily from diesel emissions inside
your car cabin can be 10 times over the
w-h-o limit sitting in a vehicle with
your windows up in traffic is not the
safe haven you might think that it is
that's why we've created the air bubble
the first proven technology of its kind
that removes all elements of air
pollution including nitrogen dioxide
from inside a car cabin the air bubble
is optimized to protect drivers and
their families in polluted cities
and professional drivers who spend hours
on the road designed to fit on the back
of the car headrest the air bubble works
by drawing polluted air circulating
inside the car into the unit before our
proprietary filtration technology
removes gaseous particles bacteria dust
and odors clean air is then released
back to the driver and passengers in the
most efficient way possible using
advanced air flow dynamics what we
breathe matters an a lab son mission to
reduce people's exposure to air
pollution like most parents are always
conscious to avoid the high levels of
air pollution found on busy roads what I
hadn't realized is the levels of harmful
nitrogen dioxide can be even higher
inside our cars our research is a real
wake-up call as I realize the impact
this could have on the health of my son
and of other children and our labs
knowing we had the only proven
technology to effectively remove
nitrogen dioxide I knew it was our duty
without the air bubble giving people the
power to protect themselves and their
families the air bubble has been
designed by our team of hemisphere
chemists and airflow engineers at air
labs in our research laboratory here in
Copenhagen it uses our proprietary
filtration technology developed over the
past decade at air labs we specialize in
creating clean air zones for people the
technology inside the air bubble has
proven itself inside of clean air bus
shelters and in a clean air bench
commissioned by Transport for London
during the past year we have focused on
creating a clean air zone inside of a
car and on making the air bubble a
reality
hi everybody I'm Ted and this is the
bolster boost a lateral back support for
a car
it makes everyday driving more exciting
by massively amplifying the feedback you
actually become a better driver more
sensitive and in tune with the road my
daily commute was on a twisty mountain
road everything felt tight the tires
suspension steering everything except me
my torso would slosh from side to side
with every curve I tense up and hang on
to the wheel for support resisting these
forces got to be very distracting and
tiresome the problem is the car seats
are one size fits all and so the side
bolsters are angled which can't give
enough lateral support for spirited
cornering the typical solution is
upgrading to a recent seat in harness
he's an expensive and awkward for daily
driving I wanted something I could add
to my stock seat to get more support
after four years and more than 40
prototypes we perfected a design that
really works and feels fantastic
the bolster boost connects you tight to
the car like a custom sized racing seat
provides a sturdy and static surface to
lean on while cornering works quite
simply as a wedge that holds you firmly
to the seat when you lean back on the
laces it pulls the pads in squeezing
your side's a special material grips the
seat and locks you into place by simply
changing the lace tension you can
precisely control the clamping force
this makes it much more comfortable than
a racing seat because you can easily
adjust the strength and location of the
side supports plus it installs and
removes in seconds
with the booster boost your car feels
livelier more responsive imagine
relaxing into the corners hands light on
the wheel
mr. wrinkles crisper more immediate
every acceleration seems amplified Pat's
touch you on a large and very sensitive
part of your body all this additional
contact area creates a new dimension of
feedback that quickens your reaction
times and inspires more precise a car
controller driving is intensely sensual
and engaging as you become one with a
car hotter you corner the tighter it
hugs with the bolster booster your car
becomes your partner in advance holding
and guiding in a tight race

comm one year go we promised you a solar
car that costs 16,000 L and has a range
of 250 kilometres and guess what we made
it
but why did we build a sign humanity
burns 61% of the world's oil resources
only for transportation we were sick of
being part of this problem so we decided
to build a car in our garage which will
become a part of the solution
spread our vision we launched a
crowdfunding campaign with an
unbelievable result the campaign became
a huge success thousands of people from
all over the world started to support us
we recruited an excellent team and moved
into a bigger office with the right
partners on our side we could finally
start building design cars body is
covered with highly efficient solar
cells thanks to this feature design
becomes a mobile power station you can
also recharge other electric vehicles
anywhere anytime as an air filter we
integrated a special moss it filters up
to 20% of the fine dust while requiring
no special care the sign cost 16,000
years concerning the battery you can
either decide to rent it or buy it right
away we kept the car as simple as
possible without compromising on safety
and usability so no motors has only come
so far because of all the great people
who share our vision and supported us
from the very beginning to go into
volume production we need 5000
pre-orders together we can achieve this
goal and end our dependency on oil</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
