was a time when coffee was simple just
add water coffee and heat it was a
little bitter though it needed cream and
sugar then coffee changed it became
great it's now bright sweet and fruity
this is called third wave coffee but
things also became complicated those
that care have to brew manually to
control all the variables by hand the
third wave of coffee is worth all the
effort but it will be even better if it
took no effort at all this is part it
uses clever designs through with lab
grade precision and full automation
third wave coffee is finally simple if
you've ever made third wave coffee you
know it goes like this pretty wet your
paper filter add coffee make sure your
grounds on the right size the water
flows in the best but not too fast pour
a little water to let it bloom mix do it
quickly you only have ten seconds wait
for 20 slowly pour control your float so
our paddles are popular just don't hold
it in one click what a temperature is
key should be between 92 and 96 degrees
Celsius the end that's a cone gently
good luck but with the perks all you do
is add water coffee and push a button
your coffee is perfect every time so how
does it work for teas your water to a
precise brewing temperature maintains it
the entire time this is nearly
impossible using any other method and
make sure you're getting the most out of
every cup but most importantly for
bottom-up circulation flushes away
carbon dioxide and keep each coffee
particles evenly suspended in water this
keeps your coffee from tasting better
and after the timer stops cleanup is
painless and you'll never have that
escale again this kind of precision and
automation can only be found in
elaborate coffee machines that cost over
$10,000 now we're making it accessible
to everyone my name is Jacob smack never
since I had my first cup of third wave
coffee I wanted to learn everything
about it from sourcing to roasting to
brewing every step along the way
requires a high degree of precision and
the last step is the hardest
I want to change that so I invented perc
I built several prototypes tested them
and toured with them across the country
and got great feedback now I need your
help to make perc at volume so that
third wave coffee can finally be simple
oh it is just t does t too
