designed and engineered in australia
compact enough to carry everyday

the tactic rm250 a complete toolkit in
your hand we choose to go to the moon in
this decade and do the other things not
because they are easy but because they
are hard
in 2017 we launched the highly
successful Trappist one moon phase
celebrating the significant discovery of
the Trappist one system of planets that
whole potential for life now in 2019
we're celebrating another significant
milestone in the history of mankind the
50th anniversary of our landing on the
moon we've teamed up with NASA to create
a collection of space inspired watches
that pay tribute to the Apollo missions
and the day that Neil Armstrong and Buzz
Aldrin landed on the moon July 20th 1969
introducing the Trappist 1 NASA Edition
available in both limited edition
automatic and quartz models we've had a
ton of positive feedback on our previous
Trappist 1 design but we've spent the
last two years making these NASA
editions even better now with a Miata
automatic movement and custom rotor even
brighter loon constantly glowing gas
field tritium tubes starves on the
sweeping seconds hand
better dial visibility and an overall
otherworldly design resembling the
cupola window on the International Space
Station the grill gives you a sense of
looking out into space the stars on the
dial are an actual map of the
constellations surrounding the Trappist
one system the domed crystal is made
from a space-age material called HESA
light I was initially requested by NASA
during the Apollo missions to withstand
the harsh environment of space
the Trappist one NASA uses its orbiting
planetary system to tell you the time
hour and minute planets rotate around
the dial making it an easy read on a
unique display the watches are also
available in a quartz model featuring an
engraved 50th anniversary commemorative
case pack we pride ourselves in the fine
craftsmanship of our time pieces which
are hand assembled by true watchmakers
with these Kickstarter only rewards
you're getting the coolest high quality
watch unlike any other at an insane
price backk this project and be a part
of our mission to create the most
interesting watches on earth
hey it's Dan with AMT here for the ex
driver and once you use this tool you're
gonna be screwing everything in sight
let's take a look the hex driver is a
one-size-fits-all solution for the most
common sizes of hex key fasteners simply
push fasten our proprietary bit does the
rest and if you need a little bit more
extra torque we also provide an L key
which uses the same technology a regular
so that X Keys takes forever to use
their own ergonomic and you never pick
the right key on the first try if you
haven't even lost the key you need
already the hex driver eliminates all of
these issues it saves time space and
frustration any size big or small the
hex driver can fit them all what is this
you don't need this anymore
the hex drivers through your bike your
boat your car furniture machinery and
much much more
look the hex driver is gonna save you so
much time you're gonna be saying if it
aint orange and grey it's just in the
way here's how to back the project when
you select reward one you're gonna get
one hex key screwdriver and one L key
for only $20 however if you want a
little bit more select reward - and
you'll get two of each for only $38 this
keyboard will change the way everyone
types introducing the Keystone keyboard
a smart AI enabled keyboard designed
with the future in mind under every key
is a magnetic silo switch a new
mechanism that is both incredibly
comfortable to touch and built to last
it features a new magnetic switch
architecture which will transform the
entire gaming market and lead to
powerful new workflows for digital
creators the Keystone uses a magnetic
field for analog sensing every key
evolves from a simple on/off switch into
a force sensitive gas pedal this opens
the door for intuitive key combinations
such as a half press typing out a
lowercase letter or a full press for a
capital one with analog input applied to
gaming players will be able to send
multiple instructions with a single key
press for musicians visual artists and
video creators the key stone allows you
to bring a finer touch to your work any
task that involves adjustable timelines
rush sizes or scaling is much more
precise with analog sensing we are
taking advantage of analog input by
developing AI enabled adaptive typing
the Keystone can adjust key sensitivity
based on the unique way you type if you
press harder with your index finger than
your pinky the Keystone will learn and
adapt to improve your typing organically
no missed letters we also made this a
fantastic keyboard with a wide array of
powerful features the Keystone is fully
programmable with customizable
backlighting has n key rollover Mac PC
and Linux compatibility hot-swap
switches and Cherry MX cap support with
the Keystone we reject planned
obsolescence it's built on a technology
that is up to 20 times as durable as
other keyboards and if a part breaks you
can fix it launching alongside the
Keystone is a new software platform we
call hid IO hid IO is a digital hub that
allows people to use analog devices with
applications like games image editors or
other programs please join our campaign
help us improve the entire world by
releasing a truly revolutionary analog
keyboard that will learn and grow with
you
introducing zero the world's smallest
real-time translator we at time ketal
believe that good technology should be
unnoticeable
so we fit zero into a small aluminum
body this small no this small because
it's so small we even designed credit
card case for you to carry it around
it's really compact you can bring it
wherever you go when you need to
translate take it out plug it in then
you can have smooth conversations with
the world to accomplish this we
developed the world's smallest four
microphone array it can collect much
clearer voices than any smartphone and
Zira's microprocessor integrates neural
network technology that separates each
voice by its direction even up to four
people meanwhile zero is smart enough to
know when you've started and finished
speak so your conversations can be
translated accurately in real time zero
can be your travel companion have nice
conversations with local people wherever
you want
zero can also be your business partner
help you to explore foreign business
opportunities you have never imagined
before and we will continuously develop
new functions for zero there are still
many possibilities to explore zero is
smaller smarter easier to use it's like
a translator but unlike any translate
this is zero this is P go home it's a
smart device that monitors your indoor
air quality in real time and gives you
personalized recommendations to help you
stay safe and healthy picot home
combines numerous sensors into one tiny
really tiny box its Portability and
lightweight intuitive design make it
easily accessed anywhere everywhere with
a simple touch on the mobile app you can

around you Pico home monitors dangerous
particulates like PM 2.5 and PM 10 the
temperature humidity EC o2 and VOCs
these substances can cause immediate
health problems such as headaches
dizziness and fatigue and devastating
long-term ones like respiratory diseases
dehydration and heart diseases Pico home
works in all diverse situations in your
kitchen bedroom office
the gym or even outdoors it also works
with Alexa to help you make choices to
control and improve the air you breathe
for maximum comfort and health
last year's all had one of the worst air
quality in the world everyone stayed
inside where the air was even worse
nobody nearly knows what they are

air monitor but we are currently making
one that's even better
all we need now is your support to join

healthy living environment for you
wherever you are
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
