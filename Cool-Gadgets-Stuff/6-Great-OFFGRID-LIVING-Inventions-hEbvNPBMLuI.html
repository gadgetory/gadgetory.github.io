home anywhere and what if that power
could fit in the size of a shoebox this
is the solar home 620 a portable kit of
lighting charging and music that can
turn any structure into an electrified
home hanging daisy chain lights offer
multi room overhead lighting with
individual switches to control your
space
the optional motion sensor offers a
quick hit of light for pathfinding or
heads-up for nearby movement powered by
a compact six watt panel the central
control box keeps your devices charged
your music playing and your system
running with an LCD backlit display
providing real-time feedback on power
and Sun strength as bio lights first
crossover product the solar home 620 is
currently in over 40,000 households
across sub-saharan Africa and your
purchase will help us reach even more
families so everyone can access the
power of home ready for life off-grid on
the road or even the unexpected power
outage discover a perfect entry into
solar living with easy installation and
flexible set up with the solar home 620
it's Thursday tradition here at home
biogas that means banana pancakes
a 2015 we launched the first IndieGoGo
campaign showing the world how to turn
this into this an idea of a backyard
appliance returns organic food scraps
into cooking gas was first of its kind
we were so excited to see all these
people from all over the world enjoying
the system the first campaign enabled us
to get home bogus to the heart of remote
communities in need people who have been
cooking over fire would suddenly had
clean free energy it was a huge step in
fulfilling our vision the amazing
support inspired us to think forward
what if we could take the humble gas
appliance make it even better and reduce
its overall cost it took us over a year
home bogus 2.0 is an advanced appliance
that produces green renewable energy
installation is now simpler just fill
the digester with water mount the gas
container using the supplied sandbags
and you're ready to go the 2.0 version
is 50 percent more productive easier to
maintain and super durable we've also
added a home ba gas stove to give you
the perfect solution an average family
produces about two liters of waste a day
why should organic waste go into giant
polluting landfills when it can go back
into nature home bogus 2.0 can now
produce up to three hours of cooking gas
per day more than enough for an average
family plus a top quality completely
organic fertilizer that goes back into
the soil your own backyard eco cycle
once food waste goes in the bacteria
digest the organic material and released
bogus and fertilizer no electricity is
required it is completely safe to use
order less and can digest anything from
fruits and veggies to meat and dairy
we've been in the home solar business
for many years and we decided we wanted
to try to build a smaller lighter system
basically take a whole home system and
compact it down into a really small
portable package that you can still run
major appliances with and that's what we
did we made a very small ultra
lightweight portable system that can run
you know so much of your home your home
appliances and other system that you
would need in a power outage
mom what happened it's okay sweetie
when we decided to develop the Kodiak
doing to make sure that we hit all the
right used scenarios and we were looking
at how people really would use it in
real life and that included us the idea
was to make something that was so small
and lightweight but powerful enough to
do the work that you'd be done that it
would be something that anybody even a
child could pick up and carry off
someplace
the Kodiak can power refrigerators
freezers microwaves grinders mixers all
kinds of kitchen appliances and CPAP
machines some-some oxygen concentrators
a whole bunch of their medical equipment
our solar panels are made from a
high-tech lamination process we put
ruggedized corners on it to allow us to
slide them together and to pass power
back and forth over the past few years
the smartphone has become the single
most important communication device that
we use on a daily basis no matter where
we are we need it to stay in contact
with those around us however smart
phones are entirely dependent on a
communication infrastructure that they
use what happens when this
infrastructure becomes unreliable or is
non-existent for instance when we are
out in the wild traveling abroad when
there are too many users congesting the
network or when a natural disaster
knocks down existing cellular towers
that's why we created the sonic a
wireless communication of ice that
enables your smartphone to send the
instant messages voice recordings image
data and GPS locations even when there
is no internet access or cellular
coverage how does it work
simply connect your smartphone to the
Wi-Fi access point on the sonnet and it
will transmit the data sent from your
phone to other sonnet users via
long-range radio frequency no cellular
data no satellite service and no monthly
subscription the typical range for
point-to-point communication with the
sonnet is approximately five kilometres
for three miles
it also supports mesh networking that
can dramatically increase its effective
range by securely relaying data to other
SONET devices in the area
the sonnet is designed specifically for
use in the outdoors it is rated ip66
meaning that it's dust tight and water
resistant the sonnet is powered by a
4000 milliamp hour battery that allows
you to use it continuously for up to 24
hours as a built-in USB port so that you
can even charge your phone with it on
the software side is the sonnet app an
intuitive instant messenger that draws
upon the familiar user experience in
addition the sonnet app comes with
useful features such as offline maps and
real-time location sharing so that you
always know where you are in relation to
your friends in the case of an emergency
the sonnet app has a panic button which
will activate the SOS mode broadcasting
your distress call in your current GPS
location to any sonnet users in range
sole-source sport harnesses solar energy
to eat the cooking surface five times
faster than a traditional charcoal grill
it's super easy to use giving you more
time to enjoy the day fuel free rather
than fiddle with the fire since
sole-source Sport has no flame and is
cool to the touch you can also use it in
places like beaches national parks and
apartment buildings where fire cooking
isn't allowed treat yourself to fresh
outdoor cooking free of toxic smoke you
can grill with sole-source in the
morning midday late afternoon when it's
cold when it's windy at the beach even
under passing clouds as long as the Sun
is still smiling down on you the solar
reflectors are engineered with the ideal
curvature for capturing the sun's rays
providing the equipment of about 600
watts of we're all cooking power you can
cook from approximately one hour after
sunrise to one hour before sunset on a
bright beautiful sunny day for example
within five minutes the grill will be at
grilling temperatures within 10 it'll be
hot enough to sear within 10 minutes
charcoal is well it's getting there even
though it's reflecting all that energy
the surface is cool to the touch as the
heat is focused directly onto the
cooking surface and only the cooking
surface
aligning the grille with the Sun only
requires you to look into the blackout
mirror and aim the beam right at your
pan the v-shape cutout puts you in the
captain's chair of the sole source port
because you deserve this girl to work
for you how are we looking there
okay the grilling platform is a
versatile pot stand that allows you to
use the cookware you already own you can
grill pan fry saute steam boil deep fry
pressure cook and slow cook we've taken
our original model and redesigned it
with the on-the-go griller in mind the
new sport assembles in less than three
minutes and packs down to a lightweight
two feet carrying case giving you the
freedom to cook anywhere and remember no
flame means no smoke clean air cooking</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
