here it goes son we believe the son is
capable of powering our lives so we
create solar powered devices to feel the
world today we're excited to release the
go son go
a solar stove that roasts a meal in
minutes can be taken anywhere works any
day yet remains cool to touch no matter
how hot just like it's named the go son
go comes in a bomb-proof package ready
for outdoor adventure or relaxing at
home with friends if you're craving a
hot drink or need to sterilize water
flip the adjustable stand and use it
vertically to boil 14 ounces are ready
in as little as 30 minutes the secret to
our breakthrough technology is the solar
vacuum tube which acts as a perfect
insulator trapping your foods moisture
and flavor cooking made us human and it
continues to bring us together
it's an international language and an
art I'm Patrick Sherwin and I'm a solar
energy guy I've been working with
renewable energy for a long time and I
came up with gosun five years ago we
were tation a big dream trying to fit
fuel free cooking into the bellies of
people around the world it's clean easy
and healthy and for some people this may
be the only alternative where they're
not burning something for dinner tonight
most people think that Solar is too
expensive or that it doesn't work so go
Sun has made an affordable solution
that's four times more efficient than
solar panels and works its magic
whenever needed packed with power and
free from batteries the gosun go is
something you can take anywhere to cook
up a hot meal or drink with a no effort
no gas no fire no safety hazard and no
mess to clean up
the gosun go is like a ticket to an
adventure with no strings attached
there's no fuel to burn there's no mess
to clean up it's in this tiny little
case that you can take anywhere you can
cook just about anything through the
clouds through the freezing cold all
just with the power of the sunlight and
what more could you want
gosun invites you to join the 21st
century solar revolution we want you to
experience the magic of the Sun and
share its goodness as I've traveled the
world I've seen how we've become lost in
not having any attachment to where the
goods that we buy came from you know
where the clothing you're wearing right
now comes from how much attention to
detail is put into it we've created in
our packable sweater handmade in Peru
design for the most nonstop adventurous
lifestyles
and that all begins in the Andes
Mountains if you think about just where
the alpaca evolved and one of the most
rugged dynamic places on planet Earth it
makes sense that this fiber is unlike
anything else
it's imaginated fiber with hollow air
pockets that makes it one of the
lightest walls out there
it's a softest cashmere and it's
hypoallergenic so you can wear it
without even a shirt on
the only thing warmer than alpacas polar
bear fair I originally came across a
sweater made out of alpaca wool while I
was traveling through South America I
never felt anything so soft and light I
wanted to learn everything about it I've
now spent a year going around Peru
taking over Ned buses coming out to
Houston gaudy 5000 meters up to meet the
families I know exactly where we source
the materials from hace toda ESA planta
de la tierra saken's y trece is on Casas
Naturalis
when we were actually building the
sweater I would send hikers and
travelers doing this four day trek to
machu picchu and just test it out and it
was a fun process where they'd come back
and be like my armpits need to be more
breathable or we'd make this side
stretchy totally refining this product
that fit their lifestyle and also looked
great unfortunate to have been working
with the family of artisans that have
shown me the beauty of Peru
they've become like family teaching me
traditions that have been passed down
for generations stemming all the way
back to the inca mistress Mama's Amy
esta Hido el sonido Benzino me Tia
me abuela tambi√©n me mama they say we
need a big local emeriti apprentice
then spotted as a souvenir on photo Esme
sangria ie they Apprendi the bottle the
best part for me about getting to put on
a sweater every day is that I have the
feeling that it's not only making my
life better and more comfortable but
it's also making someone else's life of
miles away from me better too
even now many women in Peru are forced
to work manual unskilled jobs that
provide little to no money
we're empowering women to move to
passionate skilled work it's giving a
woman the chance to have a different
role in the family in the community to
be able to make decisions that matter

we're biolite and we love fire a
campfire is all about gathering round
but the smoke that comes with it can
often get in the way of sticking around
it's time to upgrade your fire with the
biolite fire pit a Bluetooth controlled
wood burning system that can cook your
meals and create an outdoor floating
fire without any of the smoke central to
the bilat fire pit is the advanced
airflow system an integrated fan injects
the fire with air across 51 jets
dramatically improving combustion by
burning particulate matter before it has
a chance to escape the fire so you can
go from a spark to smokeless in under 30
seconds
the result no more shuffling around your
campfire to avoid plumes of smoke unlike
typical fire pits you might encounter
the fire pit features x-ray mesh giving
you a 360 degree view of your flames and
creating the feel of a floating fire in
nighttime conditions the high temp
coated steel chamber can hold up to four
pieces of cord wood at a time and with
the hyper efficient burn you get a
roaring campfire with half the fuel
typically required so you can do more
with less control the strength of your
flames from the palm of your hand with
the free bio light app the talks to your
airflow system to modulate fan speeds
the more air you introduce the hotter
the fire the airflow pack can provide up
to 24 hours of clean burning on a single
charge and it detaches for easy
recharging via micro USB utilize the USB
port on the side to connect bio light
lighting for a perfect outdoor setup and
when you're not burning that same USB
port doubles as a power bank offering
power and a pinch to your other devices
exclusively for our Kickstarter backers
your pledge comes with a free integrated
solar cover that automatically recharges
the fire pit when not in use ready for
the beach the backyard and beyond the
fire pits folding legs and the solar
covers integrated straps make it
