100-pound whole bag to a single 20-pound
pack we founded grade 7 equipment out of
a lack of innovation in big warfare
which has now been outpaced by the
standard in climbing in 2012 while
establishing a new route on mouth or I
wondered how could we reduce the
heaviest items the friend portal is one
of the big overhangs getting pretty far
up the route now our whore bags are
hanging in if we were able to free
ourselves of this weight what would be
possible this is the grade 7 pod a three
pound to play double ledge that allows
you to sleep anywhere
imagine establishing a remote big walk
in true Alpine style
unencumbered by gear moving at the speed
of climbing not limited by the pace of
hauling we didn't just throw this
together we have spent years working on
it and every detail has been
thoughtfully considered constructed with
a proprietary material that we have
co-developed with our manufacturing
partner Tom long the grade 7 pod is
featherweight durable and it inflates to
form this rigid platform it can be used
to pull a from chill on or to sleep
comfortably in the wildest of places you
can ever imagine the great 7 pod uses
the same concept as inflatable river and
rigid rafts would be destroyed while
inflatables bonds over the rocks and
sharp edges hung from an adjustable six
point suspension system the grade seven
bodies level no matter where you hang it
accessory loops on each point keep often
used items within an arm's reach to keep
your whole back accessible a large gear
loop wraps under the party two zippered
pockets located in the suspension rings
keep your loose items secure not only is
the great 7 pod the most comfortable
simple and lightweight climbing ledge it
is also a fully insulated city mattress
keeping you warm saving the weight and
cost of a separate insulated pad to make
inflation fast and efficient we've
partnered with our friends at sea the
summit integrating their award-winning
air valve into our design
once the pod is inflated you can hang it
alone or in a bunk bed configuration or
side by side to make a double edge the
grade seven stone fly is highly
breathable and its unique design expands
in size fitting both single pod and
double pod setups in the morning when
you're ready to climb again this valve
has a quick air release pull it open
dump the air roll up the grade seven pod
and stuff it in your pack no more
faffing around with metal tubes and hard
to pack frame pledges seriously it is so
small and light that you can climb with
it on your back saving hauling for only
when it's absolutely necessary all that
sounds great right but you're probably
asking yourself does this really work we
asked this too which is why we've spent
the last six years making hundreds of
prototypes and testing them on walls all
around the world refining our design
bringing forth something that we truly
believe in we are confident in our
product so we stand behind the great
servanthood
with this simple promise as a
Kickstarter backer you will get the best
deal your grade 7 pod ships with a
lifetime warranty that's as simple as
this we will repair or replace your
grade 7 pod forever no questions asked
no fine print no
as we've completed the design
development testing the great seventh
cause is now ready turn your dreams to
reality
hi I'm Damian Henning two years ago the
sun-loving crowdfunding public was taken
with the shape flex to Sun Hat to the
tune of almost a quarter million dollars
backers loved the idea of having a son
happy with super wind resistant
waterproof
shapeable
machine washable portable
wide-brimmed
with a deployable net cape and a zip off
crown that would hold any shape forever
but there was one thing that a few folks
weren't crazy about the weight though
most folks have no problem with the
weight caused by the copper in the brim
some people prefer a lightweight Sun Hat
well I
your faithful Mad Hatter heard your
suggestions and have answered the call
now we're happy to introduce the shape
flexor light the shape flex your light
weighs 60% of what the original shape
flex your ways but still has all the
features waterproof machine washable
shapeable
portable
portable
highly wind resistant
partially or fully removable crown for
ventilation or excess hair
a deployables
an adjustable bungee to fine-tune the
size as if our shield around the brim to
protect the fabric from obstacles in the
secret back pouch for valuables
the key changed the shape Fletcher white
is the foam quartered wiremock rim
replacing the original heavier plastic
coated copper unlike in the original
shape flexor this is going to be easily
replaceable if the need arises we've
made a couple of other changes to the
hat as well like covering the crown
zipper with fabric to properly hide the
zipper using a thicker foam in the brim
and using a thicker material in the hats
main body and a thinner one for the back
neck cable this is John and John is a
good person he plays with his dog spends
time with his family he cycles to work
gives to charity and waters the plants
but when it comes to eating with plastic
cutlery he just doesn't give a fork so
we asked all the Tom's digs in Harry's
of the world
why don't you BYOC and they all blame
DES we knew bigger pockets is the answer
but then our friend Darwin called and
said you are the result of four billion
years of evolution act like it
and that's when the bulb flashed we
created the best cutlery in the world
that created this tiny box some of the
powers of the Gods to somehow fit this
in this introducing our world's first
collapsible portable and plastic free
cutlery and chopsticks this small box
fits perfectly in your pocket in bag and
is tailored for eating in the office on
the go and wherever life takes you using
it is easy simply screw it and when you
need it and enjoy the food that the warm
and fuzzy feeling of not hurting Frank
and his friends out Lurie is made of
stainless steel and unlike the bpa
infested plastic it's extremely hygienic
and cleans in a breeze with a
patent-pending eldery is designed with
the environment in mind
one set of out three conceived thousands
of plastic cutlery pieces ending up in
the ocean that could save God knows how
many turtles so let's pledge to eat
responsibly because you are a good
person and when it comes to eating with
plastic cutlery you do give a fork need
