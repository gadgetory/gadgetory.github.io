the past five years now we need your
help to make the skateboard reality
my name is Greg Breslau ski and on
markers allow ski and we're super
excited to finally share this campaign
with you guys skateboards haven't
changed for decades with the amount of
abuse a typical rider puts the board
through they're simply not strong enough
towards chip lose their pop change feel
over time this can throw off the
consistency of a skater and affect their
riding more than they might know some
professional skateboarders need to
change their decks daily to keep the
board feeling consistent with Lyde slate
construction we've created a lighter
stronger more durable skateboard deck
our boards use for plies a maple
surrounded by carbon fiber carbon fiber
is a lot stronger of material than maple
we use two layers inside the board this
prevents pressure cracks and helps
maintain a consistent responsive feel
while maintaining the same flex of a
standard deck the nose and tail of our
boards use a high-strength polymer this
material is extremely resistant to
razortail is virtually impossible to
chip and has much more pop than a fresh
maple deck this combination of materials
makes a board that lasts an average of
six times longer than an industry
standard skate board because our decks
feel so consistent through their life
you can spend more time progressing your
skills rather than relearning we've been
testing these boards for over five years
getting feedback from multiple Pro
skaters and now we believe we created
the perfect skate board
look
but good it's really good
Avenue Trucks the first-ever high
performance suspension skateboard truck
with an increase in speed better
supported turning impact reduction
increased pop and reduce speed wobbles
it makes avenue suspension trucks the
first ever skate truck of its kind
since almost everything else was wheels
had suspension why hasn't skating
adopted this yet truth is standard
trucks have limitations they don't
improve speed they don't reduce impact
and they can't maximize the skaters
performance that's why we created Avenue
Trucks Avenue was created in a metal fab
shop by a small team of skaters
engineers and machinists we've always
felt standard skate trucks lacked the
engineering needed to support the demand
skateboarding requires so we spent the
last three and a half years designing
testing and developing nearly six
hundred prototypes to bring to you a
truly versatile high-performance truck
so what are some of the benefits first
off a major increase in speed standard
trucks don't absorb vibrations due to
limited wheel travel they don't allow
the wheels to roll smoothly over up
concrete which ultimately slows the
board down Avenue sky trucks absorb
pavement imperfections and vibrations
keeping your momentum forward and your
ride fast and smooth
our trucks also compress with you while
pumping through verts and transitions
give me much more speed more speed overt
means more height and bigger air if
you're an aggressive skater you'll be
stuck - no our trucks help absorb impact
on joints and your bones
whether you're dropping off a 10 stair a
rooftop or just perfecting your tricks
impacts add up eventually destroying
your body less stress on your body means
less time recovering and more time
skiing unlike standard trucks our base
play slightly compresses before throwing
a trick releases when you pop and brings
energy to every trick reducing that dead
weighted feeling better pop bigger
tricks having suspension also means
smoother longer grinds by absorbing
rough edges chipped concrete or dented
rails our flexible baseplate helps you
maintain your grind speed eliminating
most elements that interfere
long fast grind we've also discovered
that Avenue trucks have helped reduce
speed wobble in major way we've been
able to take our trucks up to 50 miles
an hour before seeing any sign of speed
wobble we're also introducing our
suspension truck to the longboarding
industry as we're in the process of
successfully finishing the designing and
testing of our long board trucks
allowing for faster and more stable
speeds on the longboard so pick up your
pair and feel the benefits of what a
high-performance gait truck can really
do for you
together we can elevate skateboarding to
an entirely new and exciting level this
is the future meadow is the first and
only state-of-the-art compact electric
drive system that can fit under any
skateboard
within minutes it can transform any
normal schedule into an electric
skateboard tomato is just the small two
point five kilo component but it has the
capacity to upgrade your favorite board
into the most dynamic and high-quality
electric skateboard on the market all
you have to do is unscrew the rear track
of your board replace it with a metal
drive and you're ready to go now that
Killian tell you all about the new high
the heart of mellow is the motor and
we're really proud to say that it's been
developed tested and produced in Germany
before we founded Melo I was an electric
car engineer at BMW this definitely
opened some doors when we started
looking for the best partners and
supplier they immediately shared our
vision of a compact yet potent inwe'll
motor for direct transmission and thus
maximum riding pleasure even if you are
an absolute skateboard rookie the
handling of Melo is really simple with
the intuitive hand control all functions
are just under your thumb
finding the right battery for Melo was a
challenge on the one hand he wants to an
endless ride on the other hand we wanted
as little weight as possible the
solution is a custom-made swappable
battery pack so in case you really want
to go for an endless ride you can easily
exchange it on the go
every year millions of people will pick
up a skateboard for the first time all
of them want to start landing awesome
tricks if you land one you're hooked the
early tricks are very hard for most of
us just like any sport if the kids don't
see progress they quit that's why I
created skatertrainers most tips tell
you to start out in the crack or some
grass but it's not enough you don't land
back in the crack and the grass doesn't
quite feel the same there are a lot of
great how-to videos out there but many
skaters give up too soon on their
skateboarding dreams skater trainer is a
simple tool that you slip on the wheels
of your skateboard to keep it from
rolling it's an intermediate step to
slow things down so you can learn the
moves and commit to landing tricks like
a nollie or a kickflip my name is Roger
I'm an engineer an inventor and the
creator of schedule trainer I spent 25
years not skating and then decided that
I wanted to get back into it easier said
than done
it was tough I felt like a beginner all
over again only this time with a lot
more fear of falling and busting my 40
year old ass having spent the last 20
years as an aerospace engineer my mind
instantly went into figuring out a
solution to this problems
I built a prototype out of things I had
around the house and learned a few
tricks I knew I was on to something so I
made a $200 youtube video created a
manufacturable design and started
testing I was blown away by the response
I got
skaters crossed the world we're sending
in their praise of skatertrainers on
Monday and I learned it Kickham by the
end of Monday I think you guys are
totally gone there
they're totally worth it their
testimonials validated the concept but
they also highlighted some key issues
they were hard to get on with slip off
when used eventually wore out and we're
pretty ugly I took that feedback and
created version 2.0 skatertrainers it's
waser to install fits on almost any
skateboard wheel won't slip off is
lighter and more durable than the first
version
the design is ready the production
prototypes work great and the
manufacturer here in Oklahoma is
standing by the produced skatertrainers
are the perfect gift to help your
favorite skater get the tricks they
really want have some fun and stay
excited about skateboarding
you
let's be honest the skates industry
hasn't seen any real innovation in the
past thirty years that's why we've
decided to think outside the block
introducing the world's first bullet
resistant clear customizable skateboard
here for absolutely any lifestyle
whether you're a beginner skateboarder
or an advanced downhiller the jelly
Manowar is the perfect ride for you
what's going on guys this is sven CEO
and co-founder of jelly we're super
excited to introduce you the all new
redesigned jelly Manowar which has been
a culmination of all the awesome
feedback that we've received from our
jelly fans across the world but we
thought would go one step further so we
teamed up with the homies and lock
risers innovation to give our boards the
functionality to fit your lifestyle the
flex of a snowboard needs to flow the
surfboard the jelly Manowar is it down
hallucinate so I really like the new
jelly deck Man O'War super sick or Scott
concave keep it under Mikey blocks are
super sick and just click right into my
skateboard
I'm not down the hill without worrying
about my camera alright my name is Kevin
founder and chief technical innovation
officer for blocker Iser innovations
I've always liked putting things in
places that's why I came with this stash
block so I can put more things in more
places one of the things can you put
into the stash block you might ask I
wonder
what's up son bro got any jelly
but of course care from grave yeah
the patent-pending Betty box allows you
to replace your stash block with the go
block and now you can film with added
stability
you
the standard GoPro attaches to the top
of your board increasing vibrations and
rendering your footage useless plus once
you stick them on they become a
permanent fixture
the go block can be easily taken on and
off allowing for limitless user
experience by absorbing vibrations
reducing speed wobbles and increasing
stability the space-age material
provides extreme flexibility making
jelly the easiest skateboard to ride
ever it really is the perfect board for
riding down the boardwalk is so frizzy
and it's super mellow but really
responsive like I'm not used to skating
I felt really natural on the board it
was really inviting and we both really
had an awesome times getting the board's
they I really enjoy how they flex about
how durable they compete
they're awesome I can't I can't think
another board ride on they don't catch
over cracks it just flowed over
everything they're good they're nice are
smooth the fast my friends love them
good time
I love this board it saves you valuable
minutes in the morning it's fun for me
to get from my car into the office look
at it sleek enough that I can bring it
in
the jelly boys has made it so much
easier for me
it also takes you up to the next level
skateboarder alex gets so scared to like
ride the jelly board but the jelly board
wasn't actually just so scary to ride
you need a few tiny the added benefit of
a deck made out of bulletproof glass is
simple it's super high impact resistant
and 100% recyclable jellies rock is
ready to roll all we need is your
support
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
