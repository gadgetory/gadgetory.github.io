to find fresh clean sheets but is that
always the case
don't jump who are you
I just saved your life so we're about to
jump on dirty bedsheets what are you
talking about I just booked this room
that would have changed the sheets well
right
most hotel rooms are supposed to change
their shits after every guest who ever
ah how do I know these are clean sheets
we created revealed the chargeable UV
light is specially designed for
travellers by using multi-wavelength UV
and 180 degrees wide angle revealed find
hidden fluids that most other is UV
lights enabling this using revealed is
very easy simply turn on revealed and
start to scan out on certain areas like
the bathroom toilet seats walls and of
course the bed
holy Sh I'm sure glad you didn't lay on
it
and when you need a bright light with
just the click of a button reveal turns
into a flashlight these sheets our team
has completed the design and are ready
to start manufacturing in order to bring
revealed to travelers and photographers

support our campaign thank you I'm
Thomas I'm Christian and we love to play
with fire well sometimes it gets a
little bit out of hand
our idea to use this fascinating
physical principle to create a unique
product for everybody's home after
months in the left we came up with spin

cleaner and the centerpiece for a social
atmosphere and call the day's spin is a

plugged into grass flowerbeds or a
planter and become a beautiful torch

that puts up a bigger flame a spinning
flame in a glass tube beautiful soothing
and warm but now we need your help to
light up spin so help us to help you to
get an amazing fire tornado for your

necessarily coincide with our pearly
whites best interests certainly we keep
our teeth clean but sometimes brushing
just doesn't quite keep up with our
lifestyle choices coffee and wine stains

mouthpiece do the rest one of the most
powerful features we are introducing is
the ability to track your progress in

includes a red light gum treatment this
revolutionary feature helps you care for
your entire mouth by killing the
bacteria that caused gingivitis and gum
disease and both treatments can be done

couldn't be more excited for you to be

years come up with our most innovative
coffee maker yet and we want to share it

you can prove a copy to anyone's test
depending on the way you brew you can
change the brew time the coffee to water
ratio even the twist speed there are
hundreds of combinations you can try our
unique helix design and twist motion

competitors we're confident you'll want
to use your twist press but every brute
so we've added a storage component for
another three servings of ground coffee
so you can enjoy great coffee anyway
the twist press combines an immersion
method with rapid filtering to ensure
even coffee extraction every time its
plunger forces a pocket of air and hot
water downwards of a ground coffee
through a filter and into your mother

an unparalleled brew time compared to
other methods here at Bristol Co we've
gained years of experience developing a
range of coffee makers for both home and

ich bin hello I'm Marcus and I'm here to
present you t stick the robust and
secure data media most USB sticks are
neither waterproof nor truly reliable
mainly made out of poor quality
materials and this is why we developed T
stick T stick is the first USB stick
made out of titanium it is also equipped
with the so called magnetic snap this
feature allows magnetic attachment to
metallic surfaces the timeless design
made out of high quality materials
offers an equally precise interior T
stick has a fast USB 3.1 flash memory
board which is covered with a special
CBP protective layer this rubber
material seals the electronic components
and protects against water heat and
impact
for personal security all date on the
USB stick is protected with aes-256
encryption currently one of the world's
best encryptions in case of loss your
data will not be visible to others all
that makes T stick a small and robust
data safe support our crowdfunding
campaign and make sure to secure your
data on T stick
