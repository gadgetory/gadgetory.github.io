outside breeze in my face gliding under
my own human power even though I have a
very busy life welcome to my family's
little bike factory in Oregon I'm Hanna
Shoals the second generation and bike
Friday presidents it is my mission to
give people freedom and a healthier life
with high quality bikes that are
convenient to take with you anywhere you
go so I have something really special to
show you it's a big breakthrough the
packet the first folding backpack bike
under 20 pounds actually it starts under
15
in the 120 years of folding bike history
no one has ever developed a folding bike
under 15 pounds that's actually
production-ready until now and there's
more it fits in a backpack and it folds
in under 25 seconds
we've found that the limitations of
common folding bikes are that they are
heavy to carry have few gear options
have greasy chains and only come in one
size the packet is a game changer it's
the world's lightest folding bike
it's available in gears up to 11 speeds
it can be belt driven so you never have
to worry about getting grease on your
hands or on your clothes it's more
compact than all other major brands it
fits in a backpack and the best part it
comes in multiple sizes with a lot of
room for adjustability this opens up a
world of possibilities for you to have a
bike you actually want to ride and it
easily fits into your busy life it fits
in a teeny house under your desk in an
RV in the overhead compartment of a
train and into a checkable suitcase for
airline travel you really can take it
with you anywhere and everywhere with
many sizing and component choices you
can write it for cruising commuting or
adventuring my family has had a mission
to improve people's lives for 24 years
bike Friday has been building bicycles
for people to travel all over the
with our team of 27 people we hand build
each person's bike to fit their size and
personal choice from a wide array of
options the bike ready community has
grown to over 30,000 all from our little
factory using our experience fueled by
our mission we've created the packet as
the ultimate bicycle companion great for
city riding hi I'm Colin and this is
Eddy the smallest and lightest add-on
kit for bicycles that converts any
bicycle into a powerfully bike within
seconds you simply mount the drive unit
to your existing bike attach the battery
switch it on and off you go
yikes our fast eco-friendly and they
take you to work without sweating but
conventional ebikes are quite heavy
embarking they're not meant to be used
as normal bikes that's why we created
Eddy it offers a super efficient drive
while keeping your bike pure Eagle and
absolutely smooth running Eddy consists
of three parts the mounting plate the
drive unit and the battery all made of
high quality materials as you can see
Eddie is almost invisible and it's a
true lightweight champion while most
other systems have between five and ten
kilograms Eddy with only two kilograms
including the battery and Eddie is smart
in off mode you don't feel it since
there's no friction or conduit in all
mode you can select various support
levels once your pedal Eddie starts
within half a second if you stop
pedaling Eddy stops automatically
therefore Eddy a safe flight and a great
companion for your trips
this is the OI
it's a black bell it doesn't look like a
black bow because we don't want it to be
just like any other backbone to explain
why it looks like this let's go back a
bit
nog is an Australian company that
believes former function of friends
friends of benefits so once we don't
always like to fit in we love things
that fit together which is why we don't
like these so we asked what if it could
be different so we sketched catted
printed sanded painted drilled to get
the perfect form
I mean tested volume test a pitch tested
patience so we had the perfect function
small size works with twenty two point
two millimeter diameter bars and the
large size for anything up to an
including thirty one pointing and with
five finishes to choose from brushed
aluminium brass copper black and
titanium was sure to find an oil to suit
you and your work
wait Kickstarter where the founders of
no I'm Hugo and I'm Mel and back in 1877
John Richard dedicate patented the first
black belt until then nothing much has
changed with bike bells so knob
developed the oil we wanted to reinvent
what the Hubble bike bell was we wanted
to design a product which was
sympathetic to all bikes look great on
vintage bikes and it really good all the
way through the road bikes and with your
backing we can bring this bill to life
much faster than we normally would so
please pledge your support for the mark
boy getting quick get one for yourself
please share the campaign in your bike
loving friends boy
you
a journey is more than just getting to
your destination it's about enjoying the
right
what if you could cycle taking
everything you wanted with you but
without compromise introducing Tilton
here in the UK I've worked with some
brilliant designers and manufacturing
specialists we've completely reimagined
both a humble bike rack and the pannier
bike
I wanted to create a rack that
complements your road bike beautifully
and is so light you don't even know it's
there a rack that can attach to any road
bike without tools in seconds the
pannier bag needed to be equally light
robust and waterproof a pioneer that can
take it all and connect effortlessly to
the rack
historically bike racks are made from
welded metal tubes the tailfin rack is
manufactured from carbon fiber we've
shaped two aerodynamically to seamlessly
blend with your road bike tailfins been
designed with some breakthrough features
it ships with a custom skewer which
permanently replaces your existing one
and allows tail frame to attach to
almost any road bike
the tailfin rockin pannier worked
perfectly together
you could also attach existing panniers
the pannier contains a rigid backbone
which extends tailfins strength right
into the bike keeping your belongings
secure in transit
it was critical that the rack was
engineered to be ultralight without any
challenge to its strength or agility and
went beyond industry standards
hi Kickstarter I'm Emily and I dreamed
up blaze blaze is a damn good LED front
light but it also projects the symbol of
a bike then onto the road ahead it
tackles one of the biggest causes of
cyclists fatalities being caught in a
blind spot or vehicles turning across an
unseen bike it warns drivers in front of
the cyclist of its presence and prevents
them turning across its path imagine
being a bus driver with a bike down in a
blind spot you can't see even let up
like a Christmas tree the bike can be
invisible but with blaze you see its
image on the road in front before you
decide to turn I could see that green
light first it tells me selfie example
then I'll see the cyclist so that when
he's in my blind spot will point him out
two or three seconds before I actually
see he's a good possibility 50% the same
in his life another common scenario sees
drivers pulling out of a side Junction
into the path of a bike here the cycles
can be right up close but overlooked
deuter's position lasers flashing symbol
ahead of the bike increases its
visibility and gives it a presence away
from its normal footprint
finally pedestrians i've often at the
jam on the brakes to avoid hitting
someone who stepped out through
stationary traffic be one of the first
to get a blaze on your bike and blaze a
trail both in the UK and assembled by
hand with beautiful machined aluminium
casings the internals comprised leading
optical engineering with the chargeable
lithium battery super-bright white LEDs
and a green laser module the lens that
disperses the lasers highly focused
light to create an image also spreads
its energy and make it safe to human
eyes but like a laser pointer it needs
to be handled with care it has a
magnetic safety sensor meaning it cannot
be used off the bike
but the LEDs can still be used on low
power as a torch this feature also
prevents it draining the batteries in
Iraq Zac it's durable it's compact and
it's waterproof so go on change the way
we ride and blazed a trail</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
