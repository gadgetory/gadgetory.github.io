gear undergoes a makeover so extreme but
it could actually change the sport and
the industry hi I'm Jake BAM and along
with my partner Tamela we'd like to
introduce you to Eva the all foam
snowshoe which could do exactly that
it's made entirely out of foam it floats
like a butterfly and it feels like snow
shooting on the moon to be it out of two
layers of EBA the top layer is very soft
and cushiony the bottom layer is hard
for traction and a third plate actually
gives you incredible grip and traction
on even steep and icy terrain crescent
moon has been making snow shoes for 20
years in Boulder Colorado there's my
partner
Tamara Lau who came back from one of
those typical Boulder runs and said we
really need to make our snow shoes feel
like a running shoe flexible durable
comfortable like this in some ways
traditional snow shoe can be somewhat
intimidating but the eva is like a big
athletic flip-flop first of all it's
made entirely out of foam which by the
way makes it much warmer than any other
snow shoe it has a rocker shape in other
words there's no hint that rocker shape
allows your foot to move exactly like
the foot naturally does without us know
she want secondly it's got an incredibly
easy intuitive binding system it's made
out of a hook and loop velcro type
system you literally just open it up
slide your foot in and with the
adjustable strap it's as quick and easy
as that
and then third a very unique thing
happens with the evil al foam snowshoe
when you take a step it loads up with
potential energy and as you earn step if
you will from each step
it literally propels your foot forward
and it feels weightless as if you could
run faster or walk faster with these
shoes on then you can without after
prototyping and designing the shoe we
introduced it at the outdoor retail
trade show and the SI a trade show to
our great surprise Eva the L foam
snowshoe won seven best of show Gear
awards including Outside magazine
gearjunkie and mints journal and in fact
mints journal said this is the most
important product to come out of the
outdoor retail trade show that we've
seen so who would buy the Eva all foam
snowshoe well anybody who likes to get
outside in the winter families couples
dog walkers runners cor enthusiasts
anyone really who enjoys being outside
in other words people just like you and
either the L foam snowshoe could
literally change the entire snowshoe
category and with your participation
here on the Kickstarter project we can
bring it to your feet in the fall of
2017 be a part of our team thank you
hi I'm Hank I love traveling an
adventure in fact I love it so much
I just finished a 5,000 mile bike ride
from the top of Alaska to Cabo San Lucas
Mexico all the way I visited some of the
most remote places that Mother Nature
has to offer
unfortunately I constantly found that
mother nature does not always provide
the best placed choice
so what did I do my team Duff is my good
friend Sandra and have an entrepreneur
and spent the past year designing
refining our new product so we got it
perfectly right we believe it will alter
the way people relax without further ado
we introduced sterile
unlike other heavy bulky folding chairs
the air lab is extremely lightweight
incoming it blows up in seconds
compassion for small bags making it
unbelievably easy to take anywhere the
air lounge is perfect for long night
camping trips parks beaches and the high
quality material of the air lounge
allows you to last anywhere on any train
with the addition of our new air
retention mechanism and now you can blow
it up right your business with no wind
speaking of wind our anchor loop will
always be for airlines forever no matter
what Mother Nature throws em and our
experts on fabric mimic set of a half so
you can stay comfortable wherever you go
but we realize now your air lives might
get dirty
so we design the airline with removable
air tube so that you can always watch
wretches that
one word a pop you can quickly replace
the hair lounge with a new inflatable
tube
it shouldn't pop this the air lounge is
exceptionally tough carry extreme
amounts of wood it can also carrying
your phone tablet books or bottle of
it's two side pockets but most important
it can carry you on whatever adventure
you decide in place so please be one of
the first to enjoy the many
possibilities of the airline and help
fund our first production we can't wait
to see you relaxing on the air lounge
this coming summer
take your outdoor adventures to the next
level with our survivor filter pro le
our sturdy design is very durable and
easy to use for anyone who loves the
great outdoors traveling or emergency
preparedness upgrades we've made for the
survivor filter pro le include a 100
thousand liter ultra filter pre-filter
larger hoses a convenient new hose clip
and a zippered carrying case our system
has three levels of filtration which
include the 0.1 micron ultra filter
pre-filter it locks out large debris and
acts like a barrier to help remove
harmful bacteria and protozoa that are
larger than 0.1 microns the ultra filter
pre-filter can be easily cleaned and
back washed after every trip up to
100,000 liters by utilizing our
cleanable pre-filter system the light
for the internal filters are greatly
extended next is the carbon filter this
level of protection is designed to
improve taste and help reduce heavy
metals chemicals and pollutants finally
water passes through the 0.01 micron
internal ultra filter which is designed
to help remove the remaining
contaminants that make it through the
first two levels once the water has
passed through the three stage system
independent tests have shown a
filtration of 99.9 percent of virus
bacteria and staff and a significant
reduction of heavy metals surpassing EPA
standards for portable water filters
take on the outdoors with survivor
filter
hi there have you ever thought a stash
in a kayak in the trunk of your car or
bringing it on a plane as a carry-on
what about storing it in the corner of
your closet
imagine swinging your kayak over your
shoulder before you set out exploring
outdoors
adilyn across the lake to that romantic
picnic spot we did and we set out on a
mission to make out Noir exploring easy
we rework the concept of the kayak into
a folding portable one that weighs under
6 pounds with the just in case kayak you
can decide on a moment's notice if you
want to walk around the lake or paddle
across a you have a freedom to adventure
our story starts in 2015 in Alberta
Canada as outdoor enthusiasts and day
trip fanatics we thought of this concept
out of frustration with the cost and
size of the traditional kayaks and not
to mention none of us at the storage
space to keep one in our small
apartments
we won the product that fit our needs
something is portable and durable
without the investment additional
equipment and commitment that
traditional kayaks require we were
looking for a weekend kayak just like
our weekend bikes so we asked ourselves
what if everyone had a kayak that could
fit into their bag we wanted to reinvent
the camping and hiking experience so
that you can port anymore while carrying
less we transform this idea into a real
sized foldable kayak creating an out of
box solution aimed at beginners to
professionals to experience kayaking
wherever they are take just in case
kayak for a stroll on a lake river or
bay or bring it on a hiking trip for
some impromptu paddling our team of
engineers designers and testers have
built in water tested prototype after
prototype to arrive at a kayak that's
lightweights fun safe to use and durable
just in case is made from a lightweight
carbon-fiber frame held together by
custom 3d printed connectors we use a
durable ripstop skin made with woven
nylon that has remarkable strength to
weight ratio weighing only 5.7 pounds
the just-in-case
kayak can carry more than 250 pounds and
measures no more than 40 by 6 inches
when folded you'll be able to assemble
our kayak in 15 minutes we've also tried
to keep our just-in-case kayak
environmentally friendly by using a
little material as possible we believe
adventure doesn't stop at the beaten
path we believe in taking the road less
traveled and staying curious let's make
kayaking affordable make nature
accessible and advance
cheering easy let's embrace the idea
that traveling light while exploring
outdoors is possible
I mean have you ever seen anything like
this before I didn't think so
no one has Sam crap kidding me
we go
the thing I love most about the hammer
craft is whether you're on land you're
in water trees know is you can humid
anywhere in the world with the hammer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
