corners done an engineering and along
with my partner Lauren gang we've
invented this little beauty right here
these end stem folding bike stem people
are faced with a challenge of bike
storage it's it's a problem for a lot of
people they enjoy the mobility a bike
gives them and of course the flip side
of that is the space consumed by the
handlebars when the bike is not in use
if we can help them with that then we
can add to their overall enjoyment of
the writing process
you won't notice any difference between
this and a standard riding stem the
weight both the same and it's a very fun
and practical device that we think will
age you in your daily commute
we don't expect that any writer should
be able to break this component it may
even be stronger than a standard stem
component
would you like to improve your race
cycling or mountain biking performance
then let us introduce you to the new and
affordable power meter by IQ square a
power meter tells you exactly when and
where your legs are producing a certain
amount of force it helps you dose during
your write or workout so you can start
outperforming yourself and others power
meters exists in all shapes and sizes at
varying locations on a bike but every
power meter presents a disadvantage and
they're also quite expensive so we
challenged ourselves to decrease the
price while increasing functionality
well since we are attracted ourselves we
wanted to buy a power meter because the
power meter was the thing to have and we
did some research on the different kinds
of parameters and the price point the
high price point would suggest that it
would be perfect and there aren't there
are lots of restrictions and drawbacks
and we didn't buy one but since we are
priority Vella purse we started out with
the question why are they so expensive
and is it possible to make a parameter
that stands out and well it started off
with this question and we had lots of
talks about it and drawings and we ended
up with a parameter which we think meets
all those requirements to design the
perfect power meter we went through
rigorous development we theorized
designed and redesigned to secure the
best tack and product components for
each part of the power meter
so now we are proud to introduce the
first high tech power meter everyone can
afford it runs on a standard battery and
connects through bluetooth and a and t
plus the adapter is made of light and
strong titanium with a nanostructure
strain gauge deposited on the surface
our advanced low pressure molding
technique produces a waterproof casing
and a total product that is very light
here's how it works on the inside when
your leg puts power on the pedal it
causes the miniature banding of the
metal a strain gauge captures this
pressure as a change in electrical
resistance which is measured and simply
Center your app or by computer most
power meters measure the power of one
leg IQ square can measure both so you
can see if they're performing the way
you want them to
you can then adapt your training
accordingly of course we've tested our
prototype repeatedly like here on the
direct trainer where we optimized the
power meter to reach consistent and
accurate results we've done everything
we could to create a great turnkey
product so you can instantly start using
it upon delivery installation on your
racer mountain bike is easy you simply
place the adapt in the crank arm and
fasten it with the screw it's connected
to our support app where you can enter
customized bike measurements for a
smooth fit when you've successfully
completed the installation steps the app
pass with a power meter and you're good
to go it's compatible with all apps
software and bicycle computers like
Garmin and Strava so you can use your
trusted devices to immediately begin
training with our products and start
pushing your boundaries this is an
opportunity you can't miss it's easy to
use has great features and is now ready
to
ordered one IQ square power meter costs
you 149 euros or get two at 2:49 be able
to write in a group see exactly where
I'm going have all of my dad without
having to look down at my computer it
makes it incredibly safe I'm not sure
literate and it was super easy to put my
work out on there it has an arc I can
program in my wattage and I know exactly
what my goal is as a coach you know one
of the functionalities of the camera
giving that to an athlete and taken out
into a group ride or a race having them
then be able to look at the data with
the athlete and give them feedback on
his positioning probably above all just
being able to see my heart rate and my
power together constantly and kind of
make a decision like how hard I can go
having all the information in front of
you is pretty awesome and I don't think
I even looked down once on my cycling
computer which is kind of sad it was
pretty much perfect because I could
gouge my effort all the way for the
finish line and eventually I got first
you know there's certain points in your
in your sport where things change you
know they talk about the Aero bars in
triathlon they talk about the zero
helmet but this is one of those
monumental moments in the sport when
technology's going to change the game
for everybody
after our award-winning flector zero and
360 market launches we're back with a
brand new product reflector vortex the
world's first crank reflector the
smallest accessory ever for your bike
with the largest possible impact on your
safety is specially designed for
bicycles with clipless pedals that do
not provide space for reflectors with a
set weight of 2.2 grams
vortex does not create any air drag or
dynamic imbalance just a stylish look
for your bike by day and safety for your
rides in the dark flector vortexes
design features a unique 3d formable
film which perfectly fits the shape of
almost every crank set on the market due
to its sealed surface flector vortex is
nearly indestructible and keeps its good
properties for a long time it can even
withstand a high pressure cleaner
flector vortex is discreet by day but
vibrantly reflecting at night and help
secure your space on the road its micro
prismatic technology reflects a
vortexing and strong beam of lights back
to its source and attracts every car
drivers attention in comparison to
old-fashioned peddle reflectors flector
vortex increases your visibility through
its 360 degree beam angle and helps even
if your bike already has pedal
reflectors flector vortex helps you
master every dangerous situation in the
dark reflecting the light back to its
source making you visible with a
stunning glow all around no compromise
the rebus is a method of converting your
conventional bike into electric bike
without changing the aesthetics of the
bike you like having the rev loss is
like having a terre wind
rather than having a headwind at all
times and it's just good fun people
always come back with a big smile on
their faces once so give me a try we
believe a simple design is a good design
it's activated only by the pedals
there's nothing on the handlebars
revest takes care of itself and helps
you when you need help and switch itself
off when you don't need his assistance
if you're going down a hill for instance
or if you stop pedaling then the Revels
just stops so it's really easy to use so
the way it works is they have the main
drive unit battery and a sensor you have
a roller that grips onto the wheel and
through that you should transfer the
power into the tire and then into the
road this system weighs between 1 to 2
kilograms and it provides 2050 watts and
so essentially by adding 2 kilograms you
double your output or power revest will
fix the majority of bikes will fit to
double triangle diamond-shaped frames
and it worked best with smooth tires or
just normal commuter tires you can write
it cold by the hot weather dry wet rain
or snow the battery has a USB charger so
if you wish to charge your phone you can
do so we offer two batteries one is for
your everyday trips and the second one
for slightly longer trips the smaller
one is 100 watt hours and a larger one
is 209 wort hours
hi I'm John Hammond CEO of Ella comp in
2015 we announced a new product called
power pod a cycling power meter that's
simple portable accurate and affordable
and today I'm very excited to announce a
new product called aero pod aero pod
incorporates the latest generation of
digital sensors it also includes a brand
new wind port pitot tube design and all
of it is wrapped up in a beautiful sleek
case to zone so arrow pod is a great
power meter but more than that when you
use it with a direct force power meter
it also becomes an aerodynamic CDA
system instead of spending thousands of
dollars to travel to a wind tunnel or
velodrome to get aerodynamic data
attached aero pod to your bicycle pair
it to your direct force power meter and
then get out on your roads and ride
while you're on the road you'll see
power data but you'll also see CDA
hillslope
wind speed elevation and lore in fact
aero pod includes a measurement called
time advantage time advantage turns your
aerodynamic sleekness into a number that
tells you how much time you're gaining
or losing due to changes in your ride
position if you're a time trial is it is
a fantastic way to make sure that you're
staying on pace while you're riding
Aero pilot will show its data in one of
three different ways the new every site
Raptor glasses display your Aero pod
data in a head-up display in your field
of vision
for garment owners we have a new app if
you have a connect IQ compatible Garmin
device our app will show arrow paw data
right on your Garmin screen and if you
have a Bluetooth low-energy smartphone
the powerhouse app from Belikov will
show your arrow paw data arrow pod also
includes our power stroke method of
measuring pedal stroke efficiency and
economy in short arrow pod is the best
power meter that we have ever made</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
