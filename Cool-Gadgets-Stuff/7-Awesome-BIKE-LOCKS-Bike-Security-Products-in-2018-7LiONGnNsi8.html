they're too heavy too cumbersome too
bulky and not designed for those people
who really want to ride their bikes Auto
lock is an all-new cinch lock for both
cyclists and outdoor enthusiasts who
value their gear and need a small safe
and lightweight solution for their
lifestyle it's far more secure than a
cable lock and much lighter than a you
lock in your saddlebag in your pocket or
anywhere on your bike Auto lock is so
lightweight you won't even know you were
carrying it Auto lock is very secure
because of an engineered design that
uses multiple layers of high temper 18
millimeter wide stainless steel bands
coated and scratch resistant santoprene
and reinforced with kevlar making it
extremely cut resistant conventional
theft tools like wire or bolt cutters
alone are just not enough to cut the
auto lock auto lock also has more uses
beyond bicycles but for example ski and
snow tools and sheds camping gear water
sports and more the possibilities with
Auto lock are limitless
the auto lock weighs under 115 grams and
coils to under 3 inches in diameter
making it easy to pack and store on the
bike in pockets backpacks purses or
jerseys in comparison you locks or
chains are 10 to 20 times heavier than
auto lock and much more difficult to
carry the cinching function keeps your
gear locked tight we've designed auto
lock with three resettable combination
wheels and a durable aluminum head the
auto lock comes in multiple colors and
it's available in different lengths
starting with the all-around 30 inch
version which offers the most
versatility auto lock also comes in a
super compact 18 inch pro ride version
and a 60 inch extended version the
18-inch pro ride version is intended for
cyclists on the go offering the fastest
coil time the lightest weight the most
bike storage options and just enough
length to cinch your bike up to any
polar post up to 5 inches in diameter in
seconds the auto lock is both designed
and manufactured in the USA now there is
simply no reason not to carry a lock
you
you want to know why I'm walking with my
bike because of this you know the deal
your bike dies in the city flat tires
rusty chains stolen wheels stolen lights
stolen seats stolen bikes that's why we
can't invest in good bikes instead we
get cheap bikes we don't care about and
even then we're still afraid to leave
them outside overnight we've been riding
with fear and that ends now with a bike
that's invincible
single speed with caliper brakes for
eight speed with disc brakes both have
an aluminum frame which means they'll
never rust and are incredibly light and
they each come equipped with puncture
resistant tires a rust resistant chain
and an ergonomic water repellency and as
for safety retro reflective decals
ensure that car headlights make you
shine everything is locked down with
custom security bolts and it comes with
a best-in-class fortified you lock but
that wasn't enough a fortified bike must
be back with proof so we've got a plan
for that too
introducing fortified protector for the
first time ever your bike is guaranteed
against theft to do this we built a team
dedicated to protecting your button
tracking ownership monitoring secondary
markets and working with local police
but none of that matters to you because
if somehow a thief manages to steal your
bike or any of its components we ship
you a new one in 24 hours yeah we do
that but this is more than a theft proof
bike
we're building a massive community of
cycling
and together we will eliminate the
marquetry stolen
because every new invincible in the city
needs one less light that beats myself
and when enough cyclists take a stand we
can all bike with continuity confidence
that we will always be visible our
commute will be effortless and our bikes
will be protected but we can't do this
without we need your help
every bike counts make this pledge to us
and we'll make one to you we're
fortified and we always have your back
wouldn't it be great if there was a way
to store your helmet and lock your bike
safely at the same time introducing the
laser cappuccino lock the cappuccino
lock is a revolutionary way to lock your
bike using only your helmet straps slide
the male part of your helmet buckle into
the lock on one side and the female part
of the buckle on the other twist the
combination to secure the lock and
you're set while the cappuccino lock
will not replace the need for
traditional you locks it will keep
someone from walking away with your bike
or nabbing your helmet while you're
enjoying a coffee or beer following a
long ride you can register your
combination at cappuccino lock calm
should you ever forget it
with your smart phone email and password
you can look up your combination at any
time cappuccino lock is available in
four color options and is easily stored
in your bag or pocket when not in use
it's also compatible with our snow
helmets to secure your helmet when
you're on the slopes roll it lock it
leave it with laser cappuccino lock
you
have you ever forgotten your bike keys
or got annoyed with your bike lock so
what if you didn't need a key to use
your bike lock right you've seen that
before
but what if you actually didn't have to
do anything at all and your bike would
still be safe with I'd lock it we
created the world's first fully
automatic bike lock that does exactly
that I lock it automatically unlock your
bike when you're in close proximity so
you can just get on it and ride and once
you leave your bike I lock it and make
sure it's safe all of this is fully
automatic so you don't have to press any
buttons or struggle with your bulky bike
lock with I lock it you can worry less
and enjoy more because that's what bike
riding should be about I locket is built
with strong and durable materials and
can be easily attached to most bikes and
II bikes and if your smartphone runs out
of battery you can easily open I lock it
with your custom click code also if you
don't want to take your smartphone with
you you can simply use the I lock it key
fob instead to give you a higher
security I lock it not only locks your
bike but with its integrated sensors
also sets off an alarm in case anybody
tries to break it or tries to carry away
your bike so you will receive a
notification that someone is tampering
with your bike and the bike thief gets
scared away
so you want to leave your bike for a
long time simply add our additional
cable to secure your bike with a fixed
object no need to carry an additional
lock of course all I Lockett functions
can be easily configured with the I
locket smartphone app for example you
can change the proximity for locking and
unlocking the eye locket app also allows
you to easily and securely share your
bike with friends and family with just a
couple of clicks sharing your bike has
never been easier</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
