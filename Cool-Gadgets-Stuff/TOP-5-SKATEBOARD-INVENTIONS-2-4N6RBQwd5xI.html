become one your positioned on your
balance on it and the two of you are in
a dance and there's nothing like that
it's a really fulfilling feeling it's
something like wow I've mastered this
thing and that's what everybody loves is
you love the feeling of writing you love
the feeling of flowing and transitioning
and you know feeling gravity push you up
against the wall and then all of a
sudden you're in a freefall back down
but when there is a 200-foot cliff and
there's no guardrail
and you're doing 50 miles an hour it's
just an amazing thing it is high speed
high tension high adrenaline stuff going
on and that's what we all are constantly
chasing is that that flow that feeling
and it's one of those things that I wish
everybody could experience because
there's nothing like that freedom and
peacefulness that comes with mastering
something
most people think that there's nothing
wrong with the circular wheel and for
the most part if there isn't a problem
for example a bicycle wheel you either
pick one that has a very thin wheel that
you want to travel very fast on like a
typical road bike or you have a wide
wheel and you get to go off-roading and
you have improved traction and grip but
the wide wheel doesn't go fast doesn't
swivel well and the thin wheel doesn't
go off-roading doesn't provide much
traction and grip we ended up taking
this basic sine wave shape turning it
into a skateboard wheel and ending up
with a product that gave you the
benefits of both of those worlds we are
built for the cruiser free ride and the
longboard market when you're riding our
wheels going downhill going in a
straight line we pick up a lot more
speed and we hold that speed second
thing is as you go around that corner
you're going to be able to load up on
the wheel and get it to grip as much as
you want but then when you need to
release it and let it go sideways you
can go from really hard grip to
absolutely
icing out in a really controllable easy
manner they have a very forgiving impact
and that's a big deal because the impact
travels through the rest of your body so
we take some of that absorption away
we offer a tremendous amount of control
a tremendous amount of speed and we
smooth out the surface a lot if you've
never ridden our wheels before you're
missing out on an experience there is
nothing like getting on a wheel that you
absolutely cannot fathom how it would
work and then it just absolutely blows
you away I want you to ride it and I
want you to feel it for yourself hi guys
what's going on my name is David Kunis
inventor of the smart truck assembly
tool or as I like to call it SPECT that
is unique that really accentuates
is set to revolution
escape so well for guru
um stat is primarily designed for faster
skateboard truck assembly this
patent-pending skateboard tool design is
set to revolutionize the process of
skateboard truck setup by taking the
roughly 10 to 15 minute process of
initially putting skateboard trucks on a
new deck or transferring the trucks from
an old board to a new board and cutting
that time down to roughly 30 seconds the
top piece of the smart truck assembly
tool has a distinctive handle system
that through its mechanical process
ultimately turns either for magnetically
tipped allen head screwdriver bits or is
easily flipped for use of for
magnetically tipped Phillips head bits
depending on the type of hardware you're
riding at the time the bottom piece of
the smart truck assembly tool is
directly designed to handle many of the
aspects of skateboard truck maintenance
you'll be engineered to fit on all
standard truck sizes including highs
mids and lows all four Hardware sockets
will be magnetized to hold the hardware
bolt in place while setting up a new
board or making the transition from one
board to another the two additional
sockets located in the back of the
bottom portion of stadt are used to
screw or unscrew the wheel axle bolt of
your skateboard and tighten or untighten
the kingpin bolt located in the center
of your truck
additional features of the tool include
built-in bearing removal grip tape
scraper and a built-in allen key in case
your kingpin is Allen paste the smart
truck assembly tool or stat for short is
an innovative product that solves for
some of the unique inefficiencies in
modern skateboarding the tool will come
in an array of different colors and is
sure to get you more time on your
skateboard thank you so much for your
time and please check out our generous
rewards we have available to those that
help us get this product to market by
late 2017 thank you
meet Eon the next generation in urban
electric transportation Eon is the first
Bolton kit that can convert any
skateboard into an ultra light and
powerful electric vehicle it's simply a
matter of attaching our motor and power
pack to your skateboard and you're ready
to roll
Eon is a radical new transportation
solution it will transform the way you
move around the city
you'll zip through traffic and expand
your ability to use any mode of
transportation as a grad student at MIT
I commute on my longboard and began to
imagine what the future of
transportation could be like when I
moved to San Francisco and created my
first electric longboard I knew I was on
to something I then connected a group of
amazing designers and engineers take
this idea to the next level
forget about car payments gas and
parking with Eon you'll save money and
enjoy your commute in a completely
revolutionary way each motor can deliver
more than a thousand watts of raw power
and can push you to top speeds of over
35 kilometres per hour
by integrating with your wheels we've
reduced drag so you won't even feel it's
there when pushing our of√∂ see
technology makes the ride completely
smooth and silent so stealthy that it'll
be hard to even tell you're on an
electric board well besides the fact
that you'll be able to fly uphill our
kit is modular you can choose between
one or two motors and batteries to
optimize for range and terrain one pack
gives you up to 12 kilometers of range
which can be doubled with a second pack
installing Eon is a breeze just swap
your wheels for our motor and slide the
battery pack under your trucks if you
don't have a board we offer three types
to suit your riding style that will come
completely pre-assemble Eon is great
when you're learning how to ride you can
bomb down any Hill confidently with the
safety of regenerative braking that will
recharge your board while slowing you
down the Eon remote takes advantage of
the latest in advanced biomechanics
research to create the most comfortable
intuitive and ergonomic controller
available today
your Eon experiences can be controlled
by our mobile app fine-tune your board
review your stats and even connect with
other riders we've designed Eon to be a
platform for all your urban
transportation needs it's modular design
will allow you to swap the power pack
from your board to other electric
vehicles we are already designing Eon
for bikes electric vehicles have the
potential to dramatically reduce global
warming and such
pollution generated from cars across our
mission is to create transportation
solutions for urban commuters and
accelerate our transition to sustainable

skateboarding is about trying it's about
falling and getting up as many times as
it takes to get that glorious second but
what if nobody sees it they say that a
trick that nobody sees is one that never
happened that's no longer true because
we've created zero an imperceptible
device with three sensors connected to
an app that records all your tricks in
3d so you can relive learn from and
share them whether it's seen or not to
demonstrate it we invited four
professional skaters and we created a
competition like any other competition
but with a different judge
Cyril and also some interesting
conditions
the world's first competition in the
dark
do you live by hundreds of people
all the tricks all the mistakes all the
statistics were recorded by seer mowing
shared with the world and the data named
the first champion of the dark side
servo kick ass skateboarding since now
hi I'm Mike McKimson and this is the
final prototype of a skateboard designed
specifically for the smallest users it's
called my first skateboard and it is
designed from the ground up to be the
child's first introduction to rolling
pushing and turning on a skateboard
shortly after my son was born he noticed
my skateboards around our home I quickly
realized he could play around on my
board but it definitely wasn't made with
his size ability and experience in mind
grip tape is too abrasive for his hands
and needs the wheels and trucks were not
set up for his weight so rolling and
learning to use his body weight to turn
was difficult I made a few custom boards
for him that had bigger softer wheels to
help him keep rolling and used the
combination of soft bushings for the
trucks to allow him to turn using his
own weight now years later with the
addition of another little one in our
home I find myself making custom boards
again for her in addition to what I
learned with the first go-around I've
added a few other technical improvements
such as a smaller deck shape and size
rubberized foam is the top sheet and
angled risers to increase the turning
ability of the trucks along the way I've
seen there are other parents who could
benefit from an off-the-shelf version of
this skateboard - I took feedback from
friends who have skated for years and
advice of a well respected board shop I
along with friends and their kids tested
many wheel types and truck bushings to
find the optimal combination that is
completely geared towards being a
child's first skateboard and as an added
bonus the soft foam top sheet is chalk
friendly so kids can add their own
artistic touch if they want easily wipes
away with a damp cloth so now we have a
final prototype that is nearly ready for
production this is the perfect first
skateboard setup for the child in your
life be the world's coolest aunt uncle
dad mom or grandparent for your little
one by helping them to hit the ground
rolling with my first skateboard
