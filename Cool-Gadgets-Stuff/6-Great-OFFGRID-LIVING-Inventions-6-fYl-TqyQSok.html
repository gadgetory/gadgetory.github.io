which developed lava real our goal was
simple designed the best portable
clothes washer in the world we wanted it
to be non electric and hand powered so
it could be used anywhere and we wanted
it made in the USA we wanted a simple
machine which could do small loads but
not just socks and underwear jeans and
sweatshirts too we tested all the
popular portable washers sold online all
in the sixty to one hundred dollar range
and we were surprised by what we found
none of them could properly wash even
light articles like socks and underwear
there were hand powered models that
worked like a salad spinner clever but
the function was poor they were barrels
which flushed your clothes around and
there were small electric models that
sprayed water then we studied full sized
washers top loaders have agitators which
beat on your clothes and front loaders
reverse rotation so clothes simply slap
against each other new thinking was
definitely needed then the light bulb
went on
I remembered washing my jeans on a
sailboat I attached a rope to my jeans
and dragged them behind the boat they
came out astonishingly clean so our
breakthrough was to drive a continuous
flow of water through the fabric just
like on the sailboat
we took the piston and cylinder approach
the piston was the basket containing the
clothes
and the cylinder was the bucket holding
the water the up-and-down motion
generates a continuous flow of water
which blasts dirt out of your clothes
we were awarded a patent in September of
2017 lava rail was meticulously
engineered for durability and
performance we are just immensely proud
of our washer yes we are 25 to 50
dollars
more expensive than competitors but we
stand alone with the best portable
clothes washer in the world the only one
that washes real clothes like jeans and
sweatshirts love oreos worth every
dollar that's why we guarantee your
complete satisfaction or money back love
a real eco-friendly made in the USA best
in the world
hey Kickstarter we're back with another
amazing little invention for you we're
calling it dry Sarah top dye Saratov is
a 100% solar power food dehydrator for
mason jars
people have been dehydrating food since
the very beginning
using the abundant heat from the Sun and
a little Peck
we can drive foods more quickly than
ever the floor on a sunny day even in
the spring and fall you can reach
perfect dehydrating temperatures and
ultra low humidity it's simple the jar
creates a greenhouse effect and a fan
moves the hot air around the food the
result is a dehydrator equal to almost
any plug-in version but a thousand times
easier to store and totally carbon free
to operate it's made of the finest
construction in a small shop in
Minneapolis Minnesota it pairs perfectly
with hot top our last Kickstarter so now

congratulations you're preparing to
connect the world's the easiest way to
heat water on the go before we start
let's take a look at what comes with the
heater included it's a CSA listed
regulator for use on a standard propane
tank on/off showerhead and hose garden
hose adapter and instruction manual heat
shield and of course the water heater
itself you will need to provide two D
cell batteries for ignition connecting
your each attempt l5 portable water
heater is not difficult and should be
completed in less than 15 minutes let's
take a look at the installation from
start to finish look first at the
connections we have a gas input a
compression fitting for attachment of
the hose is already attached the water
input water output teflon tape should
always be used on water connections to
ensure a tight seal small rolls is
included in the hardware package with
the heater next you will attach the
shower hose to the output connection in
the middle of the bottom we will find a
convenient location to hang the water
heater weighing only about 12 pounds the
L 5 can be hung virtually anywhere next
we will attach the propane hose to the
water heater and to the propane tank
never over tighten the gas connections
as this can cause damage to the water
heater and a leaking of gas always check
for gas leaks before operation soapy
water gives a good way of detecting any
gas leaks now we will attach the garden
hose adapter and the garden hose be sure
that the adapter has the rubber washers
in it to assure a watertight fit the
on/off switch on the bottom of the
heater should be turned into the on
position turn on your showerhead and
within seconds you will have all the hot
water you need
shower temperature is adjusted by using
the water and gas regulator knobs on the
front of the heater for higher
temperatures turned the gas knob towards
the larger marks and the water
adjustment knob to the smaller marks
conversely for the lower temperatures
the gas knob should be to the smaller
marks and the water knob to the larger
marks the nice thing about e-content
water heaters as they provide convenient
and portable hot water warm showers of
the tamp cottage washing horses dogs are
these marinas anywhere you need hot
water iike temp hot water where and when
needed heating water for the world</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
