the other has never been so comfortable
the two styles have been designed to be
evergreen so they will never go out of
style be one-of-a-kind the revolutionary
be unique escape from the ordinary step
into the light this is switch pod a
minimal versatile handheld tripod
designed specifically for filming videos
or taking photos on-the-go quickly
switch from a handheld grip to a tripod
and then back again in just seconds it's
super slim and it easily fits into your
back or just clip it on instead switch
pod is built to last
it's made with an aluminum alloy not
plastic so it will hold whatever camera
lens and accessories you put on top of
it yet it only weighs 11 ounces or 315
grams that's less than your morning mug
of coffee - the coffee
here's how it works first attach your
camera with the tightening knob or
attach any ball head quick-release
system or phone adapter next grip the
handle wherever you'd like if you need a
choke up or switch hands no problem to
set it down just swing the legs open or
if you want to be fancy try it with one
hand when you're ready to pick it back
up bring the legs back together the
tools you use to create shouldn't get in
the way of you creating that's why we
created the switch pod
imagine a pocket-sized drone that
captures stunning aerial videos a flying
HD camera without the challenge of
piloting a drone hi I'm Vernon me and
we're the team that makes micro drone in
2015 we had an idea for a palm-sized
drone the first of its kind with your
support we smashed all our funding dolls
which helped get micro dome off to a
flying start Micro Micro drone micro
drone Micro drown 3 point out we created
two league work with factories started
production and shipped 32,000 roans
all over the world we can't thank you
not for your support
we collected lots of useful feedback now
we are ready to introduce the next
generation drone this is micro drone 4.0
our mission is to make the world's
coolest smallest drum with more sensors
upgraded camera and a stabilizing gimbal
micro drone 4.0 is the most advanced
easy to fight drone to date we wanted to
make it super easy to fly so it can be
used straight out of the box fitted with
a high quality Sony sensor the image is
crisp for improved video capture that's
striking and clear micro drone 4.0 is no
ordinary drone a tiny two axis gimbal
provides fluid motion that eliminates
shake giving you buttery smooth footage
using both mechanical stabilization and
E is it allows you to create cinematic
filming techniques that excite and
inspire
the compact foldable design means you
can take it with you anywhere on your
travels it conveniently stores away for
when portability matters we don't want
anyone to miss a special moment take it
out and three clicks gets you airborne
in less than five seconds
it comes with a brand new app with
advanced camera controls
we have completely redesigned the drone
from the ground up with a brand new
shape that's optimized for power and
performance take your hands off the
controls and the technology inside micro
drone enables it to fly autonomously
without any manual controls the drone
integrates powerful AI tracking that
complements smooth stable shots and
flies fast enough to keep up with
high-speed action Nerada creates
artificial intelligence for drones our
artificial intelligence is built
directly on the phone the control for
drone beyond live track we will bring
even more AI to microtome 4.0 the
ability for the drone to orbit around
the object of interest 360 degrees and
the ability to recognize the hand of the
owner and Lander we're taking it to the
next level and stability size
affordability and ease of use
