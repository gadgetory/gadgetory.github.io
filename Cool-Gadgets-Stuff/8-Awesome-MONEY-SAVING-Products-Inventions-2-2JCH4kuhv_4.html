ingenious little product that does a big
job of prolonging the life of your
fruits and vegetables it's called blue
apple living plants naturally emit
ethylene gas as a signal for them to
ripen in fact when produce destined for
the United States leaves other countries
industrial sized gas absorbers are used
to keep the produce from ripening until
it reaches the grocery store when
produce was cheap nobody really cared
but it's not cheap now and that's where
blue apple comes in blue Apple comprises
one part of the three necessary pillars
for produce freshness humidity control
temperature and blue apples part
ethylene gas control these cute little
apples hold a packet containing volcanic
mineral and an oxidizing agent sodium
permanganate the active ingredient
absorbs the gas rendering it harmless
blue Apple allows for the packets to
breathe while protecting the packet from
damage after putting fruits and
vegetables away place your blue apple
anywhere you store produce in your fruit
bowl in your refrigerator crisper drawer
and in your dry storage area with
produce like onions and potatoes after
three months simply open blue apples
empty the contents of the packet into
your household plant a garden
since the contents of the packet are a
great natural fertilizer replace with a
fresh packet snap it back together it's
that easy
Americans throw away 600 dollars in
produce every year don't buy it to throw
it away keep it fresh longer with blue
apple while you're at your local grocer
or home store pick up a package of blue
apple feel confident that your produce
will get eaten and not thrown away with
our money-back guarantee you'll have
nothing to lose only fresher longer

house regardless of size just screw flip
it on then leave the bottle upside-down

paid for it's like putting money back

money on expensive beauty products
