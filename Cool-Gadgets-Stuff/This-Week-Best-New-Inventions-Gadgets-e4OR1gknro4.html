sound visible the system is simple
lightweight portable and robust there
are 64 microphones here that record
acoustical data the sound can then
evaluates the data and analyzes how long
the different sounds have traveled then
calculates the exact positions of their
sources and displays the information
visually it's kind of like GPS there's a
touchscreen on the back that makes the
system easy to operate we can use
various different filters for example a
frequency filter that hones in on
whichever specific sound source we are
interested in and displays it
specifically the possibilities are
virtually unlimited from household
appliances to electronic devices to
straight traffic or building noise the
potential uses are multifaceted and
basically endless this system makes
sounds and noise
concretely visible so we can understand
utterly why an object is loud we can
also see exactly where the sound is
coming from then we can take conclusive
measures to improve the situation

for our projects completely in-house and
that means from the fpga and it's
algorithms right down to the user
interface
speaking of which we place a priority on
making the user interface easy to

the software and the product the program
also features an expert mode for
scientists and engineers
this mode enables more precise settings
as well as high resolution algorithms to
help solve complex tasks
