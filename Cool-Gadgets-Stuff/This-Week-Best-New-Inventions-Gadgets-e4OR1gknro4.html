cables do need for all of your devices
Murphy's Law reminded us that you
probably wouldn't have the right cable
in time of emergency the power source is
there but you just December your cable

revolutionary design that integrates all
the essential and most frequently used

cable card to be as small and light as a
credit card
everyone has to take around their bed
looking for the right cables among other
cables and objects lying around in the
depth of the back but not to you
CableCARD includes a sim ejector pin and
two nano SIM card storages loop simple
yet makes a big difference when
traveling overseas
ito-san false but no internet and no
thumb drive for type-c no worries
CableCARD has an Indian memory reader
that supports Wolf's standard USB and
type C it takes one second to set up
cable card as a cradle what makes it
even more awesome is that you can watch
movies on your phone hands-free whilst
tragedy at the same time they reported
that one major cause of vision
generation hysteria for Spain in poor
lighting creates an effective ambient
lighting to protect your eyes this is
cable card the all-in-one cable solution

this is the sound cam we use it to make
sound visible the system is simple
lightweight portable and robust there
are 64 microphones here that record
acoustical data the sound can then
evaluates the data and analyzes how long
the different sounds have traveled then
calculates the exact positions of their
sources and displays the information
visually it's kind of like GPS there's a
touchscreen on the back that makes the
system easy to operate we can use
various different filters for example a
frequency filter that hones in on
whichever specific sound source we are
interested in and displays it
specifically the possibilities are
virtually unlimited from household
appliances to electronic devices to
straight traffic or building noise the
potential uses are multifaceted and
basically endless this system makes
sounds and noise
concretely visible so we can understand
utterly why an object is loud we can
also see exactly where the sound is
coming from then we can take conclusive
measures to improve the situation
at SIA he we develop all the software
for our projects completely in-house and
that means from the fpga and it's
algorithms right down to the user
interface
speaking of which we place a priority on
making the user interface easy to
operate that means that anyone can use
the software and the product the program
also features an expert mode for
scientists and engineers
this mode enables more precise settings
as well as high resolution algorithms to
help solve complex tasks
the sound king will help a lot of people
with their work their hobbies and in
ways that we can't even foresee today it
will help make the world a little

sunglasses we spent the past eight years
collecting information for more than
five hundred thousand of our lens
customers we learned what they like what
they don't like about their existing
frames then our team of industry-leading
designers and engineers use that
information to create the best
performance eyewear system on the planet
