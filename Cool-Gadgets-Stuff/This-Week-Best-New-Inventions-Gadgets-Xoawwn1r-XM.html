best fresh and if you love great craft
beer you already get yours from the
craft brewery itself because that's the
way the brew master wants you to
experience their beer 80% of the beers
out in the market are designed to be
consumed as as fast as possible after
they come out of the brewery local beer
is gonna be the best beer because it's
fresh the question is how could you get
the best local beers from around the
country and around the world
fresh hey just for you a Pico brew we
love great beer that's why we've created
a solution we're bringing the craft
breweries to you introducing the Pico
model see the smallest most affordable
craft beer brewery for your kitchen ever
it allows you to perfectly prove
award-winning beers from around the
world or even design your own you know
if somebody is able to actually through
my beer in another country state
continent I love that brewing with Pico
is easy simply fill your Pico and brew
keg with watered insert a grain and hops
Pico pack and hit through if you want
you can even customize your battery in
about two hours Pico has brewed your
beer while Pico is brewing away you can
monitor its progress remotely from any
web browser or from our new brew pulse
mobile app let your brew keg of beer
cool overnight and then pitch some yeast
in the morning after that your beer will
ferment and then carbonate we've
partnered with hundreds of brewers and
breweries from around the world to bring
you their award-winning beers in the
form of eco-friendly Pico hats
these compostable sugar cane husk
containers are filled with fresh strains
and hops pika brews brew marketplace
already lists over sixty Pico packs for
sale and more are being added each
week you know have that beer straight
from when it's finished fermenting and
you have all of the hops super fresh
it's a wonderful thing anyone really can
use the Pico and get awesome fresh beer
from Coronado brewing even if they're
not at Humber anybody can use it
anybody can successfully brew beer I
mean honestly if you can read the kit
you can do this it's clean and not messy
I mean there's beers that I've brewed
from Colorado Wyoming Louisiana east
coast probably my favorite one that I've
done so far has been the lucky envelope
mosaic IPA
I love oak tires here well now I don't
have to go down to the other side of
Oregon they did it bring it to an event
they get to a party and say hey this is
that fear that you can t get here is
it's pretty special the beer has to be
as good on the other side of the planet
at it is right here in the breweries the
hop aroma is coming at you the crispness
of the beers coming at you the
carbonation is coming out takin any
pressure it's the freshest beer you can
have Jim Bobby and I created pika brews
seven years ago to reinvent the science
and technology necessary to actually put
a craft brewery in your kitchen this
year fast company named pika brew one of
the top ten innovative food companies in
the world and we did it with your help
Kickstarter's in 2013 we launched the
$2,000 microwave oven sized iMac
in 2015 we shrank the brewery to the
size of espresso maker and shattered the
$1,000 price barrier with our first pika
now the Pico model seed makes brewing
even easier more affordable and even
more fun the cost reductions we've
engineered into the platform in the
brewing keg have made the appliance much
more affordable clean up and post
brewing steps are a snap
the new Pico model si leverages the
manufacturing and assembly lines we've
already pioneered with our global
manufacturing partner flex the Pico si
uses the same Pico packs that we already
produce at our custom manufacturing
facility in Renton Washington
this is a speaker this is Randall
this is ductus Randall loves action
sports he also loves music this was
Randall yesterday he had tons of
problems with cables problems with
hearing traffic
I mean his headphones almost killed
after so many problems with headphones
Randall thought of another idea he would
duct-tape a speaker to his longboard
this is London London saw that disaster
of an idea and thought of a better one
but first let's meet bracket this is
bracket London's best friend since
childhood they had always wanted to
start a business together but never had
the right idea yep those ones suck until
that day when the duct tape and the
speaker is sparked an idea I just had
the greatest idea
London spent the next 17 hours
convincing Bracken that this idea didn't
suck then finally it clicked for
Brackett a portable speaker that sticks
to anything yes let's do it they quit
their jobs he dropped out of school and
went to work on their brilliant idea
they knew they would have to start from
scratch they drew up designs they
printed prototypes they went to China to
start manufacturing and finally after a
year of blood sweat and tears sticky
sounds was born
sticky sounds are a new kind of speaker
that use GoPro mounts to stick to
virtually anything like this or this or
maybe even this sticky sounds aren't
portable making them ridiculously
convenient unlike your other speakers
sticky sounds are also insanely durable
and the other guys do that maybe next
time Randy connect to sticky sounds via
bluetooth to pump your jams or play them
off a microSD card
sticky sounds floats and is
water-resistant because you don't want
to kill the hot girl you're trying to
hit on sticky sounds keeps you safe
unlike headphones or earbuds sticky
sounds allow you to hear that school bus
Howrah bear or whatever else is trying
to kill you
the sticky sound speaker is social no
longer will your friends just pretend to
like you take that headphones sticky
sounds get sticky with pledge now
you
since the dawn of time men has been
searching for the perfect shave hi I'm
Lou and this is my brother Pete we've
brought innovation to the shaving
industry for two decades part of that
journey has been searching for the
perfect shave
we knew razors had to be better than
ever razors had to get smart smart razor
with heated blades dramatically improves
performance and makes for a much more
comfortable shave shaving with smart
razor feels good
it's the perfect shave with just a push
of the button here's how it works each
hair has a tough outer layer that
resists being cut by regular blades our
smart technology brings the precise
amount of heat to the cutting edge of
the blades which instantly breaks down
the proteins cutting through the hair
with virtually no tug or pull smart
razor shades closer and makes shaving

knife through butter spot razor is
scientifically proven through in
pendant laboratory testing to cut hair
200% easier than the leading brands
non-heated blades that means a much
closer shave and your blades will last
three times longer
how about razor rash and razor bumps
it's unsightly and it hurts
with current razors shaving sensitive
areas with cold metal blades contracts
the skin and makes tiny goose bumps
those blades then cut the tips causing
razor rash with smart razor that the
opposite happens the heated blades warm
your skin so it relaxes and lies flat
allowing the blades to glide through
your hair smoothly
smart razors sleek design combines style
and functionality the power source and
microprocessor are sealed within the
watertight casing the razor cartridges
are replaceable and have six heated
blades just press the button
the blades heat up in three seconds
shave is normal and the smart
electronics will maintain the optimal
warm temperature automatically
throughout your entire shave if you
forget to turn it off no worries it's
programmed to turn off automatically the
technology behind the smart razor is so
unique that it is one of the most
protected new razor innovations ever the
spot razor is designed and we have
working models our manufacturer is ready
to go however we still need capital to
produce molds and to purchase other
components necessary to bring the smart
razor to smart shavers everywhere
