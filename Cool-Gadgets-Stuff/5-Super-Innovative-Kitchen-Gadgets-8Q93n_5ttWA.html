the inventor of whisk wiper whisk wiper
was an idea that came to me while I was
cleaning a whisk in my sink wiping each
loop between my fingers one at a time I
simply wondered why can't I wipe them
all at once everyone knows that cleaning
a whisk is a pain and that using one is
messy setting the whisk down means a
dirty counter in a dirty whisk whisk
wiper makes whisking easy to use it
insert the whisk and whisk wiper taking
a moment to line up the loops then whisk
away it keeps the loops up off the
counter and it even catches drips you
can rest the whisk on the edge of the
bowl or on the edge of the sink when
you're done instead of washing all that
food and water down the drain simply
pull whisk wiper off and return 95% of
the food to the bowl but that's not all
save every last bit using whisk wiper to
wipe out the bowl it even gets square
corners whisk wiper is a real time-saver
more hygienic and I'm proud of food
water
getting the product to this point has
been a wonderful experience working with
some very talented people industrial
designer robert Apodaca created a more
functional and aesthetic design and our
mechanical engineer are put the Sony
refine the engineering for manufacture
and elevations were added to ensure
clean lines and overall our injection
molding is being done here in Los
Angeles with Greg Layton and CNG mercury
plastics who've been here since 1947 we
even found the best whisks in the world
in Portland Oregon where John Merrifield
and his company are completing our 100%
made in the USA product it's time to
bring whisk wiper to market with your
help we can complete the production
tooling and produce the first batch
exclusively for Kickstarter
hi I'm Doug Forman and I'd like to
introduce to you the first and only
spray that uses real butter and goes
from butter stick to butter spray in
just a few seconds it's called be this
like you I like to use real butter when
I'm cooking or just eating toast but the
problem with butter is that when people
keep it in the fridge it's always hard
cold it tears up the toasts or if you're
cooking with it by the time it melts in
the pan you burn it so we've decided to
invent a better way to store and use
butter and here it is the bean butter
sprayer we created the beam with a team
of world-class engineers from San
Francisco we wanted something that was
beautiful simple and easy to use
something that you'd be proud of to have
in your kitchen or dining room and we
think we've done it just insert a stick
of butter here and in seconds
being liquefies only the butter you need
not the whole stick and you're ready to
spray in a steady even beating you can
bean pans for cooking and food release
you can bean bread and rolls or make the
perfect grilled cheese sandwich you can
beam vegetables with just the right
amount of butter and my favorite bean
popcorn for perfect coverage without
getting soggy you can even use the bean
with your favorite cooking oils even
coconut oil if that's what you like the
beam has a patent-pending nozzle design
that won't clog and a high-density
rechargeable battery you can store it on
the countertop or in the fridge it's
easy to clean with water and a drop of
detergent and it rinses clean with just
the push of a button
please join us by supporting beam and
help bring our passion for real butter
to your kitchen thanks
you
you know that moment when you reek orc a
bottle and it just won't fit in the
fridge
these Stoppers are all about overcoming
it
gears low-profile bottle stoppers are
designed to fit in tight spaces like
refrigerator shelves and wine coolers
when we started thinking about bottle
storage we realized that we can take the
eye-catching height of tall decorative
Stoppers and translate it into a form
factor that can light striking design
would go anywhere usefulness two of our
stoppers have hidden corks and an
elegant outer body that hugs any
bottleneck the third is a simple
streamlined design inspired by our
silicone storage list taking on the task
of creating bottle stoppers with the low
profile design opened up a great
opportunity for us to look at a bottles
neck as valuable real estate like
everything we do it's about more than
just making things look awesome
each cork has several fins providing a
multistage airtight seal so you can even
put your bottles on their sides
worryfree we're not just focusing on
function we're creating art that works
it's a more intelligent approach to
bottle stoppers and we think you'll love
it
yes any chef they'll tell you that a
high quality chef's knife is the most
essential tool in the kitchen and is
used to make virtually every dish
my mission is ambitious but I want to
make the world's best kitchen knives
hello my name is Adam Ackerman and I'm a
serial entrepreneur and I also love to
cook this has led me to file my new
company habitat our first product is the
game-changing canasa chef knife which is
ultra sharp and stay sharp five times
longer than any other steel knife on the
market we've reinvented the chef's knife
as we know it
NASA conducted four spaceflight
experiments that helped perfect a new
alloy that's twice as strong as titanium
the use of this ultra hard metal is the
first real innovation in knife making in
hundreds of years
the kanessa knife edge is formed using
this patented alloy from NASA the
patent-pending step you are seeing here
is the permanent bonding of this
revolutionary alloy to the stainless
steel knife body the result is a knife
that's among the sharpest in the world
right out of the box and stay sharp five
times longer it's better than the most
expensive professional knives for a
fraction of the price
here you see close-ups of the self saw
rating edge as new teeth are exposed
through use the knife becomes self
sharpening and when this is combined
with rockwell hardness in excess of 70
you can understand why this knife is
superior to Damascus steel knives for
ultra sharpness and durability with our
new patented knife making process in
place we focus on the design of the
knife we knew it needed to be intuitive
for the user durable light comfortable
high quality visually appealing and most
importantly
needed to be sharp so we went to work
sketching hundreds of designs that we
thought would appeal to professional
chefs cooking enthusiasts as well as
everyone in between
there is a very specific reason every
part of the canasa knife looks and feels
the way it does and has a lot to do with
the angle of the knife blade the steeper
the blade angle the sharper the knife
now the canasa knife is an aggressive
12.5 degrees per side for 25 degrees
total this enables you to use our chef's
knife as an all-in-one kitchen knife it
will easily cut through vegetables bread
meat you fish it will quickly become
your go-to for any cutting needs hi my
name is Mitchell Allen I've been a
professional chef for 15 years this
knife is so sharp and so durable and for
the value under $100
I can do everything with this knife it's
quite amazing you'll never have to use
another knife again I would always tell
my friends and my chef friends to use in
the canasa knife it is an amazing tool
by enlisting the world's brightest minds
including manufacturing partners
material specialists designers
scientists and supply chain experts we
aim to revolutionize the kitchen knife
as we know it over the past 24 months
our team has invested our time energy
money and resources to bring to market
in our opinion the best kitchen knife
found the planet now we're asking for
your support to continue our first
production run helped fund custom
tooling purchase needed equipment to
automate and increase the precision of
our patented process purchase materials
and hire more skilled labor and we're so
confident that we're going to deliver
our knife on time and as promised that
if we do not we'll refund a hundred
percent of your initial pledge we're
excited to be launching on Kickstarter
and even more excited to get our knives
in your hands and your kitchens and with
your support I know we can do it
