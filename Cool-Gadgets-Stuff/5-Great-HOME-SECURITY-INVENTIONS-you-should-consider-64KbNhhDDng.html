check your home with a swipe the beyond
bolts will learn your lighting patterns
and replay them to make it look like
you're still at home
and when a burglar checks to see if your
home beyond light responds
power outage occurs beyond us there
as an emergency strikes be honest there
you even leave the lights on for you
when you need it most
I'm Alex and I'm clay and were the
founders of Haven a few months ago my
neighborhood had a series of break-ins I
never thought it happened so close to
home
after talking with the police they told
us the guy was using a new technique
called log bumping every night since
then I put my daughter in bed and lock
up the house when I turn the deadbolt I
think to myself there's got to be a
better way
Haven is unlike other smart locks that
are hitting the market Haven protects
homeowners and prevents break-ins where
they occur the most at the front the
back door we want to challenge the way
people think about their home security
current smart locks focus on ease of use
through technology but still rely on the
same outdated vulnerable deadbolt to
provide protection and security Haven is
installed at the base of your door in
front of the threshold and uses the
house as the strongest platform to
support secure door Haven is made with
sound engineering and mobile
connectivity to connect users with their
home give them control over their
environment and secure their family
after seeing other smart locks hit the
market we both thought there's got to be
a better way thieves have been kicking
in doors for years deadbolt locks maybe
getting smarter but they're not getting
stronger with how-to videos on the
internet block bumping is becoming the
quiet and forceless way for a thief to
easily get into your home in seconds
we are Haven we are setting out to
reinvent the way people lock their homes
and interact with the digital
environment insider our team includes
engineers designers and entrepreneurs
charging Ford to create a residential
smart lock but with a clean design smart
interface and secure technology that is
grounded on simple physics we have
reinvigorated a lock at the bottom of
the door where the structure of the home
provides the most stable platform to
prevent a break-in we also wanted our
lock to work with our users smartphone
wearables or other home automation
devices that they interact with every
day Haven will know when you arrive or
leave your home establishing the ideal
environment that complements your
lifestyle making coming and going easier
Haven will allow users to customize
certain scenes with respectful lighting
sound entertainment and even
environmental controls
