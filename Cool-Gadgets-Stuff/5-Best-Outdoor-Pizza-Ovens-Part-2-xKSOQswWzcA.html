to take me and my sister to this local
pizza bar it was a classic Italian
pizzeria lots of little paintings on the
wall red and white glogg tablecloths and
a huge wood fire pizza oven in the
middle of this tiny restaurant for me
this place was like paradise and the
pizza baker he was God while he was
preparing our dinner I would spend ride
by his working place and watch how he
would stretch the dough slapping it from
hands ahead throwing it up in the air
and how he would gently spread out the
tomato sauce it was a wonderful thing to
see
and when that pizza came out of the oven
it would have that beautiful wood-fired
smoky day hi my name is Peter Staedtler
I am a maker also and the founder and
proud owner of stellar made for the last
few years I've been experimenting and
teaching myself how to make that
beautiful stretchy pizza dough only I
didn't have the money or the space for
one of those big Italian pizza ovens so
that's when I knew I had to make my own
wood-fired oven I started welding song
and grinding I made lots of different
ovens always learning something new
finally I took all that experience to
create shtetl made outdoor oven this
oven is built entirely out of court and
steel sheets and the design is so simple
that anyone can put it together you just
slide all the parts into each other and
your oven is ready
it was never easier to make those
amazing good fired pizzas yourself
with the step limit oven everybody can
become another group like every
traditional pizza oven it is fired with
wood and when a piece of food is burning
it will release all its beautiful aromas
making sure that whatever you cook will
get that magical smoky flavor
you start by placing some small kindling
into the oven you light them up and once
you got the fire going
you can add bigger pieces of wood inside
top part of the oven there are two stone
baking boards these stones will absorb
all the heat from the flames and then
pass it back into the food this way when
you bake a pizza you will always have
that perfect light crispy base
introducing the Cuisinart al fresco
Morris the world's most practical and
portable ways to create perfect brick
oven style successes
great wood fire keep that it's hard to
eat in any season with the Cuisinart
alfresco Moray you can bring that
signature thin crust taste to your
backyard
it's simple setup and smart design will
have you cooking in no time the pizza
oven works like a traditional brick oven
by blending conduction conduction and
reflected heat so you get delicious
pizzas that cook evenly and in as little
as five minutes but pizza making is
about more than just the food it's a
unique experience that everyone can
enjoy together personalize your pizzas
exactly how you like them and choose the
freshest ingredients for incredible
flavors best of all its lightweight
importable making it a perfect fit to
teach camping or of course again
a warming tray key to finish the top
while you cook one and we've included
two piece appeal and an integrated smoke
to perhaps add that real wood Barbie
once you're done the hinge lid allows
for quick cleaning and cooldown the full
line of accessories including a folding
stand allow you to customize your pizza
making experience with the Cuisinart
alfresco more a perfect pizza
environment you get a crisp delicious
pizza every time your going to love
being able to create your very own
world-class stuff and trust us your
friends and family will do
welcome to owning and only pro the
world's best outdoor oven only
revolutionized the outdoor cooking
landscape now only pro is taking on the
large traditional events by offering
incredible versatility but still being
the most affordable event of six sides
I wanted to invent something that looked
amazing
that was transportable so you can enjoy
outdoor cooking anywhere and avoid the
time and effort of a stone made all the
way OD pro works is very simple its wood
fired like our other models it takes the
direct heat of the flames and the heat
stored in the stone baking port this way
you get a well-cooked top as well as a
beautiful expressive base the broth size
and multi-fuel capabilities make it very
special just like our previous models it
burns wood pellet but with the pro you
can also use regular wood charcoal and
it can even run on gas by adding a
specially designed burner which means
you're ready to go at a flick of a
switch Pro can breathe temperatures of
932 degrees fahrenheit in just 15
minutes only pro has twice the cooking
surface of our previous models so you
can cook a delicious 16 in Neapolitan
style pizza in just 90 seconds it can
cook just about anything meat fish
vegetables desserts and take the perfect
bread its tasty
social and fun
what
and
this is more than just food its heart
it's a passion and a conversation it
brings us together so we can enjoy it
together it's one of those foods that
everyone can take part in no matter who
or how old you are
and now let's Baker so pizza oven box
you can create those experiences at home
the Baker some pizza oven box allows you
to bake gourmet quality pizzas around
two to four minutes
the patent-pending design combines a
cooking chamber made of pizza stone
material with a housing that utilizes
convective conductive and radiant heat
to bake foods at about three to four
hundred degrees centigrade and best of
all it's incredibly easy to use it fits
on most three burner or larger gas or
large charcoal barbecue there's no fuel
nothing to plug in you turn on the
burners to high and wait until the
needle hits the right temperature one of
the things that I love the most about
the Baker 77 box that you don't have to
be a gourmet chef to use it you can use
your favorite store-bought pizza or
easily make your own from scratch and
you still get the same artisan quality
and taste and it's not only for baking
pizzas you can sear in Roe Steakhouse
quality meat roast vegetables baked
casseroles desserts and artisan quality
breads you name it
overall it's fun the food becomes the
part everyone pitches in making pizzas
baking pizzas and of course tasting the
different pizzas my name is Tim case and
I'm the creator of the Baker stone piece
of amongst the best easiest and fastest
way to create gourmet style pizzas right
on your own patio
