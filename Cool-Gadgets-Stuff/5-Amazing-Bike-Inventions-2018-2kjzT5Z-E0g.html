two minutes I'm gonna watch you two meet
Noriko an Erica is a smart ebike and our
vision is to make it affordable for all
people around the world let's take a
look
this is Narita an electric bicycle and
beautifully the most affordable carbon
fiber smart electric bike ever with

very lightweight yet extremely strong
monocoque carbon-fiber frame and a
powerful motor at an affordable price
with unique and recognizable silhouette
featuring a cutting-edge technology and
packed with mind-blowing options
marika is not a downhill bike but it
doesn't mean we haven't pushed it too
hard and break its limits introducing
Naya Rika heartbeat assist when
activated the faster heartbeat you get
the more assist you get from the motor
automatically this mode gives you 3
pedal assist levels based on your
heartbeat rate you can also calibrate
the percentage of assist you would like
to receive using the
I'm an engineer I design and build all
I like you
it's been a few years now tinkering with
and riding around your expected life I'm
finally happy now it takes about 20 to
30 minutes to learn to ride and in
reactions that gets on the screen are
fantastic
the bike comes in a kit they bolt
together yourself this keeps the cost
lower and perfect for those two you like
me like building and seeing or
everything works
because it's a kid the bike is also
modular you can make their trike for
increased stability and heaps easier
rides you can lengthen the frame and
their cargo bike the Bella cycle of the
bikes but it's also a starting point for
its creativity and engagement
engineering the custom parts of the bell
cycle are made of high-quality aluminum
6061 and 2024 all the bicycle parts are
standards and the design is fully open
source on our website and you should
consider the kit our jumping-off point
for further customization
the bell cycle is designed and built
here in New York City it's not normal
it's not meant for the average person
it's definitely not meant to replace
their bicycle but it's good to H tinker
the weirdo the adventurer and the
engineer if that's you or someone you
know give us a shot and back us on
Kickstarter today hi my name is Simone
I'm su designer over are Aurora is a
battery free bicycle lighting system
the wheel mounted lights are powered by
strong neodymium magnets
when a bike's wheel starts to spin the
lights move past the magnets and the
generated electric energy is stored in
the capacitor
when it's charged Aurora lights up
so we don't have to worry about charging
the battery we're getting to put it back
when it's charged for switching the
lights on or off while riding so I just
work
Aurora greatly improves your visibility
at night which makes you safer
Hara comes in two models to achive and
say 200 they find white seven seconds
and turns off just as quickly when your
bike stops motors native Android takes a
bit of time to charge but when you stop
that thread fight for example
it pays to black in a few minutes but
even after a 10-minute stop it will
return to maximum rises on the seconds
after you resume right
these lights are available in a variety
of colors and fit almost any bicycle
whether it's a mountain bike road bike
or BMX and it's just so cool
we set about to create a bicycle helmet
that had dual cameras in it one in the
front one in the back so that every time
we went on a ride
you took the helmet with you it's a
wearable camera but it doesn't take any
extra setup you get it and you put it on
you've got to put a helmet on anyway in
2014 I suffered the second hit-and-run
accident of my life and I had another
device I could have put it on the bike
and I could have recorded what was
coming but I was lazy and whilst I was
lying there I think it was one of those
lightning bolts moments I thought you
know if I put cameras into a helmet I
would take it with me everywhere I went
when I went to go and buy something like
this there's nothing available and so I
thought to myself fall if there's
nothing available why don't I make one
my name is Rebecca I'm a transfer I'm
Chris I'm an IT consultant I love I
think it's my gym just love getting it
and appreciate it actually feel alive
love the morning rides I like to ride
hard and give myself a good workout
every day it's a mental health thing
keeps me sane riding in traffic is scary
cuz it's so unforgiving I've seen people
look straight at me there's no reason
pulled out but they just do I'm a mother
I have two small children I do worry
about passing cars that can be stressful
the end of the day the car will win so
you know it's a little bit nervous
the Maury engine so the thing about
having a camera is that if there is
something that happens to me I have a
record I think it would help if there is
an incident is record exactly what the
car drivers done the fact that you can
stream what's going on in their helmet
so your phone if you mount the phone to
your handlebars and you can see what's
happening behind you that's probably the
biggest thing for me just being able to
see cars coming up behind me having a
few second ticket I'm still having a
vision of any cyclists approaching from
behind trams cars without necessarily
having to turn to look behind and look
in front it feels just like a normal
light helmet I expected it to maybe be
heavier yeah I'm really quite amazed I
thought that there'd be a lot more
weight to it good tactile on switch that
I find is quite easy to use it can it's
really easily you push a button and it
to turn it on and it's honestly I think
if every drivers thought that they were
passing a bike rider who could prosecute
them for what they do wrong I think you
give you more passing distance
definitely a bit of lip deterrent I
think we'll see motorist being a little
bit more accountable the product that
already exists prototypes are already
made
we need your backing to be able to scale
up the production of these helmets and
get them out to you so you can ride with
the most technically advanced bicycle
helmet in the world it's a great product
I didn't expect it to be this good
the experience of riding a bike is
something that we're all familiar with
what we're not familiar with is the
danger and the driver behind you that
can't gauge when you're slowing down
about a year ago we set out on a purpose
to make riding your bike safer we did
this from a driver's point of view and
as everyday driver I noticed this and
it's very difficult for me to gauge when
the cyclists in front of me is slowing
down
by using multiple accelerometers coupled
with smart algorithms the light goes
from a blinking pattern to a full
intensity solid
we call our bike light loosened and it's
designed and made in California machined
from a single piece of aluminum so this
keeps the bike light extremely light
while also making it extremely durable
this is where you come in we already
have prototypes in the field being
tested so that we can make listen even
better what we need to do now is ramp up
production so that we can drop the cost
and make urban cycling safer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
