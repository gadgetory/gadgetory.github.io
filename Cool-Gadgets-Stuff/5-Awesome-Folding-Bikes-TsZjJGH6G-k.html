years they use small wheels and hinged
frames that sacrifice performance and
ride ability in order to achieve a
compact size they are heavy awkward to
use but worst of all they don't actually
fold that small we wanted to create a
folding bike with big wheels a bike that
looks rides and feels like a normal bike
but could still fold small smaller than
any other folding bike it also had to be
lightweight easy to use and
exceptionally safe introducing helix
helix is a revolutionary new folding
bike it has 24 inch wheels but one piece
titanium frames and a patent-pending
locking systems that is free of hinges
and clamps helix can go anywhere ride it
to work put it in the trunk of your car
for your next road trip take it on your
next vacation
we set out to design the modern whole
bike that didn't compromise ride ability
for sides using patent-pending helical
hinges we were able to put the wheels
inside the frame and between the crank
arms helix was created using modern
computer aided design and manufacturing
process it uses the latest bicycle
technology helix improves on decades-old
folding bike designs in every possible
way it rides better fold smaller and is
safer and easier to use
I love riding my bike the joy of being
outside breeze in my face gliding under
my own human power even though I have a
very busy life welcome to my family's
little bike factory in Oregon I'm Hanna
Shoals the second generation and by
Friday Presidents it is my mission to
give people freedom and a healthier life
with high quality bikes that are
convenient to take with you anywhere you
go so I have something really special to
show you
it's a big breakthrough the packet the
first folding backpack bike under 20
pounds actually it starts under 15
pounds
check it out in the 120 years of folding
bike history no one has ever developed a
folding bike under 15 pounds that's
actually production-ready
until now and there's more it fits in a
backpack and it folds in under 25
seconds
we found that the limitations of common
folding bikes are that they are heavy to
carry have few gear options have greasy
chains and only come in one size the
packet is a game changer it's the
world's lightest folding bike
it's available in gears up to 11 speeds
it can be belt driven so you never have
to worry about getting grease on your
hands or on your clothes it's more
compact than all other major brands it
fits in a backpack and the best part it
comes in multiple sizes with a lot of
room for adjustability this opens up a
world of possibilities for you to have a
bike you actually want to ride and it
easily fits into your busy life it fits
in a teeny house under your desk in an
RV in the overhead compartment of a
train and into a checkable suitcase for
airline travel you really can take it
with you anywhere and everywhere with
many sizing and component choices you
can write it for cruising commuting or
adventuring my family has had a mission
to improve people's lives for 24 years
bike Friday has been building bicycles
for people to travel all over the
with our team of 27 people we hand build
each person's bike to fit their size and
personal choice from a wide array of
options the bike riding community has
grown to over 30,000 all from our little
factory using our experience fueled by
our mission we've created the packet as
the ultimate bicycle companion great for
city riding
you
we're tagged on a family by company for
the last seven years we've been creating
bike strollers that are loved and
enjoyed all around the globe this is our
latest project we do not hesitate when
we say this is the next step in the
evolution of family bikes see three
years ago we searched for our next
project we turn to a lot of people and
asked them what they would want in a
family life some answers were strange
can you make it fly somewhere
eye-opening young babies should be
facing their parents and some were just
adorable
I am Donovan we listen and set out to
create the ultimate family bike for two
years we made sketches prototypes
studied materials
carried out experiments and explored
every aspect of family bike should have
basically we reinvented the family bike
this is the taiga
2.0 the most comfortable safe easy to
ride practical and just all-around
coolest family bike you could possibly
imagine the targa 2 has everything our
customers wanted and much more safety
first Tonga has three wheels so it's
inherently stable the cargo box
materials are super strong plastics with
a metal frame inside that makes the
seating area durable and resistant to
impact the child seats themselves have
endless features and options
tugga can take one or two kids facing
forwards backwards or facing each other
or a boatload of laps to keep it
versatile in seconds target 2 turns from
a family bike into a lockable cargo bike
with extra load space on top we use disc
brakes and a Shimano gear and you can
always easily turn it into an electric
bike for effortless long distance rides
now for the fun part apart from the wind
in their hair we wanted the kids to have
a truly enjoyable adventure on our bikes
so we added the accessory bar which you
can attach a variety of fun add-ons yes
there's also a water gun and when it
rains or if the kids just want some
privacy
there's the royal canopy let's see what
else no it can't fly yet but it can all
be taken apart to fit in your car truck
oh and the seeds come in a variety of
colors because you know the personal
touch transforms our own ultimate bike
into your own ultimate fighter last but
certainly not least the price while
creating the Targa - we never forgot the
one thing everyone asked make it
affordable make it affordable you can't
fold so we did because to turn the
family bike trend into a real revolution
we had to make it accessible for
everyone whether you use it for a
weekend trip drop-off
for shopping or to carry your loyal
friends Watauga too is an ideal solution
our company has a proven track record so
this is one of those projects you can
back safe we need your help to make this
piece of family on a reality so backed
agha and help us make the ultimate
family one taga</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
