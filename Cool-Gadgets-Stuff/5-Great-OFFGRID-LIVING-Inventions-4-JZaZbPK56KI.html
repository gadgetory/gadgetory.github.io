is Michael Lally and I'm here to
introduce our new power spout til girl
product here it is it's a four jet hydro
turbine this allows power generation at
relatively low heads it's been designed
to operate from 2 metres to 30 metres of
head and generate up to 1.6 kilowatts
which is quite sufficient to power a
normal sized home obviously how much
power it can produce depends on your
hydro resource
we have spent over a year developing the
power spout Togo product and several
weeks of testing it on our test facility
full time we have done about 50 test
simulations at various heads from 2
meters to 30 meters and output powers of
a hundred watts to 1.6 kilowatts this
information is then used on our website
so that you can quickly determine what
our products will do installed at your
site we also include losses in pipes and
losses in power cables so that our
calculator will accurately predict
output power
if you ever need to service it you can
then take you back to your workshop
where you can step it down so as you can
see it's a very simple robust and
reliable product if it does need
maintenance on the bearings that can be
easily done the bearings are just tens
of dollars to replace it comes with a
two year warranty and he's going to
power your house for the next ten years
so if you've got a suitable stream now's
the time to get on and do it so let's
summarize the power spout to go product
it's cost effective it arrives in a box
fully assembled its dropship globally
all over the world via our dealer
network it's reliable it's easy to
service it can work on grid or off grid
if you do have a marginal stream and you
still want to generate your own power
you might be able to do that using solar
photovoltaic panels in the summer and
during the wet season you can complement
the power that you generate using a
hydro turbine the fact is over the last
few years
equipment for generating your own power
has dropped to very low levels it can
now be very cost effective to generate
your own power from sunlight and hydro
or a combination of those two it's time
to stop talking about doing it and
actually do it I've been doing it 20
years so I've put my money where my
mouth is
hi my name is Spencer Taylor co-founder
of fennec in the summer we're not
working we like to be outside whether
it's camping glamping climbing fishing
road trip hunt
being on dit anytime you're out there
keeping food fresh gonna be tough the
cooler as most people's go-to solution
but once the ice melts it's pretty much
useless and direct exposure to water or
Frost can reduce the shelf life and
flavor of fruits and vegetables looking
beyond the cooler your options are
pretty limited you can set up a fridge
at your campsite but they're heavy
expensive and are going to require you
to carry in a constant supply of fuel or
plug it in or go to freeze-dried food
wrap which let's be honest just isn't as
tasty and fennec we've been working for
the last four years to develop a
lightweight low-cost food preservation
system that never needs electricity or
ice we call it the Yuma 60 L it weighs
less than 5 pounds packs flat and is
easy to take anywhere can be assembled
in under 30 seconds and is powered
exclusively by water or river water and
in hot and dry conditions can preserve
food at five days without needing a
refill the secret is patent-pending
smart fabric technology our team is
inspired by humanity's first schooling
system honed over ten million years of
evolution sweating we've developed a
smart material which mimics the
properties of human skin called face
tech the flexible walls are made of a
sandwich of food safe plastic on the
inside and phase tech on the outside
water is stored in between the two and
as water absorbs heat from the food it
becomes vapor this vapor passes through
the specialized pores in the face Tec
taking heat and energy with it in hot
and dry conditions the interior can be
up to 35 degrees Fahrenheit or 20
degrees Celsius colder inside than the
ambient air temperature around it this
cooler temperature greatly extends the
shelf life of perishable food Tomatoes
kept inside can last up to five times
longer than those
left out in the open it's ideal for
fruits and vegetables that are best kept
in a stable room-temperature you can use
it on extended trips living off-grid
trying to reduce your carbon footprint
or you just need a place to store some
extra perishable food it has straps for
easy carrying and can be stacked to save
space everything from the truck to an
extra room can be turned in and
temperature stable storage you fennec
was founded with the social mission at
our core around 20% of the world does
not have access to refrigeration this
means that more than half of the fruits
and vegetables grow in sub-saharan
Africa spoiled before anyone can eat
them not only does this reduce 3.3
billion tons of carbon in the atmosphere
every year but it romantically impacts
the incomes and habits of the rural
families we've had versions in the field
in North Africa for more than 30 years
these studies have allowed us to refine
iterate our design in that time our
users have saved up to 10% of their
income as a result of less trips to the
market and less wasted food
every year the world needs more and more
energy but too much of its been coming
from fossil fuel sources contributing to
climate change we need to find a way to
make affordable energy available for
everyone without cooking the planet what
if there were way we could not only do
that but actually improve our atmosphere
well it turns out we can and in fact we
already have all power labs makes a
biomass power generator or worse at the
intersection of Agriculture and Industry
it uses the byproducts of agriculture to
generate power to enable industry the
byproducts of the power generation are
biochar which is a useful soil enhancer
and it improves the soil performance in
agriculture the total power and product
cycle of doing that because we've
returned carbon back to the soil as
biochar is carbon negative while power
labs is a mash-up of university trained
engineers DIY fabricators renewable
energy pioneers and experienced field
operators for the last seven years we've
been researching and innovating in this
whole but largely forgotten art of
turning organic material into a usable
fuel justification is a process that
breaks down organic material into an
energy dense paper that we can combust
and an engine in place of gasoline we
can turn about a kilo of biomass or two
pounds into one kilowatt hour of
electricity where as little as ten cents
compare that to almost 50 cents a
kilowatt for all current diesel power
communities around the world want and
need to develop economically and to do
that you need energy that can be done
effectively the way generators work
today you need to able to do high
amperage energy for drills or husking
things for milling for doing spot
welding all kinds of things for which if
you want to do that with solar or wind
at small scale you will likely need a
lot of battery capacity so you can build
up a lot of current and do that
small-scale generators run off of
sustainably managed biomass provides a
direct way to do it we have projects in
over 30 countries around the world
serving rural energy access operating
schools medical clinics all kinds of
different uses this is a 20 kilowatt
power plant in a package small enough to
fit in the back of a pickup truck if you
have one of these and biomass you could
have on-demand affordable renewable
energy whenever you want
introducing BioLite Basecamp complete
cooking grilling and charging for groups
hi I'm Jonathan and I'm Alec we're the
founders of bio light and co-creators of
our core technology found in the camp
stove home stove and now in the base
camp stove here's how it works the base
camp converts heat from the fire into
usable electricity via a thermoelectric
generator housed within the orange power
pack this power is a fan that blows air
back into the burn chamber for improved
combustion the surplus electricity is
then sent to a USB port allowing you to
charge your devices over the past year a
brilliant team of engineers and
designers have been working on this new
product to deliver you a unique fun and
most importantly high performance
experience incorporating thoughtful
feedback from our camp stove users we've
made a series of updates and
improvements that we can't wait to get
out to you here's what the team's been
up to we updated the power pack so that
it generates five watts and the stores
power we also built a smart dashboard
that allows users to easily see how hot
the fire is and how much electricity is
being generated we increase the size of
the cooktop to accommodate larger groups
and we developed a dual purpose cooking
surface with a OneTouch grill to boil
ever transforming the flame to meet
different cooking needs at the flip of a
switch
we added folding legs for adjustable
cooking height and a bucket handle for
easy portability and we're including a
flexible USB light to aid in nighttime
or low-light conditions it always helps
to see what you're cooking we can learn
a lot from our users in the outdoors and
at home
and through continued collaboration we
become a better company with better
products and we believe that together we
can bring safe and reliable energy
everywhere from all of us here at bio
light thanks for helping us take our
project from the lab and out into the
world
