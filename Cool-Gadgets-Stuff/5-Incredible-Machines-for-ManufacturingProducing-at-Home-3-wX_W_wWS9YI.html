first open-source CNC farming machine
farm bot moves around in the XYZ space
day and night seven days a week
growing food for you just the way you
want it to be grown farm up precisely
sow seeds in any pattern and density you
want and then waters them efficiently
the exact amount that each plant needs
based on its type its age soil
conditions the local weather and you're
growing preferences farm bot can grow a
wide variety of crops all in the same
area at the same time while each plant
is cared for individually in an
optimized automated way by growing many
types of plants at once your garden will
benefit from the natural advantages of
poly cropping and crop rotation while
you and your family gain from a healthy
and varied diet using the onboard camera
and advanced computer vision software
pharma diligently monitors your garden
detects weeds as soon as they emerge and
then buries them under the soil with the
soil sensor farm BOTS can show you how
your garden changes over time enabling
smarter more efficient farming with each
passing season with farmbot your garden
will flourish your plants will thrive
and you will gain access to fresh food
grown right in your backyard with the
practices that you believe in you
control and configure farm by using a
powerful web-based interface so no
coding is required to grow food with the
sequence builder and scheduler you
combine the most basic operations of
farm but into custom sequences for seed
injection watering and even whole
regimens for taking care of a plant
throughout its life the drag-and-drop
farm designer allows you to graphically
design the layout of your plants for a
game-like experience that's
fun fast and easy you simply press the
synchronize button and farbod does the
rest
farm BOTS hardware is designed for easy
assembly and modification with the
included tools you will assemble farmbot
to a size that suits your needs and
because everything is made from
corrosion resistant aluminum stainless
steel and 3d printed plastic your farm
bot will work for years out in the
elements farmbot score electronics
include the Raspberry Pi computer the
Arduino mega microcontroller and a ram
shield combined with powerful NEMA 17
stepper motors and rotary encoders tools
are reliably positioned within
millimeter accuracy and our flexible
hardware and software platform is
already for you to modify and expand
upon farm BOTS abilities want to design
your own tools go right ahead
leave farm bot to control lights that's
easy inspired to go off-grid with solar
power and collected rain it's already
been done and we can show you how to do
it and the most important feature of all
is that farm bot is 100% open-source all
of our software hardware plans 3d CAD
models and documentation is free for you
to download and improve upon we've
written step-by-step assembly
instructions documented past versions of
the hardware and even set up a community
wiki and forum for collaboration in the
last year alone we've seen independent
replications of farmbot all across the
globe by teams and individuals and
companies small and large now we want
you to join us we're looking for
inventors garage tinker's Packers and
DIY boot enthusiasts to dive in with us
and help grow this exciting new
technology platform
3d printing is amazing we use it to get
innovative bring our designs into
real-life objects however most 3d
printers may not live up to your
expectations cost you a lot of time and
money until now introducing the snap
maker 3d printer it makes all the things
you do with your printer more reliable
enjoyable and affordable a full metal
body and industrial outlook highlight
its premium design along with the metal
body all major components are cnc
machined from aluminum alloys to boost
the precision and capacity then they go
through the anodized process to obtain a
protective oxide layer the all-metal
designed snap maker focuses on every
detail to consistently deliver the very
best result snap maker also features an
innovative modular design giving you an
easy set up of 10 parts in only 10
minutes which is the best ever on a 3d
printer it comes with easy-to-use
software simply drag and drop a model
into it and click start you do the
design and let the snap maker do the
rest its hassle free from start to
finish
high-performance snap maker lets you
tinker and explore in unique and
exciting ways giving you the most
enjoyable experience all the time
now there's no need to focus on a fixed
screen you can check and control all
settings using its movable and intuitive
touchscreen in your hand a snap maker
also features expanded options of laser
engraving and CNC carving with
interchangeable heads snap maker can be
easily transformed into a laser engraver
that sparks your creativity and CNC
carving machine that lets your
imaginations run wild
snap maker is versatile inspiring you to
create in more ways we're very excited
about what we've built so far and want
to invite you to enjoy the creative life
with imagine moving from an idea in the
morning to a prototype in the afternoon
and think about how fast product
development could be if you could
prototype all your high precision PCBs
in-house in one day what would your team
be capable of introducing the other mil
pro the fastest and most affordable way
to fabricate PCBs without abort house
the other mil Pro mils directly from
Gerber files achieves six mil tres in
space and effortlessly handles
double-sided PCBs
why spend half your design time waiting
on the board house iterate as much as
you need and by the time you go into
production you know your parts will work
perfectly
product development becomes fluid and
agile when you can create looks like
works like prototypes in a fraction of
the time with no training required at my
tribe we work with a host of industries
everything from consumer electronics to
medical devices and automotive we have a
saying build less faster the quicker we
can learn some things the faster we can
get you on the right path and so the
other mill has provided us this great
opportunity to give our clients the
right answer faster to build less and
build it faster the other mill Pro comes
from industry veterans that build
products like you we know what it means
to develop production designs and we've
created the ultimate power tool to help
you do your job and like you we're
obsessed with precision reliability and
quality every component in the other
mill Pro is carefully selected and
rigorously tested to ensure that it
works perfectly out of the box it's time
to unlock your team's full capacity with
the only tool that can rapidly and
accurately prototype PCBs in-house with
the other real pro you'll turn your
vision into a product faster than ever
before
you
imagine that your desktop 3d printer can
print not only plain sex but of support
slain or clay lets you experiment with
automatic the position of soldiering
paste veins or even food
what does all of this now this is
possible a ceramics 3d printing here is
a printhead and pump or the precise the
position of highly viscous paste and
clay with yours desktop 3d printer
prints from wet clay or porcelain can be
burned into useful ceramics they're
strong durable heat resistant and food
safe this can be a perfect gift a
souvenir just a hobby or even a new
opportunity for your business the
ceramics 3d printing kit in here meant
several creative engineering solutions
the compact lightweight printhead can be
installed with different orientations it
is compatible with most CD printers it
provides sleep proof inaccurate
fifth tutor eliminates air bubbles from
clay made by hand you can easily
assemble and disassemble the extruder
for cleaning to provide you with
different nozzles to reach the optimal
speed and quality of printing the
syringe pump precisely dispenses even
seek play our CD pencil tip is not
limited to clay you can experiment as
many different materials and invent new
application for the 3d printing
technology stone flower graphic
technology for perfect ideas
hello I'm maker arm the world's first
multifunctional robotic arm that fits
anywhere in your workspace
I have changeable tool heads that allow
me to do some really neat stuff and I
can help my humans make just about
anything
I can 3d print freely since I don't live
in a box
I can auto level so my humans don't have
to I can make things up to 30 inches
long and 10 inches tall on any flat
surface I can make high quality 3d
prints with both filament and resin but
I can do a lot more than just 3d
printing I'm great at building the next
big thing like this I can cut sheets and
3d print corners I can pick and place
sheets and panels together and create a
custom PCB I can solder assemble
components
I can even work with fellow maker arms
voila
here's our finished project the custom
laptop I can be operated wirelessly on
all of your devices plus my humans can
teach me tricks and send me a remote
instructions I was made for creative
people everywhere I can make really
impressive toys paint on canvas and
fabric and create custom invites I can
etch glass engrave plastic and leather
carved metal and wood I can also plot
design
and yes I can even decorate cakes
another cool thing my humans can design
their own custom tool heads for me it
feels great helping my humans build
their dreams and I would love to see
maker arms and labs garages and
tinkering stations everywhere</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
