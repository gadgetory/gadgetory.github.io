hi Brian it's Monday are you going to
the office yes
great this will take 24 minutes please
turn on the radio playing kiss FM you
have a new whatsapp message from Sarah
Rocca would you like to hear it
yes please the message is meat for lunch
today
do you want to reply yes then pass for
the door
I got cool half desk well mix old house
should I send this message yes please
done
Chris I'm running late
we call Peter you have three contacts
with the name Peter which Peter would
you like to call Peter
Abraham Peter Maer Peter Wolf okay
calling Peter would
there's a traffic jam causing a
10-minute delay you can save five
minutes with an alternative route okay
please take the alternative route okay
please take the next left turn Chris is
designed for plug-and-play
you just get in a car and you plug and
unplug it like this the first time you
install it it takes less than three
minutes and it's connected to your smart
phone and to your car audio and you're
good to go Chris works with any car and
with any modern smartphone both iPhones
and Android tricks it's an intelligence
hands-free device designed from the
ground up to be operated safely in the
car - the combination of voice hand
gestures and display it is very
intuitive and easy to use and reliably
does what you wanted to do and that is a
big difference to all those voice-only
assistants out there who often let you
down because they simply don't
understand what you want to do Chris
comes with lifelong updates and
continues to get better for many people
their car is an extension of their home
it's a private space in which they spend
a lot of time and sometimes other people
come and drive with them so we designed
Chris to be a beautiful object that
integrates well with the interior of
your car it has a timeless human design
an iconic round shape and a metal ring
around the display which gives it a very
solid and valuable finish Chris makes
the drive smarter and safer by keeping
your hands on the wheel and the eyes on
the road
according to government research under
inflated tire is three times more likely
to cause a crash so do some damage
38 psi a good tire deflating into 27 25
percent lower now it's three times more
dangerous now this one and this one
okay owner it's come here I way to guess
which front tire it's under inflated
this one lifts up a little different
cell it's the same yes they do and this
is the real danger you can't tell by
just looking that's how we developed a
device to help keep you safe
introducing the Zeus smart tire safety
monitor the next-generation technology
that puts you in control of your driving
safety safety has never looked so sexy
using the most advanced German sensors
Zeus monitors both tire pressure and
temperature in real-time and sends rich
data to the app Zeus is the first ever
tire monitor to be able to detect slow
leaks with its advanced data mining
technology this proprietary algorithm
called accurate temp analyzes pressure
and temperature data over time and
alerts you to any slow leaks that other
tire monitoring systems would have
missed the app report clearly pinpoints
the exact tire and the rate of leakage
to make it even more versatile we've
designed it as a device that anyone can
self install take it with you on your
next trip and easily install in just
three steps on your rental car
when it comes to protecting your family
everywhere you go choose the next
generation and safety technology stuck
in traffic chaos every day the greatest
hope is getting home safely you always
follow the rules but you know there are
people who don't so how do you protect
your family you do everything you can to
keep saying but when an irresponsible
driver causes an accident how do you
prove that it's not your fault
introducing altered duo Z - your best
road buddy z - is a smart dual lands
dash cam that records everything on the
road
v2 has two addition designs for
different purposes standard and
commercial when you were the victim of
the hidden run accident don't worry
about it
v2 is already captured the other
driver's license plate number for those
professional drivers v2 helps you to
avoid troubles both inside and outside
of your vehicle
one easy step and you are ready to go as
soon as you start the car the camera
will automatically turn on and start
recording
when you and not with your car the tool
is there to protect v2 will
automatically turn on and the court
someone fix your car with licensed
dealer
in case of an accident or emergency stop
the reporting of back times is
automatically protected you will never
lose the important videos every trip of
your life and remember you know the
truth save them all
all kinds of cars all kinds of goods and
all kinds of drivers waste
we're engulfed by mass production
accelerating consumption and rampant
materialism products are designed to
become obsolete when it started for the
next big thing - the policing of natural
resources at astonishing rates of public
pollutants and trash into the
environment developments and
sustainability are promising but they're
not happening fast enough
and the solutions are still too
expensive and inaccessible what if we
can make a machines last longer run more
efficiently and self improved instead of
supporting the high turnover consumerism
that we see today what if we had
solution here and now that's our mission
at try Rotex recycling the problem of
waste by creating the first of its kind
nanoparticles that actually repair
machines or increase in performance and
efficiency harnessing the power of
nanotechnology we came up with a small
solution to this big problem
turbo text nanoparticles have two faces
one deadlines are one less like the
sticky side reinforces and strengthens
or the slippery side reduce subscription
just like carbon selling to diamonds in
a mantle of the earth turbo tax
self aligned through a diamond like
lattice structure under the heat and
pressure the engine
unlike other protective coatings this
process actually reverses engine wear
particle by hospitals restores it to a
better than new condition for initial
focus was to make lubricants paper among
many nanomaterials we worked on one
unique outlier reduced friction
dramatically down to super lubricity
level
with the help of national labs and
research agencies we understood the
mechanism and developed proprietary
production process after years of
research and rigorous testing who are
proud to introduce car boss a safe and
green additive for your car by improves
gas mileage boost horsepower and extend
the life of your engine car boss comes
in a small recyclable applicator that
you inject it into the oil fill of your
car as you drive turbo Tech's
nanoparticles are forged into a diamond
like armor around engine components
rejuvenating a daily driver to become
more efficient then when it was new a
third of the gas that you put in your
car is wasted on engine finishing with
612 million cars on the road that waste
adds up running on car boss or use less
fuel reduce pollution and leave a
smaller carbon footprint we're ready to
go to market hi we're the founders of
Medina
I'm Earl and this is Josh and we founded
machina for tires because we are honored
when we started oh you're buying parts
in both in the mod eventually this got
boring because we didn't actually
understand what was going on at least
with mechanical things you can see them
working but as soon as you had
electronic you can't see in you have to
either trust whoever made it or become a
car nerd we want you to stop just
bolting things on
start understanding and creating that's
why we build much machina wisdom of the
inner workings of your card kind like
routing or jailbreaking your phone once
you're in the possibilities are endless
minor cards are controlled by a sister
no computers passing information back
and forth here's what it looks like when
your cars are running somewhere in this
mass of data to the engines RPM and gear
selection if we want to create a shift
light all you need to do is I play those
pieces of information and program
machina to tell us when to ship machina
not only listens to your car but it can
talk to it too let's say you want to
unlock it a mile away machina can do
that but I mean it can also be more
complicated things like retune your
entire ECU for a new fuel type the
question really shouldn't be what can my
Akina do it should be what are you
willing to learn how to do machina works
with most modern cars machina is
inexpensive compact easy to learn
flexible to your situation wirelessly
connected and most importantly open
source and it's court machina is an
interface that connects to your car to
the obd2 port or a wired connection
using every common protocol Martina's
interface makes easily to our processor
board which is based on arduino making
it easy to work with whether you're a
beginner or a pro there's something for
you to build and create machina let me
get back to the original intention
all right make it better make it fun
make it yours you can do this and you
don't have to do it alone
in fact there's an entire community of
people who love cards and understand
technology</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
