aim your camera down if you have a
vertical sconce you can actually go
ahead and switch that so you can get the
viewing angle you want this telescoping
lens actually can connect up with the
glass of your enclosure what that means
is you're not going to have glare or any
of the blinding kind of like hey the
infrareds bouncing off the glass or the
light is bouncing off the glass I can't

Vito tanka pour vodka yeah a new video
for a saga di revoir dear
ever since the domestication of animals
in early agricultural history man has
tried to control and limit their motion
range from manual hurting to building
fences fences require considerable
maintenance and construction is driven
by high cost this material and
time-consuming process has left vast
areas with potential pastures overgrown
and untouched what if we can utilize
this natural resource for future food
production let nature decide where
animals can graze
we started 10 years ago as a group of
farmers and engineers with a simple idea
bringing modern technology and
traditional farming together what we
created is the world's first virtual
fence system for grazing animals
improving agriculture animal welfare and
the environment all at once no fence is
an innovative and cost efficient system
enabling farmers use the full potential
of their land and animals our grazing
technology consists of a solar-powered
GPS collar and a digital boundary that
is transferred to the animals collar the
collar used the mobile phone network to
communicate with our web portal an
easy-to-use mobile application simply
define the area and build your virtual
fence the fence can easily be adjusted
or moved giving animals access to new
areas and healthy pastures whenever you
decide
if an animal should wander off the
leaving Sun will start warning the
animal it's moving out of its grazing
area should it ignore the beeping sound
a weak but effective electric shock will
be given as a last resort
our technology also enables farmers to
follow their animals movements and
receive notifications if anything
unexpected should occur through our
revolutionary approach farmers can now
save time energy and money and give
animals access to healthy and varied
pastures with over two years of
large-scale testing we have successfully
proved function along with good animal
welfare now we've begun to develop our
solution for the cattle industry we're
just getting started and we want you to
join our journey allowing animals use
their full potential so we can move
forward to a profitable and sustainable
industry
