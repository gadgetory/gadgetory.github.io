and he's looking back at you he's
curious about who you are and what
you're up to this is vector this is a
video about vector heasley new creation
from Hong Ki he is a character a robot
that is meant to live in your home he's
always on he's alive the idea is really
that vector becomes part of the family
or that home both on the emotional
character side but then also on the
utility side vector is really the first
robot that uses advanced deep neural
networks to do a lot of perception and
understanding of the world around him
what he does feels intentional he can
react to inputs in his environment in
his life we generally want to find one
defining feature and then build from
that
for vector curiosity was a big one what
they're saying is you officially live in
a time when robot sidekicks are a real
thing it's a step closer to that sci-fi
robot you know that everyone wants to be
friends with that step closer means
you've got a robot in your house waiting
for you to get home
autonomous like a Mars rover aware
enough to avoid Falls like a tightrope
walker and always excited to welcome you
home like a loyal companion vectors no
slouch roommate either he's happiest
when he's helping out ask him the
weather and then he'll show you he can
set a timer and cause a commotion when
it's finished
activate robot alarm
and he can connect his robot brain to
the internet to answer your questions
he's a little robot who brings a lot to
your house he's also a little robot with
nearly 700 parts that one right there
that's his sole part okay I made that
one up but the little guy's got soul
let's get someone in here to tell him
what all this stuff actually does how
does he hear the vector has a microphone
array which allows it to hear voices and
noises and understand where it came from
what's he used to see vectored uses a
wide-angle camera
why doesn't he fall off the table for
crop sensors how come he doesn't bump
into stuff has this laserdisc sensor
right here in the front whoa robot
lasers how do we know he won't use that
for evil we have a very strict quality
control process to make sure that no
evil robotic overlords emerge from from
vector this thing is just awesome
there's got to be a huge amount of code
inside the robot there is a huge amount
of code inside the robots a few million
lines of code at this point that
software really encompasses everything
from the character to the low-level
operating system to the cloud
functionality he has a camera in his
face and that's actually one of his
primary sensors not just capturing the
light in all the pixels but it's making
sense of those pixels he knows what it
is and where the stuff is that code
creates his intelligence and his
personality we think both about the IQ
and the intelligence as well as the EQ
and the emotion you feel something for
him you bond with him relate with him
care about him and you feel that he can
relate to you and give you something
back he is your friend he was built to
help and delight and entertain you that
is delightful and entertaining so
instead of sitting back and waiting for
the robot apocalypse on key is making
super-smart robots built to bring joy
and companionship to humans
did I mention he likes to be pet and I
know vector is a really big milestone
for robotics because for the first time
ever there will be hundreds of thousands
of people living with a robot in their
homes and that has never happened before
vector is ready to live in your house
part at least he will be after the snap
sweet robot dreams buddy
you
you
after a long day who isn't happy to
settle into the most comfortable place
on earth
bad bet is comfortable but not practical
and it has not really changed for
centuries today we are more connected
than ever and it's time to give this
piece of furniture we spend so much time
in and update and upgrade that's why we
created the bed show a game changing of
a bed rolling table that allows you to
enjoy your bed like never before we
definitely prefer to be on our comfy
beds over anywhere else but we could
never redefine the comfortable position
or our laptop would overheat and sting
our legs since the creation of the bezel
we can use our laptop and reason our bed
for hours with good posture and great
comfort The Bachelor also allows you to
eat in bed without spilling everything
making it a great place for brunch
thanks to the bed show you can finally
watch your movie comfortably and you can
fall asleep safely no need to get out of
your bed for anything anymore just relax
and stay cozy under the covers you can
also work on the bed chill and believe
me you will enjoy working like never
before
The Bachelor is suitable for both small
and large surfaces of course you can
store it at the end of the bed but you
can also slide it away from your bed and
put it anywhere in your room turn the
bachelor into a table for sofas or
recliners a desk or even a console table
there are two virtual versions to choose
from the bachelor basak is designed to
revolutionize your life in bed while
keeping things simple The Bachelor Plus
is a fully poured and connected design
based on the same structure as The
Bachelor basic it provides amazing
additional features for both versions
but you'll have two drawers that you can
keep everything in rich organized and
clean
so that nothing falls on your bed we
made great edges
thanks to their forecasters batching
them easily on any floor type the bed
shield plus also provides for USB
charging ports and for power outlets so
that you can stay connected with easy
and of course you can choose your plug
type make your bedroom brighter without
having to turn on your main light with
the Batchelor plus LED light to much the
atmosphere as you move you can choose
the color mode and adjust brightness

a movie and listen to music on your
laptop or smartphone the sound quality
isn't always great right you can connect
your devices to the Batchelor plus using
bluetooth and enjoy the amazing audio

meet NGO chair the most stable and
portable seat designed for any adventure
the sturdy and comfortable go chair sits

size of a water bottle making it perfect
for taking and storing anywhere forget
taking two chairs with two hands on
multiple trips now you can carry three
times as many in one journey go chair is

once and unlike other chairs that can
take half a minute or more to construct
go chair instantly opens and sets up in
less than five seconds just pop it open
with one motion and extend the
telescoping arms that's it and when
you're ready to go just press the button
to release the frame put away the arms
and wrap it up to stowaway so you can
spend less time hauling and more time

the stability up to 300 pounds
featuring quick-drying nylon canopy the
bow chair is built for durability and
all types of weather from Lake daze and
spring and summer vacations to fall
getaways in winter sports go chair is
the last set of portable chairs you'll
ever need to own based in Santa Barbara
California we have decades of
manufacturing experience and are ready
to make and ship your go chairs I'm from
northern Wisconsin so I like to sleep
cool my husband Carl's the devil so he
likes to sleep high still we fight a lot
cuz I get too hot and Carl gets too cold
so either we fight over the thermostat
or I have to cast him out to the couch
even if you're not married to the spawn
of Satan over half of couples disagree
on bedroom sleep temperature I've tried
everything
bedroom fans just dry out my eyes
without cooling me under the covers and
most mattresses get me hot and sweaty
some companies paint and blue and call
it cooling technology but those guys are
just Carl's marketing friends from hell
classic we spend a third of our lives in
bed why can't it be comfortable
introducing bed jet the world's first
rapid cooling and heating system just
for your bed with bed Jets patented air
driven technology you can slow down or
warm up on either side of the bed
whether you like to sleep hot or cold
you can customize bed jet to your
preferences bed jet works instantly and
you can control it from your phone
tablet or remote control it's the kind
of spooky witchcraft Carl goes crazy for
it look it's a lifesaver before we got
our bed jet we were this close to
splitting up what-o
from our old bed oh because we'd be
divorced only bad jet solves the real
problem humidity just like humidity
makes weather feel hotter humidity makes
your bed feel hotter in beds trap body
humidity like a
middle school locker room making you
feel hotter unlike a middle school
locker room
luckily the bed Jets quiet cooling
system circulates fresh air between the
sheets instantly wicking away sweat just
look at bed jet versus a cooling
technology mattress with bed jet you can
go from hot and steamy it's cool and
fresh in 30 seconds or if you get to
hold the bed jet circulates warm air
everywhere making your sheets feel
toasty like they just came out of the
dryer back bed jet keeps your bed ten
times faster than an electric blanket
died and gone to hell
that jet is the best solution for cold
feet I still go on a baby
not like that Carl not ready to be a dad
and when the bed jet quietly streams air
into the patented bed jet cloud sheet
you'll feel like you're literally
sleeping in a cloud okay maybe not
literally plus it's silky quiet and so
sleek it fits right under your bed you
won't even notice it's there like a cat
and if you get night sweats
check out the sweat test bed jet dries
over eight times more sweat than a
cooling mattress bed jet is the first
device ever that's clinically proven to
relieve bedtime symptoms of menopause
like poor sleep and hot flashes now the
only hot flasher in this house is my
husband Carl hi it's Tuesday how what do
you think pants should come off whether
you want to bed jet alone or with a
partner every bed jet comes with a no
sweat guarantee try it risk-free for
sixty days free shipping if you don't
love it send it back for a full refund
and free return shipping it's pure
it's fine we're fine thanks to bed jet
Carl and I are getting a full night's
sleep and a full day's living bed jet
it's the highest rated mattress product
on Amazon with 89% of customers giving
it five stars
the other 11% are from hell or steal one
for free do not steal one you could
though just buy a lot of good ideas it's
literally the opposite of a good idea
well time will tell
hey that's cool it's called the prison
system it's a good way to go we don't
agree on a moral level stop looking for
a better mattress make your mattress
better with bed Jets
