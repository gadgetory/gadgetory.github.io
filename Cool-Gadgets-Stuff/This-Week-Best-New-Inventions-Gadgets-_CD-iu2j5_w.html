single day over the years they've
adapted from magnifying spectacles to
key fashion accessories however one
thing has always remained constant
they're just glasses until now the high
temperature for today will be 75 degrees
introducing let glass let glass is a
revolutionary pair of AI glasses
transformed the traditional pair of
eyeglasses into a high-tech
fashion-forward product that changes the
way you live at first glance let glass
appears to be a standard pair of normal
eye glasses but the clever frames can
perform a range of functions using a
built-in microphone bone conduction
speakers and touch interface embedded on
the side of the frames with let glass
users are able to listen to music chat
with friends and track activity without
having to touch their mobile phone and
can customize control settings
I was traffic to my office the traffic
was light so I'm estimating 23 minutes
our patented bone conduction technology
allows you to hear stereo music without
locking your ears it transmits music
through your bones directly to your
inner ear so you can still hear
everything around you with let glass you
can hear music and notifications and
make hands-free phone calls call Mary
using the built-in microphone hey Mary
I'll be in the office in 15 minutes
integrated with Amazon Alexa and
connectable - Siri Google voice
assistant from your phone play live free
by Tim white let glass allows you to
interact with your home technology
wherever you are on the go I've copied
in migration okay I added it add items
to your grocery list lock your doors or
set reminders all with a touch of a
finger in 80 feet
you're right let glass is designed for
people who wear glasses every day so
fashion was a key priority each pair of
glasses comes in three colors and
designs and while these glasses offer
corrective vision that you can rely on
the additional features add value to
your daily routine at a level unlike
ever before so change the way you wear
glasses change the way you live get let
glass now and open your eyes to a whole
new world of style and convenience
we use the internet to make plans
connect work and play together the
internet hosts our lives so why do we
entrust it to organisations who
typically don't have our best interests
at heart
most of our communications flow through
centralized web servers where
corporations control our online
experience they collect our information
limit our access to it and then sell it
to advertisers and because a centralized
internet concentrates power it's
vulnerable it can be censored hacked and
manipulated the internet is broken but
what if no one stood between you and
your data or dictated how you connect
with friends family and community if the
internet were free from central control
it would vastly expand humanity's
potential for creativity and
collaboration it would change the whole
game we know this world is possible
which is why we created polo polo is a
community rebuilding the internet by and
for the users rather than running
information through centralized
corporate servers like Amazon and Google
holo offers peer-to-peer web
applications that replace the middleman
with a spare computing power from our
own devices this creates a cloud run by
users like you and me holo gives you
back control of your data and online
relationships this isn't just file
hosting this is distributed crypto apps
small and large all the way up to
Facebook scale but we can't launch this
alone we need you to run a slice of this
new net and we don't want venture
capital to take control of this space
that's why we've built all this without
it and now we're asking you and your
friends to step up get a hosting box and
take back the Internet
simply get a holo hosting box enable
yourself and others to access
distributed apps through a web browser
and get paid in our secure
cryptocurrency
hello fuel polo fuel can then be used to
pay hosts for data storage and
processing plus it makes in-app
purchases and micro payments easy apps
available on holo are built on holo
chain an alternative to blockchain
technology that is massively faster more
energy efficient more scalable and ten
thousand times cheaper holo chain
architecture is so lightweight that you
can operate a full Facebook scale note
from a single smartphone that's great
news for developers who can build fast
applications that scale organically the
easiest way to help launch holo and
participate in its growth is to purchase
a holo port a pre-configured computer
we've optimized to host crypto apps just
plug it in connect it to the Internet
and start earning we've teamed up with a
world-class hardware supplier to produce
three different holo ports each with a
different capacity for earning holo fuel
choose the holo port that works best for
you and quickly earn back the cost of
your purchase if you claim one of the
first 1,000 you'll become a founding
member at holo we're building the future
of the Internet
one that doesn't impose or exploit but
empowers join our community
run holo earn crypto together we can
build a better Internet
life is becoming increasingly more
stressful there are limited healthy
options to help us recover from the
anxiety of everyday life in our modern
world of communication and technology do
you find yourself unable to completely
recover from the stress and pressures of
the day did you know that stress and
anxiety can lead to poor performance at
work in school decreased energy
headaches resorting to substance abuse
only 36 percent of those suffering from
anxiety and sleep deprivation actually
receive the treatment they need as these
people end up relying on drugs to manage
their symptoms their dependency on these
medications grows we set out to find a
product that can not only reduce this
reliance on medications but also provide
a healthy alternative to reduce stress
and recover introducing the recover
blanket weighted blankets have been
successfully used in the medical
community for years to assist those with
sensory issues stress severe anxiety and
even depression our mission has been to
make the recover blanket and the science
behind it available and affordable
to a stressed public looking for ways to
bring their body to rest easier and stay
at rest longer about his head trouble
sleeping I was diagnosed with the EDD
about 22 years ago now when I go to bed
sometimes I wake up in the exact same
position and the best thing about that
is mentally I know I got a good night's
sleep and I like it when my husband goes
out of town I know it sounds silly but
it makes me feel safer it's hard for me
to go to sleep at night and all this
it's just like we just go right to sleep
we believe he would feel abandoned and
cry and throw fit after we got the
recover blanket but like he had like a
nice hug and he went to bed a lot easier
and stays
the recover blanket is designed to fit
your body not your bed they are tailored
to be roughly 10% of your body weight
and range from 10 to 25 pounds the
dimensions are approximately 5 by 7 feet
making it the largest weighted blanket
on the market this allows enough room
for two people comfortably and maybe
even your furry friend as well the
design and quality of the recover
blanket was just as important to us as
its primary weighted function its inner
shell is designed with breathable 100%
cotton to keep you cool during the
summer and the removable plush mickey
cover will keep you cozy during the
winter months people that have
difficulty sleeping or achieving that
deeper relaxation can find the relief
they seek with the recover blanket a
body at rest stays at rest
think this can't happen to you think
again because the greatest threat to
your cybersecurity may not be from the
outside it may be from the person
sitting next to you
data breaches can cost your company
money and credibility once lost those
are difficult to recover
that's why Halbert deals the threat of
the source so you don't pay at the end
when you get up Halbert automatically
secures your computer from intrusion and
compromise when you return Halbert turns
your computer back on during all your
data from breach
Halbert an elite end-user defense system
you know you need it
our imagination is beyond what we
already know a constrained by the tools
we have at our disposal so we created
latte Panda alpha a hackable computer
for your big idea this time we literally
break down a full PC and squeeze in big
power for creators like you it comes
with Intel seventh gen core and three
CPU turbo boost up to 2.6 gigahertz
eight gigabyte dual channel memory 64
gigabytes storage and Intel HD 6 1 v
graphics this makes it four times faster
than its predecessor 20 times the
computing power of a regular SBC allows
you to fully leverage cutting-edge
technologies for your innovative
projects it comes pre-installed with
full Windows 10 Pro Licence and runs
perfectly with Linux whenever needed it
always has the power and speed to keep
up with your demands

using a flash drive run your
applications on any Mac Linux or Windows
PC enjoy fantastic entertainment and
gaming create compelling applications
boost your productivity to new heights
of quality and quotas two years ago we
came to you but the world's first SBC
with full Windows 10 out of the box
Lotte Panda has since become a standard
development platform helping to make a
difference on various projects across
the globe now we are back with another
revolution to define a new era of
computing not just for enthusiasts but
also for everyone who uses a computer
together with high quality components
Lotte Penta Alpha marks the next
evolution of your productivity taking it
many steps further making it possible
for you to focus on creating stunning
projects projects that may change the
world we live in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
