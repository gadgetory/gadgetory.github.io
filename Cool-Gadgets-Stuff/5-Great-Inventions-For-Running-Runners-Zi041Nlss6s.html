Kickstarter is for you we're going to
challenge something you probably take
for granted about your sport watch like
the rest of your performance gear your
watch is evolved to help you achieve
more we simply asked why are your
valuable stats not in your natural line
of sight we want to know our cadence
without losing we want to know our pace
without going slower
we want to know our metrics and we want
to stay focused on a sport and honor
form today's watches deliver a torrent
of information in ways we never could
have imagined
so why do we wear them the same way we
always have our vision is a bat a band
that moves your watch to the optimum
position a Bandhan enables you to view
and interact with your watch using no
arm rotation it means staying in form it
means improve safety when grabbing a
glance and it means improved comfort and
convenience when using your apps while
looking at your metrics
on top of optimizing the position it's
designed to be ultra lightweight
comfortable to wear and durable during
activity
ergonomic design creates the perfect
angle of view and interacting on the
move and is adjustable size fits
everyone on the left or right hand
stopping yet another piece of technology
from bending is more uncomfortable
positions and with a versatile design it
can be worn 24/7 or easily swap between
bends to break a hundred years of
tradition we needed to think differently
we needed to break the status quo if
this sounds like you join us and help
change the face of time
Oh
what if there is one number that could
help you run better meets tried the
first wearable device to give runners
away to measure and train with the only
objective measure of performance power
in cycling power has become the
definitive measure for understanding
intensity and work done because it's a
true mechanical representation of what's
happened by measuring power
I strive enables a runner to properly
gauge their training intensity to ensure
that their training appropriately to see
maximum improvement invented by
Princeton engineers and tested in one of
the world's top sports performance labs
stride is being called a breakthrough
for running and a perfect recipe for
improvement stride uses patent-pending
sensing technologies to track a runners
motion through 3d space and high
resolution we also track the
environmental conditions your running
through and from that we calculate your
running power with stride for the first
time runners can actually measure their
running efficiency and they can uncover
ways of running faster without actually
running harder power is the only
accurate and predictable measure of
workout intensity with stride runners
can guarantee perfect pacing on any
workout in any race across any terrain
the great thing about stride is you just
clip it on and go there's not even an
on/off switch it automatically syncs up
with all the devices you already use to
train and when you get home you can look
at all your data on your PC or your
laptop and learn all about your glove I
think stride is really going to
revolutionize the way you train for
running it gives you information that
you never have had access to before
shouldn't you use pace and you can use
heartrate but it's you know they're just
they're not great metrics at the end of
the day that's what I that's what I want
to see is my power number the bottom
line is this strides like game change
lining room only does it give you all
the information you can traditionally
get from a stopwatch or a GPS minute it
also gives you all of the forces
associated with that one giving you a
complete picture of what's happening
when you train stride running with power
Olympian champion warrior winner
none of those words describe you
and frankly you're planning on having a
beer after this run maybe four
so why did you spend $200 on these
ridiculous sunglasses Jesus someone you
know could see a dress like this
Ritt nice party tech thanks beaver urban
beers esters right yeah I mean I'm just
the voice of a guy but you might want to
re-evaluate your life choices
hey guys hold up what I've got a my life
sucks
he's fun welcome your gear should be too
cool look good
SEC play gooder hi Kickstarter we're
good er we started this company based on
a few strongly held beliefs running is
fun and your gear should be fun too
everything's better when you can bring a
dog with you and Bruce Springsteen is
just a conglomerate 30 bald eagles
placed into a human shaped denim suit
more important than all that we believe
that running sunglasses have a few
problems they're expensive they're ugly
and they're over engineered with
components you don't need who wears this
Oh gross
what are those we asked over a hundred
runners what's the most important
feature for running sunglasses the top
five responses were they look good
they're affordable they don't slip they
don't bounce and they protect your eyes
with that feedback we created the
gooders running sunglasses be home
do they look there are you seeing these
of course they look good affordable only
$25 that's not a joke we have to sell
our unicorn Reginald to make this price
possible flippin not with our brains
they have a special grip coating to help
eliminate slippage even when sweating
bouncing nope
our frames are snug lightweight with a
comfortable fist to prevent bouncing
while running protection Oh
for show we use polarized lenses with
the highest level of UVA and UVB
protection put simply these are the best
damn running sunglasses you can buy for
under $50 meet step the world's most
advanced real time running coach
welcome back snap let's do it it's three
sensors attached to both your shoes and
your hip not your ear not just one foot
but everything that has to do with
running and nothing else
step captures the movement of your
entire lower body as you move it
collects real-time data about your form
impact and fatigue using this data it
puts world-class personalized coaching
right in your ears
careful Wesley you're over pronating on
your left foot
let's adjust your step much better
your over-striding zack bring each step
in a bit you got it Catherine your
pelvic tilt is too far straighten up for
less pain good job step also comes with
drills to help you improve faster run
through checkpoints conquer the stairs
or boost your agility and improving
doesn't end at the finish line great run
Catherine now let's see how you did step
provides you with in-depth data on your
runs so you can clearly track your
progress steps shows your progress with
easy-to-read metrics it then makes
adjustments to your training plan based
on your running history step even lets
you know when your muscles are fatigued
and which specific ones are holding you
back
careful Wesley your calf muscles are
beginning to cramp take it easy it shows
you your limits and then helps you beat
them steps data becomes even more power
well when it's shared whether it's your
coach or your friends sharing or goals
helps you reach them faster it's
convenient charging system and ultra
secure attachment allows you to run as
long and as hard as you want and with
multiple colors to choose from there's a
step for everyone just press a button
and activate your agile an affordable
solution to run faster harder and
smarter
