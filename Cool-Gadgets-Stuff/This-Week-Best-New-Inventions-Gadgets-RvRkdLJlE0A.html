launch world's first truly portable
steel string guitar rock on our dream is
to create the ultimate virtual reality
flying experience we want you to feel
like you're really there as you glide
maneuver and destroy your enemies to
make our dream of reality we're building
the highest resolution VR headset to
date with an unprecedented 200 degree
field of view introducing hi max AKA dr
when you put on a conventional VR
headset the first thing you notice is
that your vision is narrow and
surrounded by darkness but with power
headsets 200 degrees of view you get an
expansive natural view of the virtual
world so you are free to move your eyes
and use your peripheral vision to own
every corner
or defeat every enemy
I thought that was like being in VR and
this one is like looking for like tiny
binoculars a view this wide requires
maximum clarity so we're using a 4k
display for each eye totaling over 16
million pixels more than 6 times the
resolution of current VR headsets we've
worked hard to make Pi max a KVR a
smooth experience with a high refresh
rate and low latency even on modest
hardware
it makes you feel
to deliver complete VR experience Himax
akv are supports through the positional
tracking and includes to positionally
tract controllers so you can pick up
objects and wield weapons
we've also built-in speakers to bring
realistic sound to your experience an
even added optional eye tracking and
hand-washing support this isn't yet
another VR hardware product we're
committed to building a complete and
open VR system that's fully compatible
with mainstream VR content platforms and
existing accessories our goal is to make
VR better for everyone so we are
collaborating with industry partners to
foster a culture of open innovation and
the global VR community and we've
already published our open SDK so you
can create your own projects for a KBR
or BioLite and we love fire a camp fire
is all about gathering round but the
smoke that comes with it can often get
in the way of sticking around it's time
to upgrade your fire with the bio light
fire pit a Bluetooth controlled wood
burning system that can cook your meals
and create an outdoor floating fire
without any of the smoke
central to the bilat fire pit is the
advanced airflow system an integrated
fan injects the fire with air across 51
jets dramatically improving combustion
by burning particulate matter before it
has a chance to escape the fire so you
can go from a spark to smokeless in
under 30 seconds the result no more
shuffling around your campfire to avoid
fumes of smoke unlike typical fire pits
you might encounter the fire pit
features x-ray mesh giving you a 360
degree view of your flames and creating
the feel of a floating fire in nighttime
conditions the high temp coated steel
chamber can hold up to four pieces of
cord wood at a time and with the hyper
efficient burn you get a roaring
campfire with half the fuel typically
required so you can do more with less
control the strength of your flames from
the palm of your hand with a free bio
light app the talks to your airflow
system to modulate fan speeds the more
air you introduce the hotter the fire
the airflow pack can provide up to 24
hours of clean burning on a single
charge and it detaches for easy
recharging via micro USB utilize the USB
port on the side to connect bio light
lighting for a perfect outdoor setup and
when you're not burning that same USB
port doubles as a power bank offering
power and a pinch to your other devices
exclusively for our Kickstarter backers
your pledge comes with a free integrated
solar cover that automatically recharges
the fire pit when not in use ready for
the beach the backyard and beyond the
fire pits folding legs and the solar
covers integrated straps make it easy to
transport if you can carry a cooler to
your favorite outdoor spot you can carry
this no problem looking to cook with
your campfire we got you covered
the fire pits a dual fuel system can
accommodate both charcoal or burn your
firewood down to embers and with the
included great top your system
transforms instantly into a hibachi
style grill for epic outdoor meals
what do plants eat those fats eat fruits
and seeds and some eat little insects
why is the sky blue when white light
from the Sun passes through our
atmosphere the blue and violet
wavelengths are scattered making the sky
appear blue to us hi I'm Sarah and this
is my little one
Ethan he's always curious about
everything and asked hundreds of
questions each day we want to encourage
his curiosity so we can explore and
learn more about the world so we invited
this cuddly little fuzzball into our
lives
meet Lu Bo an incredibly smart robot
powered by the most advanced interactive
technology woo bo is both playful and
goofy and pinks Ethan laughs all the
time a small team of graduates from MIT
and Harvard curates exciting things
about the world and shares them with Lu
Bo so Lou boy is like a knowledgeable
and kid-friendly search engine who not
only answers questions it also inspires
Ethan to explore more lugo creates an
imaginary space to experience different
possibilities so Ethan can be anyone and
work on anything no wonder Ethan asked
me so much about being a dragon trainer
lately Lu Bo always knows how to spend
an independent and creative afternoon so
Ethan never runs out of fun activities
to choose from sometimes where Bo helps
take Ethan's fun ideas one step further
and brings his imagination to life Lu Bo
is always a patient friend who helps
even to make and to create new things
sometimes when athens friends come over
Lobo gets playful and invites everyone
to get up and move around whether it's a
whole afternoon playing charades or a
completely new idea
Wu bill always keeps up like a fluffy
partner in creativity that's only the
beginning of what whoa Bo has under all
that fur like a launch pad for learning
Bluebell has more than 40 different
skill sets and since we bow is connected
to the Internet his skills are always
fresh and always growing I can also set
up daily routine reminders so in an
encouraging way Wu Bo turns routines
like brushing teeth and cleaning up into
engaging challenges and as Ethan starts
practicing these routines on his
he always had someone sharing him on
with Lubow every morning is a blast and
every bedtime is a breeze and the stars
who are blinking at us why the stars

all your vital stats immediately other
scales only tell you half of the story

picture why because you're a results

your body well a door knows it knows how
much you weigh how much of your body is
water and how much of your body's fat
but how about your muscle mass you want
to know your bone density you know why

the main reasons we feel weak when we
get older our bones just can't support

on how to improve it yeah doors like my
personal trainer although it doesn't
sweat its knowledgeable it's caring and
available 24/7 ad or smart scale was
developed by marathon runners and
doctors meet these healthy brainiacs as
a runner I like to track my progress

tour smart body compositions

individuals the team has an extensive
experience in high-tech some of the
brightest people in Silicon Valley they
understand what people need to improve

in your basic info and then connect it
with your phone via bluetooth and that's
it enjoy your personalized health tips
