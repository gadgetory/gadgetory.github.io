you ever have selection you sure can
but most people don't have enough
because let's be honest most people
don't know what they're doing I sure
didn't I was one of those cardio only
people wondering if I would ever pass
the psychos are ten what a long little
great naked chest and then I slip these
on and now I know exactly what the fuck
I'm doing the double class made me as
confident as this yet though - a ten
percentage factor 20 here's the deal
they're about five hundred different
ways that you can track cardio workouts
but tracking strength training is always
going to bid oh okay we get it
it sucks or whether it did suck you see
the double gloves automatically protects
how much weight you're lifting might
exercise you're doing and so many reps
you double what are you
even when you lose count they work with
free weights machines and bodyweight
exercises so you never miss a rep once I
get to know you the deltas up take you
step-by-step through your work outfit
pop in some headphones and follow the
program how much weight should I use
this money what s the fuck should I do
Chris one two one of the time that
increasingly now the gloves knows just
where you are in your fitness journey so
they build up the workout to build your
boss for those of you that already know
what's on doing the double closet Rack
professional metric which the power
explosion and velocity we're talking
solid statistical evidence of what a
badass you become don't just open pickle
jars crush pickle jar
pure carbon believes that strength is
for everyone that means you so stop
counting steps and start counting reps
with the Delta glow
hi I'm Damian Sanders founder of X bar
fitness three years ago I developed the
original X bar because I needed a
workout and fitness tool that would fit
my extremely busy lifestyle when we
released the original X bar in 2014 we
were new to Kickstarter and the fitness
industry with your help our campaign was
a huge success proving to us that there
was a demand for a product just like
what we were offering since then we sold
almost 10,000 X bars we're incredibly
happy about that but we're even more
excited that we have had the Xero
returns that's a true testament to the
high quality we've been striving for
since the beginning
the original x-bar is an awesome piece
of equipment but like with most first
products there's always room for
improvement
everybody loved our bars but we did hear
one request over and over you all wanted
a collapsible X bar for travel so
inspired by your feedback we gave
ourselves one simple goal design the
world's most complete and now travel
friendly personal fitness system being
travel friendly minute had to be light
it had to be durable and most
importantly it had to be extremely
versatile so that you could achieve the
workout you want anywhere anytime
our design team went back to the drawing
board and spent nearly a year designing
new concepts and testing prototypes
after almost a year of R&amp;amp;D we feel we've
absolutely nailed it and we are so
excited to introduce the X bar flight
the world's most versatile and extremely
portable personal fitness system with
the X bar flight we've streamlined the
bar shape smooth out all the angles and
termed all the fat because of your
feedback we completely redesigned the
docking system and we're proud to
introduce a revolutionary hex Connect
system with the docks now being hexagons
you have six different docking angles
for each exercise
because the doctor attached you now have
the ability to transition seamlessly
from standing exercises to floor
exercises with ease
with the hex Connect system will be
released in a future line of connecting
components to expand your arsenal of
exercises and make the flight even more
versatile and now with the Quick Center
disconnect it allows you to use your bar
as two independent handles this has
opened up dozens of new exercises like
army crawls fly push-ups and even
lateral raises the flight is so
intuitive that the learning curve is
next to zero trainers and class
instructors love it because people just
get it the second you grab your flight
you instinctively know how to use it
with this new design the flight is the
ultimate travel buddy
there's nothing worse than finding
yourself stuck in a new hotel or a new
city missing another workout the plight
is so versatile that you can now turn
your hotel room into a personal gym in
seconds and at only 18 inches it fits
about anywhere your suitcase your back
seat even your backpack and when
reconnected the flight is incredibly
stable and feels like one solid bar when
we say you can workout anywhere anytime
we really mean it
just imagine the places you'll take
yours
so whether you're a busy mom or you're
always on the road for business or if
you just have no interest in going to
the gym the flight is your solution the
gym is right there in the palm of your
hands whenever you're ready
from beginner to advanced you decide how
much you want to push yourself the X bar
flight is always ready for whatever you
can dish out if you're a professional
fighter and amateur athlete or you use
combat training for pizza
you already measure your performance but
how do you know your hard work is truly
paying off how do you get consistent
accurate feedback now you can would
strike set strike tech is the ultimate
training technology for the smart tough
fighter my name is Wes Elia founder of
strike tech I've been around boxing and
combat sports my whole life back in the
day my grandfather was a boxer and he
taught me how to box when I was a kid
and I loved one thing I discovered from
my own training and from talking with
other fighters was a frustration of not
being able to truly measure your
performance or improvement Strike Tech
was created to help you learn to be a
smart tough fighter an instant source of
feedback that measure speed power
punches and other struts all synced to
an interactive mobile app and unlike

tag was created specifically for combat
sports train strike tech is very simple
to use place the sensors on your wrist
sync them to your smartphone or tablet
go through your routine
get instant feedback measure result and
set new goals it's just that simple
my name is Montana I've been training
for three years I'm always looking for a
speed advantage I may not be more
powerful than my opponent but if I hit
them twice as fast I don't have to be
stretched extract my punch counts and my
speed when I'm training beg text if you
need the confidence to know my hard work
is paying off my name is Mark de la Rosa
I've been training for nine years I'm
all about power the impact of a punch
if you only train by feel you're only
guessing out your punching power with
strike tech I can measure my power and
performance we know we have a great
product we developed it and tested it
with professional fighters now anyone
can have the same competitive advantage
as the pros at a price that most
athletes can afford check out our perks

strike tech the next big thing and
combat sports training strike Tec is
what you need to be a smart tough
fighter

ready to run today time can stand a
minute we are a group of passionate
runners some of us run all the time and
some of us run occasionally but common

idea of shift IQ we created the world's
first virtual running coach with
artificial intelligence that measures
the way you run and give you live
feedback while running straight on your
body and lean forward from your uncle we
wanted to create a product that would
help runners run better faster and

personal running coach that helps you
become a better runner one coaching
