capture your own funny moments
although tracking is critical clever how
to try out all the tracking stabilizers
in the market we found out there's a lot
of room for improvement
it is too easy to lose sight of a target
when the object is shaded or simply
moving fast
that's where taro campaign
Carroll is an auto tracking device to
control ikana that are always keep you
in a frame
all you need to do is put on the
infrared tag and leave the rest to taro
our tracking camera will instantly
identify where the object is and our AI
algorithm will pinpoint it exactly at a
blazing thirty calculations per second
that's 15 times faster than our
competitor now with taro I even ran out
it's moving as fast as 50 miles per hour
with taro zero lagging tracking feature
your object will be constantly locked in
even during very sharp turns
Taro's dynamic tracking works perfectly
even when you yourself are also moving
fast because it sees and captures
fast-moving moments so smoothly you
won't even need to look at the screen
with three high torque brushless motors
hammer action camera see video jitters
are now a thing of the past and with our
app breathtaking action sequences
pictures and videos are just a single
click away as a group of AI software
engineers we've poured our heart and
soul into getting our prototypes just
right we are now so excited to be
releasing not just one but three devices
taro t1 for smartphones and GoPros taro
TX for DSLR cameras and taro in one a
separate tracking module that's
compatible with all stabilizers whether
you're a blogger sports freak animal
lover or whatever now at last you can
put yourself in the frame and
confidently capture every moment that
matter whether you already have a
stabilizer or perhaps looking to buy new
one the taro bringing your shooting
experience to a whole new level it's
badass today very oh sorry and work
karlof you're setting me up oh we hit
the microphone
I'm cat I'm obsessed with the universe
under some of this projects up for you
in ten words deep space glamour the dark
3d printed fine artwork I believe good
artwork should clearly inspire you and
that's why I think space is so important
when faced with such amazing beauty we
stop thinking about the small things
that really aren't in that important in
life and we start thinking about the
bigger picture it creates all these
important contemplations about the
meaning of life and where we came from
and it's these contemplations they drive
us to be better people and they
encourage humanity to push the
forefronts of science last year I spent
thousands of hours ham painting these
deep space artworks so I could share
them with you in this campaign and as
well as that we've developed an insanely
cool fine art G play printing method it
uses a groundbreaking 3d Glo print
technology in short it'll create Museum
standard fine artwork not only will you
be able to physically touch the
brushstrokes but they glow in the dark
in an amazing fashion we're gonna be
using one of the strongest
industrial-strength phosphorescent
pigments available on the market today
it's a closest thing you can have to
having an original painting and the
coolest part is that these fine art
prints absorb natural daylight and they
glow for up to eight hours and darkness
it means that when the lights go down
the universe comes alive and these
limited-edition prints are hand finding
graphite with generous borders for
framing
they'll be printed using our
revolutionary methods on luxurious
archival 100% cotton canvas and Y&amp;amp;R
travel and paper the paintings can be
rolled and shaped in a rugged tube and
sent anywhere in the world
there'll be a few slots for custom
commissioned work this is where you come
up with your favorite spacing and colors
and we work together to make it happen
so this year we'll be shipping
a colossal painting to the team at
SpaceX Italy but this painting has taken
thousands of hours of meticulous
painting to create and I hope to deliver
it along with a plaque with all the
names of the backers that made this
dream a reality it's really simple how
it worked you pick the number of
artworks you want and the material and
then once the campaign is over you get
to pick from a massive collection of
paintings I just want to say thank you
for taking the time to look through all
of this project please pledge now I hope
you come on this journey with us and
become part of the space family
please family historically we've made
speakers and headphones and made a very
big business out of making products that
delight customers we're gonna now help
people live more fulfilling lives with
audio products that are focused on
wellness rather than just entertainment
so there are three pillars of general
health and wellness some nutrition
exercise and sleep and most people go
through life thinking they can cheat
sleep they can burn the candle at both
ends there are significant health
implications for not sleeping enough and
not sleeping well things like
cardiovascular disease type 2 diabetes
obesity cancer Alzheimer's are all
medically statistically linked to poor
and insufficient sleep this product is
designed to protect people's sleep from
unwanted disruptive noises if the
honking of taxicabs people talking loud
neighbors a dog barking in a hotel
environment that you're just not
uncustomed to the snoring person right
next to your head I mean we've been
learning about years at Bose for a very
long time and we've been able to
leverage a lot of that knowledge we
combine boses noise-isolating stay here
plus tips with soothing sounds that are
optimally tuned for masking noises so
sound masking works on this basic
principle that if you have this
disturbing sound that's going on let's
say like a low rumble of a snore and you
play another sound that's close to it in
frequency so let's say a low like
Thunderstone
that thunderstorm is actually going to
help to cover the original snoring sound
what makes it special is our ability to
do that in a form factor that is tiny
comfortable and stable so many people
sleep with the ear pressing into a
pillow so the stay here plus tips are
incredibly soft and you'll see when you
touch them and feel them how comfortable
they really are and how you like having
them in your ear Bose has never made a
product that's this small before we sort
of debated and fought over every
millimeter that we could gain to make
the products smaller it's actually very
easy to use so you download the Bose
sleep app insert the sleep buds into
your ears select which noise masking
sound you prefer schedule a wake up
alarm and you're good to go
the charging case is actually very cool
you get two nights of sleep on a single
charge to the sleep buds themselves and
then the charging case will provide one
additional full charge while you're on
the go we were lost it was close to
midnight we had all of our belongings on
us and it was starting to look like we'd
be spending the night on the streets of
Bogota on that night in Colombia flinty
was born
when was the last time your phone let
you down did you need to call a loved
one or get an uber out of a dodgy night
spot or you like us stranded without
Maps or a hotel address the solution to
this common problem isn't a chunky power
pack that's just sitting at home when
you need it most the right solution
needs to be pocket-sized and versatile
introducing sidekick by Flint
say you're on an adventure or you're in
a situation where traditional charging
just isn't possible no problem
sidekick can take charge from double-a C
&amp;amp; D size batteries which you can pick up
anywhere so what about the times when
you can't find batteries
well sidekick has a Japanese made
rechargeable lithium built-in
or maybe you're running low at work or
at the airport just plug in with
sidekicks built-in fast charge cable
sidekick was designed as an everyday
carry
so we're bundled in a lot of everyday
features check them out below a
successful Kickstarter creators and
serial backers we know how it feels when
a project is delayed or worse fails so
this time around we've done all the
heavy lifting up front we've completed
electronics tooling mass production
round one and quality control now we
need your help to fulfill our factory's
minimum order quantity please if you
value connection and rely on your phone
back this everyday carry phone charger
we won't let you or your phone down</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
