introducing the wolf and grizzly grill a
compact stainless steel grill that you
can install within seconds we've
engineered the wolf and grizzly grill in
two parts for simple assembly a frame
that you pull apart and a surface that
you unroll and secure in place and
because there's no such thing as one
fire fits all the WG grill features
three different height configurations a
high position to cook above a wood fire
a mid position for a charcoal barbecue
in your backyard and a flat mode that
lets you use what you have around you to
cook as high or as low as you feel
compelled to compact and weighing about
a kilogram the grill is designed for
easy transport and everyday use and
because of the carefully selected
materials and finish a beautiful patina
develops over time you'll be proud to
watch this real Larian as they become
the testament to your adventures hi can
I show you something really cool in this
tin is liquid plastic to take out the
tube you squeeze the tube on this tin
you can make instant liquid plastic in
four seconds this is a honey like
substance there's no solvents in it only
you determine the cure time watch this
one two three four that's instantly hard
plastic my name is Rob and my business
partner dr. Tom Offerman in Germany
invented bondic sadly two and a half
years ago just before we're about to
press the Go button on Kickstarter he
passed away suddenly and our priorities
completely changed fast-forward bondic
has become a hit with the makers and the
DIY community the problem is that with
the success of bondic came all the as
seen on
the industry who in spite of our patents
basically knocked everything off and
instead of making the lawyers boats a
lot bigger we decided not to be the 38
or 39 person on the lawsuit case and
what we've done is to distinguish
ourselves from everybody that's copied
us
I took the beginning of what dr. Tom and
I were working on and finished it off
this is the bondic evo and the
difference is that now the two points in
the right direction and you don't have
to flip it so when it gets low on fluid
there's no waiting for the fluid to come
back also the LED is exactly in the same
spot right by the tip so you can drop
and you can cure and you can drop and
you can cure right away now easier than
ever before to change the batteries you
can pick them up in any dollar store
bondic isn't just for makers it's for
everybody's for professionals for
hobbyists for moms dads kids if you've
got something very expensive made of
plastic there's really no better way to
repair it we've been hard at work and we
thought this is the best time to launch
bondic pro with your help we can
determine which variations are best to
take to retail
thanks for taking the time and we
appreciate your support
