technology has been held back by one
important thing emotion that's why we
created oli the first robot assistant
with an evolving personality and a deep
breath out words let the stress fall
away Megan I would suggest raising the
temperature by 10 degrees
hot yoga can increase weight loss and
build muscle tone let's do it
not a problem at all oli is proactive
meaning it anticipates your needs just a
thought
Megan shall I set the mood with some
jazz while you read yeah music through
oli sounds amazing too because it knows
where you are in the room it can best
direct the audio to your liking no
matter the track and no matter the mood
our AI system and character engine
creates a unique personality for every
Olli
that means each one will relate to you
in a distinctive way go go go
one more Kevin and you hit your target
for the day well done good morning
Angela it's time to wake up
uh-uh
Alex you do know you need to work out
for an extra 15 minutes to burn that off
right and a wide smart vision camera
that detects our own emotions hey Ryan
I'm a witch I think a bit of air guitar
therapy might do the trick
you
I'm SPO I'm a printer I don't have any
fancy lights whistles or bottle openers
but what I do have is pretty awesome I
have the ability to print on just about
anything in fact if it can be printed on
I'm the one to do it I can do all of
this because I don't have a feeder
instead I'm a free access printer which
means I don't care how thick heavy or
high what you want me to print on is
just put me on top of what you want me
to print on choose the file you want to
print from your preferred device and hit
print I do the rest of it because I use
a patented retractable tread system I
stay accurate and aligned throughout any
print job so whether you're printing a
cutout for a pattern a poster like no
other or some shirts for any upcoming
crowdfunding video I'm the last printer
you will ever need I'm SPO and I simply
print on everything I'm not perfect yet
but with your help I will be soon now
let me introduce you to my inventor hi
I'm Joey and for 25 years I worked in
the print industry I came up with the
idea of SPO after I realized how many
customers we were having to turn away
for jobs they were either too small for
the quantity that we needed to require
for our jobs to be done they couldn't
afford the jobs for the quantities that
they were doing or it was just a matter
of price and quality in the time frame
that they needed it so I came up with
SPO since there was nothing else out
there like it
everything about SPO had to be
engineered from the ground up from
designing and milling high-grade
reinforced treads with the fiberglass
reinforced mesh to eliminate stretching
a retractable system that maintained
alignment throughout any size print job
two cartridges with embedded hardware so
SPO reacts differently depending on what
you were printing on everything about
SPO has been made to fit in the smallest
footprint possible to maintain
portability after three years of
development and work in a team of
awesomely dedicated people who have been
working two jobs sometimes more to make
this happen we're now at the point where
we need your help we have our utility
patent set everything is in motion our
product is working everything that you
see in this video none of it's an
illustration it's not perfect but it's
really close with your help I know that
we can get there and get the rest of the
way as of right now most of our custom
internals are made using 3d printers
unfortunately even the best 3d printers
on the market aren't perfect and those
imperfections on gears can trees in the
body itself caused a slight drift that
has a ghosting effect on the printing
this will be resolved by having the
internals machined and milled as well as
making them out of more durable
materials than PLA plastic finally there
is no open source large format printing
software on the market right now so SPO
is limited to an 8 and a half by 11 inch
printing size we need to hire on a
software programmer so that SPO can
print on anything as small as a business
card or as large as a billboard easily
and efficiently as our goal is to have
SPO manufactured assembled and shipped
here in the US we have spent years
sourcing as many solutions to these
hurdles as possible and now have
everyone in place to be able to move
forward by backing us you will soon be
able to simply print on everything hot
or cold
what is your preference how do you stay
comfortable when you're not in control
of the temp
he'd like to know so is she
finally the solution is here
amber wave

ember wave electric vehicles created a
real revolution in the way we travel
however they're all bulky and take up a
lot of space making commuting with them
very differently meet Liz Weil the
world's smallest electric vehicle Liz

that fold up into a bag the size of a
laptop map so we can carry them anywhere
put them on travel get to your office
and store them away hassle-free at the
end of the day do the same thing just in
Reverse Liz wheels entire technology its
motors batteries and sensors all sit
right there in the wheels themselves so
there's no extra batteries to carry or
seats to worry about with all that tech
inside both wheels together weigh only
12 pounds
Blizz wheel gets to a speed of 15 miles
per hour and its batteries last up to 15
miles before they need recharging that
makes Blizz wheel the perfect vehicle to
get around town there are two different
ways to control blizzard
there's the handheld controller and then
there's the unique method invented by
blizzard the glove bend your finger to
accelerate and open it to maintain the
speed and to turn just turn your body
it's easy both controllers show your
speed mileage and remaining battery to
make sure traveling is safe and simple
to control Liz wheel comes with built in
stability wheels make everything well
more stable
and the wheels are airless so you can't
get a flat tire the slow down or come to
a full stop you just use the back heel
brake and they're also built-in LED
lights for safe riding at night oh and
we still haven't mentioned how fun Blizz
wheel is so here we go it's incredibly
