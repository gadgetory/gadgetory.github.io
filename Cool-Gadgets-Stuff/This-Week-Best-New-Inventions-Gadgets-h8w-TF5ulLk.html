legend so to speak about how things came
to me this story is one of rebirth the
first thing I say when people ask I'm
standing hoverboard is no it will not
catch on fire
one family saying the hoverboard they
bought for their son ignite many
youngsters this year want a hoverboard
exploding every degree possible so why
would anyone in their right mind make
another hoverboard well came to life
when this aerospace engineer and this
electric vehicle engineer were
hand-picked by this entrepreneur to
believe they could do something better
so their journey began with question how
did everyone get it wrong to think of
that out these guys went straight to the
source the boards that were coming out
of China
shaaka the necessary steps to produce a
safe board didn't exist in his assembly
line it was how fast and how cheap can
we produce and sell to America
we were unsafe we visited those
factories we saw bad conditions of not
only the workers but of manufacturing is
techniques we came back here inside of
the bikini better and they did just that
sleeves rolled up this team hit the
reset button determined to avoid mistake
to the Past blaze a new path to the
future so from the ground up
they built move from scratch right here
the good old US of A everything is
custom science to make not only unique
ride but completely safe products
traditional hoverboards really seem like
toys he wanted something more robust
more sturdy something that you felt
solid anything equal he heard of right
this board is no toy it's a machine
built to be ridden with a solid platform
and larger wheels move is ready to hit
the trail and when you need a break it's
easy to safely hop off and carry thank
you traveling with noodles breeze
you might wonder if it suits all types
of riders well building locks they
thought of that too when issue that we
saw a traditional other boards was new
riders to the struggle to learn radical
what we developed was custom ride
profile would help the new riders learn
but yet gave the advanced riders the
nimble medical quick ride in their
logical carving that moon feels
different intelligent ride sense
yourself the board for you like your ski
skateboard or even survey just without
the waves this board is really fun to
ride it's not just getting you from
point
it's allowing you to have fun while
you're doing being outside - Oh gross
so this radical new smarter stronger
better and unlock the 71 Ford Pinto this
pony won't blow up the future is here it
gets called the moon
all over the globe the energy used for
air conditioning is increasing rapidly
in the u.s. almost all of our homes have
AC and consider that the AC use in the
US generates 117 million tons of co2
each year it's a big problem but energy
problems are complex hard to fix and
usually end up costing the consumer more
while miss box is a simple solution that
helps you reduce the environmental
impacts of cooling your home while
saving you money in the process
miss box installs to your existing AC
unit in just minutes
bring the benefits of evaporative
cooling proven in industrial
applications for decades right to your
home our new design incorporates modular
components proprietary technology and a
smart learning algorithm that
continually adapts to optimize savings
at the core of the controller is a
unique combination of sensors allowing
this box to function completely free
from wiring a powerful logic board with
integrated cellular connection provides
miss box with a direct secure seamless
communication channels this marks a huge
step forward for connected devices by
eliminating the need for clumsy setup
and unreliable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
connections to ensure the water mist is
safe for your air conditioner we've
developed a water treatment system with
leading experts in the field and to
allow this box to operate autonomously
we have created a wind turbine generator
the charges mist box whenever your AC is
running by monitoring AC usage and the
environment around your unit miss box
continuously optimizes its performance
to maximize savings and you can track
all of this information right now app
we've partnered with a Tier one
manufacturer which will allow us to meet
demand and deliver the product later
this summer
independent third-party studies have
proven the miss box can save twenty to
thirty eight percent of energy costs
we want miss box to be affordable for

total wireless earphone you know that
feeling
Oh
hi I'm Paul and this is Turing tumble
Turing tumble is a new type of game
where kids build mechanical computers
powered by marbles to solve logic puzzle
it's a snap to learn it's fun it's
addicting and in the process they learn
how computers think when I was a
professor at the University of Minnesota
I thought how important it was for all
students to learn to code and had a
solid understanding of computers I have
three young kids and I'm trying to teach
them all I can about computers we've
built robots play games that teach
coding concepts and built electronic
skill and while those things have been
helpful that all treats computers like
abstract black boxes they teach how
computers behave not how they work they
overlook the fundamental most amazing
concepts how a bunch of simple switches
connected together in clever ways can do
incredibly smart things I designed turn
combo the let can see and feel how
computers work the logic isn't hidden
behind a computer chip it's all right
there in front of them
no electronics at all here's how it
works the game board holds a handful of
marbles on top one marble is released at
a time like cycles of a processor the
marble rolls down the game board and at
the end pushes down the lever that
releases the next ball
you build in logic by placing six
different types of parts onto the game
board the ramp acts like a wire sending
balls in one direction or the other
the crossover acts like wires crossing
each other
the fifth aDNA logic it stores
information by pointing right or left
like a 1 or 0 the Interceptor captures
the ball stopping the computer with just
means for parts it can be some
surprisingly smart thing it can count
add subtract multiply and divide it can
create pattern and it can do some types
of logics add the gear and gear bit
pieces and the computer becomes Turing
complete which means that the board was
big enough it could do anything a
regular computer to do I designed a
series of 51 fun puzzles to help kids
discover for themselves how to build
little computers solve a variety problem
the puzzles are tied together with a
comic book story beautifully illustrated
by artists and programmers all young lee
where each puzzle brings alia the space
engineer closer to being rescued from a
seemingly deserted planet there's always
a great aha moment when you figure out a
way to solve the puzzle it's intensely
gratifying to build it watch it work
this isn't a simple game literally back
in the box collecting dust after a few
hours of play a kid can set it up on the
kitchen table or their desk and keep
coming back to it some puzzles take 5
minutes to solve and others don't need
to come back to over and over with fresh
eyes and try again and adults looking
for a challenge
this game is not just for kids it
requires you to think in a way you've
probably never had to before and the
later puzzles are a formidable challenge
even for seasoned software engineers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
