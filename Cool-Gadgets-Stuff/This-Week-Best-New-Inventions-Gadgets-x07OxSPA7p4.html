prototyping we're ready to introduce the
Spry a waterproof drone that floats like
a boat can briefly submerge on the water
then flip back to fly in the air at over
40 miles per hour
it's a combination of a racing quad and
a photography drone with a robust
waterproof body and yes the first ever
waterproof remote control the waterproof
remote control has a built-in monitor
that allows you to watch the live video
stream and on-screen display information
the sprite can also send its video
signal to several monitors
simultaneously so you can share your
flying experience with your friends on
the spot
the surprise 4k camera tilts up and down
to always point in the right direction
during flight Orwell floating this
allows you to see what's under water
another cool feature is the expansion
port that allows future accessories to
be attached on the bottom and enhance
the surprise capabilities
you can turn the GPS on and off from the
remote control to fly freestyle
or activate its advanced flight features
like Follow Me object orbit and return
to remote-control location so that if
you're on a moving boat the Spry will
always come to where you are if you're
more into robotic flying you can use
this Fry's app to set up waypoints on
the map and fly a designated path
completely hands-free
the Spry is compact and comes with
everything you need to fly the moment
you get it the carrying case battery
remote and charger
you
1.8 trillion pieces of plastic float at
the surface of the Great Pacific Garbage
Patch hear the ocean cleanup is
deploying the world's first
technological solution to this growing
problem the principle behind that is
simple create a coastline where there
are none concentrate the plastic and
take it out the system consists of a 600
meter long floater and a 3 meter deep
skirt attached below the floater
provides buoyancy to the system and
prevents plastic from flowing over it
while the skirt prevents smaller
particles from escaping underneath as
the impenetrable skirt creates a
downward flow marine life can safely
pass beneath it here is how the system
catches plastic the system takes
advantage of three natural oceanic
forces winds waves and currents both a
plastic and system are being carried by
the current however wind and waves
propel the system only as the floater
partly sticks above the surface while
plastic is primarily just beneath it the
system thus moves faster than the
plastic allowing the plastic to be
captured the skirt extends deeper in the
middle of the system than on the outer
edges as the current applies pressure on
the skirt the system naturally adopts a
u-shape which enables it to concentrate
plastic in its center like a funnel
the drag generated by the skirt also
acts as a stabilizing force allowing the
system to reorient itself when the wind
changes direction and because the system
like the plastic is free-floating it
automatically drifts to the areas with
the highest plastic concentration fitted
with solar powered lights anti-collision
systems cameras sensors and satellite
antennas the system actively
communicates its position at all times
and continuously gathers performance
data
periodically a support vessel comes by
to take out the concentrated plastic
like a garbage truck of the ocean the
plastic is then transported to land
recycle and made into durable products
this is the first of a fleet of sixty
systems once deployed the fleet is
expected to clean up 50% of the Great
Pacific Garbage Patch every five years
hi I'm Zack app and I'm a scientist
I have a PhD in microbiology and
immunology in the University of Michigan
and those statistics about hangovers
kind of mind-blowing
despite being something that millions of
people face all the time
hangovers have never had a real solution
as a scientist that's in crazy so I
looked at what we knew about hangovers
using my 10 years of genetics experience
I made this this is Z bionics a
bioengineer probiotic bacteria that
helps prevent a hangover in this one
ounce bottle is just engineer probiotic
water and some flavor let me explain how
it works and why it's a different
drinking alcohol produces a toxin called
acetaldehyde if this toxin not just the
hydration that causes the worst morning
after effects of drinking using genetic
engineering we built a probiotic that
breaks down acetaldehyde we started with
a natural probiotic bacteria found in a
Japanese superfood called natto then we
altered its DNA so that it produces an
enzyme that breaks down acetaldehyde
this is similar to what your liver does
but our probiotic does it better after
spending a year building a prototype we
put it into a drink with this hypothesis
before drinking alcohol you drink our
probiotic and it works in your gut
throughout the day and night breaking
down acid aldehyde and setting you up
for a great next morning
almost half the corporate world suffers
from back pain that is chronic even
constant because long hours spent
sitting the wrong way in a car at home
and work most of our daily routine is
dominated by the seated position for
years back pain has been a serious
problem in our society often resulting
from a lack of movement and poor posture
the solution support optimize your
workplace in a comfortable way through
healthy and active sitting
imagine the gentle pressure you feel
when you accelerate your car we've
designed our innovative product to
incorporate the benefits of that
pressure in a sensation we call the
boost effect the boost effect pushes you
back into the best position it's a one
size fits all solution that can be
combined with any office chair with
special airing to ensure a non-slip
surface and anti stretching materials
suitable for all floor types this fusion
of soft and hard materials give the sit
board its unique and simple design we
have worked closely with health and
safety engineers to guarantee a safe and
comfortable working experience
most on-the-job accidents happen by
slipping stumbling and falling that's
why we intensively discussed all
necessary safety aspects during the
development of the support
lastly we pursued a very flat design and
chosen a highly slip resistant surface
so that's what makes the board
well-suited to all surfaces and shoe
designs whether you're wearing a sneaker
with rubber sole or a wet leather office
tree you're always guaranteed a secure
foothold you can immediately feel the
difference between sitting without any
lower back support and sit boarding sit
fort represents a new generation your
key to a modern and dynamic workplace
with support you have the opportunity to
experience movement even while sitting
intuitive movement that activates your
entire body maximizes your concentration
and increases your capabilities
almost 30% of people forget whether or
not they locked their door they end up
wasting precious time to return home and
check the door or risking potential
burglary meet sure key it's the world's
first add-on for your keys that gives
you the peace of mind that your house is
safe with sure key you don't need to go
back and check the door you just need to
look at the sure key to get to know if
your door is locked
it's easy affordable and much safer than
smart locks
Shirky notifies you if the key is left
in the lock whether it's on the inside
or the outside of the door are you sure
you lock the door with jerky you are</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
