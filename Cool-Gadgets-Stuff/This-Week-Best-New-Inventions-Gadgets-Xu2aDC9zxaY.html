smallest phone breaks the ice in any
situation you can save up to 300 numbers
make and receive calls and even text be
a part of the tiny revolution and be the
first among your friends to own a piece
of history
our mission is to help people take back
the outdoors from insects and we want to
do that in a different way
mosquitoes are actually a growing
problem there's new diseases there's
Zika there's dengue there's West Nile
the season for mosquitoes is getting
longer and longer and they just get in a
way of spending time outdoors enjoying
the activities that each of us love and
spending time with friends and family in
our backyard sprays and repellents that
you put on your skin just get in the way
of outdoor fun so radius is a new and
better way to fight mosquitoes you just
turn it on and mosquitoes are gone the
radius of ice is so easy to use it's
push-button simple literally one button
on the front of the vice you push that
to turn it on you instantly see the
light come on and that lets you know
that the device is active and working
radius uses an EPA approved active
ingredient that is based on a naturally
occurring repellent found in the
chrysanthemum flower and our scientists
have worked on a formula that can be
activated at a lower temperature which
enables us to use a rechargeable
lithium-ion battery in order to heat and
activate the repellent creating the zone
of protection this is the first time
that battery power technology has been
combined with this active ingredient
I love the refill of the system to
deliver a simple refill system they had
to last a long time
and any other products that are out
there what we deliberated was an
incredibly easy to use easy to replace
refill process it was definitely a great
moment for us when we were first able to
put the product out in the field and see
that everything that we knew on paper
hypothetically was supposed to work
actually did work saying that yes this
in fact was working and delivering the
type of mosquito protection that we not
only held ourselves to but also that we
knew consumers would expect from us the
first time they tried the product we've
been through several rounds of prototype
testing on radius and we do that before
we even begin to think about mass
production our test facility in Georgia
has put radius through its paces and in
fact they're seeing reductions in
mosquito pressure amongst the best
they've ever seen we think radius is a
perfect fit for Kickstarter it's a novel
new and different way to fight
mosquitoes and it's really a blend of
the most advanced digital technology
with cutting edge repellent formulation
paired together that gives you a
solution the fighting mosquitoes that
simply hasn't existed before we're
really close to development we have
everything about the product designed we
have the approval from the EPA now we
just need some help with funds to do our
first production run so to our
Kickstarter backers we can promise
on-time delivery of an area miscue
repellant solution that actually works
radius is convenient it's portable you
can take it with you anywhere and
because it's lithium-ion powered you can
even take it on a plane so your next
trip or adventurer destination you can
take radius with you
this is game show it's a game console
that's modular portable and open-source
so you can do all kinds of cool stuff
take Jackie for example hi she used it
to play indie games like the classic
platformer cave story and with game
shells expandable memory slot she can
download thousands of more titles online
when Jackie's feeling nostalgic she can
also run emulators on her game show
unlike a slippery touchscreen the
classic controller layout is perfect for
retro gaming or you could be like Tom he
likes to mod his games like adding a
cheat codes or new character models he's
even working on developing his own game
for game show it's a prequel to Tetris
you can use Python C Lisp or any other
language and for makers like William
game shell is an all-in-one dev kit that
runs to new Linux each kit comes with an
air embassy for an Arduino compatible
programmable keypad a 2.7 inch screen a
1050 milliamp battery and a stereo
speaker you can choose from six
different case colors and with our STL
file you can even 3d print your own with
game shells plug and play modules will
doesn't waste any time searching for
compatible parts everything just works
right out of the box then he just writes
his code on PC or Mac and he can upload
it wirelessly through a Wi-Fi connection
game shell had become a Wi-Fi speaker a
controller for your robot a smart home
remote and even an 8-bit synthesizer the
possibilities are endless from the
beginnings of gaming to the future of
hardware game shell is with you wherever
you want to go
you
hello Kickstarter my name is Nils three
years ago my team and I came to you with
an idea we wanted to let you know your
home was safe without invasive cameras
or complex security systems that's why
we designed point thanks to you the
point is now used by thousands of people
across the world today we're launching
the next generation we've learned from
our community and we've seen of families
and neighbors come together when the
unexpected happens that's why the new
point is fool home alarm sign for
collaboration we think you'll love it
meet Susan Bob and Judy Anderson and
their neighbor Alex this is their home
with point point consent smoke
point can sense noise
point consents movement
traditional alarm systems rely on many
individual devices and sensors the point
combines sound motion and environmental
sensors in one device through machine
learning it identifies what's happening
in the environment much like a brain
when point detects something important a
message is sent to a group of people
chosen by you so you can help each other
out when needed point is now serious
business and the team behind it is
growing after more than a year of hard
work with just a few months away from
shipping the new point will come with a
subscription when it hits retail but we
want to offer you something special
all Kickstarter backers new and old will
get free lifetime service so please
support us and join us on our journey
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
