the design is finished and we are about
to start production now we need help to
bring swanky into your kitchen back us
and don't let it sink
hey guys I'm Joseph and I'm Johannes I'm
a professional cook and I'm a product
designer last year we made the
Frankfurter bread a kitchen workbench
for professionals and for kitchen fries
now we are back we made a product for
everyone let's start from the beginning
the solution is so simple extensible
steel brackets that hold two containers
one for waste and one for food
this is much more than just a cutting
board it's a new way of cooking it's 100
percent
and we added something new and we think
you're gonna like it your cutting board
can now hold your tablets or your
cookbook
so this is our new product and we're so
excited to show it to you today and it
feels great to be back on Kickstarter if
you like what you see support our
crowdfunding share it with your friends
and help us to get this to market
product design is really fun and one of
our favorite things is making tools that
everybody has been asking for
the gear ladle and spoonula are the
product of hundreds of customer requests
we try to approach them as if they were
the very first and very best of their
kind their unified by their versatility
but perhaps their most easily summed up
by their ability to scoop almost
anything in the kitchen the ladle
allowed us to carry over the same
economic considerations found in our
flip spatula series the angular break
off its 45-degree handle is the key to
the ladles incredible performance the
bowl holds three quarters of a cup of
liquid and we've added large measurement
marks in metric and imperial units the
curved edge was designed to provide
something that we call the perfect pour
this might be the most research and
development we've ever done on a single
kitchen tool we took the very best
aspects of all the ladles we could find
and combined them into one and then we
added a few extras
our very favorite thing about this ladle
is the flexible front edge it can bend
into the corner of any bowl or container
allowing it to reach spots that no other
ladle could I think we can say it this
is the perfect ladle let's face it the
spoon yyl is pretty cool too we've taken
a fresh look at spoon EULA's to achieve
a simple and extremely versatile profile
it combines a spatula with the gentle
curved bowl of a spoon the spoon eula is
the most utilitarian of all our kitchen
tools it's often seen but never
perfected until now with the spoon EULA
much like the ladle we took all the best
attributes of the competition and
combine them into one the edge is sharp
for scraping and precise scooping the
goal is extra deep and the blade has the
perfect amount of flexibility the end
result is even better than we were
hoping for it's everything a spoon
dealership the gear ladle and spoon EULA
are without a doubt two of our all-time
favorite tools that can you pick them up
you'll know exactly what we mean when we
say get it right
our journey to make this knife began
with a love of quality food and an
intense passion for cooking we set out
to design something stylish versatile
and durable enough to last a lifetime
from the beginning we wanted to build a
knife that wouldn't wear out so we made
sure to use the strongest most versatile
materials available
we built this knife to stay incredibly
sharp and be comfortable to use day
after day a quality knife is more than
just a piece of metal it's a perfectly
sized blade with a razor-sharp edge and
handle that's as stunning as it is
comfortable
each knife is made by hand with expert
craftsmanship and exacting standards in
forging the blade using time-honored
processes the result a beautiful blade
that will last for decades we all care
deeply about making high quality
products and we think that our passion
really comes through in this knife
creating a new product costs a lot
that's where we need your help we think
we created something truly incredible
with this knife and want to deliver a
product that can make unforgettable
experience as possible high tech starter
we're the team behind rpm West and we
need your help we need to cover our
first production run so that we can
bring this beautiful knife from our door
to yours
