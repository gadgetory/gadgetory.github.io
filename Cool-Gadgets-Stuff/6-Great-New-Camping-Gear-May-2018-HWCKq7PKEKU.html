and resting wherever you put him Dave
will rest out of all the resting
apparatus they've obviously prefers the
hammock but lately he found that a
hammock great as it may be presents many
glitches that can muddle up a good rest
so he teamed up with the good people
from croa to create koala a hammock
designed so you don't ever have to stop
relaxing koala has everything needed for
the most restful of rests a pillow a bug
mesh an option to take out the spreader
bar so you can rest more cocoon-like and
even a tablet holder to hang your tablet
as you watch but that's not all see for
example what happens when Dave wanted to
rest his beer in his old hemp so koala
not only has a pocket for the beer it's
a beer koozie so that the beer stays
nice and cool cool
voila has a different sized pocket
here's a quick list of stuff you can put
in them and inside there are three
water-resistant pockets for Dave's phone
tablet and valuables so much better than
where he kept his phone in his previous
hammocks koala is light and very easy to
carry so there are no second thoughts
about taking a camping
surprisingly when imagining koala
they've also thought about talking to
other people with koalas unique
multi-position system they've can easily
transform koala into a sitting position
now he can talk to his beloved friends
when it rains koalas rain tarp let's
Dave nap away even in the pouring rain
because it's so well designed koala can
double as a bed with the attachable
hammock quilt back Dave can easily slide
into the hammock and pull the quilt over
himself but he lets his loving friends
do it for him and here's Dave under the
quilt theory is turning on koalas LED
lights probably because he wants to read
you know it's another beer if Dave
desires to rest somewhere else the quilt
can also be used as a picnic blanket
koalas crows fourth Kickstarter
campaigns so you can be sure they know
how to create and deliver great camping
gears they made sure every stitch of
koala is perfect and that the fabrics
are the most comfortable possible Dave
you agree he won't even pick up his head
what a champ
so if you two want the most restful of
all hammocks yet koala it's Dave
approved
if you are a seasoned outdoorsman then
you already know that lightweight and
compact equipment is essential to your
time out there especially when it comes
to extended expeditions in the remote
wilderness you pack in only what you
need no more no less
being so far from home you take great
care to choose equipment you can trust
your life with equipment that is
engineered to last and that is easy to
use and maintain you know that
equipments strapped to the outside of
your pack is a bad idea especially when
it comes to a hunting bow we know this
all too well so we decided to design a
60-inch bow like no other that packs
down into a small backpack one that
feels familiar to both a compound and
traditional style Archer allows for a
variety of shooting styles and
accessories and best of all is designed
to withstand the test of time the Atmos

meet the Bandicoot a single chassis quad
optic lightweight fully adjustable USB
rechargeable silicon headlamp headlamps
or head torches are usually fabric
straps buckles and bulky bits the
Bandicoot is designed differently so
there's no more bouncing around fiddling
with yourself blinding yourself blinding
others waking others wearing out and
looking
the advantage of using the silicon in
the Bandicoot is it allows you to merge
the strap with the housing in the one
material and therefore doing so it makes
it more streamlined and less bulky I
guess the truth we feel looking is what
you can do with it
it's more versatile it's more
comfortable it's less obtrusive the
overmolding allows us to house the leads
and battery in one chassis but without
the bulk and oversimplified optics of
traditional headlamps it doesn't tangle
your hair it's not like a rubber band
it's waterproof it's easy to clean and
this makes it ideal for running hiking
climbing fixing hampi be a pongy
searching reading sleeping a power
practical we're all about lighting it up
but we're tired of lighters a blowout in
the wind and run out of fuel introducing
two new ways to light it up spark your
flip and sparker win sparkler flip is
the rechargeable solution for disposable
lighters it's slim teardrop design fits
easily into your pocket or bag
with a simple button push the powerful
electric arcs are revealed and packed a
punch sparker flips secondary bottom
button make sliding up those
hard-to-reach places comfortable and
easy
sparker wick lets you reach even further
designed with an extendable six inch
neck tilted head and cross pattern spark
the wick easily takes on candles
barbecues and more USB rechargeable and
windproof bold sparklers give you the
flexibility to reach further and light
