garden space like you we've all tried
and failed at growing our very own
vegetables at home so we decided to
create garden space a robotic smart
camera that helps you grow fruit at home
food is a huge part of our lives
can we all want it to be fresher and
better tasting and as you've heard from
friends and neighbors the freshest
best-tasting food is that which we grow

growing grapes allowing aspiring and
experienced growers like yourself to

camera that monitors information on
plant health and growth rates so you
know exactly what's happening in your
garden and because it's done by a camera
it can look over the your entire garden
no matter its shape or layer all you
have to do is follow the planting guide
on our mobile application or simply tell
garden space what you planted the second
thing garden space takes care of is
watering garden space knows what you're
growing as well as the weather and using
a thermal sensor the water stress of
your plants so it knows exactly how much
water each plant needs and then
automatically waters them for you no
more worrying about if you're under or
over watering the third thing garden
space does is protect your garden
sensing when uninvited guests sneak into
your garden for a midnight snack
God's faces senses target the pests
to ward them away keeping your plans

family will get to enjoy your homegrown
food garden space arms you with tools to

application is there to guide you from
seed it's a table getting started with
garden space is as simple as one two

connect it to your home Wi-Fi plug in
your standard garden hose and you're
ready to grow plus it's solar power so

double triple or even quadruple your
garden space by growing vertically using
the garden tower too even if you don't
have a yard you can still have a garden
anywhere on a deck patio porch you can
grow delicious vegetables and herbs
beautiful flowers and even scrumptious
sweet fruit the secret to the garden
Tower 2 is the unique system of
stackable interlocking planting trees
each planting tray has nine spaces for
growing all of your favorite plants plus
the open-concept top allows for tons of
additional planting space
running throughout the entire center of
the growing system is a composting
chamber that we fill with soil garden
scraps and compostable kitchen scraps to
turn this into useable compost we use
what every in-ground garden uses garden
worms with the addition of some red
wiggler worms we turn this into a
complete garden ecosystem the worms feed
on all of the scraps breaking it down
into great compost they also help to
aerate the soil creating a nice cushy
environment for plants roots to thrive
any time at your planters watered
weather from rain or your own watering
it'll percolate down through the system
and collect down here creating a compost
tea that's so nutrient rich and then can
be recycled back into the container the
garden tower too is the ultimate grow
anywhere complete garden system hi i'm
joe jones inventor of turtle fifteen
years ago I created Roomba a small user
friendly robot that cleans home floors
all by itself
since rumors amazing success I've been
looking for opportunities for other
practical robots I found a great one in
the garden it's called turtle turtle is
a robot that eliminates weeds is solar
powered chemical free and waterproof
everyday it charges itself in the Sun
and one has enough energy it goes
patrolling for weeds my name is Rory
McKean I'm the CEO of Franklin robotics
turtle uses the height of the plant to
decide if it's good or if it's bad if
it's taller than an inch at the Obsidian
if it's smaller than an inch it cuts it
turtle has two methods of removing weeds
the first is a small nylon string on the
bottom of the robot that spins rapidly
to cut the weeds the second is the
design of the wheels as the robot drives
around the wheel scrub the surface of
the soil damaging pre-emergent weeds
Farrell doesn't need to pull weeds
because it chops them every day even if
a chopped weed sprouts again turtle will
keep chopping it down until it runs out
of store energy and dies there's no
mapping or programming required for
turtle you put the robot in the garden
press go and the robot takes care of the
rest
turtle uses bluetooth to talk to the
user smartphone
an app that accompanies turtle through
the app you can learn about conditions
in your garden and what turtles have
been doing because turtle cuts the weeds
every day the clippings are small so
they fall back onto the ground and
shrivel up returning the nutrients to
the soil to inform turtle that you want
to keep a small plant you put one of the
provided plant collars around the
seedling this lets turtle know that it's
a desired plant once the plant is larger
you can remove the collar if you like
turtle collects some energy even on
cloudy days and it uses this energy very
carefully thus it can keep operating
through extended cloudy periods turtle
is helped by the fact that weeds can't
grow very fast when there's no Sun
turtle can easily cover the typical
garden size in the US which is about a
hundred square feet
given favorable soil conditions or sunny
climates turtle is able to cover more
area than that turtle is round it's
short it has four-wheel drive and
extreme camber wheels those are all
design choices that improve Turtles
mobility in the garden turtle requires a
barrier to keep it from wandering away
from the garden this could be the edge
of a raised bed a chicken wire fence or
some other type of border heavy duty
yard work can really take a toll on your
hands
planting without gloves can be a dirty
job or worse you have gloves but they
don't protect your hands
finally there's garden genie gloves the

without watch this garden genie lets you
easily dig and plant your yard all

raking fast and easy garden genies

electric tiller and cultivator from Sun
Joe get a quick
it's Thursday tradition here at home
biogas that means banana pancakes
a 2015 we launched the first IndieGoGo
campaign showing the world how to turn
this into this
an idea from a backyard appliance
returns organic food scraps into cooking
gas was first of its kind we were so
excited to see all these people from all
over the world enjoying the system the
first campaign enabled us to get home
bogus to the heart of remote communities
they need people who have been cooking
over fire wood
suddenly had clean free energy it was a
huge step in fulfilling our vision the
amazing support inspired us to think
forward what if we could take the humble
gas appliance make it even better and
reduce its overall cost it took us over
a year
home bogus 2.0 is an advanced appliance
that produces green renewable energy
installation is now simpler just fill
the digester with water mount the gas
container using the supplied sandbags
and you're ready to go the 2.0 version
is 50 percent more productive easier to
maintain and super durable we've also
added a home ba gas stove to give you
the perfect solution an average family
produces about two liters of waste a day
why should organic waste go into giant
polluting landfills when it can go back
into nature home ba gas 2.0 can now
produce up to three hours of cooking gas
per day more than enough for an average
family plus a top quality completely
organic fertilizer that goes back into
the soil your own backyard eCos icon
once food waste goes in the bacteria
digests the organic material and
released by gas and fertilizer no
electricity is required it is completely
safe to use order lists and can digest
anything from fruits and veggies to meat
and dairy
more and more people are beginning to
reduce reuse and recycle as a way of
life Nature has given us so much now
it's time to give back
