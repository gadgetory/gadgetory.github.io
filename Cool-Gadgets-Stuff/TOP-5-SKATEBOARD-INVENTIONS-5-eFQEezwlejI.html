Brea skateboards and we make skateboards
from plastic free oceans welcome to our
Kickstarter we're down here in Santiago
Chile working on our fishing net
collection recycling program where we've
made the first skateboard from recycled
fish net waste we love riding our boards
we want to share the joy with you helped
us make this project a reality and
support us on Kickstarter here's our
story
the word barrio comes from the native
Mapuche people of chile and it means
waves we chose it to first recognize the
country that gave us the opportunity to
create this project
through our initiative net positiva
we're able to source a continuous supply
of high-quality highly durable and
highly recyclable material just as a
wave starts with this small disturbance
on the surface of the ocean we're
starting with this small change in an
ocean of plastic and with more time and
energy we can create this great force of
change our idea was to transform plastic
collect on the coastline of Chile into a
positive product and we're excited to
bring you the minnow the first
skateboard created from recycled fish
down along the coast of Chile - meant a
los pescadores no hacen ninguna
Priscilla de Sol materialist no hace muy
poco proportion para que un grande Sofia
parle avec artisanal a porque / materia
poder approaches no contaminate the
nestled s hol man
when we set up our net collection
program net positiva and a few select
communities in Chile the reception we
got from the fishermen where we showed
them that we were converting this burden
into this positive product was
incredibly well-received the challenges
is that these fishermen are dealing with
an incredible amount of fish net waste
with very limited resources and
infrastructure there's a supply chain
that we've set up on the ground in Chile
we're able to transport the Nets
from the remote fishing towns to our
recycling and manufacturing facility
it's under one roof at our Santiago
recycling center that our next undergo a
unique process where they're sorted
shredded and re pelletized to be made
into future minnow skateboards after
months of hard work in a plastics
engineering and research lab in the
United States we've been able to refine
the design and the material to provide
you not only a sustainable board but a
high quality board as well we've
partnered with industry-leading
component suppliers Satori Movement
Paris trucks and busting bearings who
all aligned with our mission to provide
you with the board with an awesome ride
like me design nothing bored because
it's like a fish yeah it's a pretty good
board this is a really special project
for the team inspired by a deep
connection to the ocean where surfers
and general ocean lovers we actually get
to ride our board that we thought of
through this project we get to see the
board go from the cleaning process and
the collection points for the
manufacturing in Santiago we get to put
this board under your feet and have you
ride it something that we're really
proud of
rakesh a the world's first and only rock
and debris deflector for most standard
and penny sized skateboards
skateboarding is something people are
passionate about the euphoria that comes
from skating is limitless
but as high as that could be the crash
can be even greater
specifically when your board hits the
rock and you go flying off all
skateboarders have fought one of the
most lopsided battles known to man the
war of skateboarders versus rocks you
can almost hear the maniacal laughter
coming from rocks after they take down
yet another rider for decades
skateboards have evolved in regards to
the wheels the trucks even the deck
themselves all in an effort to make
skateboarding more enjoyable protective
gear has also come a long way and if you
choose to wear it it can help soften the
blow when you fall parents today are
willing to do almost anything to protect
their children but let's be honest none
of those are viable options we want to
welcome you to the new era of
skateboarding one where skateboarders
have the upper hand
rocks be where as you can see rakesh a
doesn't change the way your board
performs in fact even the most advanced
riders to still perform the majority of
their tricks I really believe it's
useful
for kids just learning for even adults
they just ride cruiser boards a phone on
a skateboard more times than I can count
I mean like mostly because of stop rocks
they just hit your wheels and you go
flying I've been riding over by a car
when I was 15 years old I hit a rock and
I fell in front of a car ran me over
doctor said I wasn't gonna skate again
but you know a couple surgeries and Here
I am I don't notice the ruckus Shay on
my skateboard at all it's very light
yeah the rocker say it's nice you can
still skate with it I was doing street
tricks I was boardslide and landing and
going through rocks kicks the rocks out
the way when you want to go downhill
bombing and stuff then you just go right
through big rocks small rocks anything I
really feel that it's going to save a
lot of a lot of parents from going to
the ER and kids from being injured one
of the challenges we faced was finding a
material that was light enough where
skateboarders wouldn't notice it yet
strong enough with the right amount of
flex to stand up to the harsh conditions
of skateboarding I design rakesh a to
not only deflect rocks and debris but
also rise up over uneven riding surfaces
rakesh a attaches easily to the trucks
of your board so even if you're just
starting out writing it college to be
cruising around campus or more advanced
riders we've got you covered
please tell your friends about Rakesh
and together we can help turn the tide
in the war against Rock and helps
everyone ride free
how could we turn on the radio the first
time I brought out the rover after
finishing the design
I took it to my favorite skate spot I
just made this new board was ready to go
it's just me and newest it was perfect I
felt like I was on top of the world
waiting to drop in 1:21 seaboards is a
lot more than just a skateboard company
it's a prototype to solve an
industry-wide problem like a global
problem of carbon fiber waste disposal
we'd really like to thank those people
that supported us with the first
Kickstarter last summer which allowed us
to go a lot further a lot quicker than
we thought during the production of the
aileron we noticed that we were still
generating a small amount of scrap and
so we decided to put that material to
good use that's when I knew we had it
this was this was the board we were
about to start making
it really began to see that we wanted to
engineer an orb it was totally different
it's a time-consuming process we start
with one iteration go back change it
again we wanted to make it sleek and
stark kind of had it looking like a
missile it's got those sharp angular
features that make you think of an
aggressive aircraft but there's a lot of
purpose behind that engineering we knew
we had to put a hole in the board
because we wanted people to be able to
lock it up we wanted to have a shape
that relayed and conveyed its origin as
an aerospace product we ended up
sweeping that whole back and giving it a
slight curve on one side and a hard
angle on the other turning into more of
an aerodynamic shape it all starts with
processing we get the shipments of
scraps of material and we cut it to
length and width then kit it load it
into the press and then take it out to
the water jet cutter
each board that we make it's water jet
cut to incredible tolerance within five
thousandths of an inch an eighty
thousand psi stream water comes blast
the material out of the way what you're
left with is
cool skateboard
with water jerk reading to the President
to the tracks
in every aspect of the book to give you
we really focused on stability
really stablest small board on
the carbon fiber composites you kid
allowed us to make the board smaller we
have a new tighter wheel that gives you
that great handle feels very member on
what this board represents the passion
and innovation of 120 once it's light
and smooth it's unlike any other board
it's far higher quality material than
you can get get any consumer product
when we finally finish our board
it's like emerging from a cave felt like
I was on top of the world and then I
dropped it on
hello Kickstarter my name is Desmond and
I'm here to talk about baby does wills
limbs for skateboards the idea came to
me a few years ago when I went to bed
one night and had a dream me
skateboarding was all my dream I used to
refresh a magazine and in my dreams one
night I seen
from then on I had my share of ups and
downs we're trying to make a dream
reality I stay focused like when you pop
a trick my fall off hit the ground then
you try and try to stick it never give
up cuz the only time you truly fail is
with in an escape or culture who you are
define on how much determination
practice and hard you put forth making
your destiny a reality baby doves skate
skate and after that I continue to go to
manufacturers and see if I can try to
get this made so after a lot of time
trial and error I was able to finally
come up with a product that works very
strong durable we got pink limbs
we got Chrome
we got gold rims we got matte black kind
of like Batman style rims
we love skateboarding it is such an
integral part of many of our daily lives
the skateboards get us to school work
and most importantly play
boards and writing styles take many
forms with even more unique writers but
we are connected by the joy of the sport
no matter who you are or what you're
writing
we found that where your boards journey
began and ended each day is where we
started by a problem there was no
suitable product to facilitate this need
that's why the dock from board home was
created it's a simple multi-purpose
board storage and display rack our
boards are often a second thought after
writing which means they could easily
end up misplaced damaged or just
inconvenient for us or others around us
we decided to solve that problem our
easy-to-use rack was designed for a
quick grab and write function we also
included in the dock an accessory tray
which means you will no longer use all
your extras with the dock your boards
will always be where you know they
should store it up out of the way and
convenient we realize that every person
has different writing needs whether
you're single with a couple boards or a
growing family the dock is able to
support you in any circumstance it has a
unique modular design that is made up of
interchangeable board slot sections
giving you the ability to grill not only
your skateboard collection but be able
to know where that collection is Landing
before and after use with this feature
simply slide additional sections as
needed and attach back to wall the dock
is made up of strong molded plastic
designed to be able to take the beatings
for boards conditionality all this while
being extremely lightweight and
affordable
