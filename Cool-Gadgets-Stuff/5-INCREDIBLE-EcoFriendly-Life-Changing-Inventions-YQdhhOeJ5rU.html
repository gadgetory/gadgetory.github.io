intact forest nature as it should be
but sadly reality looks different
deforestation and ever-growing mountains
of garbage the main cause the way we
package things we decided to try and
change this
after years of designing prototyping and
testing we succeed
we invented an amazing new method to
make tableware out of leaves and leaves
only no chemicals no plastic not a
single tree is cut down our products are
as renewable and biodegradable as a leaf
falling from a tree and the next time
you eat outdoors your plate will be as
natural and greenness everything around
you when you hold one of our plates in
your hand you will be surprised feel the
intricate texture the fresh leaf
we'd love to fully automate and scale a
production process and get this
beautiful product into everyone's hands
together we can create the greener world
you
we know what you're thinking you hear
the music see these amazing places on
earth and you think we're going to talk
about another big idea that might or
might not happen to save the planet well
no we are here to share with you
something practical that we have
actually built to bring what people say
for years is the future - right now food
waste and declining energy sources are
major environmental hazards biogas is
the solution it's a natural process in
which organic waste is converted into
cooking gas so five years ago we went on
a mission to bring biogas to every home
we group the best engineers scientists
designers and product people together
and now it's here
home biogas home biogas is the first
family-sized user friendly affordable
biogas system it is the change and you
can put it in your backyard home biogas
comes in an easy-to-assemble kit and its
uses as simple as can be just throw in
your organic waste and there you go a
hot stove ready for cooking a cycle of
in-house energy and it runs with no
electricity your leftovers provide you 2
to 3 hours of energy of day any kitchen
leftovers including meat and dairy work
even your pets litter just toss it all
inside home biogas and the bacteria in
the digester will decompose the organic
material and release biogas
as a byproduct of the digestion home
biogas even generates an incredible
plant fertilizer it's the kind you pay a
large sum for in garden stores in this
manner home biogas creates an eco cycle
waste turns into gas and fertilizer
fertilizer is used to grow food and gas
to cook it leftovers are more waste we
are way past the prototype fix we've
already installed more than 150 units
that have been running for over a year
until now we've worked with
international organizations in
underserved communities now we're
bringing it to you you are in charge of
creating your own clean renewable energy
energy that you can trust we need your
help to make home biogas and accessible
household item so if you want to bring
the change get home biogas let's create
a better future for our next generations
I ordered for at least sambar and the
spool is put in it so as he was putting
the spoon I grabbed it from his hand I
run my thumb on it it was greasy
I took us me a sniff of it it was
already smelling of someone but it's
been reused
we know plastic has got so many chemical
complexes in it
phthalates chill aids bisphenol this
cause cancer
these leach into food they don't
biodegrade but still we using whole lot
of plastic disposable cutlery why are we
doing this answer obviously is there is
no alternative oh well we have an
alternator now we come up with an
alternative and that is edible cutlery
here there is no coating in fact it is
entirely delicious you can eat up the
spoon delicious it is made of dough are
blended with rice and wheat without
preservatives just like dehydrated
vegetables our product also has a very
long shelf life or more than three years
in fact you can even have a hot soup
also you can stir your sugar and have
your tea you can eat it up you don't
want to eat it you can just throw it it
decomposes within four to five days
which does never fail ever take it to
likely some Gmail Margaret AMA start ok
come to rukia bar is ahmed al ki upon
kaya both tasty later madam
applicable Carnac atomic Guevara me
sooner up with Samba with you a burger
spoon folk art angry though spoon cup
flavor I dropped his Madeira adjoin rock
salt black pepper malate or is Quebec
cafe table tops Moon Cafe de ser una
cara upper jaw root Academy when it
comes to financing this I had to put the
only assent that I have which is a flat
weight I am reciting as a collateral
security and then got the loan because
there's no such technology we are the
first in the world the technology had to
be created
I brought in this edible cutlery and
trying to promote a market for millets
and motivate farmers to move away from
rice plastic is very cheap true but I
can make it as cheap I can with volumes
and once when I get the volumes I get on
to the farmers directly and start
procuring raw materials directly from
the farmers in which case my spoons will
be asked if as a past exposed
so now the cutlery is tasty fun
nutritious and environment-friendly
that's edible cutlery we have a new
product called the Twilight that we want
to introduce to you right now
so this is the Twilight and it's the new
baby version of the solar pop there's a
red a red SOS signal a low setting I
said if you holding for three seconds it
will turn off at any point it's the best
limit solar light on the planet Wow
here's the Merlin series we have the
Merlin solar puff and we have the Merlin
helix both have six different colors of
LEDs one regular light bulb used every
day by everyone in the United States
causes the 11 billion pounds of carbon
emissions what if we started to use our
own clean solar light through my
research I realized that there are 1.6
billion people in the world without
access to electricity and they are
relying on kerosene lanterns to light
their world at night it's a fossil fuel
it's toxic and I thought to myself just
imagine if all those people stopped
using kerosene and started to use a
solar Lantern their lighting would be
free as well as healthy for their
children
through the help of allison thompson of
third wave volunteers we've impacted
over a hundred thousand people by
distributing our lights we want you to
know we hand deliver these lights with
volunteers all over the world from the
high mountains of Nepal or through Haiti
to the last year with the Syrian
refugees and the kids are able to sleep
better at night in their tents with it
and also it doesn't attract the
mosquitoes and you know what it makes
you look 10 years younger
here's your chance to get so light
designs most innovative new products
the compact Twilight or the Merlin
series for your very own and if you
choose you can order one of these
life-saving lights for a family in need
you
