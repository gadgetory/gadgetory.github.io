small-time gear designer and inventor
best known for the EM Berlin stove but
today I want to introduce you to the
world's first production emergency super
shelter warm all over
it is it's like if you can imagine what
a rotisserie chicken would feel like
that's basically what you're doing is
sitting in a like a solar oven almost
okay we're at 75 right now and it's
still climbing
we're almost at 80 degrees
there are five heat loss mechanisms that
you have to watch out for in a cold
environment
number one is conduction that simply
means touching something colder than you
are if you sit on a cold bench
you're gonna lose heat through your butt
to that bench it's the way it works
number two is convection convection is
wind you all heard of wind chill so you
know just how effective the wind could
be at accelerating your heat loss
number three is radiation a lot of
people don't realize it but we are
actually constantly radiating long wave
thermal radiation out into our
environment up into space
next we have respiration when I take a
deep breath of that cold mountain air
it's refreshing but as I exhale I'm
exhaling warm moist air from my lungs
and that's heat coming out of my body
finally we have evaporation if you're
wet from sweating or you've been in the
rain or the snow or you've fallen in the
creek the water evaporating from your
skin greatly accelerates your heat loss
there are a lot of inexpensive actually
kind of cheap tube tents and mylar
blankets that are available on the
market they do an okay job at insulating
you against those five heat loss
mechanisms they get you out of the wind
in the rain
they help reflect a lot of your body
heat back at you but honestly one of the
little secrets that is pretty well known
in the bushcraft and survival community
is you can do just about the same job
with a garbage bag well all these
different shelters including the garbage
bag
they all have the same limitation and
that limitation is they don't actually
help you produce heat all they do is try
to stem the loss of heat from your body
and so if you are sick if you're injured
if you're already wet or malnourished or
tired there's a good chance that your
body might not be able to produce enough
heat to take advantage of one of those
shelters anyways at the very least
you're gonna be miserable and
uncomfortable shivering all night long
so how does a super shelter work well it
does the same job that all those other
shelters do it takes you out of the wind
and out of the rain and snow it reflects
a lot of your body heat but it does
something that they don't in that it can
be heated from the outside with a small
campfire you ever notice how when you're
next to a campfire or a wood stove that
it feels like it warms your bones it's
because it kind of does that fire is
giving off thermal radiation like a big
spotlight and it actually penetrates
your tissue and starts to warm you from
the inside and so what the super shelter
does is acts like a greenhouse by
collecting that radiation by collecting
that warm energy coming off a fire and
it traps it inside there with you
so that it can warm you as well this is
where the genius of the super shelter
comes into play and I wish it was my
genius but it's not all credit goes to a
gentleman named Morris Cohan Ski mores
is a highly respected and knowledgeable
wilderness living skills and survival
instructor he came up with the concept
for the super shelter in the 19's I
believe it was inspired by his
observations of how igloos function and
it is still today regularly improvised
and built in the field by bushcraft and
survival nerds alike by utilizing this
method with a little bit of space-age
materials and put it into a tiny package
that you can throw in the back of your
snowmobile in the back of your pack or
your day pack you could be in your
t-shirt and a pair of shorts even when
it's below freezing outside as long as
you know how to tend a small fire and
you have of course a super shelter so
here I am once again Kickstarter coming
to you with my idea asking you to help
me make it a reality I've teamed up with
an incredible company called heat sheets
they are the premier manufacturers of
thermal reflective materials here in the
United State
they're NASA to prove their us
government-approved their space approved
they got all sorts of approvals I don't
even know they are the people to go to
for making this type of material and I'm
really honored that they're working with
me to make the shelter
you
we carry gear that we trust because we
think adventure should be enjoyed until
the very last bite
meals are an essential part of being in
the outdoors and to us the sports on the
market have never quite measured it so
we decided to create one that does
introducing morsel a versatile utensil
for cooking eating and clearing a tool
designed to rethink the way we eat on
the go
morsel has a unique rubber edge that
allows you to easily scrape every last
bit of food the ergonomic asymmetrical
shape its plates pops bags and bolts all
shapes and sizes the extended length is
perfect for digging deep without getting
your hands dirty more so also features a
full sized fork and a safe cutting edge
for slicing through tough foods
we've spent last year designing
prototyping and testing
the result is the best camping utensil
we've ever used
if you've been hungry for a better
utensil your search is over</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
