totally predictable down to the
cost-savings
nothing similar to what you've seen from
us before in fact it's impossible to try
this is Vera an autonomous vehicle Vera
is part of a larger system and has the
potential to optimize transports in
highly repetitive short distance
transport flows with large volumes of
goods such as ports factory areas and
logistic mega centers offering better
delivery precision and flexibility
the autonomous electric vehicles operate
together in a network and are connected
through a cloud-based service and
management center we want to make it
easier for clients and partners to run
their business we are now presenting a
highly effective system for moving Goods
24/7 as a complement to what's available
today
the pace of society and increasing
global trade is placing high demands on
efficient and sustainable transport
solutions ecommerce is growing fast and
we have a widespread shortage of truck
drivers autonomous electric and safer
vehicles have a great role to play
our autonomous solutions open up for new
possibilities it's exciting to know that
the full potential of the transport
industry is yet to be seen
you
hi my name is Spencer Taylor co-founder
of fennec in the summer we're not
working we like to be outside whether
it's camping glamping climbing
fishing road trip hunt
being haunted any time you're out there
keeping food fresh can be tough the
cooler as most people's go-to solution
but once the ice melts it's pretty much
useless and direct exposure to water or
frost can reduce the shelf life and
flavor of fruits and vegetables looking
beyond the cooler your options are
pretty limited you can set up a fridge
at your campsite but they're heavy
expensive and are going to require you
to carry in a constant supply of fuel or
plug it in or with a freeze-dried food
wrap which let's be honest just isn't as
tasty and fennec we've been working for
the last four years to develop a
lightweight low-cost food preservation
system that never needs electricity or
ice
we call it the Yuma 60 L it weighs less
than 5 pounds packs flat and is easy to
take anywhere can be assembled in under
30 seconds and is powered exclusively by
water or river water and in hot and dry
conditions can preserve food of the five
days without needing a refill the secret
is patent-pending smart fabric
technology and our team is inspired by
humanity's first schooling system honed
over ten million years of evolution
sweating we've developed a smart
material which mimics the properties of
human skin called the face deck the
flexible walls are made of a sandwich of
food safe plastic on the inside and face
tack on the outside water is stored in
between the two and as water absorbs
heat from the food it becomes vapor this
vapor passes through the specialized
pores in the face deck taking heat and
energy with it in hot and dry conditions
the interior can be up to 35 degrees
Fahrenheit or 20 degrees Celsius colder
inside than the ambient air temperature
around it this cooler temperature
greatly extends the shelf life of
perishable food Tomatoes kept inside can
last up to five times longer than those
left out in the open it's ideal for
fruits and vegetables that are best kept
in a stable room-temperature you can use
it on extended trips living off-grid
trying to reduce your carbon footprint
or you just need a place to store some
extra perishable food it has straps for
easy carrying and can be stacked to save
space everything from the truck to an
extra room can be turned in and
temperature stable storage you fennec
was founded with the social mission at
our core around 20% of the world does
not have access to our frigerator this
means that more than half of the fruits
and vegetables grow in sub-saharan
Africa spoil before anyone can eat them
not only does this reduce 3.3 billion
tons of carbon in the atmosphere every
year but it dramatically impacts the
incomes and habits of the rural families
we've had versions in the field in North
Africa for more than three years these
studies have allowed us to refine an
iterator design in that time our users
have saved up to ten percent of their
income as a result of less trips of the
market and less wasted food global food
spoilage affects everything and a fennec
needs our help to find it we want to
make this product available to some of
the most vulnerable populations on earth
new people making as little as five
hundred dollars a year by buying one
you're enabling us to distribute it to
these markets at a reduced cost
for decades our ideas have been bound by
the borders of the whiteboard locked
inside an office only to be erased and
lost forever
well the dark ages of whiteboards are
over introducing the think board X
powered by rocket book for the past four
years we've been converting surfaces of
all shapes and sizes into a creative
writing surface but why stop there
this time we're reaching for the stars
to create the next great thing we sent
our team to visit rocket book labs to
blend think board with rocket book
technology we took the awesome and think
board and added the magic of rocket book
technology together we've combined the
ease of a peel-and-stick whiteboard with
the simplicity of the rocket book app
creating the think board X a
peel-and-stick whiteboard built for the
digital age designed with the same
special coatings and adhesives found in
our premium films the think board X will
peel stick write and erase with the
quality you'd expect from a premium
grade whiteboard the think board X is
also powered by the rocket book app so
before you wipe your ideas off the board
you can blast them off online to your
favorite cloud services in a fraction of
a second rocket book machine vision
scans and enhances your notes and to-do
lists inside the rocket book app there
are seven configurable destinations set
up the app to assign each destination to
a location within Dropbox Google Drive
Evernote or many other services your
notes will be more organized than ever
before to save you time add a double
hashtag to a written title to activate
smart titles smart titles uses optical
character recognition to automatically
transcribe your written title for better
organization the think board X comes in
two convenient sizes large and small so
you can share your notes from that group
project and drop them directly into a
shared folder
or snap a picture of your desk share
with your team and continue right where
you left off
whether you're organizing your day or
blasting notes far away unleash your
creativity with the power of the cloud
the think board X powered by rocket
phone what do you see when you go into
your office no plants ugly plants dead
plants and what are you breathing Bob's
Burgers microwave fish recycle they're
from employees that don't even work
there anymore
meet Reed we have combined natural air
purification with beautiful and precise
engineering to create this
first-of-its-kind product packed into
this tiny gear is the air cleaning power
of almost two hundred plants breathe
works by actively pushing air through a
filtration system rather than passively
cleaning the air as plants normally do
on their own the plants use the bacteria
and gases that are being circulated
through a/c systems all day as a food
source then the new clean air is
delivered back into the room and to you
but breathe doesn't stop at cleaning
your air it's pretty with multiple color
options and different healthy plants to
choose from you'll be the envy of
everyone in the office did we mention
it's easy seriously these plants are
hard to kill you have to add water every
10 days think you'll forget we don't our
app will let you know when your unit
needs water and the indicator on the
side of breathe will also let you know
you can also set a timer to clean the
air when you're in the office and turn
it off when you're not and if you're
pulling that all-nighter breathe will
run 24 hours a day you'll always know
how much air has been cleaned and if you
ever tire of your plants you can go
online and order a new combination home
or office in whatever room you need
clean air breathe is there for you
we breathe 12 times per minute 720 times
per hour 17,000 times per day six point
three million times per year isn't it
time we brought a little of the outside
Alexa turn on the light okay
