life
502 a.m. I wake up to get ready for work
tailored shirt timeless classic hmm
coffee a gift for my lover Visa 360
smart dash cam beautiful design
intelligent features a refined
innovation for car security 613 a.m. I
head out to install my visa 360 the
specially designed mount supports all
types of cars and the strong magnetic
attachment makes it effortless to
install my new life with visa begins no
no no it was clearly this idiots fault
and I can prove it V Zoe's 360 camera
system captures all around my car
without any blind spots using the
dedicated app I can wirelessly transfer
videos to my phone and the 4k HD video
shows everything in crystal-clear detail
it's an open-and-shut case
126 p.m. I believe in working hard in
order to someone just hit my parked car
and she just drove away
classic hit and run but visa
automatically detects accidents even
when my car is off and the low-power
sensors do not drain the car's battery
with its 4G capability
I'm notified immediately by receiving a
video clip to my phone I've got all the
proof I need for an insurance claim 621
p.m. it's been a long day and I feel
quite sleepy thankfully Pizzo sleep
detection feature uses facial
recognition to alert a drowsy driver
that was close diesel you saved my life
11:16 p.m. i'm finally back home as a
crime deterrent visas bright LED light
remains on at all times
this lets others know that visa was
watching looks like i'm in safe hands
946 a.m. I go on a road trip with my
best friends
why don't I capture this spontaneous
moment with just a single press of a
button I can take a selfie in the car as
well as the outside landscape all in one
seamless 360 image or video with the
dedicated internal battery I can even
take V zone outside to use it just like
a regular 360 camera an unforgettable
memory captured in a gorgeous 360 degree
image and I can quickly share my photos
and videos to social media directly from
the visa app my life is now fully
protected all thanks to my visa 360

introducing mouths n mouths n is an
innovative armrest
designed to optimize the position of
your wrists and reduce pain while
working with your mouse and keyboard
mouths n takes six seconds to install
and it's so beautiful you'll never want
to take it off with its a golem
mechanism mouths n allows you to move
freely and comfortably supporting your
arm in a natural state and forcing you
to maintain an upright posture
did you know that an average user makes
up to 7,000 mouse clicks every day but
not all repetitions are good maintaining
your wrist in an unnatural position can
be associated with repetitive strain
injuries tendonitis and potential risk
of the carpal tunnel syndrome
we've designed a concept that keeps your
arm in a natural position to relieve
wrist tension and shoulder pain Mouzone
is a result of more than 1,000 hours of
development and countless reiterations
given birth to a groundbreaking Peugeot
flow mechanism that supports your arm
and allows it to move freely in all
directions
dear Kickstarter community with a
working prototype mouths n is now ready
to hit the production line pledged to
our project today build a more ergonomic
workstation and create a healthier and
more productive future for yourself or
your employees
ergonomics designed mousing
I've always had a sincere appreciation
for the ocean so an insulated water
bottles emerge to the market I was
honestly stoked it was a small way to
give back and protect the thing that
practically raised me however after a
few months of using my water bottle I
began to notice this odor no matter how
many times I washed it I couldn't get
rid of this smell and being somewhat of
a germaphobe I wanted to know why so I
teamed up with some scientists and
engineers of my University and I
discovered that the average water bottle
has more growing bacterial colonies than
your average dog toy all of this led me
to develop a Lulla Lulla is an insulated
water bottle that uses digital UVC light
to kill 99% of bacteria in your water
and in your bottle so this means no more
nasty after smell and great tasting
water no matter where you are our UVC
light rests in the bottom portion of the
bottle so by always being in contact
with your water the UVC light is able to
kill bacteria more effectively so you
can always be confident that your water
and bottle are being kept clean using
the luma bottle is easy you just fill it
up and press the button and in 60
seconds you will have a clean bottle and
fresh water plus luma bottles battery is
rechargeable and lasts up to two months
on a single charge with functioning
prototypes and manufacture
to go we need funding to put this bottle
into production so we can distribute it
to you help us make luma bottle reality
so that we can make clean water
available to everyone while continuing
to protect the earth
this is okay we'll give him a second all
right you ready all right this is Jamie
and like most people he starts his day
off with the shower
Jamie showers have been pretty special
lately and that all has to do with this
guy the origin sponge the organ
the origin sponge is a hundred-percent
natural antimicrobial and infused with
bamboo charcoal there's not a single
pinch of plastic in its creation making
bacteria and other nasty musty smells in
your sponge a thing of the past
the eking of past it wasn't always like
this for Jamie Jamie used to shower with
the most widely used sponge in the
market today
the popular a loofah path not only do we
flip off sin other sponges made from
plastic take over a hundred years to
fully decompose they don't absorb water
or harsh on the skin on a wild
playground for smells and bacterial
growth
Jamie was pretty much sudsing up with
the glorified plastic bag but we'll
leave the past in the past made from
konjac plant root the origin sponge is a
hundred percent natural and fully
biodegradable because our sponges
infused with bamboo charcoal it's
antimicrobial helping prevent the growth
of bacteria and those nasty musty odors
from developing at all its unique design
helps move water from across its surface
while gently exfoliating all skin types
helping remove dry dead skin it's
ergonomic design feels natural in your
hands and all up on your body so we
invite you to try it out for yourself
feel the difference of what could very
well be the only sponge you'll want to
rub your body with again the origin
sponge by origin design company
imagine riding a bicycle while standing
up in a more natural and relaxed upright
position now imagine controlling it not
only with your hands and hand along with
your whole body bridging the gap between
man and machine and dance now relaxed
free your mind forget everything you
know about bikes and prepare for a
completely new experience this is our
sweet escape from the hectic everyday
life our reverse button back to basics
back to nature back to our true selves
