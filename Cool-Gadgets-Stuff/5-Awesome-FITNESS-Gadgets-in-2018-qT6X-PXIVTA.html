training it's a cutting-edge Fitness
technology that's scientifically
validated to put you in the best shape
of your life time under tension training
involves rapidly doing sets that stress
the body fast moving from set to set
exercise to exercise rapidly puts the
body in a state that burns calories the
key however is that you must increase
tension and resistance through the range
of motion with a free weight that tail
ends of movements are often wasted as
once the weight hits a center of gravity
it is falling into you with time under
tension technology the increased
resistance of the band makes it tougher
to complete the motion exerting more
stress at the end weights don't get
heavier as you move tensioning to us
men's fitness says this about touch by
putting a muscle under longer bouts of
strain you can cause extensive muscle

even easily attaches to a wall stud
comes apart in seconds for travel hey
what's up everybody
my name is Austin Dunham so over the
years I've been teaching and inspiring
many people with my youtube channel and
in that time I've realized that most of
us know how effective resistance
training is when it comes to making our
body stronger but we often forget that
our body weight can be one of the
greatest sources of resistance if we
have the right tools a few of those
right tools for me have been paralyzed
and dip bars but what's been available
to us so far has been weak limited and
primitive time for perilous and dip bars
to evolve and give you more and that
evolution is my new products double dip
bar by 80 workout
the adepts are more than just my baby
they are a major evolution of some of
the most useful tools and calisthenics
push-up bars parallettes and dip bars
you see Cal aesthetics has always been
my favorite way to workout so workout
style that focuses on building strength
and muscle through Jess your body weight
which means you don't need a lot of
equipment to keep aggressing but when
it's time to advance your Cal Tech's
ability beyond just puts us on the floor
you need the best equipment equipment
such as parallettes
and dip bars have helped me master
seemingly impossible bodyweight
exercises but as I progress at my
calisthenics strength I also know those
parallels more versatile they can help
me and you achieve more that led me to
some questions what if there was just
one pair let that can help us improve
push-ups what if those same parallettes
can help us do more dips
what is just one piece of equipment
could help us do the exercises we needed
to go from I Cal satis rookie to a
callous abuse Pro I asked myself these
questions over a year ago and today
those questions have been answered and
the product I want to give to you dobe
dips by 80 workout a product with a
design that not only makes it look good
but also gives you balance where you
need it and more variety to keep you
going there are many features that
you'll like about double dips the
strength the variable size the
portability never again will you be
limited base from a height of a pellet
or a dip bar because with double dips
you're getting the best of both
in today's fast pace we live in it's
hard to find the right time and balance
to work out so when we do how do we know
we're taking our workouts to the next
level the answer the pushup machine with
the push-up machine you maximize your
time by achieving muscle activation like
no other equipment on the market so the
question then becomes how our team of
engineers and product designers
successfully created the strongest
smoothest and most robust pushup machine
on the market today the push-up machine
delivers muscle activation that combines
force movement and gravity it aligns
your body in the perfect position to
maximize proper muscle recruitment for a
no cheat pushup what separates the
push-up machine from any other exercise
product on the market today is our
patented technology that allows you to
choose between 0 5 and 10 percent grades
at 0% you'll feel the muscle activation
in the chest core shoulders and triceps
at 5 percent you'll get the same muscle
activation and it will be more
challenging and at 10 percent
it's the highest level of muscle
activation and intensely challenging
my name is Graham Wilkerson I am the
owner here at Genesis sports performance
I'm a sports performance coach and
strength conditioning specialist I'm
always doing a lot of body weight
pressing exercises and you know in order
for me to get a great chest workout with
just push-ups I may have to do up to you
know a couple hundred with the push-up
machine I could literally do a hundred
push-ups within 20 minutes you may be
even less and my chest is fried and I
had a great workout life is hectic
finding time to stay fit shouldn't be
imagine if you could get stronger and
burn more calories during your daily
routine anywhere anytime now if you can
and it's as simple as putting on pants
introducing the ago G 2.0 resistance
training pants wearable fitness designed
to turn your normal daily activities
into a workout millions of people use
resistance bands every day to strengthen
muscles burn fat and rehabilitate
tendons and joints with eight resistance
bands inside each pair ago G adds
constant tension to every movement you
make quickly warming up your muscles and
challenging your new
use the drawstring to anchor the
resistance at your hips and then slip
the Agoge stirrups under your heels to
stretch out the bands and activate the
resistance we know everyone moves in
different ways so we designed a goji
pants to come in different levels of
resistance use the light resistance to
train for your next 5 km or use the
heavy resistance to turn even the most
mundane movements into a workout a goji
allows you to maintain your full range
of motion without any restrictions of
movement the more you move the more the
pants work simply wear wash and wear
again improve your fitness it's as
simple as putting on pants hi I'm Erin
modern founder and CEO of a goji whether
you are just getting started on your
fitness journey an elite athlete looking
to get an edge or somewhere in between a
goji can help you reach your goals just
anticipate all the excess we've spent 18
months working with the best athletes
the best programs around the country
including all the pro athletes the
Olympians and college programs we've
seen in a shorter period of time to
athletes reaching the results or
whatever that is you use it for whatever
you want it was an intense feeling my
muscles felt activated the blood of my
body was flowing
and it's just something
unexplainable we spent all that time
researching and testing and we want to
take that technology and give it to the
everyday individual
the setup and storage for Pocket monkey
is faster and easier than ever before we
upgraded the design to a hyper
functional system that fits seamlessly
into your life the simple and smooth kit
functionality allows you to set up and
store pocket monkey in seconds we
upgraded the system to a stronger and
more robust doorstop pocket monkey is 40
percent smaller than monkey bars - and
weighs less than 1 pound so it's even
easier to take anywhere we wanted pocket
monkey to look as good as the workouts
we've been working side by side with our
manufacturer to improve the finishes and
make a more aesthetic design there are
now finished edges smooth corners and a
more durable construction this was all
done without sacrificing any quality the
foot straps are such a powerful and
integral part of monkey training we had
to make them better our foot straps now
have a stronger thicker more comfortable
material and requires zero set-up time
they are built directly into the system
back by popular demand the lower
triangle returns to our system this
feature provides more comfort and helps
to balance the bars during workouts
to keep your workouts flowing the new
single point adjustment system makes
changing the height of your bars as easy
as the push of a button we eliminated
every feature part or function that was
unnecessary or slowed you down pocket
monkey makes your workouts fun and easy
anytime anywhere</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
