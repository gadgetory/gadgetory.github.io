inventor of the spoon desk okay here's
your life if you don't have a spoon rest
then your counter gets dirty if you do
have a spoon rest then your spoon rest
gets dirty if you have the spoon best
then nothing gets dirty how cool is that
traditional spoon rest get dirty the
moment you use them the spoon best stays
clean
you could buy elevated tongs or you can
use the spoon best on regular tongs and
the spoon best will be there for you in
case there are any drips do you really
want to go out and buy a whole new set
of kitchen utensils just because you
like the elevate idea why not just get
one thing the spoon best that does it
all the spoon rest was made for spoons
but what about other cooking utensils
like tongs the spoon rack doesn't work
with tongs the spoon best works great
with tongs all you have to do is close
them put them down and let go and then
pick them up whenever you're ready to go
again
so no more fiddling around with that
locking mechanism it's this easy we're
raising money on Kickstarter right now
to be able to place our first order with
the world-class manufacturer I hope that
you're able to back this project either
for yourself or for a friend that likes
to cook it would make a great gift and
really it's time the world needs a
better spoon you have tried the spoon
rest now try the spoon best
thanks all for your support let me tell
you a secret
this pizza wasn't made in a wood-fired
brick oven it wasn't made in an oven at
all I made it in my kitchen stove in
just three minutes
Pizza is the original fast food and I
really love to share it with my friends
but making pizza at home is very time
consuming and the results are never the
same as in my favorite pizza place
nothing kills to move faster than hungry
guests so why are we still making pizza
at home in ovens which takes forever to
preheat that's not fast food and the
party will be over before you even make
one good pie when I went on a mission to
make the best possible pizza in the
shortest amount of time
I earn ate was born I earn eight is
designed to skip and up and all together
so you can make your feet so straight on
your kitchen stove or range in under 10
minutes ironing can heat up to 800
degrees Fahrenheit just like commercial
pizza ovens no more waiting 30 plus
minutes for your oven to preheat heating
up your apartment and wasting all that
energy
the cover is designed to quickly soak up
the energy from your stove and radiate
intense heat into the crust and toppings
to ensure evenly cooked pizza in just
three minutes the bottom end of iron
eight is made out of special steel that
can hold as much energy as four Govan
and it conducts heat way better so you
get those perfect chart spots on the
bottom of your pizza
you can turn even a frozen supermarket
pizza into a star of your party with
iron 8 iron 8 is handmade in Europe it's
made out of heavy-duty steel which
prevents wrapping and is virtually
indestructible its all-natural coated
only with vegetable oil to prevent it
from rusting and provides a nonstick
surface it's made to last a lifetime
we tested iron eight with all common
heat sources it works great on electric
glass induction or gas stoves you can
even use it on your grill or campfire
have you ever made a gourmet pizza while
camping now you can and it's not
intended just for pizza either high
carbon steel is superior to stainless
steel aluminum or even cast iron it can
hold more energy and radiates more heat
so that sous vide steak will get a
perfectly seared finish the cover can be
used as a baking steel for those rare
occasions you'll still want to make your
pizza in an oven providing a scorching
hot surface that emulates a wood-fired
brick oven
you
for those who are trying hard
the patience of a saint
who doesn't stop to blow on hot soup
before and suffers because of it who
thinks waiting is the hardest challenge
in cooking
and eating
for those who break the rules and
fridges
for all of you we invented cooler Pro
hello my name is Julie and I'm almost
one of those four just can't race I will
start my life in a minute
this is the time i did for the scott
parker cream soup to be cooled off by
the means of the cooler crop cooler Pro
will cool off any hot dish or beverage
in a minute without any harm or any side
effect for the food I'm so proud to
bring the device to market that will
change the revered chamomile we have
been working on this product for almost
a year and receive great demand for our
engineers designed a special system that
guarantees the fastest cooling off
process you can regulate the height of
the dish where to maximize the cooler
effect a non-contact temperature sensor
will measure the temperature of the dish
and show it on the display cooler Pro is
fast simple efficient and beautiful it's
small and fits any kitchen perfectly I
wanted this device in my kitchen since I
was a child waiting for my favorite pies
full of this 15 minutes for as long as
an hour now school abroad takes on the
two minutes to complete the clock but it
just came off the door with cooler Pro
you'll be able to eat your favorite
foods so much faster and spend the
waiting time enjoying all those things
you had to put off
every greater Dale his story
I'm an architect my story began with my
grandfather
he was a blacksmith nature was his
primary obsession and inspiration the
after national self antigens father's
feeling being one with nature in his
daily routine of work as I felt back and
on the nights when my grandfather
crafted the blades for his kitchen
knives I began to create a handle to
match one that isn't like the many of
this Mitchellville fairies but is made
from wood what began as a sketch turned
into a passion because sometimes
innovations require perfect conditions
and timing
I found much your passion and design to
finally I created a complete knife and
cause skit skit combines the tradition
and the modern schizos environmentally
sound stylistically pure and elegant
depth it for the needs and challenges of
modern uses grip forms and adjusts to
the hands economically the wood is
hardened and tempered but isn't inferior
to the natural wood surface high carbon
content coupled with exceptional
alloying of the blade sharp and
long-lasting body of the handle is more
hygienic than typical synthetic handles
makes a tannic acid produced by hard
wood which has antibacterial properties
my grandfather taught me that all
organic raw materials were a gift no
matter how far society progresses
creating skid took me back into the past
but also a giant step towards the future
