we can measure a lot with breath
specifically we can measure the amount
of carbon dioxide you breathe out and
the amount of oxygen you breathe in if
we take a ratio of those two numbers we
get what's called our ER and our er can
give us basically how much carbohydrates
versus fat you're burning you can see
when we run a test in the lab persons
exercising longer and longer they're
going to be burning more carbohydrates
the duration of exercise at a certain
intensity dramatically changes their
body's metabolism for 24 hours with the
band on your wrist you use breath for
five minutes once a month while you take
a walk after five minutes of analysis
the app shows you how you both bad in
those five minutes how much you could
burn in 24 hours in your capacity to
lose weight this month other fitness
trackers based on heart rate zone
training and create you to workout at
the low intensity for a prolonged period
of time and make assumptions for your
fat or sugar burn instead path precisely
measures how you burn fat through your
breath and nose when you stall pull
anything over time Pat learns how your
exercise changes a fat and sugar run
throughout the day and starts
recommending the minimum minutes of
exercise you need every day to achieve
your goal the challenge is how do you
determine someone's 24 hours metabolism
with only 2 minutes of break analysis so
we collected personal break data of
almost 300 individuals in the lab not
just during the exercise but also after
they eat and why this team with months
of testing we use this data to train and
pacer machine algorithms which now can
predict your metabolism with 90 to 95%
active path measures our oxygen and co2
levels during each stage to measure your
metabolism to the minute which is
equivalent to a we owe to sub max test

abandoning their devices but ours is
