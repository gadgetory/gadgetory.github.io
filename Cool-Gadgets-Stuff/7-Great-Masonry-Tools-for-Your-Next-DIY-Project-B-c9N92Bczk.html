key features for stainless steel spring
clogs porpoise beam when you lay it on
the course they keep the tool simpler
than players we learned the closed end
up here at the end of a wall to begin
getting water into the cutaway section
press a tome into a scrape it across
just like so no gluten here comes the
perfect square pair to begin who will
know swing the tool around and as you
see the backhand hero to open its bridge
so as we reposition it on the wall slide
the tool along as we go pressing our
mortar dome into the cutaway section and
scraping it across we come to the corner
now look at this then log underneath
hits a corner break we finish perfect we
come round again to look at the back
here ensures we join on to perfection
and away we go again all design for
speed and ease so when we come to
putting on a brick we just gently press
the dome into that with the perfect
template now again to settle at the end
of a brick pointed in remove the excess
remove the guide the perfect vertical
joint knows well to put on our next
brick again just gently pressing that
home to give you that tight secure 10
millimeter joint note all around your
brick no we need to come to the far end
of our wall set off the end as well to
pull our string Line so we get perfect
straight lines I bring you the message
me it's my second invention again pure
simplicity here a set of metric brackets
the keeping the lip here on the top
which ensures when you settle at the
corner of your brick your loyal cannot
slip we can no place on the bricks
within the course
we just bring the top edge of a brick no
to meet our spring line there you have
it
we've uniform clean joints with perfect
squared lines
we just need to point over joints so my
final invention the pro pointer what's
unique about this it's multi-dimensional
you were 12 in each and six millimeter
pointing surface one of them will always
get in and strike up your joint and give
you that perfectly pointed finish just
get out there and fill something
beautiful because remember you can build
introducing the ox mix mate mixing
paddled a revolution in mixing at the
moment I'm working on-site as well as be
working for world skills as the skills
competition money to worldwide here we
are setting up the race using one whole
bag of multi finished plaster with
eleven and a half liters of water let
the plaster settle into the water and
then start by mixing from the bottom of
the bucket
mixing took only 45 seconds whereas the
standard mixer took two minutes this
shows just how much time you can save
using the mixed motive and time is money
mix made from ox tools unleash the power

my name's John hassle time
manager Ali fix we're going to be
demonstrating the cracks ditching kit
the cracks ditching kit is used for
repairing cracks in any type of masonry
could be stone brickwork or block work
the kit contains 10 stainless steel heli
bars and a tub of hell upon thixotropic
grout for installing the bars a pointing
gun for injecting the grout a steel
mortar nozzle for reaching into the
joint a mortar rate for cutting the
joint out a heli bar insertion tool and
a mixing paddle all that's required in
addition to the kit is the tools that a
builder would carry in this van such as
a power drill step 1
rake out or cut slots into the
horizontal mortar beds extending 500
millimetres either side of the crack to
the specified depth step to clean out
the slot and then flush thoroughly with
water step 3 using the provided mixing
paddle and a power drill thoroughly mix
the Heligan grout step 4
using the crack stick pointing gun
inject a bead of heli bomb to the back
of the slot step 5 using the heli bar
insertion tool push the heli bars to the
back of the slot ensuring good coverage
step 6
inject a second bead of hellevang grout
and then use the heli bar insertion tool
to ensure complete coverage of the heli
bars
step 7 repoint the mortar bed and make
good the heli fix cracks ditching kit is
easy to use it comes with full
instructions there's no need for any
specific training it can be used on all
types of masonry and may take away the
need for rebuilding also the system
reduces further cracking the pre-measure
components takes away the need for
adding water on site the high surface
area of the bar and contact with the
grout reduces the potential for
operative error and the bars can be bent
around corners to accommodate cracks
which are positioned adjacent to the
corner
I received a question from Mike
regarding the mtech brick jointer G 1700
which is the item here and it comes with
four different diameter attachments and
you select the one that is correct for
the type of profile on the joint you
want and it's for are putting concave
weather joints in the mortar in your
brickwork to stop water getting in so as
with all pointing you do your
perpendiculars first which is like this
and then you come along hold uncle and
you push the mortar in to give the
weather struck weatherproof joint in
your masonry so hope that helps any
other questions please go to and take

and look forward to answering
this is the for jet wall blaster by tool
Crete made in the USA this is a
pneumatic hand tool which connects to an
air compressor and can be used to spray
high viscosity
semmen Tisha's mixes including stucco
plaster concrete and even fibered and
aggregate filled mixes like GF RC or
mixes with small pebbles colored glass
and more simply connect the air valve to
the optional green air tube and then to
the hopper use an appropriate fitting to
connect the 3/8 inch or half inch inside
diameter air hose to the cp5 automotive
fitting on the sprayers air valve to
begin spraying we recommend a compressor
that is either gas or 220 volt electric
with a minimum specification of 5
horsepower 7 CFM at 90 psi this will
give strong continuous air flow for
greatest sprain power the 4 jet wall
blaster is a favorite among contractors
Ford speed and wide spray pattern
using a mortar sprayer overhand trolley
can reduce application time by more than
half and cut labour needs by even more
simply spray the material onto your
substrate and follow up by traveling it
smooth and even the tool creep motor
sprayers are easy to use easy to clean
and when treated and maintained properly
will last for many many years a crew of
three is ideal for greatest efficiency
one person to provide fresh mix another
to spray and the third to follow up and
trow everything smooth and even this
sprayer is best for medium to
large-sized wall projects for smaller
projects or if you need to spray onto
the ceiling take a look at our other
sprayers available at mortar sprayer

while I'm Kevin O'Brien on the inventor
and the blockbuster bolster one it
straight through here we've got the
hundred mill traditional bolster been
around for a lot of years used for
cutting blocks bricks and everything
else when cutting the block you can only
cut part of the block and also there's a
danger bit coming off a striking point
and hitting your thumb or your finger
what they did they tried to get over
that problem bringing in the mushroom to
protect your hand when cutting it but a
lot of bricklayers don't like using them
because when you cut the block and
follow that through this bit of plastic
comes down and hits you on the back of
the hand the blockbuster bowel stuff
we've got a 230 mil blade which is the
depth of your block striking point on
the top but just as important is the
handle on the side so your striking
point he's on the top of the bolster and
your hand is over well out away we've
also introduced hundred mill lines offer
your bowls they're up to your mark spin
the balls around cut the block
eliminates the use of a tape also used
on your gay balls you cut ups on your
Gables your angled cuts straight through
the block bus is not only good for
cutting blocks with you can also cut
bricks of it there you go nice straight
cut the blockbuster Bowl stuff a lot
quicker a lot more accurate and a lot
safer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
