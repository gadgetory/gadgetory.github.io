the award-winning go cycle electric bike
some of you may already know a bit about
my story and have followed our progress
in europe to all of our early customers
and supporters thank you for getting go
cycle this far for those of you that may
have just discovered us on Kickstarter
welcome this is our story
in 2002 I left a dream job at McLaren
cars and from my one-bedroom London flat
I began to design the best folding
electric bike in the world I traveled
the globe pitching go cycles of all the
big bike companies and they all said it
couldn't be done so I started a company
and in 2009 we launched the iconic go
cycle g1 followed by the award-winning
go cycle g2 and now the best go cycle
yet the amazing go cycle g3 but it's not
been easy slowly we built up our team
and we worked hard to establish
ourselves in Europe but my vision for go
cycle is global and that's why we're on
Kickstarter we want to break into the
North American market with a new model
the go cycle GS making stuff is hard
making the best folding ebike in the
world is really hard you've got to do a
load of testing and I mean a load of
testing because mother nature's rulebook
is tough and there's no undo button in
engineering when you're developing
something new failure and progress go
hand in hand and we've developed decades
of experience designing lightweight
bicycle parts at go cycle we cook with
different ingredients like our high-tech
injection molded magnesium frame and
when it comes to innovation nothing
compares to our clean drive which keeps
oil and dirt off your clothes
performance is in our DNA our drive
system is light and compact it's four
times the power density of any other
ebike on the market
I designed go cycle should be two wheel
drives the motor powers of front you
power the rear that's the lightest
possible ebike configuration you can get
and it means the go cycle is balanced
and easy to handle but I've saved the
best for last
our patented pitstop wheel this cool
side mounted design not only looks great
but it means the wheels are quick and
easy to remove of course go cycle is
portable modular and compact this is
hands-down the most versatile ebike
you'll ever
the most important part of the bike that
is really light it's six point five
kilograms and I can actually lift it up
in one finger which is amazing
peter is not just the product design
fanatic but he's also mad about bikes so
these two elements combined became the
hummingbird bike we're looking to buy a
folding bike that weighs less than 12
kilograms and we couldn't find one so
then Peter thought he could actually
make one and then we thought we could
actually mass produce this and help
other people who are in the same
situation as we were you carry it with
you all the time you take it on the cube
on my way back home because it's a long
commute I can take it in the elevator
then you save a lot of space and also my
commute is more enjoyable the invention
that we patented for the hummingbird
bike is the way it falls it uses a
unique folding system which moves the
pivot our folding to the center of the
bottom bracket by doing this the chain
is always in tension and you can always
hold it in the chain will never drop
we've started with the yellow because we
wanted it to pop and have something to
stay so that people actually notice it
on the street also it's customizable so
you can have it in four different colors
red black yellow or pure carbon fiber
feels amazing carbon fiber is a lot
better than alloy or titanium it's
absorbed vibrations of the road that
means it's incredibly strong but also
incredibly light it has a really unique
design that doesn't resemble anything on
the market and we were hoping that it
becomes an iconic design in bikes
the response has been amazing people are
stopping us on the street asking us
where they can buy the bike they can't
believe how light it is also they love
it because it's really bold it has a
very interesting shape
we made this bike because we know there
are people out there who are looking for
a lightweight folding bike that looks
good so that's why I put a lot of
thought into how it looks and how it
feels and rice it's not just a
functional bike you can actually
showcase your personality through it
many full-size folding bicycles are
often too expensive or don't fold smart
the quest have been to create a bicycle
that looks and rides like a normal
full-sized bicycle yet can be easily
folded down to a tad larger than its
wheels
introducing foobie fixie foobie is a
folding single speed or fixed gear bike
having the performance design and price
of a normal full sized bike it folds
easily and without the use of any tools
the folding locking mechanism has a
double action for safety the patented
design offers a stiff and cool frame and
that is designed to have the same riding
features as a normal fix II would the
bike comes with a flip-flop hub and rear
and front brake so you have the option
to use it as a single speed bike or as a
fixed gear bike sometimes you have to
lock your bike outside with foobie
folding locking your bike is safer with
wheels and frame lock together with one
you lock foobie uses only available
standard parts so if you already have
single speed bike you can turn it into a
folding bike just by buying the frame
it fits in the trunk of most cars and
can be taken on public transport where
folding bikes are accepted the bike is
designed on the existing foobie frame
technology that has been tested for many
years this frame design has proven
itself to be both stiff and safe beat
the Electra bike air 33 the air 33 is an
ultra lightweight eco-friendly foldable
electric bicycle it isn't just another
bicycle it gives you options the
electric motor and battery allow the
bike to work in three ways traditional
pedaling hybrid pedal assist and
completely electric get your daily
exercise during your commute or don't
the battery is lockable and removable
making it easy to charge and hard to
steal we designed a unique folding hinge
back strengthen for points as opposed to
two making it safe and easy to fold it's
ultra lightweight weighing only 33
pounds almost half as much as other
electric lights the wheels still move in
its folded position so you can just roll
it around when you're not using it
whether you're a new writer looking for
a fun sustainable way to explore your
city or daily commuter in need of a
cost-effective alternative air 33 is for
you bad traffic take air 33 classes on
the other side of the hill air 33
cravings at 2:00 in the morning air 33
this is the next step in bicycle
innovation it's built on our beliefs
quality convenience and sustainability
join us in redefining urban mobility
from this to cleaner air healthier
people faster commutes easy storage
err 33 by electro bike change the way
you move it's rare for established bike
companies to collaborate on a new
product together especially to grow a
new category that is barely recognized
by our industry for this project we turn
an extra cycle each brought our unique
strengths together it was a natural
partnership because we shared the same
vision removing barriers to urban
mobility
I'm Josh Homme I'm a co-founder and the
team captain at turned license what I
love about Josh is that he's a brilliant
pragmatic doer who is deeply passionate
about bicycle quality and design these
days he runs turn an international
company based in Taipei that is devoted
to finding new and innovative ways to
make bikes fit better into our everyday
lives and they have the patents to prove
it hi I'm Ross Evans inventor and
founder of extra cycle 20 years ago I
set out to make a bike that would change
the world as an idealistic engineering
student I landed in war-torn Nicaragua
in a tin and cinderblock shed i welded
together a bike that would alter the
course of my life and as it turned out
the lives of people worldwide
the city is full of incredible
opportunity and things to explore
designing a bike that can unlock the
hidden treasures of our cities is a
challenging design problem for this
project we at turn an extra cycle each
mater unique strengths together to build
a special bike the cargo node
it had to have integrated lighting
robust smart and always ready a bike
with a passenger seat need a friend go
out on a date it's a must
quality parts wide gear range it's good
on the hills and strong brake stop you
fast it even has a pump hidden in the
seat post carry your laptop laundry
kitty litter camping gear picnic
supplies you name it if all the bikes
are important because they allow you to
take a product which is incredibly
efficient and it's one of the best
inventions ever the bicycle and they
make it important whether that is being
able to fold it and bring it on bus onto
the subway into the trunk of a car so
that it fits into your life in this
liberated landscape there is a new
opportunity if you could unlock your
city what would it look like what would
your life look like
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
