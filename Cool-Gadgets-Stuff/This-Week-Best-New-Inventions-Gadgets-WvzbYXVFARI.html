you
meet ping the world's smallest GPS
locating device it's tiny so you can
stick it on your kids your pets your
bike your luggage or anything important
you don't want to lose it can be found
miles away and lasts up to five months
on a single charge there are a lot of
tracking devices out there that are
supposed to make it easy to find things
so most of us aren't using them why
because Bluetooth devices only work
within 35 feet of your phone you can't
find your kids if they're playing
outside or your luggage if it's lost
halfway across the country and these GPS
devices which have a much larger range
are big clunky need to be constantly
recharged and have large monthly fees
ping is reinventing the locating device
Bluetooth cellular and GPS for maximum
range extremely long battery life
waterproof and durable all together in a
tiny affordable versatile solution one
more thing ping is the only device with
a little check-in button that lets your
kids send their locations to friends or
family with a simple push and if they're
in trouble they can hold that button
down to send you a distress signal so
that health can be contacted ping is the
first truly useful affordable and simple
personal GPS locator
hi there have you ever thought a stash
in a kayak in the trunk of your car or
bringing it on a plane as a carry-on
what about storing it in the corner of
your closet
imagine swinging your kayak over your
shoulder before you set out exploring
outdoors paddle it across the lake to
that romantic picnic spot we did and we
set out on a mission to make outdoor
exploring easy we've reworked the
concept of the kayak into a folding
portable one that weighs under six
pounds with the just encased kayak you
can decide on a moment's notice if you
want to walk around the lake or paddle
across hey you have a freedom to
adventure our story starts in 2015 in
Alberta Canada as outdoor enthusiasts
and a trip fanatics we thought of this
concept out of frustration with the cost
and size of the traditional kayaks
not to mention none of us have the
storage space to keep one in our small
apartment
we won the product it fit our need
something portable and durable without
the investment additional equipment and
commitment that traditional kayaks
require we were looking for a weekend
kayak just like our weekend bikes so we
asked ourselves what if everyone had a
kayak that could fit into their bag we
wanted to reinvent the camping and
hiking experience so that you can
portage more while carrying less we
transform this idea into a real sized
foldable kayak creating an out of box
solution aimed at beginners to
professionals to experience kayaking
wherever they are take just in case
kayak for a stroll on a lake river or
bay or bring it on a hiking trip for
some impromptu paddling our team of
engineers designers and testers have
built and water tested prototype after
prototype to arrive at a kayak that's
lightweight fun safe to use and durable
just in case is made from a lightweight
carbon-fiber frame held together by
custom 3d printed connectors we use a
durable ripstop skin made with woven
nylon that has remarkable strength to
weight ratio weighing only 5.7 pounds
the just-in-case kayak can carry more
than 250 pounds and measures no more
than forty by six inches when folded
you'll be able to assemble our kayak in
15 minutes we've also tried to keep our
just-in-case kayak environmentally
friendly by using as little material as
possible we believe adventure doesn't
stop at the beaten path we believe in
taking the road less traveled and
staying curious
let's make kayaking affordable make
nature accessible and
venturing easy let's embrace the idea to
travel in life while exploring outdoors
is possible just in case
kayak has already been tested in
multiple locations around the world and
now we're ready to bring the finished
product to you in the summer of 2017
adventure that travels life
