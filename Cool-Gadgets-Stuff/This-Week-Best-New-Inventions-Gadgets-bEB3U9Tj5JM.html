to heat the cooking forces five times
faster than a traditional charcoal grill
it's super easy to use leaving you more
time to enjoy the day fuel free
rather than fiddle with a fire since
sole source port has no flame and is
cool to the touch you can also use it in
places like beaches national parks and
apartment buildings where fire cooking
isn't allowed treat yourself to fresh
outdoor cooking free of toxic smoke you
can grill with sole source in the
morning midday late afternoon when it's
cold when it's windy at the beach even
under passing clouds as long as the Sun
is still smiling down on you the solar
reflectors are engineered with the ideal
curvature for capturing the sun's ray
providing the equipment of about 600
watts of we're all cooking powers you
can cook from approximately one hour
after sunrise to one hour before sunset
on a bright beautiful sunny day for
example within five minutes the grill
will be at grilling temperatures within
10 it'll be hot enough to sear within 10
minutes charcoal is well it's getting
there even though it's reflecting all
that energy the surface is cool to the
touch as the heat is focused directly
onto the cooking surface and only the
cooking surface aligning the grill with
the Sun only requires you to look into
the blackout mirror and aim the beam
right at your pan the v-shape cut out
puts you in the captain's chair of the
soul source port because you deserve
this girl to work for you how are we
looking there okay
the grilling platform is a versatile pot
stand that allows you to use the
cookware you already own you can grill
pan fry saute steam boil
deep fry pressure cook and slow cook
we've taken our original model and
redesigned it with the on the go griller
in mind the new sport assembles in less
than three minutes and packs down to a
lightweight two feet carrying case
giving you the freedom to cook anywhere
and remember no flame means no smoke
clean air cooking bright months are
ahead so get outside and get grilling

left thumb break will quickly and simply
stop the s-1 when you drive is done
simply use the small circle app to lock
your s1 making it unusable to anyone of
you misako team has been targeted days
of research and development we want to
design the ebike
not only can save energy but also can
stay tight a space so you can take with
you grab okay whether you're commuting
to work or cruising through the park vs
ones adjustable seat and handlebars
always make for a comfortable run the
small circle has one the most portable
and lightweight e bike available today
you
do you travel and when you do your
devices travel with you then you know
plugging your devices in different
countries can be a challenge whether you
travel often or once in a while you
probably use one of these at least once
in your lifetime simpler travel adapters
only plug into one type of socket
Universal adapters aren't the most
travel friendly because they're big
bulky and can be quite heavy
well after countless prototypes
extensive testing and customer feedback
we created a better solution to help
travelers like their devices anywhere in
the world introducing micro the world's
smallest universal travel adapter with
surge protection compacting all the
benefits of a bulky universal adapter
into a cool gadget the smallest single
socket adapter bringing over a hundred
and fifty countries from all seven
continents into the palm of your hand
squeezing all plugs from around the
world into a compact space for maximum
versatility micro is super small weighs
only 40 grams is durable then very
travel friendly plugging in the micro is
easy micro accepts all major plug types
from around the world the adjustable
integrated casing makes it easy to cover
any third pin safely the release
mechanism is spring-loaded and easy to
use top slide the plug into the Americas
and over 54 countries simply twist to
use in Australia and over 29 other
countries
and when you're done push to store and
block bottom slide to plug into Europe
and over a hundred and twenty five
countries simply connect the integrated
modular third pin extension for access
to the UK and over 47 other countries
when you're done you know the drill push
score and lock the built-in fuse
protects your devices wherever you
travel because the blown fuse it's

or tablet simply replace the fuse and
you're ready to go wherever your travels
may take you the world's smallest
lightest Universal travel adapter keeps
your gadgets safe and makes plugging
your devices easier than ever before
3d printing in the RepRap project I
heard the cry from makers around the
world that they could finally make their
thing but those dreams fell short
3d printing didn't live up to the dream
that everyone had hoped the ability to
make their thing in scale when you want
to make something with a 3d printer you
have to load and unload the machine I
wanted something that had precise
control and repeatability I wanted
something easy to program that I could
use from one job to the next
I've wanted a robotic labor force hello
my name is Andrew Wingate and this is a
desert is an open source robotic arm
that can help you fabricate an automatic
entire build there was a wide array of
tool head it's basically a hacker
surface up to itself this is a scar a
class machine the structure is
self-supporting no motor needs to hold
up any other it's a proven industrial
design we want to give you the ability
to manufacture anything you can dream
from anywhere the open source software
and hardware stack is derived from the
3d printer cable this is a super
hackable platform it's so hackable you
have the ability to share tools with
this machine you can automate almost any
hand tool or power to a router we used
wait a few kills my tool heads were
mostly hunks of 2x4 and hand tools we've
done over 30 complete projects projects
ranging from metalworking to 3d printing
to fabrication and assembly if you have
a tool head you like and you think other
people you can make them and even sell
them you don't even need permission from
us the tool had possibilities there
when I think about what it can make I
don't think about what it can make I
think about what you can I want to help
you make your thing and we will share
our designs and teach you to build
assembly lines an entire automated
Factory you can make one you can make a
million
we plan to democratize manufacturing and
that's why we're open source with open
source software and open source hardware
we are able to provide a fertile
platform to build your dream we give our
source files we give our design files we
give you all the information on how to
use them we will donate 10% of revenue
from every arm to our community and to
the greater open source hardware and
software communities at large we think
it's important to support the ecosystem
that made this project possible we
believe this is the future of
manufacturing the ability to make what
you want where you at any scale let's
kickstart the next Industrial Revolution
and create a technology that allows us
to work together to create a better
world for every
you
back in 2015 we successfully crowdfunded
the paper shooters construction tip
torre blaster since then we sold
thousands of blasters shift millions of
spit balls and are stocked in major
retailers all around the world now we're
back with a new range that you don't
need to build spit fall blasters these
are all planted fully assembled and
shoot straight out of the box spit ball
blasters raises the bar for projectile
based to a comment by utilizing 100%
biodegradable and readily available
tissue paper is Anna now you'll never
need to buy more ammo or collected at
the blast let's take a look at how it
works simply take a piece of tissue
paper and roll it into a tube next snip
off 1 centimeter pieces then dip each
piece in water and place inside the moat
having fine
compress the mold and there you go
perfect result every time
oh the mo into the shelf then into the
magazine BMO sticks to the target and
three wimps out there state-owned urges
to get hit the assault rifle a spit ball
blasters as we 9000 allows you to black
100% biodegradable to the ball that you
can make yourself from ordinary tissue
with the ability to hit targets up to 65
feet away the blasters feature awesome
paint jobs and thanks to the unique
cocking system also offer real triggers
and ejecting shells in addition they
feature a flip clip which allows for 16
shots without reloading meaning you'll
own the battlefield we also include the
brass catcher so you don't need to worry
about collecting the show</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
