more versatile they've replaced
traditional materials across the board

polyethylene fibers ten times stronger
than steel

lifetime our fabric is sweat proof

a heat welded construction will replace
his conventional stitching instead tear
proof bar tacks placed in high-stress
areas make it virtually unbreakable we
challenge the notion that leather is
even relevant for wallets anymore using
modern materials and construction
methods we knew we could engineer
something thinner and stronger that's
incredibly precise and tactile
hundreds of athletes around the world
and put our wallets to the test and
their feedback has helped us to design
the fly phone wallet
here's a summary of our experience in
the industry and is led by a passion for

happy breathing there are a lot of
studies that show that opioids don't
work as well and cause more side effects
than simple ibuprofen I first realized
that maybe we're giving the wrong
medications but as I researched pain
management it turns out that for almost
every pain condition medications are the
third or fourth most effective 12 years
ago I invented a device to block needle
pain called
buzzy it's been used for thirty 1
million needle procedures what people
say works for pain is thermal therapy
hot wraps cold wraps vibration massage
yoga exercise those aren't things that
most physicians think about recommending
do a Thurmond is a personal customizable
wearable device for pain that has really
high-tech pain solutions on the back but
a comfortable strap that wraps around so
that you can feel good when you put it
on do a therm combines the cool pulse
technology that we've proven is
effective for sharp pain but gives you
the option of very intense heat or very
intense cold with a variety of vibration
therapy cycles that have been proven to
work for different kinds of pain the
research and chronic pain doesn't say
you get better overnight you need to
have something that feels good that that
you use on a regular basis to help
retrain your body that your low back
doesn't have to hurt we're a mission to
change how people treat and even think
about pain I've actually never found
anything that combines vibration and
heat or cold after using the dooooom for
a while I think there are a significant
number of advantages over tens Wow
seriously that's that's really cool
you affirm is an interesting concept
making things look simple as always our
goal but this is a very complex device
the cool pulse technology we developed
has been cleared by the FDA it's a class
one device so it's the most minimum risk
but we've gone through the studies to
prove that it's effective heat and cold
have both been studied separately and
found to be twice as effective as any
medications at decreasing back pain if
you pledge an R do a therm device you're
gonna make it possible for the most
amazing low back pain device that ever
existed to be in your hands you'll get
naturally tore natural cold to different
vibration frequencies three different
vibration cycles since I founded pain
care labs it's been my mission to
eliminate unnecessary pain pledge for a
do a therm and get power over your back
