in the world when I was a kid
during the 90s water guns used to be a
lot bigger and a lot meaner than they
are now and for some reason they haven't
changed in like 20 years and everyone
wonders why we thought it was time for a
new water gun there is a lot better than
anything you have ever seen you have all
the water guns in the world and then you
have the spyro one is something else
entirely what it does it shoots
individual bullets of water they're
completely harmless but they fly really
fast and really far and you can hit
someone precisely from the distance once
you run dry and you have zero shots left
you just dip the sparrow on into water
and refill xandrie pressurizes itself no
more screwing no more pumping or nothing
of that old stuff it's really cool the
spyro one has a display that tells you
how many shots you have left to go and
then you have to recharge obviously once
you recharge the display goes up to 25
again with the spyro one and a couple of
friends you'll have a great time and
intense action-packed water fights but
you could also bring it to a barbecue or
a party or a boat trip there will be so
much fun everywhere now we believe that
it is time for water gun revolution and
the only thing is missing to make that
vision a reality is your support
smelling the best water gun in the world
sounds like a lot of fun but on the
other side is also serious business the
spyro one is nearly complete
we did our part no it's up to you thank
us and have fun
I've dreamed of having a holographic
display most of my life not a RvR but
you know the hologram
my name is Shawn Prain I'm a longtime
holography and one of the co-inventors
of the looking-glass the Looking Glass
is a new type of light-filled display
that generates 45 simultaneous views of
a 3d world all at 60 frames per second
no VR headset required just go up to one
of these displays and you look at it and
you interact with it
there's no clunky headgear there's no
extended setup it's amazing
we're releasing a unity SDK and
universal model and animation importer
with a lot more plugins into other 3d
creation tools over the coming months
no matter what tool you use your work
will be able to come to life in the
looking-glass so your loss of this
technology you are like interaction with
this display it's a real intimate
process of creation this is an
interesting feeling that like connection
between you and something that's living
inside the glass I saw these things in
sci-fi comics and movies growing up it
seemed impossible like sending Holograms
of yourself to another country Looking
Glass is unique in that it fulfills kind
of what we've imagined in a lot of ways
around what a true volumetric display
would look like the Looking Glass
connects up to any modern PC or Mac with
couple cables and then you can either
create your own 3d content or explore
what everyone around the world is making
the single click my initial experience
with looking bus was really that it's
magic
the way in which you experience it is
much more natural and instinctive in
terms of seeing how you can understand
the layers of the space
reality but in a magical box the dream
of the hologram is finally here and all
of us in lookingglass factory are
designing new and impossible things and
looking glasses every day so whether
you're a rocket designer 3d animator or
volumetric videographer get a Looking
Glass and bring your 3d creations to
life
