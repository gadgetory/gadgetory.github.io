2015 we announced a new product called
power pod a cycling power meter that's
simple portable accurate and affordable
and today I'm very excited to announce a
new product called aero pod aero pod
incorporates the latest generation of
digital sensors it also includes a brand
new wind port pitot tube design and all
of it is wrapped up in a beautiful sleek
case to zone so arrow pod is a great
power meter but more than that when you
use it with a direct force power meter
it also becomes an aerodynamic CDA
system instead of spending thousands of
dollars to travel to a wind tunnel or
velodrome to get aerodynamic data
attached aero pod to your bicycle pair
it to your direct force power meter and
then get out on your roads and ride
while you're on the road you'll see
power data but you'll also see CDA
hillslope wind speed elevation and warp
in fact aero pod includes a measurement
called time advantage time advantage
turns your aerodynamic sleekness into a
number that tells you how much time
you're gaining or losing due to changes
in your ride position if you're a time
trial is it is a fantastic way to make
sure that you're staying on pace while
you're riding
Aero pilot will show its data in one of
three different ways the new every site
Raptor glasses display your Aero pod
data in a head-up display in your field
of vision for Garmin owners we have a
new app if you have a connect IQ
compatible Garmin device our app will
show Aero pod data right on your Garmin
screen and if you have a Bluetooth
low-energy smartphone the powerhouse app
from Belikov will show your Aero pod
data
arrow pod also includes our power stroke
method of measuring pedal stroke
efficiency and economy in short arrow
pod is the best power meter that we have
ever made
imagine the perfect road the feeling of
flying over smooth pavement gliding from
curve to curve unfortunately for most of
us the reality is not so smooth at
redshifts sports we want every road to
feel like the perfect Road which is why
we're so excited to be back here on
Kickstarter to introduce the Shox top
suspension step the shock stop is a
pivoting suspension step that isolates
your body from bumps shocks and Road
buddies
compared to a regular step the shock
stop dramatically reduces impact forces
on your hands and wrists we designed the
stem from the ground up specifically for
road riding and it's available in a
variety of lengths and angles with
adjustable stiffness so everyone from
performance cyclists to recreational
riders and commuters can find the
perfect fit I love riding my road bike
but it's really stiff and it tends to
transmit every little bump straight to
my hands and arms I use gloves extra bar
tape and I even upgrade it to a
carbon-fiber frame but in reality those
changes only added a tiny amount of
cushioning you've probably felt fatigued
numbness or even pain in your hands
after a long ride and usually it's just
annoying but the vibrations and impacts
actually slow you down and cause a loss
of control and over time they can even
lead to long-term injury the shock stop
stem has an integrated pivot joint with
twin adjustable elastomers that smooth
out the road letting you relax and enjoy
the ride instead of dodging every little
bump and crack you can focus on the road
ahead
every shock your body absorbs actually
slows you down the shop stop lets you
ride faster at the same energy level and
it also reduces fatigue so you feel
fresher at the end of every ride at the
end of the day the shock stop just makes
every part of your ride feel better
installing the shock stomp on your bike
is incredibly easy and you can choose
from different stiffness elastomers to
get the precise feel you want we design
the shop stop to be lightweight
torsionally rigid and completely
maintenance-free our pivot design uses
the same fully sealed cartridge bearings
that are used in full suspension
mountain bikes and we chose the highest
quality components and materials to
ensure that the shocks top would stand
up to even the roughest roads let's be
honest the suspension stems of the past
were a bit of an eyesore and they
definitely weren't optimised for a road
riding we tuned the travel feel and
aesthetics of the shocks top to
perfectly compliment modern road bikes
and the roads we ride on
this right in your line of sight right
when you need it then it's honestly
going to be a game changer for me
completely be able to write in a group
see exactly where I'm going have all of
my dad without having to look down at my
computer it makes it incredibly safe I'm
not sure literate and it was super easy
to put my workout on there it has an arc
I can program in my wattage and I know
exactly what my goal is as a coach you
know one of the functionalities of the
camera giving that to an athlete and
taken out into a group ride or a race
having them then be able to look at the
data with the athlete and give them
feedback on its positioning probably
above all just being able to see my
heart rate my power together constantly
and kind of make a decision like how
hard I can go having all the information
in front of you is pretty awesome and I
don't think I even looked down once on
my cycling computer which is kind of sad
it was pretty much perfect because I
could gouge my effort all the way for
the finish line and eventually I got
first you know there's certain points in
you in your sport where things change
you know they talk about the Aero bars
in triathlon they talk about the zero
helmet but this is one of those
monumental moments in the sport when
technology's going to change the game
for everybody
one of my favorite things to do is to
get out and ride my bike but the
combination of rough roads and stiff
bike frames means riding can be really
tough on your body in 2016
we launched the shock stop suspension
step to add cushioning to the front end
of the bike the stem changed the way
people thought about suspension but the
front of the bike is only half the
equation that's why we're so excited to
introduce the shock stop seat post a
revolutionary short travel suspension
seatpost that will completely change
your riding experience no matter what
kind of bike you ride maybe you're out
for an epic gravel adventure or just
dealing with potholes on your daily
commute you're gonna find rough roads
wherever you ride modern bikes are
designed for speed and efficiency not
for comfort this means bumps and impacts
pass straight into your body which leads
to fatigue pain or even injury
we designed the shock stop seat post to
suspend your body and isolate you from
the shocks and vibrations of the road we
optimize the travel and suspension
kinematics to provide a super plush
bottomless suspension feeling we
designed the seat post to integrate
seamlessly with the styling of modern
bikes you can change the spring rate and
preload to match your specific riding
style
and it's compatible with all types of
writing gravel me bike commuter Road and
mountain
studies show fatigue reduces riding
efficiency by up to 20%
typically adding comfort to your bike
meant sacrificing performance the shock
stop seat post lets you ride faster and
more efficiently because instead of
bracing yourself against impacts you can
say seated and keep pedaling over rough
surfaces it reduces the accumulated
effects of bumps and vibrations allowing
you to ride further faster and more
comfortable the shock stop seat post is
the rare product that increases comfort
and performance riding the shocks top
seat post is truly transformative
introducing the Kouros Omni smart
cycling helmet with bone conduction
audio that gives you a safe Wireless
Bloodless precision audio experience as
you ride our technology delivers audio
vibrations through your upper cheekbones
and directly into your inner ear keeping
your ears open to listen to your
environment and your hands on the bike

navigation and ride data and even take
calls controls are right at your
fingertips with the Smart Remote
you can skip tracks adjust volume answer
calls and activate the safety light from
maximum visibility and with the
cloud-based Koro smartphone app you can
set and save routes track ride data
share and compete all in real time all
of this integrated into a performance
helmet that sleek lightweight
aerodynamic and safe giving you the
power to stay connected and the freedom
to love
or ride</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
