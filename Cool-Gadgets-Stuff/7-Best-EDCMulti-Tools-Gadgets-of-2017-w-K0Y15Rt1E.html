taken a lot of time perfecting our
little knives we find them so handy not
just using them in a studio but also in
our day to day life too
we hope you like using them as much as
we do so please back or share our
product and we look forward to seeing
how you use yours
we all
objects that pop up in life and they
don't always happen when our tools are
handy it's annoying to have to spend
time chasing down tools for a job that
should take ten seconds if you're like
me it usually ends up getting added to
your to-do list that's why we created
the lever gear tool card
it's a multi-tool the size of a credit
card that has 40 different tools it's
always with you
so you can get things done I like to be
prepared to handle any task but I also
hate the idea of carrying around a lot
of extra stuff a credit card size tool
that could disappear in my wallet seemed
like the perfect solution we developed
the tool card with a simple premise the
real estate in your pocket is precious
so you should own stuff that's actually
worth carrying we began our design
process by brainstorming all of the
functions we could pack into a credit
card sized multi-tool we also tested
every card that existed on the market we
thought a lot about the design and
layout of the tool card by nesting the
tools we were able to add tools and
reduce weight without sacrificing
strength we kept the edges smooth so it
feels great in your hand when you're
using the tools we chose not to have an
exposed blade so the tool card is TSA
compliant and it won't damage your
wallet instead we added a blade
protected by the can opener so you can
cut cords but not your fingers the tool
card weighs only one ounce and slips
easily into your wallet so you won't
notice it until you need it
or ditch the wallet all together the
innovative money clip is designed to
snap on with a click and disassemble
with ease no extra tools required
no fasteners to lose so you can quickly
switch from wallet card to money clip
tool card is made in America from blade
quality 420 stainless steel which is
then heat treated for excellent strength
and hardness
it's then bead blasted for a
professional finish and laser etched for
rich permanent graphics
Hey
we were lost it was close to midnight we
had all of our belongings on us and it
was starting to look like we'd be
spending the night on the streets of
Bogota on that night in Colombia Flynt
who was born when was the last time your
phone let you down did you need to call
a loved one or get an uber out of a
dodgy night spot or you like us stranded
without maps or a hotel address the
solution to this common problem isn't a
chunky power pack that's just sitting at
home when you need it most
the right solution needs to be
pocket-sized and versatile introducing
sidekick by Flint
say you're on an adventure or you're in
a situation where traditional charging
just is impossible no problem
sidekick can take charge from double-a C
&amp;amp; D size batteries which you can pick up
anywhere so what about the times when
you can't find batteries
well sidekick has a Japanese made
rechargeable lithium built-in
or maybe you're running low at work or
at the airport just plug in with
sidekicks built-in fast charge cable
sidekick was designed as an everyday
carry
so we've bundled in a lot of everyday
features the Thomas loop is an
innovative 3d printed gadget made from
strong and flexible plastic and durable
elastic strength it's self tightening
feature will make sure that your
possessions are fastened safely simply
wrap the elastic string around an item
secured in the designated notches pull
the ends to tighten the loop and you're
ready to go it can support up to 33
pounds it's practical and smart design
makes it easy to use and its
applications are endless
and that's not all the Thomas loop also
helps you with your groceries just pull
the handles of the biodegradable plastic
bag through the hole and fold them
around the curved edges its shape fits
perfectly into your hand preventing the
thin bag handles from cutting into your
palm and since we all know that life
isn't black-and-white the Thomas loop
comes in five different colors the
Thomas loop such a small thing that
helps in so many situations innovation
serves humanity the best if it reaches
the people who will use it
