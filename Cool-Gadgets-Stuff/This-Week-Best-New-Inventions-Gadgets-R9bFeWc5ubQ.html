cover your skin use a racket or apply
sticky skin damaging sprays or creams
but we realized nobody wants that
this is why we invented a solution that
is not sticky doesn't cause allergic
reactions and is friendly towards the
environment at the same time this is the
bindi tail a portable mosquito repellent
it comes as a wristband but also clips
to any place where protection is needed
it is small non intrusive and very
lightweight the bandido uses proven
techniques you know from products that
plug into your outlet and combines them
into a portable device that also
protects you outside wherever you go
utilizing all-natural DEET free scents
and sonic sounds it instantly creates a
shield around you to ward off mosquitoes
I like the Bandito because I can finally
enjoy outdoor activities with my kids as
a parent it gives me peace of mind
knowing that the product is safe for
kids and keeps them from having itchy
mosquito bites after playing outside a
replaceable battery and Sen strips allow
for long-term use and refilling every
season so if you're getting ready for a
picnic with the family golfing with
friends backpacking with buddies or
anything outdoor related you can rely on
the bandido help us make a change a
portion of proceeds will be donated
towards fighting malaria

people who reported suffering from
stress and anxiety has increased by

relaxation we desperately need
introducing Moonpie a high density
zero-gravity bean bag engineered to
morph and respond to your body naturally
relieving stress while providing altima
comfort and relaxation my name is John
fiorentino and I've spent years poring
over the research and science behind
sleep stress and anxiety just last year
I created the now world-famous weighted
blanket on Kickstarter and raised over
4.7 million dollars from over 23,000
incredible backers and now I'm so
excited to introduce to all of you moon
pod a beanbag completely re-engineered
to deliver a full-body weightless
experience the weightless sensation moon
pod delivers is designed to mimic the
therapeutic effects of floatation
therapy
a powerful practice to help people who
suffer from anxiety ADHD insomnia PTSD
and depression moon pod eliminates all
pressure points by evenly distributing
your weight across its surface actively
targeting high tension areas opening up
these high stress areas promotes proper
breathing and circulation to increase
relaxation while decreasing overall
stress and anxiety levels moon pod
morphs into three main positions sit in
the center to use it like a chair
recline to lounge around and chill out
or lay down completely horizontally and
when you use it along with my weighted
blanket the experience is unlike
anything you'll ever feel this
combination unlocks a seriously
transcendent experience whenever you
need it and don't worry it's super
lightweight and designed to stand up on
its own making it easy to store away
just about anywhere so whether you're
working hard relaxing after a stressful
day or taking a power nap moon pot will
quickly become your go to solution for
all-day relaxation our manufacturing
partners are ready to go so please join
me again to create another
transformative product that will help
