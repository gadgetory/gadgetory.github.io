virtual reality has already taken us far
beyond what can be achieved with
traditional screens and controllers but
it has the potential to be so much more
immersive we want to directly connect
you with the objects that you interact
with in the virtual world so we're
building Athena a VR rifle controller hi
I'm Sebastian co-founder of alien VR
Athena is the end result of an extensive
development process incorporating
lessons we learned from our earlier
prototypes and our successful developer
kit the persuader we learn that the most
important thing for a VR gun controller
is perfect positional tracking we
accomplish this with our previous death
kit with an attached live controller but
Athena has lighthouse technology built
in perfect tracking makes you lose
yourself in the game you can running gun
firing from the hip or shouldering the
weapon and looking down the sights every
movement is perfectly mirrored in kick
we kept physical immersion in mind with
the details of this controller this is
like a high-end racing wheel or
mechanical keyboard from a realistic
reloading action to a fully analog
cocking handle to the powerful recoil
feedback with up to 14 hours of
untethered gameplay it's packed with
impressive technology and built with
gamers and mud the VR gaming is only as
good as the games themselves and we
recognized from the beginning that to
make Athena's success we had to have the
support of awesome game developers the
increase of immersion is quite high when
you're actually holding what you're
seeing inside of the game and we
hunkered down and went into this
seek-and-destroy mode and having the
actual item in our hands leaning up
against the walls it was it was amazing
I think the guys did a great job on
making this easy as possible easy for us
to do is doing the implementation of the
SDK to within a few hours
got the whole setup running and having a
physical gun in your hands which you can
actually reload and you know really aim
really gave an extra dimension to the
immersiveness when you play Arizona
sunshine we're shipping Athena with two
fully playable demos that we've
developed and because it supports
lighthouse technology Athena will be
compatible on launch with many of the
games that already support the HTC vive
we aren't new to this we've already
successfully released controllers to
both consumers and developers as a team
we're all really passionate about video
games and we have been since we were
kids we want to make sure we're building
a great controller for gamers like us so
we want your input and your help to make
it 'inna a reality our goal is to
connect you more deeply with the games
that you love check out our IndieGoGo
page for more details on Athena and
becoming a backer thanks for your
support
this is small transparent speaker three
years ago we came to Kickstarter with a
transparent speaker the first premium
speaker that was built to be repairable
we are very proud it has been so
appreciated all around the world for its
great design now we are back with a
small transparent speaker
it's simply smaller more affordable and
it's made out of timeless premium
materials like hardened glass and
aluminium it connects to all the latest
wireless standards like Apple AirPlay
Google cast Spotify connects for just a
normal Bluetooth on your phone it's also
the most sustainable high quality
speaker we can make the speaker
automatically detects if a part needs to
be repaired replaced or updated and you
can send it back with our prepaid
postage for the best quality recycling
at our facilities up sighters will also
get a discount on their next purchase we
believe that big change can come from a
small group of passionate people let's
find the climate change deniers together
please back the small transparent
speaker a big step forward for
sustainable consumer electronics
let us introduce charges the world's
most advanced universal travel adapter
that also charges your mobile devices
without any additional chargers it works
in the USA UK Europe Australia and over
150 other countries the idea was born
out of the everyday struggle of people
on the go every time I go on holiday I
want to focus on what to wear but I also
have to carry around a lot of devices
that I don't want to think about but I
can't live without or when I am on an
important business trip abroad and I
want less luggage but I need my smart
gadgets all these devices require many
chargers that take up half of my space
and don't forget the countless number of
adapters around the world yeah I always
get those confused and there are never
enough outlets in hotel rooms to charge
all my devices at once that never
happens anymore because we have charges
charges conforms to plug standards in
the USA UK Europe Australia and 150
countries around the world
you can plug the device in any outlet
worldwide with all the plugs
conveniently stored inside charges saves
you space and the trouble of forgetting
or losing your Chargers the height of
the pins is adjustable to fit any mobile
case or protector now you can charge
your smart phones and tablets at the
same time using the two integrated pins
without carrying any additional Chargers
charges supports micro USB lightning and
USB C standards covering the whole range
of mobile devices and smart gadgets
great now we can charge my iPhone and
your samsung at the same time it also
works with other devices sharing the
same charging standards
charges also has three additional USB
ports to make it the most convenient
Universal travel adapter and you still
have the outlet ready to use in addition
we created the charges Bank it's a power
bank that charges my phone up to three
times and has a USB port for any other
device go charges back us now on
IndieGoGo
