all feel a certain amount of stress
especially at work stress and
frustration is a huge problem in the
modern work society and I bet you know
few people who handle it with these
usually by squeezing their balls right
so why shouldn't you introducing squeeze
balls we all know how relaxing squeezing
our balls can be and how unattractive if
you do it the wrong time we wanted to
make a product that was specially
designed for squeezing and also socially
acceptable like our balls we are small
companies Sweden that do things a little
bit differently for a year now we've
been working a product that was way back
in our minds some I'd say a bit
different some say weird and I even
heard somebody say sexy but I don't know
about that you decide you're very
passionate about it and we decided was
time to act time to release our product
and our version of what balls should
look like and feel when you look at the
methods regarding eliminating stress the
most popular are the old fashioned
stress balls but we felt these didn't
look too good so we upgraded the regular
balls into pair of great balls using the
built-in suction cup you can hang your
squeeze balls from virtually any desk
and give them a firm squeeze every time
your boss comes over to nag at you or
simply whenever you feel the urge to
discreetly de-stress right on a real
desk

Joker greeting now after our success of
the original Joker birthday card we had
some time to think and reflect and start
wondering what should be our next
product and what could we do now we
started traveling around the world so
visiting all the different cities and
places just to learn more about our
world and society and what could be our
next product and what we could bring to
you and one night when I was deep down
in the Amazon jungle with my head on my
pillow
trying to sleep I was really really
tired and then all of a sudden I heard
this noise that continued to irritate me
all night long I couldn't stop them well
we took it we put it into a product and
we now present it to you we call it the
cricket
unlike the original Joker birthday card
this one is a little bit different this
you leave in a secret in hidden location
at your friend's house or your family's
house perhaps people you don't even know
you want to go to a movie theater you
can use that a movie theater when I go
to a restaurant you use restaurant or
even just friends houses have to
interpret cells and just like the
original Joker card when you push play
on this card
it will continue to go again and again
and again or three hours plus let me
show you the details on how this card
works there is a press button and sample
totally safe play once through or you
just press it again to stop it here is
it to and from and a message to whoever
you want to leave a message to we have a
feature on the back which is an adhesive
and this is the sticky
so you can put it under a table under a
chair behind a cupboard or really where
p-please now to activate it is you can
take this tab and remove it and then you
just can press firmly once or twice on
the press but now it's ready to go you
have 90 seconds to escape the room then
it's going to start making some noises
so let's wait out the full the full 90
seconds here we go
there it is after 90 seconds you'll hear
the cricket there's only one way to stop
you have to bring it here we go and just
like the other cards we had a glitter
inside for one more prank on top of
everything
what's up Kickstarter my name is Jason
from San Diego and we live in a selfie
driven world saved every moment in
experience we have is quickly snapped
away on our smartphones and then
cherished until the end of time or until
the zombie apocalypse it seems the only
ones that didn't get the memo about
locking these moments away in time is
our furry little friends as we long for
a picture-perfect moment with our pets
they're too busy looking at squirrels
yep it's below so this got me thinking
had anybody perfected the art of taking
a picture or selfie with your pets that
would be a solution to an everyday
problem of ours so I searched and
searched to the end of the internet and
I found nothing as i sat there looking
at my laptop I literally had a face to
palm moment the answer had been sitting
in front of me all this time and I
thought why didn't I think of that and
then I realized oh yeah I did just now
that just happened
introducing the pooch selfie the pooch
selfie is a smartphone attachment which
harnesses your dog's natural draw and
focus to a tennis ball and uses its
magical powers to help you take better
pictures and selfies with your pet
whether you're taking a picture of your
pup or one with a few lists friends
pooch selfie will help you NAB those
moments with far better results than
ever before
I created put selfie to be simple and
effective it was designed for both
iPhones and androids however works
universally with most smartphones and
tablets to install push selfie simply
slide the plastic component onto your
smartphone and place the ball into the
class Nia device you'll notice there are
clearances for both front and
rear-facing cameras this allows you to
toggle between portrait style pics and
selfies without having to remove the
device our pets are quite unpredictable
and even with the sorcery that these
tennis balls hold their interest begins
to fade
each selfie comes with a squeaking
boil to grab that extra ounce of
attention from our pets and perk them up
for additional glamour shots need even
more incentive not to worry pooch
selfies bald disengages from the classy
mechanism and you can regain your pup's
focus with a couple rounds of fetch this
is particularly useful when you need to
additional time to edit the photos you
took to ensure one of them has your
smile on fleek did they get that last on
fleek reference right yes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
