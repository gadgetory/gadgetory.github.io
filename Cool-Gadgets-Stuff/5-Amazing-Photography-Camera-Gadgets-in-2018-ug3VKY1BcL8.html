over the last four years we've launched
some very unique glass to the market
we're a team of photography enthusiasts
and industry experts who aim to provide
you with new tools to enjoy photography
and this time is no different
introducing allow WA 24 millimeter probe
lens the weirdest but most creative in
revolutionary macro tool ever
traditional macro lenses in the market
tend to have a long focal length varying
from 60 to 100 millimetres or even
longer
the subject filled most of the frame and
is isolated from the surrounding
environment our new la probe however
allows you to focus really close showing
a great amount of the details and
texture of your subject at the same time
you can enjoy a compelling wide angle of
view so that more of your background can
be included into your shots for the
first time ever you can easily create a
compelling and unique bug eye
perspective style and no other lenses
can compare to
the wide-angle design also means you get
much more depth of field than a
telephoto macro lens when focusing at
close distances you can start including
the habitat or environment of the
subject into your composition since more
of your shot will be in focus your image
can instantly become very informative
and appealing as macro photographers
ourselves we usually face a problem of
not being able to shoot smaller subjects
with our allow a probe you can now take
advantage of the two to one maximum
magnification to reveal details that
cannot be seen by the naked eye the
focus range covers all the way from to
toe and macro to infinity which adds
extra convenience to video shooting
thanks to the 40 centimeter long barrel
you can now shoot really close to your
subject but keep yourself and your
camera away this allows you to reach
bugs hidden in bushes or capture lethal
animals with ease macro photography has
never been easier the tiny 2 centimeter
lens tip unlocks endless shooting
possibilities you can now get close to
areas nobody ever has before and shoot
some epic macro photos and video footage
you think this is cool enough think
again in order to bring you an even more
exciting perspective we've made the
front barrel of the Lauer probe
waterproof and dustproof this removes
your last shooting barrier and you can
literally put it anywhere to shoot it's
our job to help remove the limitations
of your shooting and now it's your time
to get the creative juices flowing okay
you may wonder how can I get enough
light to focus in a burrows or in a cave
that's already taken care of an LED ring
light is mounted at the tip of our probe
and you'll find it tremendously useful
and video shooting or for focus
assistance this is not just another lens
with a long tube this is actually a lens
with one of the most complicated optic
designs ever
it houses 27 elements spreading across
the entire barrel to deliver an
exceptional image performance this llama
24 millimeter 14 probe lens is the
world's first consumer grade probe lens
that provides both professional
photographers and videographers with the
completely new perspectives to unleash
the creativity this lens also redefines
macro photography for wildlife
photographers to capture natural wonders
hello Kickstarter my name is Josh and
let me introduce you to the ultimate
lenses this is what it looks like and
this is what you can do with it
this is how the optimal entered works
grab a lens that you own stretch it on
with only one hand now you can take
incredible photos videos and time lapses
through glass without any reflection you
can also put it in Reverse to protect
your camera from the elements widget in
your bag for extra protection or use it
as a lens changing pad outdoors
feast your eyes on the mag box a system
so easy to set up but wait it's that
quick holy Sh
shooting with flashes and traditional
softboxes can eat up a bunch of time
right from the get-go during setup or
when attaching modifiers in between
shots you've done yet our team at mag
Mon wanted to change all that so we
created the mag box the easiest softbox
to set up mount modify and gel period to
make this the most bodacious portable
easy to put together softbox ever we
knew we had to rebuild this system from
the ground up so we started by designing
the easiest way to attach larger
modifiers to smaller hot shoot flashes
it all begins with the mag ring designed
to work perfectly with our mag Shu and
our patented Universal maggrip system it
has never been quicker or easier to
switch a speed light from being on
camera to off-camera just attach and let
go there's nothing to it nothing quite
like it and since we like it so much we
let you do it twice that's right
we designed the mag ring to comfortably
fit two flashes at once side by side
goodbye crazy awkward dual flash bracket
contraptions orb and whatever they're
called Plus thanks to the mag rings
integrated use of the maggrip system
almost any speed light flash you
currently own will fit right in once
they're attached to the mag ring these
puppies are staying put the magnets give
a solid hold and to double down on
security to beefy doors lock them firmly
into place after you've grabbed your
shots just give a quick and easy squeeze
of the latch and you're ready to move on
to your next setup and you can still use
your favorite mag modifiers with the mag
ring change them out on the fly just
like that but the flash is still
attached best of all with the mag rings
ability to dual wield speed lights you
can double the output of your flash
giving you almost the same power as a
studio strobe without having to actually
lug one around it's compact and portable
giving you the ability to create more
dramatic images in more environments
even when working against the brightness
of the Sun take that you big burning
ball of hot plasma there's no question
the mag ring is the simplest easiest and
fastest dual flash system but that's not
all that it is it's also the perfect
support for the world's first magnetic
softbox the mag box takes the classic
softbox design and reimagines it from
the inside out with a brand new
revolutionary framework with magnets all
around the base of the mag box
the magnetic hold is strong there's no
way we'll fall off of the mag ring even
if it's set at a deep angle fighting
harsh winds or is at the center of a tug
of war with the Incredible Hulk when you
want to remove it simply engage the
magnetic field disruptor aka this little
tab on the top of the ring and off it
comes and now for the first time ever in
any umbrella style softbox we created a
way to keep the light source obstruction
free with integrated arms that stay out
of the way no metal bars will block your
light output with this easy to use
completely open and collapsible design
and since you don't have to compensate
for diminished light output you'll find
that your recycle time heat and battery
consumption will all be reduced and to
make this even more magnificent we built
in another never-before-seen feature
gels that snap directly into the softbox
photographers have loved using our rigid
polycarbonate gels so we took that same
technology and designed a new gel shape
to work with the mag box
no more taping gel sheets to the outside
of the diffuser simply throw on one of
our new gels and you've got color from
the inside out and to make the mag box
even easier we've put in a side zipper
so you can reach in and swap gels
without removing your front diffuser
we've always wanted better control over
lights film so our next step was
reimagining how softboxes shaped light
the mag boxes focus diffuser is the
first of its kind acting like a diffuser
grid and a lens combine it gives better
control of light as the microscopic
structure of the focus diffuser
redirects the light in 20 or 40 degree
beam angles causing less spill while
simultaneously increasing the lights
effective output like a fern a lens in
other words the focus diffuser gives you
ultra soft
incredible spill control and increased
effective output all in one beautiful
package but don't worry we also include
a classic fabric diffuser if you want to
kick things old-school and since we'd
never do things the noisy velcro way we
fixed them up with you guessed it
magnets putting a diffuser on your
softbox or switching it out just got
easier and quieter too you can use the
revolutionary mag ring mag box and focus
a fuser system on the stand or you can
take it handheld when it's attached to
our comfortable ergonomic mag shoe
lighting your shoot the magmod way makes
things fast easy awesome
you
