control
you know I
they get to leave
believe me where to take
hi I'm mark from the head I'm the
creator of the pedal plate the first
figure for creation of the federal place
was the issue that I could not use my
road bike this organiser wanted when
commuting to work so therefore we
created the pedal plate the pedal plate
will convert your road bikes pedal for
use with normal shoes and outfits the
pedal place will help you to get more
out of your own life the first step in
development was the creation of this
proof of concept it gave us enough
confidence to team up with a designer
and continue prototype
after several rounds of testing and
improving the prototypes we are now
fully satisfied with the two models the
pedal plate is the only solution that is
light and stylish that is compact and
easy to store that doesn't change the
idle orientation of your pedal and also
and don't have to buy additional police
force you apply the pedal plate by
inserting the film first and then
pushing prospect removing can be done by
simply pulling the rear clip backwards
and lifting it and for high tension
pedals you can use a tool to use if you
own a road bank line to get more out of
it and you want the pedal plate for
adapting your goal bike for commuting to
work or use it your leisure time as
always make use of your bike or leaving
your vehicle and it's placed you in
holidays then you can take a snap so
beat the crowd to it and receive your
pedal place from our first production
run already before summer and by funding
our pedal plate project we can
kick-start our first production run

as a kid I love the fun and freedom of
riding my bike two wheels my own power
and the possibilities for adventure were
unlimited but as I got older I realized
I was riding less and less my wrist neck
and groin hurt or went numb every time I
rode more than a few miles as a doctor
who has reviewed the medical research on
the subject I knew those symptoms can
mean serious trouble
I also knew there had to be a better way
my name is Jim Parker I'm the director
of cruise bike my wife Maria and I
decided to invest in an alternative
healthier bike design we helped start a
new company called cruise bike and for
the past 12 years we've been testing and
improving our various models to make
them faster healthier and more fun in
2013 Maria raced 3,000 miles on a cruise
bike to win the race across America
between us we hold dozens of cycling
records especially in long-distance
events and that's just the two of us
people in the cruise flight tribe have
lost weight gotten in shape traveled the
world and commuted to work and raced
farther and faster than they ever
thought they could now we've focused our
effort into creating a healthy
affordable bike that is all about
freedom years of writing racing and
innovation have led to a simple elegant
new design introducing the cruise bike
t-50 the healthiest most comfortable
most affordable bike ever for your body
from the pain of a traditional bike so
you can ride more get in shape and enjoy
the simple pleasure of a bike ride our
unique front wheel drive design
harnesses the compact drivetrain of the
traditional bicycle it connects your
upper body and core to the cranks so you
can climb and accelerate like you would
on a traditional bike
it delivers a tight turning radius it
also fits on most trainers so you can
exercise indoors it's about the same
length as traditional bikes and all the
components are standard the t-50 won't
cost the discomfort and pain that a
traditional bike can in addition to
being amazingly ergonomic you can share
your t-50 with your taller and shorter
friends thanks to the adjustable front
tube and you can take your t-50 anywhere
since it fits on standard bike racks and
works well with a variety of bags and
trailers making it ideal for bike
packing camping
or a trip to the market the t-50 gives
you freedom you decide what to do with
it
what is a mountain bike for us
crash
stay true

ride with your best friend or not
