crow every day for a gentle exercise and
she's sleeping a lot better now
the bike is so quiet that she can ride
it while watching TV with a simple
squeeze of the handlebar she can use it
as a standing desk when she wants a
break from pedaling I also used a desk
bike a lot it has wheels that make it
super easy to move on my own and once I
sit on the bike the wheels stay locked
in place my dad works from home and
likes to cycle while reading emails the
levers on the chair and desk make it
easy to adjust the bike and desktop to
their height my dad sometimes goes up to
seven or eight and gets a high intensity
workout best of all it's very easy to
assemble one minute is all it took to
set up our whole family loves the desk
bike and we know yours will too
scooter board is this electric hybrid
you ride it like a skateboard but you
have a handle to hold onto you gain more
confidence in your ability to ride it
growing up I always thought
skateboarding was cool and growing up in
San Diego all of my friends skateboarded
I've actually tried to learn how to
skateboard
at least four times in my life it was
just so hard to control and maintain
your balance while on the skateboard and
I felt like other people must have
similar experiences I reached out to our
team of six engineers and they've had
nine years of experience in the electric
vehicle industry for us it was so
obvious that we needed to create a
solution to this problem
so with scooter board people can usually
learn in under five to ten minutes so
that as you are learning you get more
confident about the fact that you can
ride a scooter board
it's a little bit like skateboarding a
little bit like surfing you've got that
same feeling of carving and whipping the
tail around back and forth but now you
feel like you can do a lot more with it
because of that handle you've got that
stability you've got the brake and the
throttle and extra steering control by
pushing it back and forth deck that the
user stands on is aluminum so overall
it's very durable and also lightly
having the front wheel mechanism that's
allows the user to operate it more like
a skateboard I think it gives the user a
much more unique experience that you
couldn't really get on justice gate
board or just a scooter the scooter
board has gone through extensive testing
so it is safe for all of the components
the materials the hardware of the
firmware is all developed in-house
everything really comes together to
create a great riding experience
so what we really love about scooter
board is that it takes all the fun of
skating and interjects it into your
daily lives so you're taking your
scooter board and you're just flying
down the road to go to work to go to the
gym whatever errands you have going on
throughout your date it's extremely
practical because all you have to do is
just unfold it roll with it fold it back
up roll it around like luggage so it's
very portable and it's practical and
it's really fun so we've got a power
mode and we've got a casual mode so on
the power mode you're gonna get faster
acceleration and faster great game so
you know when you're in that power mode
the scooter boardvision is really just
to bring the joy of skateboarding to
everyone imagine getting a whole new
perspective on life from the handlebar
of your weekend ride to the visor of
your everyday drive we're surrounded by
opportunities to capture meaningful
moments that pass by in an instant
moments you'll watch again and again
that's why we developed venture the
world's first wearable four-in-one
livestream camera and you'll actually
use everyday it's adaptable clippable
and durable it easily clips to just
about anything and even has a magnet so
we can attach to any metal surface mount
it to your dash to record your side job
is a rideshare driver flip it to a visor
to record highlights from your commute
or grab great footage from road trips
you can even put venture onto your
handlebars to record your latest
adventure but it does more than cliff
venture has for optional cameras that
you can connect to it connect our
headset camera to record and livestream
your point of view
imagine live-streaming how to prepare
that favorite recipe or connect our
pinhole button camera for that secret
spy mission
and our eye vision camera lets you get
first-person footage of you going just
about anywhere and when the Sun Goes
Down
our night-vision camera gives you
another whole new perspective and the
coolest part about venture is that a
Kinect through its own Wi-Fi network to
your smartphone so you can live stream
straight to Facebook friends from
anywhere in the world no wires no
connecting just you sharing your life
connecting the venture camera to the app
is easy plus it has all the features are
looking for and great optics that shoot
1080p without that fisheye effect too
expandable storage in an adjustable lens
angle it even comes with a built-in four
beam flashlight that can be used while
filming and with the extra battery pack
it can record for a whole day venture is
easy to use and build with
aircraft-grade aluminum so you can
always count on it because you never
know what's around the next corner we're
excited about the potential of this
awesome new camera and we think you

one of America's leading providers of
law enforcement body cameras every year
we deliver thousands to the market this
tough little camera can capture and
share every moment of your life so
please support our campaign today and
help us bring this amazing versatile
typical camera to market venture is the
everyday camera you need to own
electronics are a huge part of everyday
life it's great it can make life so much
easier but if your house is anything
like money you probably about chargers
and other devices everywhere you look my
name is Shawna Tula and this is the
final device fireball is a
patent-pending first of its kind safety
tech gadget it sends in burglar when it
detects temperatures over 64 degrees
Celsius from the surface which is
attached like many other startups final
came from the problem I will see every
day I worked as an electrician for years
I attended a lot of fires caused by
electrical and electronic devices but
was only after an incident of my own
home that got me thinking about
developing the final device so here's
what happened late one night just before
I went to bed the lights began
flickering
I went to check your lectures
in the house to see what is going on and
this is what the switch inside and
malfunction the waters became loose and
became generated a lot of heat these
could have turned out a lot differently
title this got me thinking why is there
no easy to use device that can warm
people with high temperatures are
detected for high risk items around a
home or business the device like vitamin
just makes sense if kids have so many
challenges other devices in their room
fire mode is an extra their safety that
would at the very least give people
particularly parents a piece of life but
at the very best formal is a device that
could save a life a home or a business
final sentence in book to learn when it
detects temperatures over fifty four
degrees Celsius the surface to which it
is attached sometimes when it comes to
safety simplicity is best that's why
this version of vitamin doesn't need any
apps or other downloads to work pull the
battery tap in the back here the film
from the decent base and pressing
against a surface which you want to
monitor while all is powered by a
replaceable 3.what battery with that's
easy once there's a test button which
will also stylus the device it's going
on one wall can protect you your home
and your family with faulty aging
devices
