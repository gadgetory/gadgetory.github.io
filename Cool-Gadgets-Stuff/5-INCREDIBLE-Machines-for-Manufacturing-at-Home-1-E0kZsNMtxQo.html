manufacturing but when it comes to
making durable things in your own shop
there's still no easy way to cut hard
materials as makers and engineers we
need to work with all materials so we
built a machine that could the first
desktop water jet wager works by
combining abrasive particles with the
high-pressure water stream mixture exits
the nozzle cut through the Northeast
it's great for anywhere show because
every material it's compact and contains
and it's digital so you can make precise
cuts that are impossible to make any
other way as an industrial designer I've
used a variety of desktop application
tool but it tend to be very limited by
the durability of the materials you can
use on those machines with its desktop
water jet we can go from design to
component to fitting that component and
testing within a couple of hours that's
an incredibly powerful tool as a jeweler
and an artist with the work I make I
spend a lot of time
hand cutting so right now I'm selling
pieces sort of a almost limited edition
because I can't physically output them
not because I want to be making in a
limited edition laser would allow me to
not only make a lot more but also to
lower the price points that may be
available to a broader audience I think
you know people tend to have their ideas
constrained by their tools and things
they're capable of working with and
having a water jet cutter which has the
ability to cut a broader range of
materials hard materials like steel and
glass will be enabling and make them
think in different ways and have
different things they couldn't build
before the future of manufacturing is in
custom local fabrication people will be
able to make things in our own workshop
that they can use every single day and
will last a lifetime
we've created a unique desktop tool and
we're really looking forward to all the
amazing things that people create with
it
starting a business nowadays is easy
everyone has great ideas but sometimes
it takes a lot of repetitive work to
realize them this is where do bot m1
gets in do bot m1 is an industrial level
robotic arm production platform it's
precise fast and extendable and also
affordable it can be your 3d printer
laser engraver soldering machine or
whatever else you build upon it yes you
can build one do bot m1 has 0.02
millimeters repeatability and 1.5
kilogram payload with these standardized
easy to change heads you can easily turn
this power into productivity like 3d
printing it can print your product with
fluency and details to colors no problem
or use laser to engrave your unfading
masterpiece or do sophisticated
soldering customizing your PCB circuit
board better than a pro besides being
multifunctional doo-bot n1 is also easy
to master and develop doo-bot m1
supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connection
you can connect to multiple arms at once
and control them via our app on PC or
smartphone with a force-sensitive 3d
mouse you can control doo-bot m1 as
precisely as you want no more trying and
guessing on a confusing software with
its hand whole teaching feature you can
input coordinates in the fastest and
most intuitive way
do bottom one is programmable via the
integrated api's you can use official or
self built developing environment or use
this visualized programming interface
making things a lot easier but we don't
stop here do bot m1 is highly extendable
there are no limits to your imagination
on it the maximum reach of do bottom one
is 400 millimeters which is enough for
most of the situations but why don't we
think bigger
when it can actually go further or use a
camera for visual with it's fast and
accurate image recognizing algorithm it
can distinguish colors without making
one mistake do bottom one loves
companions they can work seamlessly
together processing paperwork way faster
than humans could ultimately do bottom
one is built to replace manpower and
production line working day and night
non-stop the built-in mapping and path
planning system provides this excellent
mobility providing inventory management
service in your warehouse with do bottom
one it's no longer a giant business's
privilege to use professional robotic
arms everyone can now benefit from a
cost-effective user-friendly robotic arm
technology so when a new idea hits you
do bot m1 will be ready
hi I'm Barr and I'm Hannah
in 2014 I ran a successful Kickstarter
campaign for the make miss CNC today I'm
super excited introduce you to our new
project Mazza Maslow is a 4 by 8 foot
CNC cutting machine designed to change
the way we build everything from art
projects to house and it's cheap you can
get one now for under $500 math will let
you print the things you can find around
you that are made from wood this could
be anything from furniture to the
world's coolest treehouse to rebuilding
after a natural disaster we want to
create a game-changing tool which allows
people from around the world to
digitally collaborate to make amazing
things we wanted to create a tool which
is cheap easy to use inclusive and
powerful basically we want to help you
build cool
to make that possible we knew we had to
make a machine which work with materials
and their native 4x8 form without taking
up your entire garage or workshop it
needed to be affordable
both the purchase and to ship it had to
be easy to assemble with no soldering no
programming and no fancy tools it needed
to be just as accurate as a person using
power tools Evo and cutting complex
shaped our solutions masa masa uses gear
reduced DC motors with encoders and a
closed-loop feedback system to achieve
high accuracy and high torque modulus
fans only 19 inches out from your garage
or chalk wall leaving plenty of space to
park the car masa comes as an easy to
assemble kit which includes every piece
of hardware you need except for two
bricks two sheets of plywood and three
two by fours we couldn't get those to
fit in the box also if you don't already
own one you'll need to purchase a fixed
base router maslow's can be put together
in a weekend using only a Phillips
screwdriver a pair of pliers and a
handsaw as well connects to your Mac
Windows or Linux computer using a
standard USB port building things
digitally is the future and we believe
it should be for everyone this is an
important technology and we're making
the choice not to patent it all of our
designs PPV layouts firmware and
software are available for free right
now on our website to anyone in the
world when you design something to print
whether it's a kayak a tiny house or
light aircraft we encourage you to do
the same and share your digital files so
anyone can benefit check out our videos
and content below to learn how easy it
is to assemble your kit and to find out
how to turn your digital files into
real-world objects and most importantly
build something amazing
we call mean all certain tightness but
of clothing is still mass-produced we've
created a machine to change that
you
meet literates a desktop digital
knitting machine now you can create your
own garments and accessories and you can
share them online in a digital wardrobe
it's easy to use you can start a design
from scratch using our web design app or
simply load an existing design from the
online library choose the color and
material to suit you and press knit just
to make a few finishing touches and your
design is ready to wear the process of
making a garment has never been so easy
knitter 8 helps you be more efficient
and iterate faster than ever you can use
our standard size template or modify
them to your needs to get to the final
design you can use your own yarn or
choose from our great selection of tried
and tested yarns like wool cotton
acrylic or silk in plenty of different
colors we'll provide you with the right
parameters for each of our yarn which
will allow you to cut time on sampling
and focus on the fun parts designing and
wearing garments
you can knit garment with the same
quality as the clothes you can find in
your favorite store you can also use
your usual designer software simply
import your design into our app and have
it ready to knit in seconds knitter rate
can help you grow your business or even
help you start a new one offering
personalized products to your customers
and shortening lead time by producing
garments locally and on demand there'll
be no need to wait for samples no more
excess stock or waste with knitter rates
you can make garments exactly to your
needs right in your neighborhood so they
don't have to be shipped halfway across
the world knitter eight is not limited
to standard yarn so you can bring your
project to life with knitter eight your
creativity has we've been dreaming of
automation of the 3d printer finally we
developed the 3d printer that will make
our dreams come true
in 3d printers Automation the biggest
obstacle was frequent failures in
printing out 70% of failures in printing
is caused from unstable settlement of
the first layer so in order to solve
this issue we created n self probe
sensors and mesh leveling technique
utilized from this sensor enables the
perfect print out on the first layer by
sensing the smallest curves of the back
open creators cores on unmanned
automation ABC module enables to print
out a limitless plate even in those
times when there is no man to work
around by automatically changing a build
plate that are done used for printout by
itself so there is no need for a man to
change a build place or to remove the
printed objects for next printing
depending on 3d figures either it was
impossible to print out without the
soluble support or we had to split the
models into many consistent perhaps
however in order to utilize the solidus
abort in 3d printing accordingly it
requires quite complication isms that
you might have thought open creators
find parking head damages inch novels
separately and that enables more than a
perfect soluble support for them so any
figures can be printed without problems
also as you put completed figures under
the water and wait for a while will
achieve figures that are just expecting
no matter any figures what will happen
if small productions are possible in a
room for an office
perhaps it will make huge innovations in
manufacturing industry we will need your
help for our challenges thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
