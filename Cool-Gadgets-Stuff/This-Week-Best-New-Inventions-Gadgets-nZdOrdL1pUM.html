there was no witness my my car is all
scratched up a nice I expect my
insurance to cover what do you mean you

happens every three minutes every day
this is why we built a Volvo dash lady
what is good you just backed up into me
music the Baba dash is smart with a
built in chief center that automatically
detects when collision happens you'll
always have the footage you need no I
wasn't on the phone can you prove it
whether your car is on or off the baba
dash is there to protect when paired
with a volvo charger the dad can
automatically record any unexpected
activity when you are away from the car
how do you feel leaving a car alone what
if you could see what's going on in your
car while you're not saying the Baba
dash knows what happened and now so will
you videos can be captured on the Baba
mobile app and upload it to Facebook or
sent via email we spent the past year
taking this from an idea to building our
first prototypes now we need your help
to bring it to life if you care about a
safer and better driving experience back
our project on Kickstarter now thank you
for it more and together we can make
safer and better driving experience for
everyone thank you
kubel revolutionizes the way we teach
coding with the introduction of the tech
time programming language two years ago
Dana and I started a research-based
project to teach children in the age 4
to 10 about basic coding we did this
because we believe programming skills
are essential for kids to acquire to
succeed in the 21st century the result
of this project is Google robot in 2030
fall assists made at that forty seven
percent of all the jobs that we know
today will no longer exist they'll be
taken over by robotics and artificial
intelligence therefore kids need to
learn basic coding skills in order to
work side-by-side with technology the
problem with the way we teach coding
today is that we introduce it too late
and we use to complex tools you're
saying coding out of the screen mounts
of the table according becomes as easy
as being a puzzle game the robot
consistent to pop the hip and the body
it's so intuitive that all you have to
do is to assemble the two and kubel is
ready for action khoobam revolutionizes
the way we teach coding with the
introduction of the tech time
programming language when you use the
tactile calling package children learn
crucial 21st century skills like
collaboration communication critical
thinking and creativity you can also add
the language packets and children will
learn to spell their first words for
every kubo subject packets we provide
learning material with examples and
therefore Google can both be used in
schools and homes schools
time our design philosophy is if you
designed for children you should design
with children that's the reason why
we're both children in every important
design regime it is our dream that every
child will have the opportunity to learn
coding from a very early age when you
support kudal you help us achieve that
dream if you want to support learn more
about Cooper robot project check out our
IndieGoGo campaign page hello everybody
i'm dutch and this is the chameleon
I thru-hike the entire Appalachian Trail
in a hammock and I've never been
satisfied with the various hammocks that
I've camped with over the years so i
decided to engineer design and build
from the ground up what i believe to be
the perfect timing the chameleon the
chameleon will adapt to your environment
and is truly a revolutionary piece of
equipment and will improve the way
people camp forever the atomic can be
used in all seasons while allowing you
the flexibility to adapt your comic
delay in any direction and to enter and
exit either side of the hammock our
patent-pending vision zipper was
specially designed by us for hammocks
the zipper is separable and reversible
so you can either have no bug net to
save weight and close the hammock for a
bug free experience for a touch a vented
top cover that will retain heat inside
the hammock most importantly you can
flip the bug net or top cover over so
you can lay in any direction for the
hammock body we started with our own
fabrics that is known for being light
strong and extremely comfortable with an
inner woven six-way ripstop grids that
was the first for the industry we offer
different options of this fabric to
accommodate a wide range of body weight
and with a large selection of colors so
you can design the perfect climate for
your style the bug net and vents are
made from ultralight no-see-um mesh to
keep the bugs at bay while still
enabling ventilation and visibility the
top cover is made of our lightweight 15
denier argon 90 fibers which is
water-resistant retains heat and comes
in a wide variety of colors there is a
specially designed sense that not only
allows the moisture rust to exhaust but
also gives you a window to the world I
designed the titanium beetle buckle for
the chameleon and it is extremely
adjustable and detachable so you can
pack your wet suspension separately with
this system you can hang two hammocks
side-by-side with a spreader bar using
the same trees and under the same tarp
we are using our own proprietary Dyneema
webbing which is up to thirty percent
lighter than the standard polyester
webbing up
same breaking strength the numerous
d-rings inside and outside the hammock
will allow you to attach storage pockets
p cloth and tie up points that can be
adjusted from inside the hammock on the
outside there are multiple pack books
for securing different lengths under
cloak the chameleon is made by dedicated
craftsmen and is of course made right
here in our Lancaster Pennsylvania
facility smell smell is the strongest of
all senses smell can take you to distant
places or bring out emotion it can fight
lies focus and relax you this is mu do a
smart home fragrance machine Moo do is

capsules so interchangeable you can make
four hundred thousand different sense

different from anything else well you
didn't hear us say it's smart right with
mu do you control center you control
which capsule to use and how to mix them
unbelievably different amounts from the
same capsules can create completely
diverse sense the capsules are very
affordable so you don't have to be
