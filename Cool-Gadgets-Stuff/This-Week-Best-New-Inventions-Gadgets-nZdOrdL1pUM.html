happens when you don't use it do it what
did I do
you just backed into me no one was
recording
I saw your on the phone oh I saw it with
my own eyes
okay well uh nice day
you
what do you mean witnesses know there
there was no witness might my car is all
scratched up tonight I expect my
insurance company what do you mean you
can't help me is this the life people
really lead to know that car accident
happens every three minutes every day
which is why we built a Volvo - you just
backed up into media fit the Vava - is
smart with a built in G sensor that
automatically detects when collisions
happen so you'll always have the footage
you need no I wasn't on the phone can
you prove it
whether your car is on or off the Volvo
- is there to protect when paired with a
Volvo charger the dash can automatically
record any unexpected activity when you
are away from the car how do you feel
leaving a car alone what if you could
see what's going on in your car while
you're not there
the vah vah - knows what happened and
now so will you videos can be captured
on the blah blah - mobile app and
uploaded to Facebook or sent via email
we spent the past year taking this from
an idea to building our first prototypes
now we need your help to bring it to
life if you care about a safer and
better driving experience back our
project on Kickstarter now thank you for
your support and together we can make
safer and better driving experience for
everyone thank you
Kubo revolutionizes the way we teach
coding with the introduction of the tech
time programming language two years ago
Dana and I started a research based
project to teach children in the age 4
to 10 about basic coding we did this
because we believe programming skills
are essential for kids to acquire to
succeed in the 21st century the result
of this project is kubu robot in 2034
it's estimated that 47% of all the jobs
up until today will no longer exist
they'll be taken over by robotics and
artificial intelligence therefore kids
need to learn basic coding skills in
order to work side by side with
technology the problem with the way we
teach coding today is that we introduce
it too late and we use too complex tools
you're taking coding out of the screen
not to the table so coding becomes as
easy as doing a puzzle game the robot
consists of two parts a head and the
body
it's so intuitive that all you have to
do is to assemble the tool and kubal is
ready for action kuba revolutionizes the
way we teach coding with the
introduction of the tech time
programming language when you use the
tactile calling package children learn
crucial 21st century skills like
collaboration communication critical
thinking and creativity you can also add
the language packets and children will
learn to spell their first words for
every Kubo subject packets we provide
learning material with examples and
therefore Google can both be used in
schools and in homes schools preschool
toy
our design philosophy is if you design
for children you should design with the
children that's the reason why we
involve children in every important
design decision it is our dream that
every child will have the opportunity to
learn coding from a very early age when
you support kuru you help us achieve
that dream if you want to support or
learn more about the kuba robot project

hello everybody I'm Dutch and this is
the chameleon
I threw hiked the entire Appalachian
Trail in a hammock and I've never been
satisfied with the various hammocks that
I've camped with over the years so I
decided to engineer design and build
from the ground up what I believe to be
the perfect timing
the chameleon the chameleon will adapt
to your environment and is truly a
revolutionary piece of equipment and
will improve the way people camp forever
this hammock can be used in all seasons
while allowing you the flexibility to
adapt your hammock delay in any
direction and to enter and exit either
side of the hammock our patent-pending
vision zipper was specially designed by
us for hammocks the zipper is separable
and reversible so you can either have no
bug net to save weight and close the
hammock for a bug-free experience or a
touch a vented top cover that will
retain heat inside the hammock most
importantly you can flip the bug net or
top cover over so you can lay in any
direction for the hammock body we
started with our own fabric that is
known for being light strong and
extremely comfortable with an inner
woven six-way rip stop grid that was the
first for the industry we offer
different options of this fabric to
accommodate a wide range of body weights
and with a large selection of colors so
you can design the perfect hammock for
your style the bug net invents are made
from ultralight no-see-um mesh to keep
the bugs at bay while still enabling
ventilation and visibility the top cover
is made of our lightweight 15 denier
argon 90 fabric which is water-resistant
retains heat and comes in a wide variety
of colors there is a specially designed
vent that not only allows the moisture
of your breath to exhaust but also gives
you a window to the world
I designed the titanium beetle buckle
for the chameleon and it is extremely
adjustable and detachable so you can
pack your wet suspension separately with
this system you can hang two hammocks
side by side with a spreader bar using
the same trees and under the same tarp
we're using our own proprietary Dyneema
webbing which is up to 30% lighter than
the standard polyester webbing of the
same braking strength
the numerous d-rings inside and outside
the hammock will allow you to attach
storage pockets peak lofts and tile
points that can be adjusted from inside
the hammock on the outside there are
multiple pack hooks for securing
different lengths under quilts the
chameleon is made by dedicated craftsmen
and is of course made right here in our
Lancaster Pennsylvania facility smell
smell is the strongest of all senses
smell can take you to distant places or
bring out emotion it can vitalize focus
and relax you this is mu du a smart home
fragrance machine voodoo is smell
it holds four interchangeable capsules
so interchangeable you can make 400,000
different sense with it
you don't need a count how is it
different from anything else well you
didn't hear us say it's smart right with
mu do you control the center you control
which capsules to use and how to mix
them unbelievably different amounts from
the same capsules can create completely
diverse sets the capsules are very
affordable so you don't have to be
scared to play around with them you like
lavender huh oh and you don't if you
don't trust your nose you can use one of
our pre-made cents they were crafted by
a leading French perfumer to create
unique and diverse atmospheres for your
home with a quick tap on your phone
Moodle can turn your home into a log
cabin in the winter or an ocean facing
Terrace

and share it Ludo is created by a GaN
aroma that's us and we are so prolific
in the world of sense but there's
probably a little of us in every product

product and we wanted to get it out with
the help of the community we need your
support and feedback support moudou and
help bring the power of smell into your
home Ludo</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
