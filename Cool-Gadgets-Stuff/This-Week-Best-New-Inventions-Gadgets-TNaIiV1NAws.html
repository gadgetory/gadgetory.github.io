health and kill bacteria given that oil

systemic diseases we want to bring this
light therapy to your tooth brushing
routine Bristol uses safe and natural
blue light which is proven to kill
bacteria that causes gingivitis and
other gum diseases the same blue light

rather than a one-time teeth whitener
Bristol breaks down color day by day for
long-term wine natural red light is
known for healing anti-aging and
collagen promotion Bristol brings this
light therapy to your brushing routine

to make this become a reality what if I
said choose a table that will last you
for the rest of your life of course how
you're going to predict what kind of
table you need and say 10 years time
that's what I wanted I'm an architect
and I thought maybe I can design
something introducing table it's a new
take on a concept I love bring your own
flat surface and attach the table legs
and in minutes you'll have your new
custom piece of furniture all you need
for assemble is the included allen key
place your tabletop on the floor and
slide in the legs tighten the three
bolts of her leg to fasten the most
rigid plan ever on the modular table
weight stand it up and that's it table
is designed to give you the most
flexibility possible here's how first
and foremost table is super sturdy the
unique clamp mechanism is CNC machined
from a solid piece of brass giving you
an incredibly rigid connection three
adjustment screws below are designed to
spread the load and account for any
misalignment in the surface this clamp
will never come loose or wobbly and it's
safe from tampering
there's no bracing or additional fixing
so you can configure table in almost any
way to suit your chosen tabletop you can
use any number of legs and clamp them to
any edge of the surface not just the
corners and this means that your
tabletop doesn't need to be a rectangle
say hello circles triangles weird blobs
or even very long tables that use more
than just four legs for support design
is modular allowing you to change the
height of your legs in the future
the wooden portion will come in three
Heights coffee table table or desk and
counter height and will offer upsize or
downsize kits online and modular means
repairable we'll have a full suite of
spare parts on hand to get you back up
and running in no time if your legs get
somehow damaged the clamp accepts a wide
range of tabletop thicknesses between 19
millimeters three-quarter inch 45
millimeters one and three-quarter inches
with a weight capacity of up to 60
kilogram 140 pounds you're not limited
to light flimsy tabletops your solid
wood stone plywood or upcycle reclaimed
materials to create any more cube table
is durable and repairable so it will
never fail you it's modular and
adaptable so it will always be useful
it's a clean minimal design made from
authentic raw materials that will always
look great in your home or office
in the 50s the basic t-shirt Rosa iconic
Heights becoming one of the most
timeless fashion garments in the world
with while technology is all around us
the t-shirt is still made in the same
old-school way
unprotected cotton gets dirty and smelly
easily we want to create clothing that
is made for an action-packed life if
great signal it is all around us why not
use it to make t-shirts that repel
stains smell and body odor at left first
we create garments engineered to last a
lifetime we use seven unique treatments
to create the most advanced garments in
Europe developed in Switzerland produced
in Portugal and designed right here next
up our journey started last year when
our dress shirt became the most Beck's
Dutch smashing project in kickstarter
history since then we quit our jobs and
went all-in on sourcing the grayness
couple technologies with a mission to
make life as easy as possible without
compromising on the quality and design
it took us one year to get a t-shirt
right but we're finally ready the
outside repels liquid
at the same time the inside absorbs
fluids and wicks away moisture so your
sweat evaporates through the fabric we
also added silver particles to the yarn
so that bacteria is killed before it
turns into barrio de our mill in
Portugal only uses one hundred percent
soft long staple cotton and together
with our designer we use data from sixty
seven thousand men to design the perfect
fit to us it represents the perfect
marriage between style and performance
be free to buy as fast as you want
without worrying about body odor present
big plans to your tune without worrying
about sweat stains visible sweat stains
