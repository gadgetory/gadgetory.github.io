you
the virtual world stretches the
boundaries of our own reality one of the
limits we face when entering this world
is movement we wanted the experience to
feel as real as possible so we created
cyber shoes
cyber shoes bring your feet back into
the game letting you navigate your games
using your feet rather than your hands
running from the comfort of your own
chair lets you keep your normal seated
position but opens up a more natural way
to trek the paths of your favorite games
we managed to keep the design as simple
as possible while integrating insight
tracking with analog movement detection
the shoes keep their own orientation you
can run walk sneak and jump using the
shoes giving you the most accuracy in
navigating a game ever
we have been through countless designs
trying to make it right but now we have
a product that runs more stable than the
VR system itself slip on another pair of
shoes and sign into the game the seated
position makes multiplayer in VR feel
like there are no walls in the room at
all cyber shoes are one size fits all
slip on over your regular shoes and
secure to your feet with bindings just
like a snowboard to ensure that the game
picks up exactly what your feet are
doing at all times controller so now
it's playable with all the games that
are already featuring some movement
there's big virtual reality out there
and you can't walk it I'm an early
adopter of VR and they love the
possibilities it offers but I was so
disappointed when I realized that I
could not take more than a few steps
before hitting a ball that's why we have
developed cyber shoes to give you the
access to the virtual world as it is
unlimited check out our crowdfunding
page and learn more about
technology our brand and how these shoes
will change the way you play games
forever cyber shoes step into the
virtual world introducing zip top
containers the world's first 100%
platinum silicone reusable he double
dishwasher balls if Abul containers are
they perfect no but yes they are perfect
with five patents pending the zip top
was designed with the environment in
mind one zip top can replace over five
thousand plastic baggies which could say
that who knows how many fish it also
might save some sharks too but for a
container that doesn't need a lid it is
worth the risk
and unlike baggies the zip top
containers are tough heat cold cars even
kids can't destroy and they will try
they will always try but you'll rest
easy knowing that the zip top can take
whatever you throw at or in it need the
store scalding hot soup this laughs in
the faces
this makes soup feel bad about itself
look at it stand upright your liquids
are secure now see if you're worrying
for the Sharks
plus it's easy to get excess air out of
zip top containers which will keep your
food fresher long
tip top is freezer safe microwave-safe
and even oven safe if it were any safer
we'd be calling it Mister Rogers
neighborhood when you're done just toss
them in the dishwasher
the zip tops are fine
easy and because it's 100% platinum
silicone it won't lead to harmful
chemicals like plastics can but maybe
you're saying hey I like leached
chemicals in my food this product is not
for you
also please see a doctor and if storing
your food perfectly wasn't enough zip
tops are great for taking meals or
snacks on the go with eight different
shapes and sizes zip top containers can
be used anywhere even your car's cup
holder they're great for more than just
holding food to get weird with it we
won't judge we love you need proof
exhibit a thanks honey that's my
sandwich last of the butter less it's
time to leave the outdated options
behind save the planet and save yourself
with zip top containers get yours today
