break-in Haven is 10 times stronger than
your deadbolt and is the next
advancement in home security
70% of home break-ins are through a door
criminals can easily break through or
use accessible tools for home entry but
with Haven you'll be safe a barrier reg
Rises and uses the foundation of the
home to firmly secure the lock in place
it was created using military technology
tested to last 25 years and it's made
right here in the US Haven is 10 times
stronger than your dead bolt with Haven
will keep you safe
each year one in every 50 homes gets
broken into that's about one per block
the most burglars did not target
occupied houses they would rather break
into a home that looks empty and have
less risk of get caught
well now there's an easy way to make
your home true signs of life a year away
it's a new burglar deterrent called fake
TV fake TV uses LED lights to make
exactly the sort of line of television
produces from outside it looks like
someone must be home watching television
so while you're away make TV makes your
home look occupied this makes your home
a less appealing target for a break-in
make TV costs a lot less than an alarm
system and fake TV is a lot more
convincing than a lamp on the title
you do not want to be one of the
households that experiences a burglary
so don't let your home look like an easy
target for burglars buy a fake TV
protect your home your possessions and
your peace of mind order today
most people want to see what's going on
around their property but they honestly
don't want to do the wiring and all the
hassle and everything it takes to
actually put up cameras
like hem requires no drilling no wires
no hassle you just plug it in turn it on
and it works we design like him to be
the most versatile and affordable camera
for your house your camera is HD its
infrared so it can see in the dark
so first of all if you have a taller
structure if you have a shorter one you
can actually telescope it up and down
when you pick your viewing angle it'll
actually rotate side to side depending
on where you'll actually want to see
your actual lens comes out so you can
aim your camera down if you have a
vertical sconce you can actually go
ahead and switch that so you can get the
viewing angle you want this telescoping
lens actually can connect up with the
glass of your enclosure what that means
is you're not going to have glare or any
of the blinding kind of like hey the
infrareds bouncing off the glass or the
light is bouncing off the glass I can't
see anything at night it's got motion
activation so if you have visitors
you're gonna know about it
it has 2-way voice on it you're gonna be
able to adjust the colors light cam is
designed with high-end Cobb LEDs so your
lights should last you know 15 to 20
years
I mean we've spent basically two years
perfecting every piece we could to make
sure that it work in as many different
situations as possible the connected
alarm panel is a perfect solution for
DIY home security because you can
convert your existing wired alarm system
sensors into your home automation
applications and there are never any
required monthly fees or contracts my
name is nate Clark and I created
connected all the big tech companies
they're really missing out because
they're wanting you to buy all new
systems all new sensors all new wireless
devices but they aren't really
addressing all the homes out there that
are pre-wired for alarm systems and have
been since
1980s the connected alarm panel is a
drop-in replacement for your existing
alarm panel but it reuses the wiring
that's already in your home to connect
all of your wired alarm system sensors
to the cloud so now you can convert your
home into a smart home with one piece of
hardware at a much lower cost than
buying all new sensors now with my smart
things alarm system setup I don't have
to worry about arming and disarming the
system because you always carry your
phone with you your phone acts as a
present sensor so we just leave the
house and the system is armed and by the
time we come home the system is disarmed
best usability ever my daughter even has
a key fob an arrival sensor so it allows
her to come home and disarm the system
if the door opens or there's motion
detected or the smoke alarm goes off
I'll get notified right away with other
third-party integrations with
professional monitoring service you can
even notify the police if there's
breaking in your home the connected
alarm panel is easy to install and you
can do it all yourself disconnect those
wires remove the existing alarm panel
from your wall and then connect them to
be connected alarm panel then open up
your app configure it and you'll have an
internet-connected smart home you can
configure notifications when somebody
comes home or when the door is open you
can replace your keypads with tablets or
our displays you can even enable a good
night routine to turn off all the lights
in the house and arm the security system
in stay mode with one button push or one
automation one of the advantages of a
smart home is that there are thousands
of devices that are compatible with
these smart home frameworks so now you
can augment your security system with
cameras water leak sensors Alexa voice
control
one in two will experience a burglary
during their lifetime so let's see what
people do in order to prevent burglaries
cameras well that's a perfect way to
ruin your dinner if this ever happens to
you remember to keep an eye on your wine
dogs sure talks are great but they're
much too cute to leave behind the next
door neighbor you say because he always
does such a great job of looking after
your plants did time switch nowadays
refer to as the smart bulb well it's a
step into the right direction except
that burglars don't only break in when
it's dark outside come on is that
burglars are afraid of confrontation so
presence is key that's why we came up
with Karen the combination of light
effects and sound make it look like
someone's home
how tall voices are the most effective
way to simulate the presence of
residents and deter burglars especially
during the day kevin has a light
intensity sensor and knows when to
switch on the lights and when to save
power the random simulation is based on
multiple factors such as region language
weather environment and more leaving
home in a rush Kevin senses that you've
left and activates himself of course you
can control Kevin from anywhere and yes
when you're at home Karen is there for
you too I make sure the product works
for everyone you can use the app on the
phone or the grandma friendly buttons on
the device itself
Kevin is really easy to live
