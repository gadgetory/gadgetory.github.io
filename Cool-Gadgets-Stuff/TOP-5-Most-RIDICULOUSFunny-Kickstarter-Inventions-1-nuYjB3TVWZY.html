Facebook friends you have and the
elegance of your selfies determines the
quality of your mate in this type of
environment it has become important to
own really sexy technology meet Paul
Paul is the sexiest smartphone charger
on the planet hi I'm Justin father of

technology to do more than just
represent my sexuality I want my
technology to literally be sexy
this versatile design object doubles as
a beautiful piece of classical art it is
a fantastic conversation object and can
inspire creativity in the workplace Paul
is more than just a fun way to charge
your smartphone this project is about
exploring mobile technologies effect on
human sexuality I need your help to move
past the prototype phase and to be the
first small production line of all I'm
really excited about this project and I
know that Paul will love it in your
adopt up all of your own by backing this
project today thanks Victor
hi my name is Travis Peterson and my
brother Nick Peterson who is the camera
guy and I have been working tirelessly
on what we felt would revolutionize the
world we have spent over two years
working on this product trying to find
the manufacturer who can build it
correctly we want to make sure that the
lines were right we want to make sure
that the weight was correct but the feel
you could just feel this in your hand
and it would just feel something
important to you you're in South America
and we met the very person who made this
ink ink that wasn't just black but
actually your eye you don't even detect
it but your eye will actually feel the
importance of what this means to you
even the binding itself this two hours
of handcrafted machining that mattered
to us it doesn't crack it doesn't break
and here it is I'd like to present it to
you it is called the joker birthday card
and when your friend opens this car
and when they push play on the card you
can hear that music if you can even call
it music it will go not just once not
just twice but you will hear it
looping and looping forever and even if
your friend closes the card it continues
to loop and loop and loop we didn't want
to give him just something that they
could actually flows in the music would
stop we thought that was cliche we
thought it has already been done a
million times before ever you can get
that card anywhere but this card
continues to play you can hear it
continues to play and this very annoying
sound will go on for upwards of three
hours and the only way to stop it is to
maybe stomp on it a few times grab a
hammer and slam it I haven't tried
testing burning it yet but you can
probably burn it as well
we need your help to bring this card to
market we know it is something that
we've been working on for a couple years
now that is important it's something
that we want you to participate in
because we also know that it is
something that you can use in your life
something that we all need something
that does make us in our lives a little
bit better but most importantly we
really want to make something that is a
gift for you and really the gift that
keeps on giving</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
