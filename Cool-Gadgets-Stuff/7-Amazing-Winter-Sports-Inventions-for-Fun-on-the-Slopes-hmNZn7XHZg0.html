fiberglass reinforcement material
they've got metal ski edges for quick
stopping a heel break for slowing down
adjustable bindings to attach to any
shoe and best of all one size fits all
so many people are excited about this
new winter sport it's going to take the
world by storm
some even assume it'll be the next
Olympic sport
introducing sled legs the first wearable
sled product for your legs the simplest
way to have fun on any Hill
this isn't your granddad sled sled legs
combined for easy using a sled in the
control of skis without all the
equipment to carry fun can be simple
again just grab your sled legs and find
a hit the founders of sled legs are
really just kids at heart simple fun
drove this invention with a desire to
break away from the daily grind the
founders started experimenting with new
ways to have fun in the snow sled legs
is born out of necessity necessity to
have fun without paying a fortune for
lift tickets in gear necessity to have
fun when you're short on time necessity
did have fun with your kids it's a local
sledding yard we took our favorite
childhood pastime and amped it up a few
notches
what got me excited about the trail
board was the potential to start
snowboarding again
snowboarding is largely reserved for the
people who can't afford to snowboard or
who can take the time to learn it and I
think that becomes a pretty exclusive
group and for me the idea that you can
snowboard while you're winter hiking
changes the game I bet you there's a lot
of people out there who have thought
wouldn't it be awesome to have a
snowboard when you're just kind of out
and you stumble across a place that's
perfect for it when we realized that
snowboards were not designed to be
brought on a hike we saw that as a
design opportunity where we could create
a board that was specifically meant for
bringing along your first going in
knowing that this is going to be a
journey for you and at the end of the
day when you complete it and find advice
it's just going to be the most rewarding
experience
we wanted to make a seamless experience
where you're going walking to riding to
walking just kind of flow most
importantly we wanted to have control
and the field of snowboarding so the
real design challenge became how do you
take away bindings but still have that
same level of control the bindings give
you what makes the trail work the most
unique is its u-shaped contour which
allows the rider to use any boot they
want to and fit within the contour of
the board by doing that you have
leverage over your toe and your heel the
same way that you would in a snowboard
we knew if people had control over the
board they can stop when they need to
sue make that sharp turns when they need
to that's when people are gonna be the
safest I live near a major city and I
feel like a lot of people who live in
these large cities want to do something
outdoors and I think this is another
option that we can give people that's
not going to cost them a lot of money
that's not going to take a ton of
planning you know you just kind of go
out there bring it and make it
it's just so much more convenient than
planning a day to the resort buying a
ticket riding a left waving your life
like you can also look at it as a
vehicle as a mode of transportation if
you can save a little bit of energy and
a little bit of time and have more fun
while you're doing it that's just such a
win so I see the trail board is
something that is for people who have
snowboarded but also for people that
just enjoy being outside and trying
something new
anyone who is open to the idea of being
able to have fun in the snow you know
being able to go outside and utilize the
snow now does something that is
inhibiting and this coal that keeps you
inside but is something that is there to
enjoy
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
