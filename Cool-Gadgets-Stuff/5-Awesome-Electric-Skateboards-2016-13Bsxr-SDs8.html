hours commuting at L wing we believe
commuting should be the fun and easy
part of the day we're proud to announce
the world's most compact electric
skateboard all we found on the market
were electric long boards electric long
boards are super fun but they're heavy
and they're expensive
I got a mechanical engineering back one
and I always fancy to make new stuff for
example new boards new motorcycles new
skateboards so this is why we decided to
create the air wing board the in wheel
motor is very powerful you can go up to
18 miles per hour
and you can ride seven miles in a single
charge the sensation you have a
phenomenal this board is actually for
everyone from the beginner to the expert
level so it's super easy to run it you
will expect a lot more weight it's cool
I like it
yeah it's freaking awesome say I thought
it was pretty cool moving pretty fast
it's easy here and in the break I'm
pulling love the part that you can hit
it with speed let go that's completely
any freewheel off I can give it a little
go and then let it go
voter was nice it was nice with the big
wheels on it down the ride this it's
exactly what I'm looking for
blink Oh tutorial a skateboard with
lights this is a tutorial for that
there's a box okay
all right inside the box there's foam oh
and a skateboard it's good and also some
other stuff cool you get a remote strap
a charge on a skate tool
okay there's an app all right get that
from the app store
make sure your board is turned on and
then you just press that button in the
middle click on your board then pairs of
pairs okay it's paired and then you just
like check whether you want to do
beginner pro or normal or you know
figure out some challenges and follow
your routes take some pictures figure
out your distance and where you've been
all right I'm using the throttle don't
push too fast don't don't force it just
relax yeah and then you get like a nice
sort of easy start get used to it
pull back for braking not too hard oh
yeah yeah safety first
you should should really always wear a
helmet just just put it on make sure
it's strapped on ah yeah like all the
time
all right how to ride oh yeah don't lean
back don't stand up normally just like
one spread your feet out and then
forward
and slowly apply throb
you
okay there's there's a strap oh yeah
yeah just wrap it around just casual
doesn't have to be perfect throw it over
your shoulder and go well so yeah have
fun we wanted to set ourselves apart we
wanted something to compete with the
market without breaking the wallet
something you can get on to go down and
to go up to get from point A to point B
we wanted to go against the grain and
push the limits to get to work to get to
school and back home we wanted something
you can hop on and never want to get off
something you can feel something you can
love we want it to go fast and we want
it to go far we didn't just want to make
another product we wanted to enhance the
way we live and change the way we travel
forever
and we wanted to do this for everyone
this is why we built electric long
boards
hi I'm Levi and when I was in college
someone flew past me on an electric line
board I instantly fell in love all these
boards were out of my price range and
there had to be a better solution but no
one was doing it this is why I started
electric longboard
the board is awesome this board goes 20
miles per hour is an 80 mile range and
only weighs in at 13 pounds the board
uses a 33 inch Canadian maple deck and
also features regenerative braking which
is pretty cool because as you brake the
charge of the board so you can even
extend your range
you
the unborn is the world's smallest
licensed electric skateboard it was
designed to be an ideal complement to
public transport systems in major cities
and urban areas and we're looking to
change the way people move
hi my name is Tony I'm in nursery
designer 5 with our mechanical engineer
and I'm Michele and I guess I'm a
hustler and we are out boss team two
years ago we came together to find a
solution to the last mile problem in our
home country Singapore and has been an
amazing journey developing and refining
the design of the art board with the
help of our local community five months
ago we launched our pre-production
selves our local waters in Singapore the
intention of the pre-production box or
to get up is back on both hardware and
software so we could quickly iterate and
make improvements to the artwork through
this process the unborn has become a
much better product than we could have
the chief on our own
the unbought is based on the 22 team
Skidmore format and raised in a tree and
1/2 kg it is light and compact enough to
be the perfect last mile solution
it also has enough power to take the
average person up to 18 kilometres and
goes up to a speed of 25 pigs an hour
having enough range to take you from the
train station and back and still be
powerful enough to give you a trail of a
right pill grid is also at 15% which
would be enough to take a most arranged
in any other gear
