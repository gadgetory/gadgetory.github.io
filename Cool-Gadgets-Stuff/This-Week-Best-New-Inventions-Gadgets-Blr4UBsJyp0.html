two about tools this year we've step it
up once again to make the ordinary
extraordinary sleek versatile and highly
portable allow us to introduce the one
tool to rule them all the spinner drive
you can add all the bells and whistles
to a screwdriver but at the end of the
day it all comes down to two things grip
and bits
featuring magnetic fast swapping
mechanism the bits can be exchanged in a
matter of seconds attaching the spinning
wheel instantly allows extra torque to
be generated the contact surface is also
increased providing better control and
more efficient screw fascinating
sometimes the smallest changes can make
a world of difference
traditional screwdrivers are
one-dimensional tools that only solve
one problem at a time with the spinner
drive you're able to do more with less
with also inserted a set of ball bearing
in the compact body of the spinner Drive
providing buttery smooth rotation to
cope with delicate small parts and
making fine adjustments with the tough
addition you'll be getting titanium
nitride coated bits for improved
hardness and better rust and corrosion
resistance the spinner Drive is really
one for all all for one
ever wonder how clean your floors really
are you've tried the old-school broom
the not so handy mop maybe even a robot
vacuum that promises a lot but delivers
too little introducing narwall the
world's first self-cleaning robot vacuum
and mop with the most advanced
navigation first off
Narwhal takes care of vacuuming up
pretty much anything off your floors but
the magic actually starts with the
mopping other robot cleaners that claim
to mop only sweep the floor a narwhal
has reinvented the mop it has rounded
triangular mops that press down on the
floor and rotate to really clean away
those stubborn stains narwhal mops
cleaned three times as efficiently
versus other robot cleaners other robot
cleaners clean the floor and then you
have to clean them it defeats the
purpose if you asked me Narwhal is
totally self clean it automatically
returns to the base station to clean
wash and dry itself multiple times
during mopping and when the mopping is
done Narwhal keeps the mop dry and clean
with its ventilation system most robot
cleaners require remapping every time
you use them but narwhals home layout
map can be used repeatedly once created
the map is created with the help of
lidar technology you know what they use
in driverless cars Narwhal also avoids
secondary contamination by making sure
it doesn't pass over the spaces it's
already modeled you can even customize
its cleaning strategy for different
rooms and floors like choosing which
rooms to clean in which order how many
times to clean the type of floor and it
creates cleaning reports for you after
it's done cleaning Narwhal is also ultra
quiet you'll almost forget it's there
with it's awesome sweeping vacuuming and
mopping tech Narwhal will make you wish
you'd found it sooner
our wall is built by a dedicated team of
engineers and visionaries I got the idea
to build Narwhal
when I saw my mom struggling with
mopping housework every day so I decided
to build a robot to help her and
everyone in the world we hope you can
support us this is the last one it's the
world's first reusable cotton swab it's
sanitary and easy to clean with a dab of
soap
it comes in two models one pattern
cleaning and another design for touches
last swap can be used thousands of times
the materials are soft and flexible the
rubber gently removes dirt grease and
makeup traditional cut buds and other
single-use plastics will be banned in
the coming years these common bathroom
optics are often flushed down a toilet
and our serious source of marine
pollution we use 1.5 billion cotton buds
every day it's time to switch to the
last swap last swap comes with a carry
case so you can take it on vacation you
can also use it at work or you could
bring it on a date
and it comes in different colors so you
know which one is yours and which one is
theirs thanks for watching thanks for
switching to last
last year we created a new category of
shoes the all-terrain sneaker mesh of a
comfy urban shoe and a rugged technical
outdoor boot this year it's gonna get
way more comfortable for the city
and way more comfortable for the
outdoors
this is Canyon the next step in our
evolution
it's five times more durable so you can
trust it on any terrain which makes it
even more water friendly it dries even
faster with new drainage holes and a new
patent and treatment by curve when you
round the mountains you'll appreciate
that we've upgraded our souls to be
three times more slip resistant so you
can trust your intuition
we've invented sprint laces it looks
like regular laces both the tighter
staying elastic
our shoes are still ultralights
with a new upgraded slip-on design we've
created that holds your foot firmly
without compromising work so you can
feel free to move around and in water
when you're in the city you'll love that
Canyon is even more breathable wearing
it with or without socks
and now it's also impact-absorbing with
our unique dual cushion construction
cannon is sustainable vegan friendly and
made ethically it's a shoe for City
