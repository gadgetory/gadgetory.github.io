again I'm excited to bring a new
campaign to you first one we did was our
Kodiak the survival paracord bracelet
the second one was the fighter beating
of the fire-starting carabiner and now
we want to introduce the newest addition
to our adventure and survival gear that
Phoenix talent
so Doug explained that when he's out on
a hunt he wanted to have a survival tool
integrated into his knife right a knife
yeah Doug I can't assign you a knife yes
I went to work in a year and a half
later Here I am
we got prototypes made got the prototype
over Doug
he went out hunting and camping with it
but he really liked that big hole for
for gripping on either side there we
also made the proper CG so it's
well-balanced doesn't feel like it's
tilting forward or going back the handle
is g10 handle and then also you're able
to take the handle apart pull the handle
off for cleaning and also there's a
pocket in here that you can put survival
gear whether it be a fishing hug or some
tinder quick or other blades every
hunter loves got hook right when they
need that gut hook except for them every
hunter hates sharpening that gut hook we
were able to take that gut hook and now
make it replaceable so once it's used
you can just take it off put a new one
on there I was taking him out nearing
course once and one thing that always
stuck with me was when you're creating
fire that too was one and one is none
you always want to have at least two
mechanisms of creating fire and because
of that I integrated our ever spark will
into the handle of the of the knife
we're gonna put it right there on the
top in the back right here
pretty you stay warm be seen and be
found to complement the Phoenix Talon
that we've come up with the phoenix
feather we've also designed a Kydex
sheath to come with this it's nice its
durable its lightweight it houses both
knives you can take it apart we've also
integrated a little emergency whistle
pretty loud and then the the top comes
off you know have a tender quick in
there as well
the Kydex sheath also has a sharping
plate so if you need to do any field
sharpening there it is for you it really
simple so with the Phoenix Talon and
phoenix feather we feel like it rounds
out that catalog complements the fire
beaner and the cody x500 bracelet we're
excited to bring it here we've it's been
over a year and a half in development
we're looking for your help to support
this campaign we need to complete our
final round of tooling and also that
that first production run so you can
explore with confidence thanks we are go
son and we believe the son can and will
power the future solar powered
technology has become more popular and
affordable than ever but we are still
burning fuel to cook it's time to
upgrade your kitchen with the gosun
fusion more than a solar oven the fusion
stands on its own as a complete cooking
solution it's portable yet large enough
to feed a family and can even cook with
the Sun at night thanks to an integrated
electric heating element that cooks
using a fraction of the energy of other
electric stoves it uses about the same
power as your computer but cooks a full
meal for five in under an hour if you
don't have sunshine all it takes is the
push of a button to activate the hundred
and fifty watt heater with the optional
lithium ion power bank you can easily
carry enough energy to cook a meal
anytime anywhere with the solar PV
upgrade the electricity used to charge
the power bank can be made from the Sun
so you're cooking on sunshine day or
night safe to touch even when cooking
above 400 degrees Fahrenheit the gosun
fusion can bake boil or fry many dishes
in as little as twenty minutes
the gosun fusion is a deliberate
evolution of our original stoves durable
and reliable bringing together the best
of solar and electric heating into an
experience we believe is totally
game-changing gosun has been making
waves and outdoor cooking thanks to
breakthrough vacuum-insulated technology
you won't go hungry and you're never out
of gas our stoves are being used by more
than 25 thousand happy customers we've
created a full lineup of solar ovens
large and small but everyone has been
asking for a larger oven with the
ability to cook at night after four
years of development it's finally here
we're excited to introduce our hybrid
fusion here on Kickstarter where gosun
began with the help of this community go
Sun fusion lets you do the cooking at a
fraction of the power and a fraction of
the fuss giving you the freedom to do
the things you love to feed those you
care for
and to cook off-grid without gas gosun
welcomes you to the fuel free frontier

portable with a bottle cap that you can
easily use with any plastic bottle fill

environmental problem we are sick and
tired of seeing countryside speckled
with paper another trash with cool
Oakland you can forget about toilet
paper and wipes forever and specially
there is nothing better than water to

multiple prototypes over the past year

hey Kickstarter's it's your friend Mike
here with my third Kickstarter and have
we got something you're gonna want I'd
rather be outdoors than just about
anywhere and when I am outdoors a
five-gallon bucket is more useful than
just about anything whether you're
fishing racing beaching riding or
tailgating but is anything a bigger pain
in the butt to carry when you're out
here introducing the mule 5-gallon rut
bucket
one Sunday afternoon
nothing was biting so I put pack straps
on a bucket just to see if it would work
and man did it work
soon all my buddies wanted one and they
realized I wasn't as dumb as they
thought because it turns out a rock
bucket is the world's toughest backpack
it's literally three backpacks in one
the rock bucket is a crush proof
backpack that keeps your gear from
getting mangled you can even sit on it
after a long day of fishing it's also a
waterproof river bag and not only that
it acts as a giant beer koozie to keep
your iced beverages colder than my
landlords heart only ruck bucket keeps
your valuable gear bone-dry only ruck
bucket protects your gear from high
impacts only ruck bucket keeps your
beverages ice-cold and offers you no
better place to sit when you're outdoors
and even better anybody can get a ruck
bucket without spending stupid amounts
of money it's a pack it's not a car
payment and it doesn't have any of those
goofy features like overpriced fancy
packs just stuff that normal people need
and tougher than a bulldog of horns
listen you'll love how simple this pack
is it's a slick solution that makes the
outdoors even more fun than it already
is
without hauling three separate packs
around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
