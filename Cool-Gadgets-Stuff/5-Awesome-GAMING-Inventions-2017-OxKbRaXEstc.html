what are you doing
oh dude dude that is so cool I've never
felt anything like this before feels
like liquid I can feel the apparent
roundness of it it's actually a pretty
precise you can feel like each of his
little legs my hand finger tickle to cry
there's a dragon oh he's burning my hand
that's the same that's cool how does it
get warm seriously that's amazing
it's creepy looks very cool wow that's
so awesome
I mean it
dear me cried find such is pretty
inspirational that was good stuff
you
it's basically a very compact PC to play
games on it's a really nice concept it's
very different it's it's a good idea and
I don't like that there's huge amount of
games and you can play games like back
from nineteen nineties up to the newest
triple-a game laptop we still it's still
pretty heavy you need a separate bag and
this you can just put in your rucksack
you can plug in a mouse and keyboard to
it with a USB hub it's really nice yeah
I liked it really much and look very
promising it seems rather powerful it's
really a promising solution for mobile
gaming with the real PC experience using
steam you can just take your safe games
with you and play along
hi I'm Nick I'm the founder of those
awesome guys and a developer on move or
Die is basically a portable steam box
which is an amazing
yes Lesley it looks like a really
interesting product and should that
maybe have a looking into it I think
it's nice for game developers to have
this because you get try to build let
them it for PC ripping it out them you
have all the power in the PC in your
hand
virtual reality has already taken us far
beyond what can be achieved with
traditional screens and controllers but
has the potential to be so much more
immersive we want to directly connect
you with the objects that you interact
with in the virtual world so we're
building Athena a VR rifle controller hi
I'm Sebastian co-founder of ilium VR
Athena is the end result of an extensive
development process incorporating
lessons we learned from our earlier
prototypes our successful developer kit
the persuader we learn that the most
important thing for a VR gun controller
is perfect positional tracking we
accomplish this with our previous death
kit with an attached live controller but
Athena has lighthouse technology built
in perfect tracking makes you lose
yourself in the game you can running gun
firing from the hip or shouldering the
weapon and looking down the sights every
movement is perfectly mirrored in kick
we kept physical immersion in mind with
the details of this controller this is
like a high-end racing wheel or
mechanical keyboard from a realistic
reloading action to a fully analog
cocking handle to the powerful recoil
feedback was up to 14 hours of
untethered gameplay it's packed with
impressive technology and built with
gamers in mind the VR gaming is only as
good as the games themselves and we
recognized from the beginning that to
make Athena's success we had to have the
support of awesome game developers the
increase of immersion is quite high when
you're actually holding what you're
seeing inside of the game and we
hunkered down and went into this
seek-and-destroy mode and having the
actual item in our hands leaning up
against the walls it was
it was amazing I think the guys did a
great job on making that this easy as
possible easy for us to do is doing the
implementation of the SDK but within a
few hours
we got the whole setup running and
having a physical gun in your hands
which you can actually reload and you
know really aim really gave an extra
dimension to do immersiveness when you
played Arizona sunshine we're shipping
Athena with two fully playable demos
that we've developed and because it
supports lighthouse technology Athena
will be compatible on launch with many
of the games that already support the
HDC but we aren't new to this
we've already successfully released
controllers to both consumers and
developers as a team we're all really
passionate about video games and we have
been since we were kids we want to make
sure we're building a great controller
for gamers like us so we want your input
and your help to make it FINA a reality
our goal is to connect you more deeply
with the games that you love check out
our IndieGoGo page for more details on
Athena and becoming a backer thanks for
your support
