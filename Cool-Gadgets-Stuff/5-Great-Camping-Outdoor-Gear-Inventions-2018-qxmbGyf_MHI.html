life is crazy and sometimes we have to
get away from mountain hikes to remote
Minnesota lakes to Oceanside campfires
in this beauty we find restoration but
there's a frustrating challenge trying
to find that perfect flat ground
assembling the tent inflating a sleeping
pad when we're already exhausted from a
long day of hiking and the sleep itself
stinks what if we could ditch the tent
for something better
introducing the superior hammock a new
standard of simplicity performance and
comfort this down-filled hammock is
built to keep you cozy whatever the
terrain or whether it's so ridiculously
simple and fast that you could be set up
and hanging before this video ends the
superior hammock will forever change how
you camp this journey began four years
ago when I finally got fed up with my
heavy tent bulky sleeping bag
uncomfortable pad that I hated to blow
up setup took forever and I never woke
up refreshed I thought there had to be a
better way to camp so I started
experimenting first I tried sleeping in
a store-bought hammock but even with a
warm sleeping bag in mild weather I was
cold with the insulation crushed
underneath the infamous coldbut syndrome
I added a sleeping pad but it was tricky
to get positioned and slid around a lot
plus I still had cold shoulders that's
when I realized the perfect hammock
should have down insulation and built
right in I couldn't find anywhere to buy
one so I decided to make one after
sketching out some ideas researching
materials raiding thrift stores for down
jackets and dozens of hours of sewing
finally the superior hammock was born it
was amazing people started asking to buy
my hammock or make them one and then I
knew I had to share this idea with the
world
so I began putting together a talented
team to make this idea a reality
after years of refinement dozens of
prototypes and tons of field testing
were ready to launch we've set up a
manufacturing shop right here in
Minnesota to ensure the highest possible
quality on every stitch using only the
most cutting-edge strong but soft
breathable fabrics the ten-foot superior
hammock weighs a feather-light 36 ounces
yet can support 400 pounds boasting a
huge comfort range of 30 to 75 degrees
thanks to the optimized
layer baffle design avoiding any cold
spots the outside layer is DWR treated
for excellent water resistance handy
snaps close up the hammock for extra
warmth our gear is backed by a 60 day
money back guarantee and a 10 year
warranty we've packed as much value as
we possibly can so for free we're
including a bug net a stuff sack that
doubles as a reversible pillow ridgeline

hammock blanket featuring a unique foot
pocket with double layer insulation to
