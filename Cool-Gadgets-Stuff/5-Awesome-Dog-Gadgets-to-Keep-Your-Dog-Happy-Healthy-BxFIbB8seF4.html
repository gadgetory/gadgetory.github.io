may already know the importance of but
also how difficult it is to find a ramp
that allows your dog to get onto and off
of the bed easily and safely only first
got crew so I searched online for bed
ramps all I found were heavy industrial
looking ramps bulky foam blocks or steps
which are actually not a good idea if
your goal is to protect your dog's back
because you see one in for toxins get
intervertebral disk disease
Crusoe being one of them two years ago
he had surgery for a blown disk which
probably happened from jumping it cost
thousands of dollars and resulted in
months of recovery time and was
heartbreaking to see him like that a bed
is a dangerous place to jump from
especially for dachshunds but also any
small breed however ever since I built
him the ramp he uses it 100% of the time
and I never worried about him being on
the bed anymore plus he can come up and
down as he pleases the design of the dog
will ramp has been refined over the past
couple years it's adjustable in height
from a foot high to over 37 inches the
railings are removable and reversible so
you can poori out the ramp any way you
like and it can be folded down entirely
to less than three inches high so it can
be stored under a bed or upright in a
closet and to make the ramp extra sturdy
I came up with this little safety rope
which is so simple and yet incredibly
effective
simply place the rope under the mattress
with the wood block on one end and with
the other end tied off to the leg of the
ramp this isn't going anywhere and is
100% stable and secure
so check out our campaign on IndieGoGo

your bedroom including a dark walnut

spend more cuddle time with their pup
but without the worry dogle ramps is
just that but with even more features
and conveniences so get yours today and
everyone will be sleeping better about a
lot of scary moments with Finn but this
by far was the scariest thing that's
ever happened to me then I started
chewing on a bully stick got down about
half of it and I glanced over at him and
the entire bully stick had disappeared
hi there my name is Scott wool whine
this is my dog Finn he loves bully
sticks we realized that there is a
problem however that last little piece
of bully stick presents both a choking
hazard and an intestinal blockage hazard
for your dog every year we see dogs that
have attempted to ingest the small
portion of a bully stick
and this can become an emergency
procedure
fortunately Finn threw up that last
little bit of boy stick but something
needed to be done we started doing a
little bit of research about this and
realized that dog owners everywhere have
this exact same problem the most
pervasive solution was attaching the
bully stick to a pair of vice grips
which can cause significant dental
damage I knew there was a better
solution for this problem and that's why
I invented the bully buddy the most
effective way to secure bully sticks to
keep your dog safe and to give you peace
of mind as a dog owner the bully stick
is inserted into the bully buddy and
then the user simply twists the
tightening ring to engage the bully
stick and lock it in place once the dog
is fully enjoyed the bully stick you
simply loosen the tightening ring and
pop out the remaining piece of the bully
stick which can be disposed out properly
so if your dog loves bully sticks just
as much spin and he
furry friends do please support our
Kickstarter campaign we'll even send you
a supply of high-quality bully sticks to
get you started
plus bully buddy is the first of many
innovations that we at bow-wow Labs plan
on bringing to the market in the near
future the first of which will be the
bully buddy - designed for larger dogs
and aggressive chewers as dog lovers
we're all in this together let's make
this world safer for your dog and mine
and thank you for backing our campaign
swift pause is for any dog who needs a
little extra mental or physical exercise
swift pause is a game of tag or chase
for dogs where they chase the lure
around the field and they have a great
deal of fun and get a lot of exercise
all dogs are pre-programmed if they want
to run and play and chase something and
swift pause creates a great form of
exercise for them
it lets them use their brains and get
their energy out and it's pretty low
energy for us but I know we're so busy
these days so we need something that
lets them get the maximum amount of
exercise and fun out for them and an
easy way for us to do it we're very
pleased with a new product we've done
three generations of professional lure
chasing equipment we've taken the
properties of that the quality and the
safety and integrated them into our new
home unit the machine is connected to a
series of pulleys that you put out in
whatever shape you want any size any
shape it can fit in any backyard or even
indoors once you set up the pulleys
around the machine you take some string
and you run that around the series of
pulleys you tie it together to form a
closed loop and when you pull the
trigger it goes zipping around one of my
favorite things about Swift paws is
watching a dog's face light up when they
see it for the first time and one of my
second favorite things about Swift paws
is watching their owner light up just as
much we have been dedicated to Swift
paws for over five years now and we need
your help to bring it to everybody's
backyard
everywhere we go were always asked the
question who let the dogs out we let the
dogs out have you seen our parents brush
our teeth can you imagine doing the same
with them it's a dreadful experience for
both us and for them max I'm sorry now
I'll focus only on dogs did you note
that 84% of us already have oral health
issues by the age of three it's like the
number one problem for us dogs that
bites I have two toys but they don't
clean my teeth and what's with these
treats I mean they taste good but do you
really expect food to clean food just
beef jerky brush your teeth because the
mama bear breath I can't talk to friends
freely so I locked myself at home for
days man is dog's best friend and I'm
sure they'll find our way introducing
bristly the revolutionary brushing stick
for dogs
it has paw pads cleverly designed for
easy holding with the toothpaste
reservoir and bristle line grooves
bristly perfectly matches a dog's
behavior and Anatomy
hey I'm Petros the inventor of bristly
when I lost my childhood dog Mickey due
to oral disease it was devastating but
that inspired me to come up with a
solution to this crucial problem as
brushing remains the gold standard to
oral disease prevention i developed
bristly as a brushing stick to allow all
dogs to take care of their own oral
health the bristles help to clean teeth
down to the gum line preventing plaque
and tartar buildup in the last six
months over fifty thousand pet parents
have tried her first version and they
loved it their feedback has helped us
come up with a version that's best
suited to dogs needs please back our
campaign and help us empower all dogs to
