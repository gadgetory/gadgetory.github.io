how great it feels people the levers and
sun-lee are flying your own tiny plane
it's exciting
this is Mehta fly and flying it is
exciting on a completely different level
like on a scale of one to ten it's level
eleven excited maybe even 12 Mehta fly
has wings that enable it to fly just
like winged animals do so it can
maneuver just like winged animals do
technically it's not a drunk it's an
ornithopter but really it's more than
that it's a meta fly meta fly flies
using a unique method called biomimetics
denoting synthetic methods that mimic
natural processes you know how a bird
flies into your house and can navigate
around everything without hitting
anything Mehta fly can do that because
it mimics the natural movement of the
bird with its synthetic wings see what
we did there that's science explaining
awesomes Mehta fly flies just like in
nature it can take turns
flight slow or fast and can maneuver
around anything we could also glide and
be control to glide left and right with
those abilities Mehta fly is one of the
few RC flying objects that can actually
fly in small spaces here it is flying in
an office here it is flying in a house
here it is flying in an even smaller
house outdoors Mehta fly can enjoy its
full speed by changing the direction of
its tail Mehta fly can fly faster when
its tails down or more controllable when
it's up due to its two channel remote
control that allows for further range no
interference in maximum control you can
fly Mehta fly superfast towards those
dense trees and then maneuver between
them like only a metaphor Canada now
that's even level 13 exciting oh and
don't worry about crashing Mehta fly has
elastic wings and legs in addition to
both front and back bumpers to protect
its body take that tree Mehta flies the
result of more than 40 years of research
and development
Edwyn an aeronautical engineer and the
creator of meta fly got into the field
after his grandfather this cool dude
created the first successful mechanic
bird together with Edwin's father much
later edwin himself successfully
crowdfunded and delivered bionic bird
now he's diving even deeper into the
world of biomimetics to take flight
abilities even further so if you want to
fly just like animals in nature food yet
Mehta fly and get ready to immerse
yourself in an experience like no other
Mehta fly
imagine a machine that has the
performance of a tank and a drone
beat the eggs tank copter the world's
first flying tank on the ground go
through narrow gaps drive in rough
terrain drift and more
hi my name is Dee tag and this is the
extang copter after two years of
development I can finally say the drone
is ready to bring you a lot of fun my
background is in product design and
robotics
since the drones being only able to fly
my ultimate goal was to design the drone
that can operate in different
environments in the air the drone is an
agile flier
the on-board camera will cover your
mission in hd-quality take full control
of the drone with the included
smartphone now immerse yourself in the
experience with the included high
quality VR goggles the drone features
caterpillar tracks three point six inch
propellers HD camera microSD card front
and back lights can fit various battery
sizes pivoting crash resistant paths it
also comes with a 2.4 gigahertz remote
controller
don't worry we got your back here the
drums arms are designed to survive the
worst crashes
the x10 copter is production-ready but
we need your help in order to meet the
factory minimum order quantity and make
it available to everyone at affordable
price thank you for your time and
support
you
imagine a pocket-sized drone that
captures stunning aerial videos
a flying HD camera without the challenge
of piloting a drone hi I'm Vernon and
we're the team that makes micro drone in
2015 we had an idea for a palm-sized
drone the first of its kind with your
support we smashed all our funding dolls
which helped get micro drones off to a
flying start Micro Micro drone Micro
Micro drown three point out
we created two league work with
factories started production and shipped
32,000 drones all over the world we
can't thank you not for your support
we collected lots of useful feedback now
we are ready to introduce the next
generation drone this is micro drone 4.0
our mission is to make the world's
coolest smallest drone with more sensors
upgraded camera and a stabilizing gimbal
micro drone 4.0 is the most advanced
easy to fight drone to date we wanted to
make it super easy to fly so it can be
used straight out of the box fitted with
a high quality Sony sensor the image is
crisp for improved video capture that's
striking and clear micro drone 4.0 is no
ordinary drone a tiny two axis gimbal
provides fluid motion that eliminates
shake giving you buttery smooth footage
using both mechanical stabilization and
E is it allows you to create cinematic
filming techniques that excite and
inspire
the compact foldable design means you
can take it with you anywhere on your
travels it conveniently stores away for
when portability matters
we don't want anyone to miss a special
moment take it out and three clicks gets
you airborne in less than five seconds
it comes with a brand new app with
advanced camera controls
we have completely redesigned the drone
from the ground up with a brand new
shape that's optimized for power and
performance take your hands off the
controls and the technology inside micro
drone enables it to fly autonomously
without any manual controls the drone
integrates powerful AI tracking that
complements smooth stable shots and
flies fast enough to keep up with
high-speed action we're taking it to the
next level and stability size
affordability and ease of use
after two years of designing and
prototyping we're ready to introduce the
Spry a waterproof drone that floats like
a boat can briefly submerge on the water
then flip back to fly in the air at over
40 miles per hour
it's a combination of a racing quad and
a photography drone with a robust
waterproof body and yes the first ever
waterproof remote control the waterproof
remote control has a built-in monitor
that allows you to watch the live video
stream and on-screen display information
the Spry can also send its video signal
to several monitors simultaneously so
you can share your flying experience
with your friends on the spot
the surprise 4k camera tilts up and down
to always point in the right direction
during flight Orwell floating this
allows you to see what's under water
another cool feature is the expansion
port that allows future accessories to
be attached on the bottom and enhance
the surprise capabilities
you can turn the GPS on and off from the
remote control to fly freestyle or
activate its advanced flight features
like Follow Me object orbit and return
to remote-control location so that if
you're on a moving boat the Spry will
always come to where you are if you're
more into robotic flying you can use the
Spry zap to set up waypoints on the map
and fly a designated path completely
hands-free
the Spry is compact and comes with
everything you need to fly the moment
you get it the carrying case battery
remote and charger
in a time of technology and electronics
people still love creating with their
hands that's why we created the air with
drone it's an easy to assemble wooden
drone that brings the joy of building
and ancient Chinese craftsmanship to all
ages an exceptionally performing drone
that's easy to build fly and fix no
overpriced plastic here the aerodrome
features a laser-cut frame made
completely of high-quality Linden wood
coupled with ready to fly electronic
components it's easy to assemble house
modular pieces that you can put together
without any tools and everything you
need is right in the box it's
environmentally friendly wooden design
is lightweight yet durable and it even
features customizable designs and add-on
modules that allow you to personalize
your drone just for you it's a simple
easy to use platform that that is not
only a joy to build but also fly
super handy features like the latest
sixaxis flight control system hover lock
one key return and small lightweight
airframe make indoor and outdoor flying
a breeze
a word goes together with your hands and
a little creativity because we want
everyone of all ages to have an
unforgettable time building flying and
creating with drones so go get building
and let's see what you create</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
