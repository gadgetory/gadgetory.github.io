solution for DIY home security because
you can convert your existing wired
alarm system sensors into your home
automation applications and there are
never any required monthly fees or
contracts my name is nate Clark and I
created connected all the big tech
companies they're really missing out
because they're wanting you to buy all
new systems all new sensors all new
wireless devices but they aren't really
addressing all the homes out there that
are pre-wired for alarm systems and have
been since the 1980s the connected alarm
panel is a drop-in replacement for your
existing alarm pounds but it reuses the
wiring that's already in your home to
connect all of your wired alarm system
sensors to the cloud so now you can
convert your home into a smart home with
one piece of hardware at a much lower
cost than buying all new sensors now
with my smart things alarm system setup
I don't have to worry about arming and
disarming the system because you always
carry your phone with you your phone
acts as a presen sensor so we just leave
the house and the system is armed and by
the time we come home the system is
disarmed best usability ever my daughter
even has a key fob an arrival sensor so
it allows her to come home and disarm
the system if the door opens or there's
motion detected the smoke alarm goes off
I'll get notified right away with other
third-party integrations with
professional monitoring service you can
even notify the police if there's
breaking in your home the connected
alarm panel is easy to install and you
can do it all yourself disconnect those
wires remove the existing alarm panel
from your wall and then connect them to
connect an alarm panel then open up your
app configure it and you'll have an
internet connected smart home you can
configure notifications when somebody
comes home or when the door is open you
can replace your keypads with tablets or
our displays you can even enable like
good night routine to turn off all the
lights in the house and arm the security
system in stay mode with one button push
or one automation one of the advantages
of a smart home is that there are
thousands of devices that are compatible
with these smart home frameworks so now
you can augment your security system
with cameras water leak sensors Alexa
voice control
climate change and air pollution will
impact all of our lives
globally seven million people die each
year because of exposure to air
pollution due to climate change flooding
hits coastal cities six times more often
now than in the 1960s and politicians
take a global human issue and make it
political
it's like record record cold and I keep
hearing about global warming now they'll
say he doesn't understand this is a
worldwide problem oh no I don't
understand
let's do IQ tests now we can either
accept that or we can get to work here's
the problem we need everyone to
investigate climate change and air
pollution in their own communities but
the equipment costs thousands of dollars
and climate change is a complex and
global problem in the face of
overwhelming odds were left with only
one option
we're not the science that out of it my
name is Clifton Roseville and I'm the
founder of pocket lab we believe anyone
can be a scientist and that science
doesn't just happen in the lab we've
delivered thousands of pocket labs to
educators worldwide and now we're
putting our focus on climate change and
air pollution we have launched the
climate education initiative the
initiative has three parts
one anyone can be a citizen scientist by
collecting their own data on emissions
and pollution using pocket lab air two
users can contribute to science through
mission mode where data can be shared
with researchers through the pocket Lab
software the data will be open source
and freely available three you can help
educate the next generation this
Kickstarter will make it possible for
schools around the world to use Parc a
lab error we have spent the last year
developing pocket lab air a state of the
art sensor to measure carbon dioxide
ozone particulate matter and atmospheric
conditions that affect climate pocket
lab is wireless portable and rugged so
it's ready to go anywhere you can use
pocket lab air to measure emissions and
air pollution in your environment then
you can map that data to your GPS
location and you can join a network of
thousands of citizen scientists doing
climate change research
we need the smartest people of the next
generation to take on the biggest
problem
we'll find a solution if we can inspire
more young people to take on climate
change instead of inventing the next
snapchat teachers students and citizen
scientists love using pocket lab because
they can explore the world around them
in ways that were never before possible
people around the world are drinking
more and more bottled water as they
don't like the taste of tap water and
worried about the potential health
impact this year alone four hundred and
eighty billion bottles will be consumed
and less than 7% of these get recycled
the rest end up in landfills nature
rivers and eventually the oceans this is
catastrophic for our environment and a
waste of money for consumers at tap
water we decided there has to be a
better way so we spent three years
researching existing water filtering
technologies and we came up with tap a
revolutionary water filter system for
the kitchen tap last year we launched
the first generation tap one and since
then we've been working hard to come up
with a completely redesigned tap - it
takes only 15 seconds to install and
after this you can forget about carrying
heavy expensive bottles just turn on
your tap and drink healthy great tasting
water anytime you want tap 2 uses the
latest carbon block technology made of
100% coconut shells which removes over
80 contaminants including chlorine
pesticides and heavy metals while
letting the good minerals remain it
connects with your phone to give you
updates on when the cartridges need to
be changed and how much money you've
saved and the environmental impact and
it is the first biodegradable water
filter so once the cartridge is used it
can be composted so no plastic waste
ends up in our nature and oceans
during the development of the first
version tap one we tested over 50
existing filters and filtering
technologies our goal was to create a
much better product we succeeded and
have already shipped over 5,000 filters
and helping people in more than 20
countries but we knew we could do much
better
tap 2 is our next generation of water
filters it's connected smarter better
filtering and sustainable Vinci 2.0 is
