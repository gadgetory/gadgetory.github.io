connected staring at our screens
well that would be how we spend the rest
of our lives you see as humans we are
vulnerable and our smartphones are
engineered to use these vulnerabilities
against us
this is why we've intentionally designed
a phone to be used as little as possible
it's a phone that encourages you to
leave behind your smartphone to spend
that quality time doing the things that
you love the most
we call it going light almost three
years and 10,000 phones later to find
ourselves asking how can we go light
more often how can we go light for good
introducing life onto a beautiful math
display gorgey connectivity and
messaging we are rethinking what an
operating system can be a few essential
tools thoughtfully implemented and
pleasure to use may be an alarm clock a
ride home
list or some simple directions these are
tools not feeds it's a phone that
actually respects you light was born as
a refreshing alternative to the tech
monopolies we don't want to be made to
feel that we're not enough we believe
objects can empower us it can help us
appreciate our lives even more your
humans are taking back our lives
what if you could bring the power of
home anywhere and what if that power
could fit in the size of a shoebox this
is the solar home 620 a portable kit of
lighting charging and music that can
turn any structure into an electrified
home hanging daisy chain lights offer
multi room overhead lighting with
individual switches to control your
space
the optional motion sensor offers a
quick hit of light for pathfinding or
heads-up for nearby movement powered by
a compact six watt panel the central
control box keeps your devices charged
your music playing and your system
running with an LCD backlit display
providing real-time feedback on power
and Sun strength as bio lights first
crossover product the solar home 620 is
currently in over 40,000 households
across sub-saharan Africa and your
purchase will help us reach even more
families so everyone can access the
power of home ready for life off-grid on
the road or even the unexpected power
outage discover a perfect entry into
solar living with easy installation and
flexible setup with the solar home 620
we started this journey two years ago
and we were on a mission to bring
families closer together
while making your living space a smarter
one because as social beings the dining
table holds more than just a food that
nourishes our bodies
it's the magnet drawing us closer
together feeding the connections that
helps us discover our truest selves
whether it's breakfast lunch or dinner
indoors or out the most important
conversations of our lives have been
around the deep it gives us pause in the
world that's speeding up around us it
reminds us that when hits likes to
comment straight away we're in the
presence of something more important we
are a transformer table we believe that
the future of you living space it's
right here hi Kickstarter we're back two
years ago
you backed our very first project the
transformer table
a year later you enabled us to create
the very first English transformer bench
we need your help in introducing the
next generation of transformative
robotics this is our most ambitious
project yet introducing four new
hardwood collections dark American
walnut natural acacia birch gray and the
black oak these are the best products
ever made and we think you're gonna love
them modern housing
and we find ourselves having to
sacrifice to the lack of space however
we think that instead of sacrificing our
comfort we should find ways to use our
space in the more efficient way
this is why we decided to create product
that solves the issue of space there's
just so few products that truly address
this problem so we created a new
category of smart furniture that brings
the versatility and the space-saving to
the next level
from 18 inches to 10 feet the
transformative is a multifunctional
space-saving dream come true for all
office and dining spaces it's six
different sizes provide flexibility and
is perfect for any occasion sitting from
2 to 12 people these are by far the
studious and most robust dining table
we've ever made build and design with
top-of-the-line hardwood and materials
the new generation of Transformer table
are built to last a lifetime the extra
inch and a half panel borders also add
to the modern design of the generation
2.0 while adding overall stability of
the table when fully extended but the
magic of this table lies in its
innovative mechanism turning your
console table into a full dining
experience the tiny ball bearings make
the rail seamlessly glide to extend from
underneath the table a single person can
easily in the table with literally no F
it's modern and sleek design is the
perfect addition to any awesome
making it the centerpiece of your living
space some of us were born to push the
boundaries to do things differently not
just to walk our own path
but to run it to swim it to climb it and
wherever you go we go with you

hello it's Geum and I'm back on
Kickstarter welcome to our efficient
Paris first I wanted to thank you for
all your support during my first project
without you nothing would have been
possible and now William L is
distributed in more than 50 countries
and 600 the painter sells so thanks
again and I'm very happy now to
introduce you to my new project we
connected and automatic chronograph
watch is that I'm very proud to present
you today so when I took a look at the
Smashbox Rafael ate him
I didn't find any watch that fits my
taste in term of design features and
price so I decided to develop the beauty
Flores motto cheese that our
choreography watch me conclude that I
like with the dolphin hands with the
double dome glass with the 316l
stainless steel always the easy bar
system all the coat that I like and that
I did not find in the SmartWatch Rafa
this collection will be available
starting at 99 euro on the keys Tata
regarding the automatic chronograph
collection a lot of backyards ask me
about this almost every week since I
learned the first Kickstarter so
naturally I wanted to create this
collection that you can enjoy the
William L design with the best of
Japanese mechanical watchmaking inside
and again keep the price very affordable
that's why it took some time to develop
the perfect compromiser and now I'm
proud to finally along with this
collection and that will be the most
affordable as a magic coming off in the
market this new step is an important one
for the brown and naturally I wanted to
share it with you again so thanks for
