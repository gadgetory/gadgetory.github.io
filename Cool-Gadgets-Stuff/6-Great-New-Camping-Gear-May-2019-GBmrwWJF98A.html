Army veteran and product designer and
I'm Thomas entrepreneur and technology
expert and we are here to introduce Omni
blade a heavy duty large-scale
innovative five and one multi-tool that
has everything you need and nothing you
don't all in one simple carry durable
piece of still Omni is to large-scale
blades what the Swiss Army knife was two
pocket knives
it has five main functions a full tang
kukri machete a tomahawk style hatchet a
7-inch crosscut saw a closed guard
utility knife and a hammer which also
doubles as the machetes cross guard our
manufacturing partner is a us-based
company which has the industry's
broadest portfolio of edged tools and
related products this partnership is
vital to ensuring the quality and
reliability of every blade Omni is made
of a single piece of 420 j2 stainless
steel and has a rockwell hardness of
56/58 this will allow us to keep the
quality incredibly high to show our
commitment we've decided to take our
blade and ourselves on an outdoor
survival experience and let you our
supporters determine how long how hard
and how far we push ourselves in our
product see the cam for him below for
full details we're dedicated to creating
the most indispensable single survival
tool and would love to hear your
feedback
hi hola hello we are hanging wrong and
we are back for our second Kickstarter
campaign we improved and developed new
products just for you to make life and
traveling the world even more
comfortable and practical introducing
the hangin drone 2.0 let's face it it's
almost impossible to keep your clothes
organized while traveling that's why we
came up with the idea of the hangin
drone it's a practical organizer for
your clothes so you'll always have your
closet dried with you
it still has different size pockets for
perfect organization plus you even can
see what's inside of each pocket II
unfold pack your clothes inside and roll
together carry it anywhere you travel to
and wherever you need your clothes
just hang it up your clothes stay dry
and clean with our version 2.0 you can
access each compartment individually
from one side and in case the hanging
roll is too long for your closet simply
divide into
a great feature is to attach the hooks
to the strap of your backpack the
hangman roll fits perfectly under your
backpack no bouncing around or use the
handle to take it with you all by itself
we came up with three new products that
will traveling with the hangman roll
even more easy the dry bag is waterproof
and can be used with the hangman roll
inside or on its own carrying a big
sweater a tower or shoes
just like the hangman roll put it on the
backpack straps or just use the homology
rings speaking of the D rings you need
to attach them bonds on your backpack
straps and you'll be able to attach the
hangman roll or drive back to the
backpack in seconds with a shoulder
strap you can wear the hangman roll on
your shoulder or crossbody the hangman
Rowan holds up clothes to one week
smaller pockets are perfect for socks
and underwear in a bigger pocket with
three t-shirts and in the largest pocket
and cheese we wanted to make a product
that fits to every style of trevor and
packing your clothes is an issue that
everybody has before going on a trip
so it doesn't matter how you like to
travel you will enjoy traveling with the
hangin drone 2.0 in our new add-ons
we're adventurous and like many of you
our deep respect for nature guides
everything we do
this mindset sent us on a journey to
create the world's most versatile bottle
and that was hard because we didn't just
want a bottle we wanted a tool and we
wanted it to work for any adventure that
is why we built a model a utility bottle
that can do more so you can do more
model is a double-ended flexible bottle
that is both lightweight and durable
made of silicone it collapses to a
fraction of its size so you can make the
most of the valuable space in your pack
with wide openings at both ends model is
easy to clean by hand and dishwasher
safe models innovative loop design is
unlike any other on the market made from
elastic silicone the ends can be
detached and strapped over anything and
everything meaning you don't need a
carabiner to hook your model to a bag
branch or biking but model is more than
just a water bottle it's utility bottom
as the first of this new breed of
hydration gear model offers a series of
interchangeable caps called mods that
unlock unique functions of model such as
the ability to purify water from any
clear running water source the chance to
take a hot shower in nature and the
capability to drink hands-free anytime
you're on the go there's so much that
model is but there's also so much that
it could be this means we need your help
our earliest backers to discover the
capabilities and model in the near
future we will be releasing more mods to
further expand the capabilities and
model inspired by our users and these
and ones by backing this project you're
not only launching a product but an open
platform a growing and ever evolving
tool to empower adventure and discovery
it's our goal to ensure that creating
model doesn't come at the cost of the
environment we're all trying to enjoy to
that end we pledge to reduce carbon
emissions where we can and offset them
where we can we've already had the great
privilege of working with some
incredible thinkers designers and
factures but more than anything we're
looking forward to working with you
with Kickstarter's help we will complete
the final step of ring model to
production so we can get it in your
hands by October 2019 will you join in
on this adventure we'd love to have you

to prevent ice from melting when we
don't even need the ice thanks to
technological breakthroughs with

present to you the tam ik the world's
first hammock tent system that allows
you to hammock wherever you go
we love hammocks and sharing the outdoor
adventure with friends and family so
much we created a way to hammock
anywhere hammocks are great but they are
limited to where you can use them you
need to find somewhere with trees and
the perfect tree spacing we wanted to
create a new way to use hammocks
anywhere while providing comfort gear
storage and protection from the elements

landscapes the frame is sturdy easy to
use and sets up in seconds
