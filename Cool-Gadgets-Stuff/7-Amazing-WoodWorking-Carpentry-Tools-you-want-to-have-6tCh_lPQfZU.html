searching for the best way to complete
every task one thing in particular was
material print I thought there were far
too many tools needed to complete such a
simple job I wanted one tool that could
do it all but it didn't exist so I
decided to invent one it's called the
Rufus offering over three hundred and
fifty percent more functionality than
any other light tool it took me seven
years but I finally figured it out
it also has applications in other fields
such as steel fabrication and roof
plumbing
why'd you but I could I'm fine
cheat codes for the game you're playing
for the game your plan via Ginga

Oh
Chieko for the game you're playing
like to know how to join would the easy
way and create rock-solid joints that
are built to last while forget nails
split wood brackets and messy glue and
build like the pros for over 25 years
pro woodworkers have relied on Craig
jigs to build and repair furniture now
you too can create Pro joints with just
a drill and a Kreg jig to easily build
tables cabinets and more thanks to the
Craig joinery system you can master the
same techniques used by professional
cabinet makers to join wood and create
rock-solid joints it's time to say
goodbye to split wood and broken joints
forget nails brackets and the mess of
glue
Craig jigs will allow you to build all
types of furniture and wood projects
better and stronger with pocket holes
and Craig's unique self tapping screws
you'll learn how to build a tight square
box with solid joints and then you can
build many projects from custom picture
frames to complete storage systems so
why buy weak flimsy ready-to-assemble
furniture when you could build quality
furniture yourself and all you need is
your drill and a Kreg jig and you can
create rock-solid joints that are built
to last on your own wood projects the
old way of doing things require clamps
and glue alignment was difficult and
clamping always seemed to squeeze out
the glue but now just put the Craig bit
with its stepped pilot tip into any
drill and your Kreg jig makes building
as simple as one two three first clamp
down the jig with any clamp then drill a
quick series of pocket holes at the
perfect angle and finally drive Craig's
self tapping screws to pull the two
parts together it's just that simple
with the Kreg jig you drive hidden
pocket holes that provide perfect
alignment every time you'll get ultra
strong joints with no exposed fasteners
and no messy glue and they're great for
repairing failed joints in store-bought
furniture to a Kreg jig can pay for
itself on the first wood project you
build yourself and
sure to use Craig's unique self-tapping
screws made for every application to
give you those rock-solid joints that
are built to last several Craig pocket
hole jig czar available right here on
our website and at many fine

hi I'm barb and I'm Hannah
in 2014 I ran a successful Kickstarter
campaign for the make smith cnc today
I'm super excited introduce you to our
new project Maslow Maslow was a 4x8 foot
CNC cutting machine designed to change
the way we build everything from art
projects to houses and it's cheap you
can get one now for under $500 Masel
lets you print the things you can find
around you that are made from wood this
could be anything from furniture to the
world's coolest treehouse to rebuilding
after a natural disaster we wanted to
create a game-changing tool which allows
people from around the world to
digitally collaborate to make amazing
things we wanted to create a tool which
is cheap easy to use inclusive and
powerful basically we want to help you
build cool stuff to make that possible
we knew we had to make a machine which
work with materials and their native 4x8
form without taking up your entire
garage or workshop it needed to be
affordable
both to purchase and to ship it had to
be easy to assemble with no soldering no
programming and no fancy tools it needed
to be just as accurate as a person using
power tools even when cutting complex
shapes our solution masa masa uses gear
reduced DC motors with encoders and a
closed-loop feedback system to achieve
high accuracy and high torque Maslow
stands only 19 inches out from your
garage or shop wall leaving plenty of
space to park the car masa comes as an
easy to assemble kit which includes
every piece of hardware you need except
for two bricks two sheets of plywood and
three two by fours we couldn't get those
to fit in the box also if you don't
already own one you'll need to purchase
a fixed base router maslow can be put
together in a weekend using only a
phillips screwdriver a pair of pliers
and a hand
Maslow connects to your Mac Windows or
Linux computer using a standard USB port
building things digitally is the future
and we believe it should be for everyone
this is an important technology and
we're making the choice not to patent it
all of our designs PCB layouts firmware
and software are available for free
right now on our website to anyone in
the world when you design something to
print whether it's a kayak a tiny house
or light aircraft we encourage you to do
the same and share your digital files so
anyone can benefit check out our videos
and content below to learn how easy it
is to assemble your kit and to find out
how to turn your digital files into
real-world objects and most importantly
build something amazing the works axis
is more than a tool
in fact it's two saws and one which
means you can click into hero mode in an
instant to tackle the toughest tasks and
the 20 volt power share battery provides
more than enough power to build anything
you can picture the works axis a thing
of beauty with over 50,000 injuries per
year the table saw is among the most
dangerous tools in the workshop
microjig introduces the gripper 3d push
block protecting your hands and
preventing kickback like never before
the gripper gives you three essential
forces for precision control and safety
when working on a table saw downward
pressure keeps your workpiece firmly
down on the table virtually eliminating
kickback inward pressure keeps your
workpiece tight against the fence to
avoid burning forward pressure to
advance your workpiece while keeping
your hands safe and clear at the blade
it's powerful proprietary green grip
gives you incredible traction and
control of your workpiece with the ease
and accuracy the traditional push sticks
and push pads just can't achieve
the gripper is so much more than meets
the eye there are over 30 unique
applications for the gripper throughout
your entire shop its applications are
boundless offering more options and
unparalleled safety the center leg
adjusts to create a tunnel allowing the
gripper to pass directly over the blade
giving you consistent motion and
stability for the entire length of the
cut and shielding your hands from the
boil the balance support stabilizes your
workpiece by maintaining even downward
pressure which is crucial when making
very narrow cuts arguably one of the
most dangerous cuts to make the gripper
makes it safe and easy the gripper is
incredibly easy to use simply put it on
your workpiece slide it up against the
fence and while maintaining contact
pushed it along the fence to make your
cut its versatility simplicity and
unique safety features make the gripper
the best push-block in the world
like to know how to avoid the typical
measuring marking and bad cuts you make
with your circular saw well put down
that tape measure and pay attention to
this because now you can make those
perfect repeatable cuts in plywood MDF
and other large sheet goods without
measuring or marking cut lines thanks to
the Craig rip cut saw guide with a Craig
rip cut you can easily make accurate
straight cuts with your circular saw
every single time the Craig rip cut lets
you get the most from your circular saw
because it's so easy to set up the whole
process can take less than a minute and
you only have to do it once and the
Craig rip cut easily attaches to most
every brand of circular saw and has a
reversible guide for both right and left
handers that adjusts quickly and easily
to your selected cutting width once the
RIP cut is set you can make repeated
cuts of the same width with no measuring
or marking you'll save time and waste
less material and the guide could be
quickly adjusted to another width and
you're back in business here's a Craig
tip support the sheet goods with rigid
foam insulation for cleaner smoother
safer cuts on work benches or even the
ground quality projects all start with
perfect cuts so the RIP cut guide should
be on every workbench it's the first
tool to buy before building bookshelves
closet organizers tables or anything
else that requires the use of sheets
goods trade the difficulties of cutting
large pieces on a table saw form laser
straight perfect cuts made easy with a
rip cut saw guide</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
