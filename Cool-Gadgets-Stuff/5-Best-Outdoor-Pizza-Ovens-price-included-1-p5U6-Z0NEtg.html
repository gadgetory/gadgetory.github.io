of only the world's first portable
wood-fired oven I originally designed
the unit because I'm passionate about
wood fire cooking but I couldn't find an
oven on the market for less than a
thousand dollars only so easy to use
anybody can do it it's fun sociable and
allows you to cook amazing foods in any
outdoor space I'm super happy to
introduce the latest model in the only
family only to end only 2's has all the
brilliant attributes of the previous
models and much much more
here's how it works it runs on wood
pellets which are energy dense and
sustainable a heat source
you take the great out of the back with
some pellets in and light it up after a
couple of minutes you start adding
carrots to the hopper with it scoop
inside only 2's is a stone baking for
giving you the perfect stone base tasty
food the stone soaks up the heat from
the flames and releases that heat back
into the food to get a lovely crust on
Avista who needs us has a patent pending
same paper which helps the only raised
even higher temperature and burn less
fuel after just 10 minutes all is ready
to go you'll reach 500 degrees Celsius
or 900 degrees Fahrenheit meaning you
can cook a pizza in 90 seconds or less
all is also great for me taste
vegetables and even dessert owning more
fast and affordable revolutionize the
way used to south or
introducing the pizzeria pronto
the fast portable pizza oven that gives
you a p3 experience right in your own
backyard the pizzeria pronto will change
pizza night forever it's lightweight
portable and safe on any surface so you
could take it anywhere you'd like to
save up the price it's incredibly easy
to use simply hook it up to a propane
tank it can run for two hours on a one
pound tank and turn it on let it preheat
for 10 minutes and you're ready to go
the pizzeria pronto reaches cooking
temperatures of over 700 degrees and
cook the pizza in only 5 minutes the
piece of you make on your pizzeria
pronto are perfect every time thanks to
several patent-pending technologies
first with our seep diffusing pizza
stones the color core allows the air to
heat the top of the stone evenly
preventing hot spots the built-in heat
shield reflects heat back down on top of
the pizza so that your toppings cook at
the same rate as your crispy crust
finally the moisture then allows the
moisture from your cooking ingredients
to escape so that your pizza is never
soggy once your pizza is done the
pizzeria pronto is immediately ready to
make another with no waiting you can
serve a hungry crowd in no time
the pizzeria pronto is perfect for
tailgating camping for your regular
family pizza night you'll never order
delivery again when your pizzeria pronto
makes homemade pizza fast easy and
delicious

seconds but Robert is so much more than
