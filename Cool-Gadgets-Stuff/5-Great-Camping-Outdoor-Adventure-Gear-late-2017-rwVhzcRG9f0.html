have its drawbacks like finding out
where you're going and sticking together
that's why we created goat le
goat le is a GPS tracker using
long-range radio technology goat le
creates its own network goat le allows
you and whoever you
with to locate communicate and stick
together no matter where you are go
telly can run on its own for up to two
days on a single charge and can be used
on its own without the need of any other
device to record and track your location
down to one meter accuracy when paired
with a smartphone you can use the app to
view and track a group up to 30 units go
telly is able to allow users to
communicate via text to others in
even send an SOS signal when in trouble
giving you that peace of mind of being
able to be there when needed
go Telly's network is also able to be
made in your own home monitoring loved
ones and making sure they are safe
within the app you can also make an
electronic fence once a goat le device
crosses this invisible fence you will be
alerted on air smart device this can be
helpful but you need to be able to find
and track those who sometimes like to
venture off by themselves sometimes we
just need to know if someone is ok and
go tele makes it easy to venture out
with the security of always being able
to find your way back home get a goat le

we are crew and we have reinvented your
outdoors experience now we're back on
Kickstarter with our most innovative
products yet for three years crew has
been pushing the boundaries of tent
design but our new land series with the
core duo and cocoon tents brings things
to a new level featuring our cutting
edge crew insulation these tents bring
exciting new features including more
simple pitch design content modularity
and all tents can link into the central
dome tent and super flexibility all
three tents work as standalone pieces or
together so with this new crew a series
you can go as small as you need or as
big as you want
the cocoon tent can sit comfortably in
any other tent bringing crew a level
insulation to your existing equipment
but is designed to work in perfect
harmony with the portable duro and the
homely core all three tents can be
purchased as individual pieces or as a
total package this is our third
Kickstarter campaign and we've velcro
around our customers and partners we've
got you covered whether you need the
insulated tent or want to bundle it with
the hiking tent or grow to the full clan
system crew up don't just purchase
invest
accent
cut cut
get out of the city authenticity lies in
the woods comb your beard stand near
water war in water find your way won't
get lost
climb rocks any rocks above all drink
coffee fresh ground coffee okay yeah we
get it I think we can all agree fresh
ground coffee is the best that's why you
brought a hand grinder all the way here
but there is a better way this is the
loom grinder let's see how it works
nope they're better than good
they're great but how did we get here
let's step back a bit when you want a
rich rewarding cup of coffee you need
beans that are ground into particles of
consistent size now the word consistent
is key here why you know when you roast
potatoes how you want to cut each chunk
the same size it's to make sure they're
all cooked the same none overcooked
none undercooked well the same thing
goes with brewing for example if you
like the French press brewing method
like I do coarse particles get good
extraction but the fine particles will
be over extracted that means a bitter
tasting cup of coffee the same goes for
any other brewing methods you're looking
for consistency no exception today's
hand grinders generally have one major
flaw the burrs and stabilized it rocks
back and forth creating some particles
larger than the rest loom grinder on the
other hand uses a patent-pending design
that applies a stabilized conical
ceramic burr to keep everything precise
and even you'll get the same quality
grounds you get from your favorite
coffee shop thanks for listening now
back to that amazing cup of coffee
you've been waiting for okay he's done
back to the woods and whatever the heck
you're doing out there
bring the grinder it's a light too you
know so you could read or knit or read n
it go to the woods
bring your beans loom
it's a grinder and a light but mostly a
grinder
we are seasons
it's our goal to develop products that
function well and look good but most
importantly we want our stuff to go with
you everywhere and be used throughout
your entire life
and this is the seasons blanket
but this isn't your grandma's quilt most
blankets are too thin and like any
performance qualities but we are using
an assortment of Tecna T riyals and
finishes to create this lifetime blanket
to start we chose a heavy canvas
material for the bottom canvas is a
tried-and-true
legend for durability and then we infuse
that canvas with a DWR water resistant
finish our blanket is durable and repels
water and mildew on one side and then
the other side is a soft quilt
the combination of the two materials
means that you can put this blanket
anywhere and be comfortable and maintain
that durability then we added stainless
steel rivets in the corners so that you
can stake it down or even use it as a
shelter whether you take it camping in
the mountains
throw in the back of our cards and use
it to change into our wet suits to the
beach we're laying down gear for a
climbing mission
or just picnics with the family you will
love how versatile it can be
there is nothing like that out there so
we made it season's lifeproof design</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
