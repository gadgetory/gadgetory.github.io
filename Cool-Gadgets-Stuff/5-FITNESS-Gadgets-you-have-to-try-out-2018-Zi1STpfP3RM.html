love to have a good posture do you want
to be in shape have a strong core and
build muscles would you like to
challenge yourself it is proven that
doing planks is the best and most
effective workout to build a strong core
align the spine and activate many
important muscles in the neck arms
shoulders chest abdominals back glutes
and legs as the focus is on the core
region planking prevents lower back
injuries and reduces back pain
significantly it is amazing the aim of a
plank workout is to hold the static
plank position as long as possible
the longer you hold the plank the better
you perform the faster you reach your
target but the difficulty is when you
start blanking you count every single
second so instead of shaking your body
while counting seconds you can hold the
plank we have created a solution that
distracts you from this and is way more
fun the plank pad the plaint pad
combines a fitness device with a game on
your smartphone or tablet by playing a
game your focus is more into the game
than on counting every second this makes
you plank much longer reaching your
goals faster while the time flies by
having fun the plank pad itself is made
of a fine long lasting and high-quality
wood with a walnut finishing to make it
look outstanding the top is covered with
a special foam to assure a comfortable
planking it comes with a special mat so
you don't slip don't make any noise or
damage your floor we also added a nice
handle to carry the plank pad to start
an exercise you just need to download
the app place it on the straight aligned
plank pad to synchronize and choose a
game or a workout
the app also teaches you to do the
perfect plank to play the game you have
to balance the plate pad left and right
the app and the gyroscope of your mobile
device are in perfect sync with the
plank pad there is a game for everyone
like candy monster circles
asteroids Waverider and snow cruising
and in the future there will be even
more but games will challenge you to
collect more and more points and you
will forget about the time so your
workout will last much longer
besides the games there is a workout
section the plank pad has to stay
straight
while you are following the plank
exercises we tried plank pad at more
than 100 friends and also many people at
the gym and we figured out that no
matter what age and if you are well
trained or not the person could hold the
plank position almost 50% longer than
before since the plank pad can also be
used as a balance board to train the
motor coordination improve reaction time
and to prevent injuries we created two
games especially for balancing the
balance board turns into a surf or
snowboard and you play fun games while
working your lower muscles out and
increasing your body balance and
stability
now the game is up to you strengthen
your core build muscles eliminate back
pain and get a six-pack in no time
thanks to the plank pad
introducing Neil fit roller the world's
most compact convenient and travel
friendly foam roller neo fit roller
collapses to just four inches expands to
three times its size to 12 inches and
goes anywhere you do we live in an
on-the-go world where travel as a part
of daily life where our bodies are under
constant physical strain leaving you
tight sore and stressed and when it
comes to looking after your body a few
things are as powerful as foam rolling

knows that they're almost impossible to

for business a long-haul vacation a trip
across town to play sport the ultra
portable neo fit roller goes with you
everywhere if I'm rolling to be part of
my fitness routine and work in
professional sports industry for almost
10 years it often spends six months a
year on the road
I'm not planes four or five times a week
my back and my body is really stiff
tight and sore and the more I traveled
the more I needed my foam roller which
would sit on the other side of the
country my land room just when I needed
it most it didn't make sense to me that
just because we travel we compromised
our health and so I decided to do
something about it and created near fit
roller simply if you're on the go and
care about your health
neo fit roller is for you just wrote in
your bag and get on with your active
life but it's not just convenience we've
created we designed a foam roller that

painful trigger points to maximize
recovery and performance and enhances
joint health mobility and flexibility

handle up to three
and fifty pounds while weighing less

innovative patent-pending design that
expands to 12 inches and collapses to

athletic training devices aren't new
weight trainings not new fitness
trainings not do but this product it is
a lot of people say they have a
revolutionary product we truly do you
know wrist weights have been around
forever they're filled with sand or
something else clunky that moves around
to add some weight inside and we just
took that entire category and
reengineered it and made it comfortable
made it fun made it fashionable the
trading lace because of its flexible
weighted core simply just wraps around a
piece of equipment it's truly the only
product that's one size fits all because
of its ability to wrap around a hockey
stick a baseball bat tennis racket any
piece of sports equipment even your
wrist and your and your ankles really
separates it from anything out there Jay
and I grew up together and we
reconnected once his son joined my
lacrosse program so I had an idea of
creating a training product for lacrosse
and when I looked at all the products
that were already out in the market they
just they were developmentally
appropriate and honestly most of them
didn't make sense so we were trying to
figure out a way how can we add an
appropriate amount of weight that's
gonna build muscle and they came up with
the idea of the training lace
when we started with training lace we
originally just had packaging for
lacrosse we realized that it was much
bigger than sports even bigger than
Fitness and started getting into
physical therapy and just general
healthy living this product is good for
people from 8 to 80 and for that older
population it's not gonna hurt them it's
actually going to help them they can
exercise at a lower intensity and still
achieve the same desired results
I'm Fleur and I'm Nick welcome to the
work Jin family what's so good about it
is that you don't actually have to
village lieutenants I have an okay and
make it as part of that one it's easier
that one just by changing the weights
and what I really wanted to challenge
myself get all the weights in you can
still do every exercise with it yeah
there's only two hundreds of different
exercises you would literally have to
have a mountain in your living room to
have all of that equipment yeah and it's
all in one place you're just thrown away
by how many things it can do and we've
added why don't you start for doing next
there's no excuses it's like the gym to
your house literally just pull it out
from under your bed when you ain't good
and have a full body workout and I don't
have to have a pile of equipment in my
living room anymore
you take it anywhere weight anywhere
Hotel
stylish and actually works I'm going to
be doing some videos showing you how
easy it is to actually get a full body
workout this is the beginning of other
lifestyle you know we want people to
exercise feel good eat well
we want to do the app you want to make
sure that people actually have a
personal trainer that they can follow so
yeah really excited for you guys to join
us on our journey
join the Whitcomb family yeah less is
more
see Lipsy got a gym in a box we all know
that working out makes us think we are
feel more energetic and look better but
the traffic cold mornings and same
boring exercises at the gym make it easy
to hit the snooze button and push that
workout permanently to work my name is
Jason I'm a trainer fitness junkie and
loved creating stuff calisthenics have
always been a staple in my training
regimen for the past year I've been
working with an amazing design team and
experienced manufacturers to build a
product I could use in my apartment at
the beach or Park to perform full-body
workouts we're finally ready to
introduce you to the base blocks its
patent-pending design allows you to
perform over 50 body rate exercises for
your upper body core and lower body the
adjustable uprights allow you to change
the height changing the leverage to make
the exercise more difficult or easier
depending on your training level it's
assembled in seconds and slides on the
event for storage dips levers handstands
else it's they all sound that look
pretty
but to perform these exercises you need
a strong foundation our system
categorizes exercises as beginner
intermediate or advanced most the
existing training equipment is either
faulty or requires attachments to
external features when we came over the
design we made a practicality checklist
we asked ourselves three questions could
have fit in the trunk of the car could
it slide under event to storage and
could it be carried into ads or workouts
the uprights can be attached or removed
with a simple click they then slide
through a set of holsters allowed into
storage
and there's a handle in the base
allowing you to touch plywood to the
base of blocks the base measures 34
inches by 19 inches the uprights are
made of high-grade steel when compact
them is 18 inches and extend to 35
inches</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
