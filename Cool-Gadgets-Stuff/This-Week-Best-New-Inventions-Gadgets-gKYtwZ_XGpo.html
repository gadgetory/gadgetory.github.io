owning a smartphone to experience
immersive
three-dimensional augmented reality it
really is a first of its kind arise and
uses the technology that you already own
to make augmented reality available
anywhere anytime and to anyone your
smartphone camera finds the target and
overlays virtual images onto your
environment creating vivid
three-dimensional experiences you can
use anything as a target a dollar bill
your coffee cup or even an iPad screen
with just a tap on our app a choice of
experience a flip of the phone and the
horizon it's ready to go
augmented reality lets you dive into a
world where your imagination is brought
to life in everyday setting
augmented reality can bring anything
from joy and entertainment to real world
practicality such as optical learning
hands-on design and the visualization of
models when designing arrival simplicity
and usability is at the heart of
augmented reality as we had imagined
with the cardboard google brought
virtual reality to everyone with a risin
we are doing the same thing but for
augmented reality this led us to a
product that is both intuitive and its
use and only a fraction of the price of
current solutions hey guys my wife and I
Hey we're packing for our trip to
Savannah we've got this new fused smart
card that's going to help us with our
purchases throughout the trip
this card can store information for
almost any card in my wallet debit cards
credit cards reward cards gift cards gym
membership anything with the barcode and
EMV chip a magnetic strip or NFC text
view stores if you just swipe or take a
picture of a card through your
smartphone and it appears on for you now
you may be wondering about security
defuse card runs on Bluetooth and
connects directly to your phone it's
necessary you can delete all the
information on the card with the push of
a button I've got my key I've got my
phone I've got my wallet fuse allows you
to select any card to use when you need
it for instance when you pay for gas you
might rather use debit and credit you
can also add your gas pay membership
info you can even use multi pay mode to
combine the two cards for a simpler
transaction views makes it all easy
I've got like 30 different cards all at
once oh it's got my debit cards credit
cards gift cards membership cards that's
awesome
see if it works all right it worked
fuse has the capability for NFC
technology NFC means you can tap the
card to make contactless payment using
its button you can create a six tap
password to lock and unlock the card so
if it ends up in the wrong hand they
won't be able to access your information
by pressing the hold button for three
seconds you can freeze the fused card so
that your preferred payment method
doesn't accidentally change the card
stays locked and active for 10 minutes
unless it's told otherwise
it's cool too because if you forget your
card your phone will send you an alert
before you get too far away plus its
battery lasts an average of 30 days that
means you have about a month before you
have to worry about recharging it but
when you do have to charge it fees this
portable charging cradle has a built in
battery allowing you to charge the card
on the go in Savannah we had the chance
to use the fuse it's pretty awesome that
you can put all this tech into a card
it's thin as this fuse your whole wallet
in one card
what is a life maybe that's a dream we
forget we are building the next big
thing for yoga and meditation
practitioners with our tech we have
pioneered dream yoga are you familiar
with the concept of lucid dreaming have
you seen the movie Inception then you
already know the idea in a lucid dream
you are aware that you're having a dream
with our device low powered stimulation
provokes a state of mind similar to that
which occurs during meditation when it
happens in a dream your mind awakens
while the body is asleep and a person
can find himself in a dream while
dreaming that's why we call it free yoga
such stimulation has been known for the
period in scientists and is widely used
for mental therapy and mindfulness with
the help of neuroscientist
we developed a preset of frequency for
different functions meditation sleep and
studies more than 500 people tried to
devise some work even aware of lucid
dreaming and Bill found themselves in a
lucid dream with Lisa catcher you have a
40% probability of having a recent dream
from the very first try the other 60%
may end up with very vivid dreams and
better dreams recall there's nothing
believed

Oh
the magpie is the smartest tracking
device in the world
it's a rechargeable very very cheap unit
with over a hundred countries available
to support tracking
before starting my pie I was on several
projects I've built a car out of Legos
build my own jet propelled bicycle
I've also launched it go into other
space for understandable
someone showed me the video once I saw
it and once I met roll I knew we had to
find a way to book something together a
primary driver for me is is moving away
from the world where I'm creating
products and experiences for for big
companies that don't necessarily add any
value to the world well Matt fire we
definitely want to build something that
actually improves people's lives
something that it's always there always
on you don't have to even think about
the possibility but whenever you need it
it's there for you I kept reading about
people going missing and you obviously
fear you will find neighborhood pets
going missing this is one of those tiny
little problems that seems to perpetuate
in the world and that's essentially how
we got to make by its removing those
moments of anxiety in tensions
seamlessly with a simple piece of
technology Magn pliers built to last
that's rechargeable has a long lasting
battery and it's waterproof and
dustproof it's based on GPS technology
which essentially unlocks the world
that's the main differentiator between
the Bluetooth device which is 30 50
maybe 100 feet and something is powered
by GPS it's a functional cell network</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
