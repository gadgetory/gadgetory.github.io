the city the downside of urban riding is
that millions of bikes are stolen every
year and many and go unreported when you
arrive at your destination you'd lock up
your bike for something like this or
even worse this at outdoor we believe
that cyclists deserve a higher standard
of security and that's why we designed
the 560 G the world's lightest
high-security bike
hey my name is Luke as a kid I used to
ride my bike everywhere and to be honest
not much has changed when I was in
competition or just trying to get around
town every second on my bike is pure joy
when I got older I moved to the city and
started commuting by bike at first
everything was great I can get where I
was going quickly and for free but then
I had my first bike stolen I was forced
to use a heavy steel lock which me and
my riding experience painful I thought
to myself if bikes have carbon fiber and
titanium components and they've had
these for years
why can't locks do the same luckily for
me I met someone who agreed hi I'm Dylan
after talking to leek about the problem
he was having with his bike lock we
agreed there had to be a better solution
we began researching materials designing
locks and testing prototypes after about
a year development we came up with the
560 G the world's lightest high-security
bike lock weighing 560 grams or 1.24
pounds
after having my bike stolen I had to
make sure that the 560 G was different
than other bike locks I used in the past
that's why we designed the 560 G the
handle sustained attacks from the
strongest of theft tools the 560 G is
different from the bike locks because it
is made a grade 5 titanium a super alloy
using fighter jets and spacecraft this
material has a very high strength to
weight ratio allowing the 560 G to be
lightweight and secure
the components of the 560 G are
precision machine to ensure the highest
possible quality after machining they
are anodized giving the lock a beautiful
finish unlike any other lock the 560 G's
patent-pending folding design allows you
to be conveniently folded up for storage
in or on a bag if you don't have a bag
you can clip it onto your belt the file
size of G's 3-piece titanium joint
design is different from other folding
locks because it was designed a solid
marine grade stainless steel rivets
lastly the 5cg was designed up a
high-security disc lock mechanism so
that you can lock up your bike to push
the button
this versatile mechanism allows you to
combine locks for extra reach or extra
security
you
well I guess that wasn't the typical
Kickstarter moving but still the folder
lock is an amazing product and we hope
you'll be passionate about it just as we
are
so please back our project we need your
support and don't forget to spread the
word a new lock isn't down ride safe and
keep your bike safe
you
the bikes we ride are getting lighter
and faster all the time the same can't
be said for our loss for years we've
been stuck in mindset that heavy is
better it's time to move on
we want to start a revolution in bike
security we've invented a radical new
product after years of research and
development we proudly present light
Locke the world's first lightweight
you
light Locke weighs less than a kilogram
we've also designed a carry bag that
fits into your frame here behind your
seat or you can just pop light Locke
into or onto your own bag you can even
choose to have to light lot operating
from the same unique key this means you
can choose extra security or extra
length light lock comes in three designs
reflective boa green crow black and
herringbone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
