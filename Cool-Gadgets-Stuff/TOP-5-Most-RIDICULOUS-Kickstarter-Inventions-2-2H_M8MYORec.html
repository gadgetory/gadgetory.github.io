hi my name is Richard Klein a former US
Marine and CEO of Klein electronics a 24
year old company with 25 employees half
of our team has been here for 10 years
and more some as long as 16 years we're
not a start-up you've seen our products
in hotels hospitals churches schools and
warehousing world water we're profitable
and debt-free company our electrical
engineering and product design ability
has worked many products not aligned
with our currents for the goods one of
those is this live of scanner
historically I have been a
super-sensitive person when it comes to
journey food and hyper aware of how my
food is prepared in particular consider
the worst case scenario someone actually
spitting on your food although
disgusting the health concerns far
outweigh this now with Ebola being the
present pandemic we know now it's
transmitted through body fluids you need
to know if there is human saliva on your
food the saliva scanner is a handheld
laser scanner that determines biomedical
contact this will allow you to scan your
food items and detect certain enzymes
that are only found in human saliva
likewise design the engine then
correlates that to the user interface of
the device as well as to your smartphone
with more details indicating just how
healthy and saliva free your food is
although we've finished the development
of the housing itself and the laser this
new bio sensor is going to take some Rd
software coding and development of the
refractive scanner as well as
application development in fact we have
a patent pending on the device now we
need your help to pay for the
development of this product the rewards
include promotional items free saliva
scanners and even credit in marketing
and packaging materials depending on
your level of partnership we're not kids
in a garage showing you theories we're
an established family oriented company
that plans to build this and other
life-saving products you will hear about
soon we seek your partnership to do so
let's build the saliva scanner yeah
hi there my name is Laura studi and I'm
the inventor of the lupin poop let's
face it going to the bathroom in the
woods not fun for anybody so that's why
I invented this bad boy
it's a patent-pending device that
reduces eyestrain and makes it easier
and more sanitary to go to the bathroom
in the woods in other words it helps you
lessen the chance of mess in your pants
seriously a few years ago I got fed up
with the discomfort and disgustingness
associated with squatting in the
outdoors and I decided to find a
solution through a bit of research I
discovered that the restroom situation
is one of people's biggest deterrence to
participating in outdoor activities like
camping backpacking hunting or hiking
though my initial prototypes were
hand-sewn and somewhat crude the
feedback I received propelled me towards
an end product that makes squatting in
the outdoors far easier and more
sanitary than existing products for the
past year I've been working with
engineers and outdoors enthusiasts to
refine the design and improve its
durability and versatility to use you
simply wrap the loop and poop around
your waist and a tree that will support
your weight clasp the carabiner to the
loop on the open end adjust the strap
size is necessary then pull down your
pants lean back into the strap and do
your business the loop and poop is mold
mildew and abrasion resistant and loops
on the side allow you to add accessories
like toilet paper a bear bell and hand
sanitizer additional uses for the loop
and poop includes securing other gear
hanging food out of the reach of hungry
bears and even leashing your dog just
remember to unhook the dog before you
squat if you want to purchase a loop in
poop or you just enjoy potty humor visit
us online at loop n poop comm or find us
on Facebook and Twitter thanks for your
support and don't forget to tell your
friends
hi I'm ginger I'm Lewis and this is mr.
B mr. B is kind of our hobby he is
inspired many a mr. B related project
the hero postcard cat chronica the three
B moon postcard teaching mr. V to dance
like a monkey for his food the very
happy time postcard
so when Lewis showed me the barking
squirrel gravy boat on lapping squid I
just had to make mr. B version
it's awesome it has an incredibly
lifelike action and is excellent with
all manner of culinary semi liquids this
thing has brought us a good many giggles
but we had no idea our little video
would get such a response it's been
blogged tweeted shared and viewed all
the hell over although we shouldn't be
too surprised because we all know the
Internet is made out of cats so we would
love to share it with the rest of the
world but I can only make so many out of
glass to make the puking Kitty sauce but
a portable we need to go mass production
ceramic we've got the design we've
sourced the factory we've got everything
poised and ready to roll all we need now
are the funds for the first production
run so if you'd like one or if you know
anyone could get a kick out of it please
pledge and share this video we've got
some awesome mr. Bieber boards remember
Kickstarter is an all-or-nothing deal so
if we don't get 100% funded we won't be
able to turn your dinner table into a
feline vomitorium thanks for checking us
out and supporting the puking kitties a
pee bib</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
