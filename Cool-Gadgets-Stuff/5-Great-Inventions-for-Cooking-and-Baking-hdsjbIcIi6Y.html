this pizza wasn't made in a wood-fired
brick oven it wasn't made in an oven at
all I made it in my kitchen stove in
just three minutes
Pizza is the original fast food and I
really love to share it with my friends
but making pizza at home is very time
consuming and the results are never the
same as in my favorite pizza place
nothing kills to move faster than hungry
guests so why are we still making pizza
at home in ovens which takes forever to
preheat that's not fast food and the
party will be over before you even make
one goodbye when I went on a mission to
make the best possible pizza in the
shortest amount of time
iron ate was born iron ate is designed
to stiffen up and all together so you
can make your pizza straight on your
kitchen stove or range in under 10
minutes ironing can heat up to 800
degrees Fahrenheit
just like commercial pizza ovens no more
waiting 30 plus minutes for your oven to
preheat heating up your apartment and
wasting all that energy
the cover is designed to quickly soak up
the energy from your soap and radiate
intense heat into the crust and toppings
to ensure evenly cooked pizza in just
three minutes the bottom end of iron
eight is made out of special steel that
can hold as much energy as four Govan
and it conducts heat way better so you
get those perfect chart spots on the
bottom of your pizza
you can turn even a frozen supermarket
Pizza into a star of your party with
iron 8 iron eight is handmade in Europe
it's made out of heavy-duty steel which
prevents wrapping and is virtually
indestructible its all-natural code is
only with vegetable oil prevent it from
rusting and provides a nonstick surface
it's made to last a lifetime
we tested iron eight with all common
heat sources it works great on electric
glass induction or gas stoves you can
even use it on your grill or campfire
have you ever made a gourmet pizza while
camping now you can and it's not
intended just for pizza either high
carbon steel is superior to stainless
steel aluminum or even cast iron it can
hold more energy and radiates more heat
so that sous vide State will get a
perfectly seared finish the cover can be
used as a baking steel for those rare
occasions you'll still want to make your
pizza in an oven providing a scorching
hot surface that emulates a wood-fired
brick oven
hi I'm Jeff hi I'm Natalie and this is
the Innova precision cooker precision
cooking is sometimes called sous-vide it
was once used only by the world's best
chefs now it allows anyone to produce
restaurant quality results food is
amazing tender and moist
every time this new innova precision
cooker combines everything we learned
over the past four years we simplify the
design we simplify the interface and it
is the most versatile unit to date and
the precision cooker connects to your
iPhone allowing you to cook amazing
meals by simply pressing a button most
people don't know that they've already
probably eaten sous-vide it's very
common especially among the high-end
restaurants if it was a big year for
sous-vide last year because it really
became affordable right now it is the
fastest growing kitchen appliance
category precision cooking is easy all
you have to do is attach a precision
cooker to any console container set your
temperature with the mouse wheel and
press Start no other fancy equipment is
needed you simply place your food in a
ziploc bag and clip to the side of the
pot and you're done the results from
this type of cooking is consistent every
time if you want medium-rare you can get
it if you want medium well you can get
it and the results are just like what
you get at a fine restaurant the main
benefit is the consistency that long as
you cook you know on the same
temperature at the same time the meat or
whatever you're cooking always comes out
exactly the same compared to traditional
cooking the sous-vide process requires
very little skill and it's super easy
what the sous-vide device does is
actually a freeze of time so you can do
stuff with other people that's a thing
about it
I'm Dave Arnold from Booker and Dax and
we're kick-starting a product called the
Sears all the Sears of all is an
attachment for a torch that turns it
into a very powerful handheld boiler
completely portable and extremely
powerful this is 15,000 BTUs when you
use this torch I originally designed the
Sears all to solve a problem in
sous-vide cooking sous-vide cooking
doesn't leave a nice crust on the
surface of your food what's interesting
is after we built it we realized it's
not only good for sous-vide but it
considered just about anything so we
named it the Sears all we can refinish a
pizza in a dorm room we can do a burger
we can melt cheese we can sear a steak
we can do fish you can do scallops
really anything that you want to put a
fast crust on with high heat you can do
in a series all so this is actually
really good for finishing low
temperature meats at home in smaller
scenario or for a chef who's doing a
catering event or if you have a couple
of things you need to finish up or
something comes out of the oven it's not
quite right
sous vide cooking doesn't leave a nice
crust on the surface of your food so a
lot of people have been using a torch to
finish off the food because they wanted
that high heat the problem is high
intense direct heat of a torch creates
what's called torch taste which is bad
leaves a fuel taste on your meat if
searzall was specifically designed to
never put torch taste into your food for
even heat and raw power it's really
difficult to beat a bed of hot coals now
you can have that kind of power
instantly in the palm of your hand I
think that searzall is very cool for
home cooks because the one thing I know
that home cooks Lowe's home cooks don't
have are the BT units or just the power
that a professional kitchen has and I
think that this without a doubt brings
that professional kitchen power to a
home cook it really is perfect for what
we do have
we're always limited with space budget
Dave was ingenious enough to create
something that was one of those very
simple products that you sort of slap
across your head be like why didn't we
have this before so she Nakata or no
naka de aquellas hey watashi wa SES or
what customer could I work how about the
smoke Sh'ma no staccato Scott terracotta
Yuto Kasich second R&amp;amp;I code talk cardio
Koga can you shoot a circle to this look
at this piece of foie gras look at the
sheen developing the crust starts to
form almost instantly and the seer is
also fast at cooking the foie gras you
can get a beautiful outside with the
inside almost completely wrong I love
good rice but often when I eat rice at
other people's home or even at some
restaurants I'm disappointed to put it
nicely it's not cooked the way to get
the best out of it I discovered cooking
in ceramics during my trips to Japan in
China it was then that I learned to
appreciate well cooked rice so inspired
by the traditional Chinese and Japanese
ways of cooking rice I designed the
assumed a ceramic rice cooker my name is
Ben Austin I'm a product designer from
the Netherlands and I love cooking
cooking any rice you should first rinse
it thoroughly then let it soak for a
while cook it for a short time turn off
the heat and keep it covered the rice
will continue to steam until it's done
ceramics hope to eat very well so the
rice won't cool down too much while
letting it sit the glaze on ceramics is
very inert so it won't give off any
taste like metal or from dust we added
some extra benefits like these rims in
the lids these rims make sure that any
steam that condensates will drape nicely
on the surface of the rice so the top
layer of the rice won't dry out sure
cooking rice in electrical rice scooper
works too but then you have yet another
kitchen appliance with a plug assuming
is much more practical
sustainable
and beautiful but Akaka bill is silver
fleece nice gawker.com knitting and
Alexis Coker Barbara hood in the cicada
Amateur Night Stalker Yasui Sammy pan to
her way down Lily Jason :
so having promised you is delicious rice
cooked in an easy way in the assumed a
ceramic rice cooker
you
I'm like super obsessed with cast-iron
cookware I pretty much use cast-iron
pans for everything you know i bacon it
roasting it frying it sauteing it that's
all you need it's worth cooking a
hundred meals in to get it to that level
where you look at it you're like yeah
that's my pan it's one of a few objects
that you will have forever we've
designed the field skillet to take all
the best features of vintage cast-iron
and then add a modern twist we've spent
a year researching designing and
refining this pan you know it took a
bunch of prototypes it took prototypes
in plastic and took prototypes in iron
and took 3d printed sand prototypes
it took cooking with those prototypes it
took holding the handles in plastic and
in foam and then an iron and just
feeling the way that it felt in your
hand and saying does this click it's
smooth it's light it's got a good handle
but to me this pan is almost 100% in the
details the weight has been calculated
to be the exact amount you need to both
want to use it every day but also to
keep the heft in for your heat retention
and then we just put an obsessive level
of detail into the small things that you
probably won't notice but they're there
when we first started this project we
weren't sure what to expect and we've
been incredibly fortunate to have built
this dream team around us that makes us
feel like anything is possible another
big thing for us was that this is a
family project this is my brother and me
we felt like hey we're stamping our name
on this thing let's make sure that that
stands for something we've gotten into a
place where we're incredibly happy with
the way that it feels the way that it
looks and the emotional response that it
gets from everyone that we</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
