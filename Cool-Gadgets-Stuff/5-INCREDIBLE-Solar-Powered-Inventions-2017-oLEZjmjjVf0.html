apartment with my roommate novena hi I'm
Jana I also live in unique I spend
Lauren's best friend since first grade
over the past three years we have some
planning testing and building a pre
prototype of an electric vehicle called
science the cool thing about science is
that it has solar panels on the entire
colony so the Sun recharges the battery
during the day even if it's cloudy we
use polycarbonate to protect the solar
cells or your cabinet has the advantage
of being unbreakable and scratch
resistant kind of fume lighter than
glass for the total area of seven point
five square metres solar cells recharge
the battery up to 30 kilometres a day
additionally to the normal range this
car is perfect for commuters who dress
every single day to is work in evening
the college or for a camping lower
because assignment for supply
directional charging circuit can plug in
all your electronic devices you have
just imagine here if electricity
wherever you are
now worries about the Rings and worries
drastic loss I even just for you
everyday work the sign provides you
won't be cool but the power output of up
to 2 kilowatts for the interior we
developed the system called prison the
special thing about it we use a certain
moss
it is integrated into the van and acts
as a natural air filter using
electromagnetic charge this mosque
filters our pollution light fine dust
produced by the industry and combustion
engines it really requires no care since
this plant draws its water from the air
it is also sound proving and assigned in
the fire protection Class B one and the
best thing is we offer two different
models at the price of model extender
for sixteen thousand euro with range of
250 kilometres and model urban for
twelve thousand euro with range of
hundred and twenty kilometers one day it
was just a dream but now we'd like to
introduce you to solar gapps
smart blinds that automatically track
the Sun and generate electricity from
its energy it's very simple to use even
children can use green energy for their
needs all reports and control systems
are available on your smartphone solar
tax is an all-in-one solution you simply
plug in your smart blinds and solar
energy starts to power all devices at
home plus you can charge any home
battery storage you want to use and use
a small internal emergency battery
whenever you want this way you produce
your own energy and save money on
electric bills Solar gaps is a perfect
system for your home especially if you
live in a flat and don't have a roof to
mount solar panels on owners of
commercial property can mount solar gaps
on windows and reduce operational costs
for instance on air conditioning we
spent thousands of hours on research and
development of our product we built a
dream team with diverse experience and
engaged successful entrepreneurs as our
advisors and mentors current results of
our work are based on expert reviews
from around the world we created a
product that is ready to be produced and
shipped you can start small and try
solar gas technology order Solar gap
sample even this small part of life will
be enough to charge your smartphone or
fitness gadget you will appreciate whole
product quality Solar gaps cares about
you and your family even in
