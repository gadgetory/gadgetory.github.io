us-based nonprofit design practice with
a global outreach and vision with the
recent increase in the number of
international refugees we knew that
addressing their dire need for decent
shelter would be a high priority for us
in many refugee camps residents
encounter a broad range of problems
inadequate security leaky and flood
prone structures a lack of adequate
living space for families a shortage of
natural light and health and sanitation
issues associated with shared public
toilets the refugee crisis has moved us
to develop a simple cost-effective
solution that not only addresses these
issues and problems but that can also be
easily assembled by the end users with
very simple tools and no construction
experience the heads house is a
dignified home that can easily serve as
both a transitional and permanent
shelter all the components are designed
to be packed and shipped flat hence it
can be rapidly deployed the hexagonal
form it is a more rigid than a square
form
eliminating the need for added structure
it has a toilet a shower a kitchen two
bedrooms and a living space the
structural insulated panels or sips that
are used for the walls floors and roof
provides security and protection from
the harsh weather conditions the 47
square meters are approximately 500
square foot units are adaptable scalable
and can accommodate larger families
units can be disassembled relocated and
reused elsewhere assembly is simple
concrete pier foundations are dug and
poured adjustable steel legs are set on
top of the piers floor beams are
fastened to the steel legs
and structural insulated panel floors
are attached to the floor beams
structural insulated panel exterior and
interior walls are then fastened to
floor panels interior and exterior
finishes can be easily customized roof
panels are anchored directly to the
exterior walls with no need for
additional structure and a simple steel
and tuber porch is attached insulated
windows skylights and doors are
installed finally an aluminum gutter is
attached to the roof panels individual
units are combined into clusters of five
to create share and exterior spaces and
amenities we've teamed up with prominent
engineering firms in Frankfort and
Minneapolis to engineer the hex house
systems and begin construction on a
prototype in the spring of 2017
the hex house is simple but
sophisticated design makes it a smart
and sustainable solution for more than
refugee shelters there's an increased
demand for small efficient and
affordable homes and we plan to cater to
this market with customizable hex house
kits that can be delivered right to
customers doors by allowing people to
build their own homes substantial cost
savings can be realized by homeowners
ever since we introduced the hex house
in design publications the feedback has
been overwhelmingly positive every day
we receive inquiries about where to buy
the hex nuts the world is a rapidly
changing place and with that our needs
are changing also with your support
we'll be able to develop the hex house
prototype and make available to society
a rapidly deployable scalable affordable
housing solution that is much needed in
today's world
when my grandfather not founded the
Tiffin company his philosophy was simple
find out what the customer wants and
give it to them
two years ago we asked our engineers at
steadicam headquarters in Burbank to
create the best electronic handheld
stabilizer with no limitations we took
our study camp technology that's been
used in Hollywood for the last 40 years
and coupled it with Steve Wagner's
genius software design and by partnering
with aerial drone manufacturer unique it
allowed us to create this Steadicam
vault the best electronic handheld
stabilizer with no limitations the study
can volt like all its predecessors is a
expanded system with the center of
gravity right at a gimbal it accepts any
phone any case that allows you to walk
around precisely frame the things that
you want to see and move the camera in
the way that we're used to seeing on a
feature film
it's an electronically gyro augmented
study cam for smartphones that weighs 1
pound with the inertia and the feel of a
big 40-pound rig
three axis gimbal they're not terrific
at following action one two three one
two three a little lag there the study
Campbell gives you stability and agility
and that's the key the Volt effectively
puts study cam technology in the palm of
your hand our mission has always been to
help people create the world's greatest
images
so back us today we can't wait to see
what you guys are going to create
you
drone ball go is a revolutionary
invention that represents a marked
enhancement over rigid in cage protected
drones where drone ball go sets itself
apart is with its fully flexible ball
shaped outer cage and its patent-pending
stabilization system these innovations
allow Jerome ball go to remain stable on
its multi axis running ring track making
it crash happy yes it's a literally
impossible to crash the cage didn't
rigid protected drones currently on the
market are adversely affected by
collisions since they are not decoupled
from their protective cages and usually
cannot recover before hitting the ground
drone ball go is a high-speed
high-powered brushless technology drone
that's miles ahead in terms of
innovation and fun other cutting-edge
professional-grade components include
1080p camera GPS brushless motors
hobby-grade advanced flight controller
thanks to its intelligently designed
rotating frame drone ball go bounces in
rolls effortlessly this special design
allows for a small 34 centimeter
diameter outer cage enabling drone ball
go to access tight spaces that other
drones can't also thrown ball goes
running track is fixed in position and
the cage bars in front of the camera are
minimized ensuring a clear camera view
dropout goes remarkable stability allows
it to drive fly scale walls in zoom
across the ceiling in full six axis of
direction drone ball go has a 400 meter
fpv operational range and a 400 meter
2.4 gigahertz range you can even conduct
building inspections beyond line of
sight thanks to real-time lag free video
streaming direct to the LCD screen
supporting all of this technology is
drone ball goes quick-release easy to
change low-cost rechargeable lipo 3s
battery which allows for 10 minutes of
flight time and minimizes downtime drone
BALCO can be deployed indoors or
outdoors incorporate auto takeoff
landing in altitude home and its
protective cage makes it safer people
and animals with your help
trimble go will usher in a new era of
drone technology
one that can be enjoyed by everyone this
is control the robot it has the same DNA
as sophisticated hundred thousand dollar
industrial robot arms elegantly reduced
down to desktop size and made as
affordable as a coffee machine now
anyone can own their own robot just plug
in a laptop and take control with a full
range of articulation through six axis
controls uses O's unlimited as your
imagination from teaching your children
to code through play to clever
applications for small business to
science and education uses control the
robot provides endless opportunities it
works right out of the box and the
completely open source interface means
you can control it with your favorite
programming language or simple
conversation or text commands or use
physical manipulation to teach it
repeatable tasks you can also connect
multiple arms to work together end of
arm tools are easy to change and will be
available for endless uses including
grips laser engravers suction pads spray
nozzles 3d printing and more with a
camera control can also find and
recognize all users will be able to
write their own applications and share
the code globally creating your database
of control the robot programs from
creating a miniature factory for your
business to raising the next generation
of genius inventors control the robots
means anyone can now control a robot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
