hey I'm Adrian the Canadian this is the
carry on climate there's a suitcase
designed to help you stay organized when
you're on the go step one the problem
we've all been there you're travelling
on the road you open your suitcase up
and get to your hotel room and
everything goes everywhere nobody likes
that nobody likes digging for their
stuff and then worst of all when you
check out you have to repack everything
and if you're on one of those trips
where you stay two nights per hotel you
keep changing you have to keep repeating
that process over and over and over
again I've been there most of 2017 I was
on the road I've never stayed in the
same bed for more than six nights in a
row this was just a natural solution to
the problem that I was facing of not
being able to stay organized
it's a carry-on suitcase that is a
built-in shelving system it's
self-supporting so it stands on the
handle of the suitcase itself this
allows you to stay organized super
easily the shelving system has six
shelves you can pack them each to being
about 70% full then you can compress it
into space the top one is fully hard on
all four sides
that's for your toiletries your
toothpaste the things you don't want
squeezing out all over your clothes the
center shelf is extra large that's for
large sweaters scarfs end up compressing
quite a bit but they just take up space
when you unpack we all need to charge
our phones about a hundred times a day
there's side pockets for cables and
little small items and I always keep the
socks and none of these down in the
bottom
you can pack it with or without the
shelving system there's a large mesh
pocket here that you can use for storing
shoes or any other kind of items and in
the compression section there's also the
area you can use for storing cables or
other small items in these other mesh
pockets one of the biggest requesting
pad is can you make a bigger version
absolutely introducing the 20% bigger
Ariane plus it's got all the same
features just a little bit larger all
the lining material and this product is
made from recycled plastic we launched
the original carry-on closet last winter
and then we can't keep them in stock we
keep selling them out and we just got
featured in Time Magazine's top 15 best
inventions of the year I still can't
stop smiling about that one and now
we're back this is suitcase 2.0 and
we're offering it here on Kickstarter to
you guys first before we place our first
order so you guys can get exclusive
access to the very first units what
makes this the 2.0 we've developed a
better closure system it opens in just a
pinch there's an easy access USB port
for charging on-the-go and you can use
any power bank you'd like the suitcase
is made from a German designed
polycarbonate shell the quarters have
metal reinforcements the suitcase is
held together by a jet-black aluminum
frame the wheels are smooth strong and
silent and a soft touch grip that
everyone loves when you're travelling on
the go security is always a thing it
comes with the tsa approved three-digit
lock it happens in less than a second
you don't have to bend over to tie on
slip on wiggle on or strap on your shoes
introducing our newest Kissick shoes you
step in they pop on the only time you
should be thinking about you
is when you're putting on your shoes
when your feet hurt and our goal was to
eliminate both of those problems we
wanted to design a shoe that embraced
the way that people naturally put on
their shoes
the secret is in this little band of
titanium that wraps around your heel so
it provides a little bit of support for
your heel but at the same time it allows
for the heel to completely compress and
rebound back around your foot once you
produce a machine we fix titanium
because after trying all the other
materials the titanium was the only one
that gave us the combination that we
needed of both flexibility and rebounder
the titanium spring will last longer
than your other shoes work well past the
concept in inventing stage and past the
design and prototype phase and now we're
on to the manufacturing stage we want to
get these kids excuse to the world and
we just need your help we've secured
manufacturing from a responsible
facility that produces shoes some of the
best shoes facility that makes some of
the top best from world's top bring Bri
secured we found a good place to make
the shoes okay join our Kickstarter and
you can be among the first to get a pair
of our Kissick shoes only available
online we'll be selling them for $100 on
our site but their Kickstarter you can
get a pair for $80 or less we also have
some incredible deals for early bird
supporters and more amazing rewards for
all of our supporters when you stop
thinking about your shoes because it
every day we designed two kids excuse to
be extremely comfortable from the
contoured footbed inside to the high
rebound of insulin
for shock absorption you're gonna love
the way your kids shoes support us today
our early bird specials are going fast

universal USB C port but still need a
dongle for practically everything what

your iPad pro that is able to provide
all the ports you need introducing hyper
drive the adapter that replaces all
other dongles now you can connect an
HDMI display USB C data micro SD or SDHC
3.0 devices and headphones all while
charging the iPad pro at full speed
stop figuring out how to store and carry
your dongles with hyperdrive just pack

available in both silver and Space Gray
to match the iPad pro and the same hyper
drive works with the 11 inch and the
twelve point nine inch iPad pro these
three plastic dongles cost a hundred and
seventeen dollars at the Apple store but

aluminum hyper drive with all the same
ports and more starting at $49 but only

hi Kickstarter does your room look like
this clothes thrown everywhere and
scattered all over the bed you know what
your clothes get wrinkled sometimes
you'll have things dropping out of the
pockets or even have trouble finding
where your clothes on
this is not because you are lazy I
designed this hanger to find a way to
organize pants and an easier and smarter
way and after several tests I finally
created this hurdle hanger
it's made of high-quality plastic with a
non-slip rubber arm it's simple to use
just hook your clothes on both sides of
the hanger
or pull your pants over the open end
this way you can neatly hang more
clothes
and add additional space under your
clothes how to use hurdle hang hook your
pants fold your pants knit wear on the
arm save your slacks from forming extra
wrinkles place tomorrow's clothes on the
front look
Hurdle hangar
have you ever experienced these
situations at the most critical moment
the game controller dies or when you're
about to take the perfect picture the
battery for the flesh runs out or when
you are playing with a remote-control
car it suddenly stops in the middle of
nowhere at 10'o volts we believe that
battery needs to be more efficient and
better cater your needs that is why we
have created tena volts the most
advanced rechargeable lithium battery
tinna volts only takes two hours to a
full charge whereas nickel metal hydride
rechargeable batteries take around 10
hours on a single charge 10a volts
offers a stable performance with more
than 12 hours after 1000 charge cycles
tenable its usable capacity still stands
at 70% while other brands fall below 50%
after 500 cycles the best part tinna
volts is the world's first rechargeable
lithium battery that offers a consistent
power output of 1.5 volts but words mean
nothing without proof right over the
course of our four years R&amp;amp;D we've
obtained six national and world patents
and passed many testings let the numbers
speak by themselves we are testing the
10 of volts with the inner loop Pro for
a car racing test you'll see within one
hour ten of volts reaches five hundred
and thirty cycles outnumbering and a
loop by 100 cycles when checking the lap
times 10 of volts achieves us steady
times for each lap a significant
difference that shows tenna volts has a
better voltage consistency we did a
flashlight experiment to compare the 10
a volts and eneloop Pro 10 of volts is
able to provide a constant brightness
with its 1.5 consistent output voltage
at tenable our mission is to bring the
best rechargeable lithium batteries to
our customers so give us a chance and
support us on IndieGoGo today let's make
dream a reality</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
