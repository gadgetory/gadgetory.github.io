it's like they took the smart and smart
phone and replaced it with not enough
storage fum dude just sync it to your
computer it's not that hard yes I've
already tried
what about iCloud they keep trying to
get me to pay for more storage offline
storage worked just fine
five years ago but now all of my devices
are made with limited storage so the man
can lock me into some kind of lifetime
subscription plan all of the other cloud
storage companies want to take my stuff
and rent it back to me
I want modern storage that's reliable
and convenient access wherever I am in
the world
I want to fly with enough storage to
last a lifetime not fees I want a cloud
that keeps my phone free to take photos
a cloud that lets me stream my entire
music library even the family friendly
edits indie bands and special editions
t-swift included enter cloud by Dabney a
private and shareable cloud that
actually delivers on the promise of you
having access to all of your stuff from
anywhere it goes in your house and looks
great next to that photo of you and Mom
you plug in Ethernet here tower there
and stack as much storage as you need
choose a URL and you're immediately up
and running it's a physical space for
your digital stuff address included just
like your home has an address cloud has
an address that you choose like the
Joneses com it uses your private home
internet connection not public servers
that belong to someone else
cloud smart enough to know things like
how to sync files between devices when
to free up space on your phone and of
course no server should be without good
security with cloud I have a clear view
of who I've shared my stuff with and who
can stream what I've shared watch this I
can easily grant people access to things
I choose and just as easily revoke it
cloud has no lame restrictions who I can
share with how many devices I can use at
a time so I can just pay once for the
space I need you know actually buy and
own it
this renting subscribing champions
expandable affordable secure this is the
future I was promised
join us and making the internet great
again pre-order now and be among the
first to get a cloud of your own
you
this is the aqil serious a the world's
most versatile Windows 10 mini PC ever
created it's a complete desktop PC
equipped with powerful hardware
components for optimal performance wired
and wireless options enable you to
create a comfortable workspace within
seconds you can enjoy working in silence
as the serious a doesn't require a fan
for cooling the unique switch mode
developed in direct partnership with
Microsoft changes the serious a into an
input device once you connect it to a
screen
the Aqil sirius a is small enough to fit
into your bag or pocket you don't even
realize you're carrying a complete
computer with you the full HD
touchscreen and integrated battery allow
you to use the device unplugged and on
the go the aqil sirius a is extremely
versatile it's the easiest way to store
and share content it's the remote
control for all your smart home devices
it's the gateway to your favorite media
it's your gaming device it's your
connection with the people you care
about
do you remember the first time you
streamed the video on your smartphone at
that moment you are no longer tied to
your living room for your entertainment
or to your office for work you could
access your content anywhere but there's
one small problem your small mobile
device screen almost all of us prefer
large displays for entertainment and for
work and those work deadlines are
approaching a large desktop monitor our
dual screen setup will significantly
boost your productivity so what if there
is a way to have the mobility of a phone
tablet or laptop without losing the
benefit of a large screen it sounds
impossible but that's exactly what we
did introducing sput the spontaneous
pop-up display spud is a high-resolution
24 inch display that collapses down to
the size of a book and weighs less than
2 pounds this revolutionary product is
the first truly collapsible display and
the only device that gives you both
portability and a large screen for
entertainment and productivity Sorrell
the spud design process we focus on
image quality and ease of use we use the
latest projection technology combined
with our own custom optics to project a
large high-quality image over very short
distance this enables spa to produce a
bright sharp image that's about 4 times
larger than a laptop screen and 23 times
larger than a smartphone screen
to makes about as easy to use as
possible we designed to work just like a
ruggedized umbrella you can pop up the
screen in a very intuitive way and you
have this bus setup and run in less than
10 seconds as syncs but it's also
lightweight battery-powered and uses a
hassle-free HDMI connection we can get
straight to the big screen you want
without wasting any time on setup one of
the most exciting things about spud is
the many different ways that you can use
them on the entertainment side spud is
basically a portable TV or movie screen
whether you're traveling camping hanging
out with friends at a coffee shop or
just lounging around your house it's the
big screen that you can use anywhere for
work having a dual screen setup is great
productivity but you can also use it for
presentations and it's a collaboration
tool it's great for trade shows sales
visits or any kind of field work
spud gives you the flexibility you need
no matter the situation and it's great
because it's a complete solution in a
very small package that you can take
anywhere we have the team the product
and the vision to execute on spud and
now all we need is your support by
backing us on Kickstarter you're
becoming part of our founding community
as a special thank you we'll be adding
all of our Kickstarter backers to an
exclusive VIP list that gives you early
access to discount codes products
updates and beta testing opportunities
so Kickstarter what will you do with
your spud
I love my laptop I rely on it every day
and I take it everywhere but
economically laptops are not ideal
the longer we spend on them the more we
hunch leading to tension or pain in our
neck shoulders and back which is why
we've designed the Tiny Tower a portable
and height adjustable laptop stand the
tiny tower allows you to set up and get
to work in no time whether it's at the
office at home in a cafe or wherever it
has an elegant design which integrates
beautifully with your laptop helping you
work comfortably and protect your
posture
I suffered a serious disc herniation in
my neck
after hunching over my laptop for too
long I realized that a lot of existing
products don't really solve the problem
and they're not something I want on my
desk so as an industrial designer I
decided to create a product that laptop
users would be proud to own the tiny
Tower has a clever push-button mechanism
that adjusts your laptop screen to a
height that suits you there are ten
different height levels available when
you're done it takes seconds to fall
down flat into a compact and lightweight
unit that you can take anywhere it's
compatible with both Mac and Windows
laptops from 11 to 15 inches in size
your laptop sits firmly and securely on
a non-slip grip all for added security
the tiny Tower has fingers you can
extend
we've also created a high-quality zipped
nylon pouch to carry your Tiny Tower
keyboard and mouse if you want a stylish
clever solution that's as portable as
your laptop and you care about your
posture and well-being while you work
and we'd love your support
you
