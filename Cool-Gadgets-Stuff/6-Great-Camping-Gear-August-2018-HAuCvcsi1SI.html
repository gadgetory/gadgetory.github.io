now light gives you access to instant
lights and power whatever the weather
wherever you are we've created a really
simple easy and efficient way of
generating renewable power using you
anytime we all take access to instant
lights and power for granted but what do
you do for a light and a power outage
how do you charge your phone when
camping and how about the 1 in 7 people
who do not have access to electricity
this is why we've created now light a
renewable source of light and power
ready whenever you need it
current renewable energy solutions are
either solely dependent on the Sun or
rely on inefficient and awkward manual
charging we knew we could develop a
better solution we've spent years
working on the optimum way to harness
human power
now light combines a highly efficient
dynamo with cutting-edge battery
technology just one second of manual
charging finds a whole minute of life
we're excited to introduce now lights
lets you generate light and power
instantly to get started just hook up
now light pull once to turn on and keep
pulling to charge just one minute of
pulling generates an hour obliged if the
sun shining attach the 3 watt solar
panel to charge up your now light
now lights has five brightness levels
from night lights to an ultra bright
light and the live power display adapts
to the amount of power you're using and
now I can even charge your devices just
plug in your phone or any other USB
powered device with an additional
satellite you can also spread light
around a room or use it as a task light</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
