platinum the first home use fat
reduction device that freezes away up to
24 percent of stubborn fat like most
people I always believe that diagnosed
says be enough to reduce telling fact
studies show that 95% of dieters fail
why because our fat cells are like smell
balloons when you're dieting exercise at
that cost rate and when you eat
they go back other sweating and calorie
counting just doesn't change the fact
whether it's a shrink or grow the number
of fat cells in your body always stays
the same wouldn't it be great to just
say goodbye the fat Fraser platinum uses
clinically proven technology to freeze
away stubborn fat from the comfort of
your own home to optimize results the
fat freezer platinum uses therapeutic
bio light in order to actively reduce
the size of fat cells the fat fries are
platinum will help you sculpt your body
in exactly the way you want and keep it
that way it's safe simple to use and
bottom line is it really works the fat
freezer uses a medically known
technology called cryolipolysis it's a
proven technique used in high-end
clinics all across the globe it's a safe
and non-invasive alternative solution to
liposuction but up until today that
freezing has just been too expensive you
would need to spend thousands of dollars
on several treatments just to see
results that's why the fat freezer team
has worked so hard to make fat freezing
more accessible
after years of research and development
they've managed to shrink this expensive
clinical technology into an affordable
easy to use fat freezing home device
that freezer technology uses controlled
cooling to freeze away stubborn fat
cells under your skin over the first few
weeks your body will naturally dissolve
and flush out the frozen fat cells in
our clinical pilot study tests for the
fact razor we found the results to be
overwhelming we saw anywhere from a 10
to 24 percent fat reduction in stubborn
areas without any complications and no
downtime
we also observed that as the fat cells
were flushed out of the system the
surrounding skin and muscle tissue
remains safe and healthy thanks to its
natural dissolving process the fat
freezer doesn't leave any saggy pockets
behind that's why it's one of the safest
and most effective aesthetic options
available today two hundred and ten
thousand units of our first generation
fat freezer have already been sold the
fat freezer device has been a
best-seller at sharper image rated 5
stars well over 200 times the feedback
has been amazing
first second-generation product we've
taken it one step further the fat Fraser
platinum now includes syrup Utica bio
light which actively helps reduce the
size of fat cells studies reveal that
when the sun's blue light penetrates the
skin and reaches the underlying fat
cells the fat shrinks and is naturally
released from the cell walls that's why
in the summer we tend to lose weight and
in the winter we tend to gain it back by
combining the fat freezing and blue
light technology we've optimized the fat
reducing process and taken it to a whole
new level these two proven technologies
will allow users to better eliminate fat
and keep it off the fat freezer system
is the only device available that can
effectively supplement your diet and
exercise yielding you maximum results
for minimal effort the bottom line is
simple relying on diet and exercise
alone to eliminate your stubborn fat
it's like fighting an uphill battle if
you too want to start sculpting your
body get your fat freezer platinum now

Spiros mission is to inspire the
freighters of tomorrow we've been making
robots for years seven or eight years
now and we've learned a lot of cool
lessons about how to make a robot and
why to make a robot over the last eight
years we've been building robots for all
sorts of different audiences we've got
tons of feedback from people and so we
finally decided we're gonna build the
robot for the people and this is that
robot Rover is our latest programmable
customizable robot and it's our most
complete most refined and most capable
robot ever Rover is an out-of-the-box
robotic platform and it comes along with
all this stuff just built in things like
driving and sensors that you can just
start on immediately but the thing that
makes it special is it's super
expandable what's super unique about
Rover as we put in a new our expansion
port which opens it up in a way that
we've never made available with Rover is
feels first platform that allows
students and makers to be able to
hardware hat if you've ever messed with
the Raspberry Pi or an Arduino or a
micro bit you can put that on to rover
and make that project mobile
Rover works with our Sphero eating you
out you get the rich experience of our
community and our edu ecosystem you
don't have to assemble anything you can
start coding right away you get a
complete polished product and then
you've got the ability to expand and
build it into anything you want
it's got all-terrain capabilities we've
got high torque motors with a high gear
ratio which allows it to go fast but
also allows us to go
really accurate at slow speeds something
disrupts the treads or if one tank tread
moves at a different speed than the
other festival when the heading that you
originally intended which is something
unique crew 10 could've easily the
driving experience is unlike anything
you've ever seen before we worked really
diligently to make sure the skier box or
bus made sure every single gear tooth
would be able to withstand mulch or
rocks weave infrared communication that
you can use to talk to other robots
other Rovers or even our bolts so they
can send messages to each other play tag
you've got an ambient light sensor
inside so it can detect you know
different life values and behave
differently Rover includes a 4600
milliamp hour battery rechargeable via
USB seized we knew this is first and
foremost a tool and you need to be able
to swap out a battery in the tool
and underneath there's a color sensor
which allows you to detect the color
value that's driving over and write
programming based on what color it
detects it's got a full nine axis I am
used we've got gyro accelerometer
magnetometer this is the platform I've
been waiting for it has the accuracy the
precision the durability the SDK the low
latency communication it has everything
you need to actually accomplish your
mission don't just move around but go do
something everything from the gear ratio
to the clearance underneath to how you
hold it how you interact with it has
been thought through we didn't just
choose the cheapest option we chose the
right option we wanted it to have
personality and be approachable and draw
people in you know there are a lot of
competitive products that are really
cool bots but you'll feel a ton of work
to get it up and running or it's super
easy to get up and running the pennant
doesn't do that much the thing we're
really trying to do is make something
that right out of the gate you can get
started but you can kind of keep going
with it for a long time
Rover is built for you guys we want the
hackers and the makers and the students
out there to take it and make the
coolest projects out there and help
