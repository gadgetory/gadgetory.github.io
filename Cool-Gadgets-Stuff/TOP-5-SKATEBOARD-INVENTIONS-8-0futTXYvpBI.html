to us our desert wasteland no way to
exercise our snow based passion so we
set out to change the summer experience
creating a new way to ride the car slide
with the feeling of snowboarding
anywhere in the world as snowboarders we
know the difference between the feeling
that you get snowboarding and everything
else so we developed and tested before
ourselves to ensure that the ride really
felt like silver we installed the
bulkier components like batteries and
wireless electronics on the top of the
deck so that the board rides lower to
the ground generating greater stability
performance we developed custom
electronics that allow for the transfer
of power to a motorized caster wheel
that can spin forever while keeping your
riding up to 20 miles per hour the leaf
uses the best automotive grade batteries
that will take you 16 thousand miles
before needing to be replaced
growing up snowboarding everybody knows
that
sad ride home on the last day of the
season and as a kid I always used to
dream about what do we like to snowboard
around my hometown school to work with
the technology that we've developed over
the last nine months you can bring the
mountain home with you an experienced
snowboarding wherever you live writing
the leaf is an incredible feeling for
anyone who knows what it's like with
snowboards on a mountain the leaf will
allow you to control your speed up to 20
miles an hour with the power to blast
through slides client Hills carve big
turns control your braking just as you
would with a snowboard and speed checks
and full stops using the same intuitive
process fun in a snowboard
from city streets to bike lane the small
town no snow where Hills needed with the
leaf you can turn pavement into powder
over the last three years we've been
planning building and testing a
prototype of a skate deck called castle
the cool thing about capsule is that
it's six times stronger is a normal
skateboard but the material still
respond very much the same as wood it's
totally recyclable and it absorbs much
more shock to save your needs we use a
similar material to what is used in
aerospace capsules which is impact
absorbing you can slide faster pop
higher it's waterproof and unaffected by
environmental conditions this deck is
perfect for the everyday skateboarder it
has the potential to last a lifetime
zero percent delamination risk and a
virtually unbreakable material structure
hi I'm Andrea and the co-founder of
capsule skateboards just imagine you'll
be able to try more tricks and the
impact of social will result in injury
free knee and joints no more support
rates no worries about the lamination or
weather conditions that affect the
Austin Aries skateboards for the main
materials we conducted extensive
research and testing and pound the
ethics balanced behavior in terms of
flexing agent strength weight it is a
high strength skateboard that
significantly reduces the impact on your
knees
and the entire body because the board
itself can absorb the energy
we are also working on placing sensors
inside the skateboard so you can track
your riding and measure the stress and
the best thing is we offer two different
models with the skateboard for
seventy-five dollars and the longboard
models for 125 dollars we started to
build this skateboard three years ago in
our lab with our main aim to provide an
alternative option for the skater and
save the environment from the needless
extraction of booked it's not just about
how all skateboards can easily break or
become Z laminated it's also about how
more than 2-million maple trees are cut
down every year to produce skateboards
it's about you and me being independent
of toxic and breakable wood products
me
what if there's a better or a different
way to mix cables these natural and
sustainable resources will design a new
manufacturing
it shows the answers all around and
conduct cars at home make student
clothes - Kate watch our ham skateboards
are a complete change and innovation in
the way skateboards are maintained
unique skateboard constructions that the
awesome characteristics the hands
performance proves there is a
sustainable and responsible towards we
present to position the 24-inch Mulla
featuring a mellow concave with a kick
tail and the bigger and the 8 inch
Richter with a kick on both hands or
even more fun
hemp is a renewable fast growing and
recycled material it also happens to
have one of the strongest natural fibers
hemp production is a zero waste low
energy process for all by-product are
you
fibers are bound together with a durable
plant-based presence derived from
sustainable source materials a lot
research

whether you are a serious Lancet rather
daily spread moment one that simply
loves to cruise the earth carefully clad
to the boards to teach you all chose
materials and processes interests in the
industry from the environmental
