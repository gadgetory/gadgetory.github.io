seasons I'm mark and I'm tom this is
beeline moto V line moto is a beautiful
intuitive navigation device and change
the way you write
nearly three years ago we can kick-start
/ trip back navigation device devices
we've shipped that to over 3000 people
it's been sold around the world ever
since we don't just ride push bikes now
we're back to be like motor we've taken
everything that people love so much
about that first product what it into
finding the ultimate navigation devices
motorcycles
it's high-tech it's tougher but at its
core is that same concept of kickstart
to my storm in 2010 a beeline moto
attaches to any bike in moments with the
twist lock mechanism and a variety of
different marks setting up routes just
takes a few taps on the smartphone app
but you can even upload GPX routes and
once you're set up you don't need a data
connection it's very useful to have it
when we arrive in with a group and you
don't always have to rise in a pack you
can have your own ride and get a
destination you just have to follow one
direction it's very easy we've kept the
interface intentionally really simple
there are two modes for navigation as
route mode which guides you along a
specific route and takes you through
every single time and then those compass
mode which simply points you at a final
destination and gives you the freedom to
choose the route
some of the best parts are being on a
bike is that you don't have to be
hindered by traffic in that big red
light be like gives me that freedom
moves through traffic and know where I'm
going but also create my own room if I
need to I love the simplicity and just
being able to get an information need
quickly is amazing it's waterproof and
shockproof and has a really sturdy
mounting mechanism battery lasts for 30
hours of use and is been charged by USB
the display works great in direct
sunlight but also has a backlight for
nighttime lighting and the app will
track all of your rights so you can go
back and see what you did I think I love
most about Vitas it only gives you the
information that you actually need or as
I have a phone up there's just so much
going on that you actually lose track of
what's happening it really brings back
the sort of purity of running a bike
again yes put it on and it's good to go
we are Daredevils but we're not naive we
know that your helmet is the single most
important accessory for your riding
experience so we designed the best damn
helmet in the market the j√§rva Shaq's a
are smart helmet
the Jarvis shacks AR helmet is made out
of a lightweight aerodynamic
polycarbonate carbon fiber shell with
built in wide-angle 2 K front and rear
cameras that offer 360-degree field and
the industry's first voice-activated
retractable heads-up display the Jarvis
ax AR helmet connects to your smartphone
via bluetooth allowing you to see
incoming call notifications Road slip
warning weather notification gas-station
icon dangerous section warning the speed
warning traffic notification GPS
navigation and rear view images on
demand
I forgot to introduce our guest of honor
hi Alexa hey it's great to be here all
these features and more can be
controlled by voice command since safety
is our number one priority
the Jarvis helmet has CNS do tec safety
certifications anti-fog anti-scratch
anti glare visor and 100% military-grade
battery
our state-of-the-art technology empowers
every rider to enjoy the riding
experience and don't deny it this is
your dream helmet
tobacco motor wear is all about finding
the perfect balance of form and function
to bring serious motorcyclists the most
stylish protective clothing possible
that's why we are beyond excited to
introduce our latest and most ambitious
product yet it's the real deal this is
the McCoy jacket as riders ourselves we
know how hard it can be to find the
right motorcycle jacket and well heavy
branding or flashy high vis certainly
has its place we wanted to create a
timeless motorcycle jacket something
that goes beyond being just another
piece of riding gear something that
instead would be a go-to favorite that
you would wear for any occasion on or
off the bike if you don't put it on it
can't protect you that's why this jacket
had to be something riders would love to
wear we started with durable waterproof
wax cotton canvas so you don't have to
worry about getting caught in a downpour
on your way home like good denim and
leather wax canvas
Agis extremely well so you can count on
the jacket only getting better with age
the inside is lined with soft flannel
and it has breathable satin lining in
the sleeves to wick moisture away from
the skin and help regulate your
temperature as a rider you can never
have enough cargo space that's why the
McCoy has eight large pockets throughout
four large bucket pockets in front two
hand pockets and two zippered pockets
inside cinch belts on the sides allow
you to adjust your jacket for the
perfect fit every detail has been
considered from YKK zippers to our
custom anti scratch hardware to the
genuine leather accents this jacket will
get noticed every time you wear but it's
still understated in its design this
isn't just a fashion piece the McCoy is
a real motorcycle jacket with lots of
functionality built in for the avid ride
gusseted shoulders expand to let you
reach your handlebar
without feeling tight across the back
and for warmer days the jacket sleeves
can be opened up at the wrist to
increase airflow as well as under our
mesh vents so you can ride comfortably
three seasons a year
the next strap allows you to close out
the elements but if you want to leave it
undone it won't be slapping you around
either a hidden magnet in the collar
holds it securely in place so you don't
have to try to fasten it down on the
floor
let's talk protection the McCoy jacket
has five built-in pockets for removable
d3o armor and the elbows shoulders and
back d3o is famous for their lightweight
flexible and comfortable armour products
that can really take a hit if they have
to and for Kickstarter backers we are
including the d3o armor for free the
vast majority of riding gear is made
overseas but just like our jeans and
riding shirts the McCoy jacket will be
hand-sewn right here in America by
skilled craftsmen when you buy American
you support local workers and the made
in the US movement while we can
guarantee personally the highest quality
you're a hundred percent gonna want this
jacket don't miss your opportunity to
have one of our first american-made
heirloom quality motorcycle jackets
