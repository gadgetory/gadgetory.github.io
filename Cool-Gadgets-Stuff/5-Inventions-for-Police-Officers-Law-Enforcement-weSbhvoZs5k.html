officers are confronting people who
because of reasons of their choices or
reasons beyond their choices they need
to be subdued in a non-lethal way rep
technology is an innovator of modern
policing solutions we created this
non-lethal solution for law enforcement
specifically with the purpose of not
causing pain the goal is to restrain an
individual to create a safe space
between the citizen and the officer
that's intended to be used very early in
an encounter with an individual that
could be armed non assaultive but
non-compliant our product is
specifically designed for people
suffering mental health issues mental
crisis is subtype self-induce and it's a
safe way to stop an individual from
progressing forward causing harm to
themselves or to those around them
this gives us an option to take someone
into custody without hurting themselves
others and the police officers this is
an impressive step forward in giving
another tool to police officers so that
they can reduce injuries to themselves
and to the people they're serving before
you you go to a petard before you go to
a Taser before you go to your firearm
this should be the lowest level of
restraint this is one of the most pain
free level of restraint that is on the
market today
this is Marvel meted reality spider-man
has nothing on both I'm really intrigued
by the product and it's a lot cheaper
than a lawsuit it's a lot cheaper than
sending officers to court and if we can
prevent an officer from having to put
their hands on a suspect and prevent
somebody from getting hurt then I'm all
for it yeah it does save quite a bit of
money in litigation but also in the
general public's opinion they'll look at
law enforcement as being creative and
trying to figure out a way in dealing
with those and mental crisis and not
resolving to use of force with a firearm
as an example or a Taser
I think the community would love a
product like this what they're seeing on
the news
is use of force and extreme use of force
I think this would go a long way in
helping our perception our team began
demonstrating the bowler app 100 about
six months ago
and the response from law enforcement
and military it's been nothing short of
incredible we've had national and
international coverage from over 40
networks we've had reporters and elected
officials wrapped and deploying a device
on television the bowler app is truly
expanded in an extraordinary way we've
had requests from over 300 departments
in 30 countries to see demonstration to
understand how to test a product and
pricing our founder our chief technology
officer and our in-house embed there
Elwood we call him woody Nora who
happens to also be my father because
over 100 patents to his name he's world
famous and we're lucky to have him on
the team we're working on several
variations to the product today
including a virtually silent version of
this product specifically to address the
consumer market and also to address the
threats that we see in our school
systems as well as working side-by-side
with the US Navy SEALs to put the
product on a drone so policing has
changed over the last few decades so the
challenge that we have now we need to
have the response it's appropriate so
having something that it's non-lethal
that we can bring to the table to help
restrain people I think is going to be
the change of policing in the future I
think the product is outstanding this is
going to save lives
you
the Throwbot xt from recon robotics is
the world's most versatile tactical
robot it protects the lives of tactical
operators and helps resolve dangerous
situations by delivering immediate video
and audio reconnaissance these
capabilities provide operators with
increased situational awareness and
greater standoff distance to factors
that help teams mitigate risks and make
informed effective decisions the throw
bot XT has several characteristics that
make it indispensable to SWAT narcotics
and counterterrorism teams it's small
and lightweight immediately deployable
throwable 236 meters and extremely quiet
weighing just five hundred forty grams
and measuring less than twenty
centimeters wide the t xt fits easily
into a small pack along with a hand out
operative control unit morale the robot
can be deployed in less than five
seconds by pulling the activation pin
and throwing it into any environment a
single joystick on the OCU is used to
control the movement of the robot the t
xt can survive repeated lateral throws
of up to 36 meters and vertical drops of
9 meters once deployed it moves very
quietly delivering life-saving audio and
video reconnaissance without letting the
suspects know that it is on the c the
robot is also equipped with an infrared
optical system that automatically turns
on when the ambient light is low the
Throwbot xt may be specified in any of
three transmitting frequencies enabling
entry teams to simultaneously operate up
to three robots in the same environment
in addition the t xt can be paired with
a recon scout search stick which
immediately converts the robot into a
pole camera to clear rooftops attics and
crawl spaces
lastly the new command Mattern station
2.0 allows a command post to receive
video and audio transmissions from the
Throwbot xt from up to three hundred
five meters away
tactical commanders and negotiators can
now see and hear the intelligence
gathered by the robot in real-time
enabling all personnel to deliver an
integrated response to any situation
you
a gun is fired somewhere in your city so
what happens now
in the past there was a slim chance the
shooting would be reported to police at
all even when it was it took precious
time and there was often confusion
regarding the location of the shooting
and other pertinent information at least
that's how things were shot spot has
changed all that my utilizing advanced
technology honed over two decades we
have automated the process we monitor
gun fire activity 24/7 so if a gun is
fired in any area within shot spotter
coverage the system detects locates and
immediately alerts police of the gunshot
so how does it work
it starts with acoustic sensors that are
placed on buildings or lamp posts
throughout a neighborhood if a gun is
fired anywhere in the area multiple
sensors detect and timestamp the sound
the precise location of the gunshot is
determined based on the amount of time
it takes for the sound of the gunshot to
travel to each individual sensor
effectively triangulating the sound the
exact location of the detected gunshot
is indicated by a dot on a map once an
alert is generated it is immediately
sent to our IRC or incident review
Center we're trained acoustic experts
then analyze each incident in mere
seconds determining if the sound is
gunfire shot spotter acoustic analysts
receive extensive training on reviewing
and classifying gunfire by
distinguishing gunshots from other
impulsive sounds that are not gunshots
in addition they are trained to append
additional contextual information such
as multiple shooter alerts or full
automatic weapons alerts that can prove
to be essential tactical intelligence
for law enforcement agencies responding
to these crimes the entire transaction
takes place in less than 60 seconds with
the real-time shot spotter alerts police
can immediately be dispatched to the
scene utilizing the gunfire audio clip
and tactical information officers can
approach an exact
location quickly and safely to engage
the shooter interview witnesses and
collect key evidence at the crime scene
shot spotters respond app enables patrol
officers to receive real-time alerts
quickly and effectively in their patrol
car on MDT's or on-the-go on their
smartphones the shot spotter alert
system is used in more than 90 cities
and is an invaluable tool to help make
communities safer by responding to
gunshot incidents faster making it easy
to find evidence and reducing risk for
police officers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
