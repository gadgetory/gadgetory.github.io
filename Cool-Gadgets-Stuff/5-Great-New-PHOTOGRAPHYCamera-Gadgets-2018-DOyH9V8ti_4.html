I'm a Kickstarter I'm Kris inventor of
isolate for nearly 20 years I've made a
living as an artisan photographer
there's been a lot of innovation in the
transition from film to digital strobes
batteries LEDs are cheaper more powerful
than they've ever been
yet we use them much the way we did in
the 1950s what if I told you there was a
new way to light your photos for the
first time ever you can adjust real
light after the shutter has snout for
the past two and a half years we've been
developing a technology that does just
that
to show you what isolate is all about I
brought my friend lolly in she's a
photographer and she's gonna use isolate
for the first time so how does it work
well it fits in your light like any
other softbox a beauty dish what makes
isolate unique have a special optical
components that encode the light these
are used generally in scientific and
medical imaging but never before in
conventional photography all the
information is captured in a single raw
file how is that possible the Iceland
hardware encodes the light into very
specific wavelengths and then we can
easily decode it with our software
essentially splitting them into editable
layers once you've adjusted the light
you edit as you would any other photo
instead of pushing pixels you're playing
with light akan videos of penis
so now you've seen what Isolite can do
and how it works and now we need your
help
depending on how much you pledged you
could receive some great extras unique
opportunities and of course be the first
experiment with I select so please back

my name is Bradley Devine and I do
travel and lifestyle photography and
videography my name is Jessica janae and
I'm an international wedding and fashion
photographer I'm in Deer Isle and I'm a
destination wedding photographer my name
is Erin Brimhall and I am an outdoor
lifestyle slash automotive photographer
well I love about the universal lens
count is I love how it grabs onto the
lens and the only way it's gonna come
off is if I pull it off and I love that
it does fully pertain to protect what's
most important about my lens and the
glass and I feel like it's something
that should have existed a long time ago
my favorite thing about the universal
lens cap is when I have the lens cap on
I'm shooting something a wedding I bump
against something doesn't just fall off
so I like that these really grip your
lens it's super hard and so no matter
what happens it doesn't fall off which
is glorious and nothing kick it in it I
feel like even if I'm shooting in sand
and dirt and dust and nothing can get in
there into the cracks water anything
it's very protected I love that it's
Universal because I can put it on both
ends of every single one of my lenses
and it's so much nicer for travel so I
don't have to like pack every single
little type of lens cap for each
specific lens
I keep way better track of them and it
keeps my lenses protected throwing them
in and out of bags and stuff like that
well I like about this the most is you
mean you can put it in your pocket you
know whenever you need to it's not like
in there as like a big old hold I like
how its stretchy so it can fit on any
like any type of lens you have you know
if it's on the 7250 all my live lenses
like my Sigma's that have the design I'm
already you just stretch them over it's
nice and then if it's on the back so you
don't have a calf anymore I feel like
it's something that should have existed
a long time ago and the lenses have
existed so like this is something that's
definitely going to protect what's most
importantly the camera that's the glass
and lens so I really like it
introducing the lower aperture power GX
ND the world's first variable graduated
neutral density filter the raw aperture
power GX ND is a hard transition
graduated neutral density filter with
continuously variable range up to five
stumps using the or aperture power GX ND
we can maintain proper exposure of the
shadows without blowing out the
highlights the beauty of power GX ND
filter is that one candle in a proper
exposure for both highlights and shadows
graduate neutral density filters have
fixed values and how much light that can
stop and they typically only come in
single stop values with no fractional
values in between stops with a power of
G X and D filter all you need to do is
to rotate the filter until you get your
desired result it is as simple as that
we include a slimmed aperture for
directly mounting the power GX ND filter
on lenses which allows for rotation and
single axis movement between the filter
and the lens we also provide adapter
plate to use a power GX ND filter play
square filter system the power GX indeed
is based on our innovative power x ND
filters that we introduced in 2016 the
power GX ND features the same
multi-layer nano coatings from the power
x and d mm these coatings are able to
repel oil water dust and dirt from the
surface of the filter we have added
heart stomps to power jacks and deep to
limit rotation this was a highly
demanded feature especially for video
usage
the power of GX indeed also features a
brand new director eating scale another
highly demanded feature the power GX &amp;amp; D
features Shah v2 semi-gloss for today's
modern high density sensors and 4k video
requirements the power G X and D filters
are offered in three sizes for multitude
of lens coverage requirements we believe
the power GX indeed is an innovative and
valuable tool for both videographers and
photographers with your support we can
bring it to life</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
