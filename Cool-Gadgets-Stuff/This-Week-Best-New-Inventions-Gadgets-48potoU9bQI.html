I love doing pull-ups and yet I had
nowhere to pull apart after I was
finished
sometimes I try and just shove it under
the bed or I leave it on the bedroom
floor or on the apartment floor
somewhere just to look terrible and took
up a lot of space
ask any personal trainer and they'll
tell you how important Colts are to a
good fitness routine and yet the
equipment we'd used to do pull-ups at
home hasn't been improved in years
hi my name is Erik what I really wanted
was a full bar that's easy to store
that's a piece of cake to set up and one
that I can carry with me when I go
traveling so that I don't have to break
my routines and start all over every
time much of the trip nothing like it
existed so I decided to create it I'm
thrilled to introduce you to flexor with
the world's first foldable Coolibar to
use the flexor just hook the top into
the doorway and you're ready for your
workout the bar folds and unfolds in
under 3 seconds and takes up less than
1/4 the states of a traditional full of
fire you can easily tuck it away in any
extra space you have in a drawer or a
clog the frame is made from high-grade
durable yet lightweight metals and the
door support is made from the quality
injection molded plastic the flexor is
designed to hold up to 250 pound it
folds to under 2 feet by 1 foot by 6
inches and weighs less than 6 pounds the
flexor requires no assembly at all just
pull it out of the box
unfold it in under three seconds and
you're ready to go you can use the
flexor to do pull-ups chin ups sit ups
dips legless and a whole range of other
exercises it's a full-body gym all by
itself
what you're seeing is a man fighting a
teddy bear in the snow this man is not
crazy is the presenter of apricot the
most innovative durable feature-packed
goddamn terrific adventure cult and it
won't burn hole in your pocket how come
because well big grand companies spend
their money on ads and stores we spent
our budget on research development and
material to make a better coat even this
video is the cheapest video we could
possibly make one cameraman one
presenter and one incredible adventure
coat apricot was made by real
adventurers who went through every
possible challenge to find what a real
adventure coat means every aspect of the
coat was rethought from the ground up it
all starts with high mature an
innovative installation system that
keeps you warm in cold conditions and
cool in warm ones and is super
breathable and super light hey got you
cold you like I mean it is the coat
light cool with apricot we also
rethought the way pockets are built into
jackets each of apricots many many
pockets was designed individually to fit
any essentials you need to carry all the
pockets are stitch welded to be
waterproof but the pockets are only
tapped to store it we invented a design
method called ewd
differential weight distribution which
ensures the coat feels empty even if you
pack it full of gear in other words
carry all that stuff and feel like
you're carrying no stuff pretty genius
what else oh yeah the state back thanks
reasonably-priced percenter ever got
stranded at the bottom of a mountain and
needed to be pulled up apricot evil did
then they came up with say family a
built-in life-saving harness that can
carry up to 400 pounds if you're strong
enough to pull of course Africa is
waterproof and windproof it's meant for
real adventurers not a kiddie playground
tool when you were a real adventurer
sometimes you get lost that's why we
partner to de-spawn the world's leader
in GPS traffic just press this button
and your location is sent to a
helicopter or your mom yeah and the GPS
never runs out because apricot also has
a built-in solar battery yeah they
thought of everything while you wait for
rescue enjoy apricots built-in
inflatable pillow mmm that's good
napping okay now presenters in a city
man des cope looks great everywhere and
on anyone oh and the beer to demonstrate
how strong our materials are we wanted
this man to fight them fear but
apparently a real bear costs a lot and
we wanted to invest more in the Colts we
even only spent a hundred bucks on our
logo it was run by this guy thanks
Nathan look out for the bear ha ha good
stop so now you're excited you're
thinking this coat looks amazing but I
don't know you guys how can I trust you
so I guess you and the branded coat
managers are regular golf buddies no
you're not and we don't play golf
it's boring we just really care for this
coat we spent a lot of our time and
money to make it a reality because we've
tried many other coats and just weren't
happy now advocate is finally here
