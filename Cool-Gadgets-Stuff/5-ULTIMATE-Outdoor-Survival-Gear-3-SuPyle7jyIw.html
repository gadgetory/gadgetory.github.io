ground up to be the most versatile
survival and bushcraft tool on the
market the jack performs all attached to
required of a bushcraft knife like
cutting chopping and photonic what makes
a jack different is the front cutting
edge and mounting holes the mounting
hole allows you to attach a makeshift
handle with paracord to utilize the
front cutting edge of the knife this
allows you to chop with more force for
less effort the jack was thoughtfully
designed made from durable and rust
resistant 440c stainless steel the
handle and all mounting holes have
radius edges this ensures your hands in
lashing cord are not a braided during
use the handle has slots to wrap cord in
any fashion you please and also has a
dimple for use of the bow drill the
large coil is close to the cutting edge
making fine cuts easy the top of the
blade has a 90-degree edge perfect for
use with a fire steel or scraping the
sheath is made from lightweight durable
and weatherproof Kydex plastic the jack
is designed to go hand-in-hand with its
quick detach saw the saw can hold up to
four 12-inch
Universal saw blades which are
lightweight and readily available it
also allows you to carry different
blades for different cutting tasks the
handle is made of 6061 aluminum and all
hardware is made from stainless steel to
use the sole detach it from the jack
sheath and use the sought-after to
attach the saw blade to the handle the
sought-after also works with the knife
mount the jack to a handle and attach a
saw blade to make a more efficient saw
by allowing you to use the strength of
both arms adding handle makes the task
faster and easier the saw with adapter
retention cord and one 12-inch pruning
blade weighs 7 ounces it will be
available by itself or with the jack
the jack with a cheetah weighs 1 pound 1
ounce or 1 pound 8 ounces including the
saw for one and a half pounds you can
carry a knife chisel hatchet machete
handsaw and pole saw the jacks
lightweight and versatility make it
perfect for camping hiking hunting and
bushcraft
if you are a seasoned outdoorsman then
you already know that using the right
equipment is essential when putting your
pack together you will understand the
grueling demands of the wilderness and
most of all you will have a respectful
appreciation for nature and know that
sometimes your equipment can be the
difference between life and death when
the lead engineer of survival archery
systems started developing the SAS
tactical survival boat
he was already aware of the need for
equipment that was properly engineered
having survived a near-death experience
in which his knowledge of the outdoors
together with some well-chosen critical
equipment and literally saved his life
he set about developing a product for
food acquisition it would possibly one
day do the same for someone having spent
a lifetime growing up in the woods and
having spent 15 years as an automotive
and petrochemical engineer he set about
developing a set of requirements which
encapsulate the eight critical aspects
of a survival though that you should
look for in a premium product these
critical aspects led to a design which
was launched onto two years of
development and testing and now the SAS
tactical survival though is solved
technically the morning people all over
the world to understand the need for
premium equipment package spoiling is
critical to a complex design and to
overcome the need to strap your boat to
the outside of your pack
it absolutely must be 21 inches or under
when in transport mode the SAS tactical
survival boat comes in at all cuts the
length of 21 inches even fits into most
one leg max in order to get a bow that
does not stack and is still efficient
you need to have the right limb to rise
a ratio as well as the right overall in
designing a 60 inch long boat with the
carefully chosen limb to rise a ratio
gave the SAS Texas survivor boat is
perfect balance and a bow that is not
stacked all the way past 31 inch draw
for long-term survival purposes it is
crucial that all working
lots of a bow of fully
corrosion-resistant and so survival
archery systems chose marine grade
materials throughout the only part of
the bow that is not fully corrosion
resistant although all important I
tensile steel limb retaining bolts which
were chosen to give an extremely high
factor of safety in the field and only
require a light layer of animal fat or
oil to remain in perfect condition
durability is key for a survival bow and
so during the development the engineers
employed what is called design for
infinite life which basically means that
the theoretical design is capable of
withstanding 500 million shots at 31
install going a step further some hefty
safety factors were added to ensure a
super light bulb that will last more
than a lifetime any composite limb with
a through-hole is prone to cracking
around that hole unless it is properly
secured using a correctly talked bolt
and washer system the SAS tax course
available makes use of a positive limb
retention system to ensure the limbs
remain safe and secure in the field
having a compact bow is important but
having a solution to store your arrows
is critical to your choice of a well
rounded product the patented SAS
tactical survival bone is the only bone
in the market that allows for a storage
solution of errors inside the riser and
this comes at no additional cost to
space to reduce pack weight and ease of
use and maintenance-free and truly
ambidextrous pose that requires no
changing of parts of the last two
critical aspects of a great survivable
the SAS tech defensive Volvo is the only
truly ambidextrous survival bow on the
market and requires no tools to maintain
it or convert it from left to right hand
simply place a terrorist on both sides
of the riser and swap it between hands
if you are looking for a premium
survival bow that captures these age
critical elements then look no further
than the SAS tactical survivable
ts bottle Audrey systems exceptional
gear for exceptional people
earthquakes tornadoes floods and
hurricanes leave us without running
water gas and electricity which stove
was born because we saw a need to
provide affordable but reliable camping
and emergency preparedness cooking
solutions we designed this emergency
cook kit to provide you and your loved
ones with the assurance that you will
have a way to cook food and boil water
in any situation the quick stove cook
kit includes a custom stainless steel
pot with a sturdy handle that locks the
lid down for easy transportation the lid
can also be used as a cooking pan
heating plate or flipped upside down
while cooking to be used as a double
boiler when not in use the pot holds the
stove and to fuel disks for easy
transportation as a self-contained kit
the cube stove weighs less than a pound
and is made of durable steel which makes
the stove strong enough to support any
size pot or pan you would like to use
the stove is optimized to burn the quick
stove fuel disks but easily burns other
fuel sources like quicksand means real
table --tz-- sterno cans wood charcoal
and alcohol burner
when using the provided pot and fire
starters you can boil four cups of water
in under four minutes the fuel disc is
made of cedar and wax and will burn for
25 to 35 minutes the fuel disc is
essential for emergency preparedness
because it is waterproof and because it
can be stored for years without going

emergency code kit but in the event that
you do you will be prepared to cook food

situation thank you for supporting our
