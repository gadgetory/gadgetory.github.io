cover your skin use a racket or apply
sticky skin damaging sprays or creams
but we realized nobody wants that this
is why we invented a solution that is
not sticky doesn't cause allergic
reactions and is friendly towards the
environment at the same time this is the
VIN detail a portable mosquito repellent
it comes as a wristband but also clips
to any place where protection is needed
it is small non intrusive and very
lightweight the bandido uses proven
techniques you know from products that
plug into your outlet and combines them
into a portable device that also
protects you outside wherever you go
utilizing all-natural DEET free scents
and sonic sounds it instantly creates a
shield around you to ward off mosquitoes
I like the Bandito because I can finally
enjoy outdoor activities with my kids as
a parents it gives me peace of mind
knowing that the product is safe for
kids and keeps them from having itchy
mosquito bites after playing outside a
replaceable battery and scent strips
allow for long-term use and refilling
every season so if you're getting ready
for a picnic with the family golfing
with friends backpacking with buddies or
anything outdoor related you can rely on
the bandido help us make a change a
portion of proceeds will be donated
towards fighting malaria
in 2015 you helped get our rugged
stainless steel beast of a stove into
the hands of the campers and bush
crafters of the world enjoy our unique
rocket stove design the original MA -
tub was made with intention to take a
beating and it does in the three years
we've been around not one hottest stove
has been returned we now want to extend
the hottest experience to a new group of
outdoor enthusiasts
the lightweight backpacker we are proud
to introduce to you the titanium hot ash
mini Baja - many ways in under a pound
which is perfect for backpacking and
thanks to the new redesign of the burn
chamber it burns
even more efficiently huh - mini comes
with a lifetime guarantee just like the
original hot ash stove just like the
original the hot ash mini allows you to
cook with natural fuel like sticks and
twigs but without the need for canisters
thanks to its nest of dimensions this
stove lets you travel life and Leave No
Trace the hot ash mini nest itself when
not in use so it won't waste space in
your pack despite its small dimensions
it burns with all the efficiency of a
full-sized rocket stove
we have been working hard to create a
quality design that you can trust and
now we need your help we're not a big
company but we believe in our product
and we need your help to fund the hot
ash minis production and get it to the
market this stove was designed with you
in mind and we want to do this together
so please tell your friends about the
hot ash mini and help us build this
stove for everyone to enjoy
enjoying the great outdoors means you're
going to get sweaty and dirty but when
it comes to getting clean nothing seems
to do the trick baby wipes can't cut
through the grime and if we were to go
the conventional route we would have to
look around gallons of water for an
outdoor cold shower
but lugging 40 pounds of water just for
that seems ridiculous so we here at
geyser invented a better way to get
clean using less than a gallon of water
that's right less than one gallon that's
eighty percent less water and weighs a
mere six pounds which is equivalent to a
six pack of your favorite beverage
skeptical we thought so so we ran it
through the ultimate test let's start
with five gallons of blood mother nature
isn't the only one who sticks around
let's also add five gallons of icky
sunscreen why stop there if you love
camping at music festivals then tell
them a splash of color then say hello to
the geyser system it's not a shower it's
better it's the world's most portable
inefficient system to wash yourself and
your gear
step one just add your gallon of water
step two plug it into your cars DC
outlet or a portable battery step three
turn on the pump then open the valve
enjoy and get your clean on one gallon
lap up to seven minutes for a refreshing
body wash the result no more squirming
in your car tent or sleeping bag while
wearing the grime from your last
adventure it's designed with a
user-friendly heating system we bring
the heat in a little at 15 to 35 minutes
but if you're really in a rush scroll
down below to learn how to get that down
to five minutes
scrub too hard don't worry we thought of
that to replace an igniter scrub is as
easy as texting a friend text the number
on the tag choose from a variety of
colors and it's on its way
introducing adam by yuna hertz the
world's smallest 4g rugged smartphone it
fits in the palm of your hand
it's waterproof dustproof and shockproof
