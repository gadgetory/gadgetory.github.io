the advantage of using the silicon in
the Bandicoot is it allows you to merge
the strap with the housing in the one
material and therefore doing so it makes
it more streamlined and less bulky I
guess the truth we feel like it is just
what you can do with it it's more
versatile it's more comfortable it's
less obtrusive the overmolding allows us
to house the leads and battery in one
chassis but without the bulk and
oversimplified optics of traditional
headlamps it doesn't tangle your hair

waterproof
