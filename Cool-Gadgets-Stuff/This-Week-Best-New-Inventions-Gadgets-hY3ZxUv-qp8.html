robot in the world to respond entirely
through videos and gifs
Pico is not just any robot
he's our desktop companion designed to
provide little moments of delight and
entertainment to get it through your
name so what can people do for you well
since I spent long as it front of the
computer I use mine to stay productive
keep me off Reddit when I should be
working
remind me to drink water regularly rest
my eyes from time to time and for those
times when all I need is a quick
pick-me-up Pico I just can't do this
just keep swimming just keep swimming
just keep swimming swimming swimming my
very own productivity but but of course
that's not all you can use him for all
kinds of tasks Pico what is the weather
people set a timer for 20 minutes
people you are not the lights
the list goes on and his unique vision
response system means you don't get the
same boring responses to common
questions always keeping it fresh and
fun he will come as an affordable easy
to build kit so you get to put him
together yourself no special tools
required everything you need is included
in the box so you can get up and running
in absolutely no time there will be a
bunch of pre-programmed skills so he is
ready to go right after is assemble no
matter your technical prowess you can
also easily add your own custom
responses and new skills and since the
code is open source community
contributions will continuously improve
the experience for all because brain is
a Raspberry Pi and this opens up a
thriving community right from the start
there will be a growing video library of
educational content so you can use them
as a truly unique platform to dive
deeper into the world of robotics
electronics and software just pop his
head plug in a keyboard and mouse and
hack away to make him your own he has an
impressive screen for an expressive face
a microphone array so he can hear you
stereo speakers so you can speak to you
a camera so he can see you
and a unique flexible exterior for added
nonverbal cues and what's more Pico
comes with a personality to match define
him after giving him a task and he'll
stop listening to you as well Pico lady
Spotify asking the same question
repeatedly and he might get annoyed Pico
what is the meaning of life and whatever
you do don't ask him when it's
pronounced gif or Jif definitely not
your average pot so go ahead and back
because addition to helps us go into
production so that you can bring the
most delightful the most entertaining
and the hippest little bot into your
home office or classroom that completely
redefines the way we interact with
robots today ever struggle to carry the
coffee you need to survive the day and
the water you actually need to well
survive carrying separate bottles for
your coffee and your water is annoying
so we fixed it
meet h2 Joe h2 Joe holds 12 ounces of
hot coffee and 12 ounces of cold water
all in one brilliantly designed bottle
using a bit of engineering magic we
built h2 Joe so you can sip your coffee
and drink your water all from the same
lid plus h2 Joe is easy to fill simply
unscrew the stainless steel
fill with your favorite coffee and
reattach the chamber is double wall and
vacuum seal to keep your hot coffee hot
for up to six hours next remove the lid
fill with cold water and screw back on
the water compartment is triple
insulated to keep your cold water cold
for up to eight hours and of course your
h2 Joe is 100% BPA free when it's time
for cleanup feel free to throw H to Joe
in the dishwasher or easily hand wash it
so whether you're commuting to work
jumping between calls or simply powering
through the day h2 gel will keep you
caffeinated and hydrated no matter what
we'd love for you to back our campaign
and be one of the first to enjoy the
convenience of h2 Joe your coffee and
water and one bottle
water is indispensable our planet needs
it every day and so do we
we're never a team of passionate
engineers designers and creative folks
who care deeply about the future three
years ago we introduced the nervious
Basha or one point on Kickstarter thanks
to your support we've shipped over
16,000 showers we started as a
father-and-son project between Carlos
and his father
Emilio to solve a practical problem now
we've grown into San francisco-based
startup the 13 team members two offices
manufacturing partners across the US and
customers in over 55 countries together
our community has saved over 100 million
gallons of water we are incredibly
excited to announce the Nivea spa shower
2.0 we think it's the best the most
thoughtful and precise shower experience
in the world
nebith technology a demises water into
millions of tiny droplets the shower
experiences in developing relaxing an
extremely efficient at rinsing this
sensation marries the best parts of a
steam shower and a traditional shower
in addition Nebbia saves 65 percent of
the water used by standard showers we've
listened to feedback from all of you and
we've improve the experience in every
way more heat maybe a 2.0 is 29% warmer
than maybe a 1.0 better body coverage
nebby has twice the coverage compared to
regular showers higher velocity maybe as
droplets come in contact with your skin
three times faster than conventional
showers we didn't stop there then if 2.0
works in homes with below average water
pressure the Nivea spa shower 2.0 comes
in two new finishes matte silver and map
wash both brand new finishes are made
with the highest quality powder coating
processes and Gen one we use what we
call hollow cone nozzles the spray is
only around the perimeter of that cone
in Gen 2 we found that it's actually a
better experience if we fill the entire
base of that cone with spray it turns
out that people are over
a bit unreliable in telling you which
shower is warmer or colder
so Manny is a mannequin that we
outfitted with 32 temperature sensors to
basically get a accurate and objective
quantitative reading of how warm or cold
a shower prototype is what we're trying
to do is challenge people's notion that
you need more water to have a better
shower and the way we've done that is
just by iterating and iterating
iteration maybe a 2.0 is incredibly easy
to install you don't need a call plumber
and it only takes about 10 minutes it
effortlessly slides up and down without
buttons and comes with a magnetic wand
it also works as a side spray we've also
designed our first accessory the Nebbia
shelf the Nivea shelf is made from three
millimeter aluminum and takes less than
a minute to install without screws
sometimes it's the simple things that
make a great shower Nebu saves so much
water and we've put a calculator on our
website showing exactly how much money
you'll save say hello to a garden smart
