the surface of the Great Pacific Garbage
Patch hear the ocean cleanup is
deploying the world's first
technological solution to this growing
problem the principle behind that is
simple create a coastline where there
are none concentrate the plastic and
take it out the system consists of a 600
meter long floater and a three meter
deep skirt attached below the floater
provides buoyancy to the system and
prevents plastic from flowing over it
while the skirt prevents smaller
particles from escaping underneath as
the impenetrable skirt creates a
downward flow marine life can safely
pass beneath it here is how the system
catches plastic the system takes
advantage of three natural oceanic
forces winds waves and currents both the
plastic and system are being carried by
the current
however wind and waves propel the system
only as the floater partly sticks above
the surface while plastic is primarily
just beneath it the system thus moves
faster than the plastic allowing the
plastic to be captured the skirt extends
deeper in the middle of the system than
on the outer edges as the current
applies pressure on the skirt the system
naturally adopts a u-shape which enables
it to concentrate plastic in its center
like a funnel
the drag generated by the skirt also
acts as a stabilizing force allowing the
system to reorient itself when the wind
changes direction and because the system
like the plastic is free-floating it
automatically drifts to the areas with
the highest plastic concentration fitted
with solar powered lights anti-collision
systems cameras sensors and satellite
antennas the system actively
communicates its position at all times
and continuously gathers performance
data
periodically a support vessel comes by
to take out the concentrated plastic
like a garbage truck of the ocean the
plastic is then transported to land
recycle and made into durable products
this is the first of a fleet of sixty
systems once deployed the fleet is
expected to clean up 50% of the Great
Pacific Garbage Patch every five years
majority of my childhood was always
within the water there's nothing worse
than being out there surrounded by
plastic I was a product designer in
another life and it was my job to make
plastic products and after a while I
realized that we didn't need the stuff
that I was making and so I stopped
I met Andrew and he told me about his
project and it just clicked for me the
project was amazing we could have a
better time at the beach because we're
not swimming in plastic and pollution
anymore
we haven't ate better because the fish
healthier arenas ports and yacht Bubba's
is the perfect place for the Sieben
there's no massive ocean storms it's a
controlled environment
it catches everything floating in the
water
plastic bottles paper oil fuel and
detergent 24 hours a day seven days a
week 365 days a year
another good thing with the location of
the CBN is that people can see what
we're catching what they're they're
swimming in it's been a big change in
our life we quit our jobs we've taken
all our money and we're putting their
heart and souls into making this happen
one of our goals is to make the seaman
from our own plastics to create another
seven to capture more it's a domino
effect the second goal is to create a
world where we don't need the sea beans
imagine that we have a pollution free
ocean for our future generations
today 320 million tons of plastic are
produced globally each year at best just
10% - this versatile material is
recycled the rest
it's either burned buried or even lost
into the environment recycling
technologies was founded to solve this
problem we've developed the machine that
recycles all types of plastic waste back
into the oil it originally came from
what's special about our technology is
it's able to tackle plastic currently
considered and recyclable films food
pouches laminated plastics such as crisp
packets and even black plastic globally
plastic waste is a huge untapped market
opportunity that could curb everted into
1.5 billion barrels of oil with 60
billion pounds that's almost three years
of the UK's annual oil consumption
drastic is a fantastic material
it keeps her food fresher for longer
makes cars lighter and is widely used in
health care it's hard to imagine a world
without plastic but no one wants to live
in a world that is drowning in it either
at recycling technologies we see plastic
waste as a valuable resource we are
recycling it to produce an oil we call
flax which has many uses one of which is
making one plastic
since formation we've raised five
million pounds of equity and four and a
half million pounds of grant funding
from the government these funds have
been used to develop and test the
technology since 2016 we have been
successfully operating a near full-scale
commercial plant at Swindon Borough
Council's waste facility with support
from the Scottish Government we reach
agreement with a waste operator for the
first commercial plant to be operating
in Scotland in 2018 a global wax trader
has also signed a five-year agreement to
purchase the wax proportion of plaques
we as consumers want to know that when
we put something in the recycling bin
it's actually going to get recycled the
beauty about recycling technologies is
very soon we'll all be able to recycle
plastic at home with confidence using
our patented process the machine takes
plastic waste and feeds it into a hot
chamber in the absence of oxygen the
long polymer chains are cracked to
create a range of plaques products
including wax and a raw material for
making more plastic recycling
technologies machines will be modular
and mass-produced in a factory just as
you would a car coming off the
production line they'll be transported
to existing waste sites anywhere in the
world
mass production will allow us to build
recycling capacity quickly to meet
demand our plan is to install 1300
machines by 2027 producing seven million
tonnes of plaques annually this will put
recycling technologies near every city
every beach and every ocean
in the UK it can cost a hundred pounds
of tongue for waste companies to dispose
of plastic waste our technology will
turn that cost into an income of two
hundred and seventy pounds per ton we
have a great team here at recycling
technologies but of course it's more
than just us we're grateful for the
extensive support from universities
grant bodies are great suppliers and and
of course our current investors now with
your support we'll be able to install
our first commercial plant in Scotland
by the end of 2018</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
