introduce you to our prototype flying
car this unique vehicle is called the
pole v1 or the personal air and land
vehicle and it marks the start of a new
era of door-to-door mobility on the
ground the vehicle drives like a sports
car
within minutes its rotor is unfolded its
tail is extended and then it is ready to
take off the Bovie is very easy and safe
to play thanks to the advanced
gyrocopter technology which allows for
takeoff and landing in small spaces
with the successful test results we have
proven that it is not only possible to
build a flying car but also that it can
be done within existing international
rules for both flying and driving
for more than 100 years people have
dreamed of the freedom of a flying car
and many attempts have been made to
realize this dream but now it has truly
become a reality
are we creating a new future in mobility
so here is lilium we are developing the
world's first entirely electric vertical
takeoff and landing
we want to establish and build the new
means of transportation although you're
working on it every day you still got
these gnomes waiting wow that is
something really really cool that we're
doing here and it just feels amazing to
be to be actually a really big part of
that so you have an airplane that takes
vertically like a helicopter
but once it's in the air it accelerates
into forward flight and fight between
Gormley and this way the Chiefs much
higher speeds than past but also higher
speeds than a helicopter
so connectivity is what it's all about
iha 184 is the safest smartest and
eco-friendly low altitude autonomous
aerial vehicle Amy I'm providing medium
short distance transportation solution
early in 2013
u-haul started a disruptive and
revolutionary plan of making this new
generation of autonomous vehicle this
vehicle is set to match three
philosophies absolute safety by design
automation and sync flight management
platform in 2011 the house founder and
CEO watches best friend
tangina disease from a flight accident
surely after are just a helicopter coach
also lost his life when a helicopter
malfunction those two accidents erases
Quach determination of designing and
absolute safe aerial vehicle the journey
of beyond 184 is paved with obstacles
for we keep making unremitting endeavors
to successfully achieve the design KP is
the prototype during the test flight
and this leads to the official project
Chekhov of hong-won 8480 he has designed
and developed our own propeller dynamic
testing system
this is how we have done it
you know attracted the best talents to
work on structural design industrial
modern design and manufacturing
delivered by pop composite material team
all part of three hong-won 84 are
designed and produced by ourselves here
comes the official testing for a home
184 chassis group of engineers on site
troubleshooting and reload
we have the application designed for
yee-haa 184 after setting up the flight
plan with a single click user can take
off on any location this relax and enjoy
the front
now we'll always keep in mind of a
humble beginning but our heart and soul
with the product rebuild absolute safety
by design automation and think slides
management awkward
you have our word once we begin we will
never give up
you
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
