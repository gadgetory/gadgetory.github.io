us-based nonprofit design practice with
a global outreach envision with the
recent increase in the number of
international refugees we knew that
addressing their dire need for decent
shelter would be a high priority for us
in many refugee camps residents
encounter a broad range of problems
inadequate security leaky and flood
prone structures a lack of adequate
living space for families a shortage of
natural light and health and sanitation
issues associated with shared public
toilets the refugee crisis has moved us
to develop a simple cost-effective
solution that not only addresses these
issues and problems but that can also be
easily assembled by the end users with
very simple tools and no construction
experience the hets house is a dignified
home that can easily serve as both a
transitional and permanent shelter all
the components are designed to be packed
and shipped flat hence it can be rapidly
deployed the hexagonal formed it is a
more rigid than a square form
eliminating the need for added structure
it has a toilet a shower a kitchen two
bedrooms and a living space the
structural insulated panels or sips that
are used for the walls floors and roof
provides security and protection from
the harsh weather conditions the 47
square meters are approximately 500
square foot units are adaptable scalable
and can accommodate larger families
units can be disassembled relocated and
reused elsewhere assembly is simple
concrete pier foundations are dug and
poured adjustable steel legs are set on
top of the piers floor beams are
fastened to the steel legs
then structural insulated panel floors
are attached to the floor beams
structural insulated panel exterior and
interior walls are then fastened to
floor panels interior and exterior
finishes can be easily customized roof
panels are anchored directly to the
exterior walls with no need for
additional structure and a simple steel
and two rear porch is attached
insulated windows skylights and doors
are installed finally an aluminum gutter
is attached to the roof panels
individual units are combined into
clusters of five to create shared
exterior spaces and amenities the hex
house is simple but sophisticated design
makes it a smart and sustainable
solution for more than refugee shelters
there's an increased demand for small
efficient and affordable homes and we
plan to cater to this market with
customizable hex house kits that can be
delivered right to customers doors by
allowing people to build their own homes
substantial cost savings can be realized
by homeowners
this is a real film of a real building a
tool not a toy the very first of its
kind designed for people with vision and
business on the move the concept is
simple fold up the solid parts of a
building to move it easily then open it
again wherever you want it to be ten
fold technology does this quickly and
easily at the touch of a button this is
a building that builds itself labor and
machinery are not required this is a big
space in a small box with lots of room
for your own stuff it is designed so you
can arrange the spaces and contents in
the way you choose this is the solution
for mobile housing offices shops
exhibitions restaurants workshops
clinics and schools and everything else
that needs to get there easily or be
there now the ten fold you box is a
dynamic property asset that you can move
again and again it's strong adaptable
comfortable and future-proof with full
off-grid potential a building that moves
is never redundant just fold it away and
take it where it's needed next be where
you need to be develop business faster
increase opportunity change lives go
where others cannot go and do what
others cannot do
you
hi there I'm Ian Kent presidents of
nomad micro hopes you know the world
would be a better place if housing was
more accessible and affordable to
everyone but the reality is the supply
and demand has made it too expensive for
most and this for the size house were
accustomed to
if houses were smaller more efficient
and easier to build this reality could
change yet changing the size of our
houses requires changing the way we
perceive the definition of home they've
been simplifying our routines
re-evaluating the importance of material
possessions and reducing our consumption
of goods tall orders for a society that
uses designer labels as status symbols
and sees huge sprawling mansions as
measures of success however see changes
in the air a growing number of
progressive individuals across North
America Australia and new tonight in
Kingdom are sharing stories of how
they've resolved their own housing
crisis they taken stock of their daily
lives then dismantled and reassembled
them to reflect a new personal
philosophy our goal is simple in concept
to offer a cost-effective micro home
under $30,000 in us that can be shipped
anywhere on the planet and is easily
assembled not such a simple goal in
execution though it also has to be
lightweight strong well insulated and
resistant to rot and termites it's
layout must strike the perfect balance
between size economy and livability it's
all about innovation making components
work harder to be efficient prioritizing
and doing more with less using a unique
system of piles
that eliminates the need for a concrete
foundation nomads barely touches the
ground and leaves little to no footprint
specialized wall and roof panels
minimize energy requirements for heating
and the addition of solar panels as well
as a rain collection system renders
nomads carbon footprint virtually
non-existent
true to its name nomads can move and
adapt to almost any geographical
location and provide housing in a wide
range of climate conditions it can be an
affordable urban dwelling or suburban
getaway housing for remote communities
or developing nations with assembly
taking no more than a few days nomads
can also address urgent disaster relief
needs with minimal effort and cost</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
