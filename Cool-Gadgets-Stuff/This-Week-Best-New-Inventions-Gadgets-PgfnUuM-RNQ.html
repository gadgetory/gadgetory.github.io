strongest bonds are with family but you
can't always be there with them and
calling doesn't give you that same
feeling there are a lot of things you
enjoy doing together and you can't do
through a call so we made omni the robot
that makes these things possible even if
you live miles away omni's in like a
phone call or ordinary video chat
they're there in the robot you have the
control to move and look around and this
frees up the other side from having to
stop and answer a call you can just join
in no matter what they're doing no more
phone tag or scheduling a call like a
meeting our testers are using on me to
do awesome stuff like cook together hang
out for a barbecue or even watch a whole
movie together it's the stuff they never
do with Skype or FaceTime because it's
just way too cumbersome and the coolest
part is that none of this was planned at
a time as soon as they got the bot these
experiences just happen naturally we
wanted to make a home robot that's not
just a toy but something's built to last
can be truly useful week after week our
design philosophy has two main parts and
the first is the maximize of the human
connection so omni's made to be human
height to give you that most natural
view of the world people on the other
side can look straight at you and talk
to you just like normal we really wanted
to enhance presents a feeling that
someone there with you so we designed on
me with a moving neck in a seamless
control interface we call motion map the
neck may seem subtle but we thought it
really makes the experience a lot more
engaging a lot more human so the second
part of our design philosophy is to
minimize all hassle because nothing
should get in the way of the Omni
experience setup is simple unfold
connect to Wi-Fi and call in with just
one click there's no software install we
also made Omni super quiet so you can
hang out for a long time without bugging
anyone and if you need to move it around
it's light you can take it upstairs move
it out in the patio or pull it up into
your car you know if they're worried
about keeping it charged when you're
finished press one button to auto dog
army is different right down to its
materials and how we make it resource
sustainable bamboo and we use sudden
anodized aluminum another cool thing is
we use additive manufacturing to build
Omni in a scalable and efficient way
we're doing it all in-house to keep it
lean and that means less risk you've
already been shipping Omni to test users
around the world for over a year we're
also backers like you tired of campaigns
over-promising and under-delivering so
that's why we waited to launch our
campaign until now after two years and
nine generations with prototypes we're
super passionate about bringing families
closer and with your support we can
bring the Omni experience to everyone
join our campaign and enjoy on me with
your own family
as people increasingly depend on the
smartphones to organize their personal
life it is becoming evident that the
traditional computer has been replaced
by the smartphone as the main servant of
our digital needs from a simple way to
communicate it became the one device
that is every device near access
introduces the mirable
the mirror book is helpful laptop and
the other half is in your pocket it's
just smart phone plug in your phone and
unleash its real power instead of having
a limited interface on a small screen
now you can be productive in a 13 inch
display with a keyboard and a mouse pad
the mobile first revolution simplifies
your life with only one device to secure
saw your data a nexus internet
with its 24 hours battery and its slim
design you have the perfect combination
from mobility on the go
whether you need to make some research
work on your PowerPoint presentation or
just take notes the mayor book is made
for death accusing
you can play with the millions of apps
available on your windows or android
phone
equal blows river is a new generation of
smart clean mobile power it's a portable
lithium-ion battery with the world's
most comprehensive array of charging
ports and one of the highest total
energy output of almost any storage
solution on the market it's designed for
everybody from outdoor activities and
indoor leisure to industrial
applications and emergency services
river releases you from the shackles
with outlet so you can power a free life
the unit is equipped with 11 independent
charging cord which can all be used
simultaneously for a total output of 500
watts to put this in perspective that
means you're good power to iphone to
ipad to mac book the mini-fridge a
lantern a drone battery a mobile Wi-Fi
unit and stereo speakers all at the same
time without limiting the output on any
port with the storage capacity of 460
and watt hours river gives you more
powers than almost any battery of the
time you can jam on your electric guitar
for 20 hours straight or you can watch a
10 hour marathon up your favorite TV
show by campfire rivers battery can be
recharged in three different ways a
standard outlet or a car charger can
replenish the battery to full capacity
in just eight hours with eco flows
portable solar panels river can be
recharged with absolutely zero carbon
emission in just 12 hours the real-time
display allows you to monitor the
batteries current output power remaining
capacity and charge time being a
documentary filmmaker a lot of my shoots
happen outside a lot of times our
locations are way out in the middle of
nowhere first time I use river I was
really surprised at how much these
little units can accomplish on location
everything runs on batteries we have to
set up a DI t station battery charging
station and we could even run our LEDs
when we need extra lights and never have
to worry about the noise and the
pollution of a generator applications
for battery power ardently River isn't
just an accessory it's your power
companion for harnessing clean energy
anywhere so you're free to go everywhere
and by the way this isn't just a concept
rubra has been tried and tested and as
you can see this entire production has
been lit by river
who says your daily commute can't be fun
nada with adult to develop the smallest
widest most convenient urban transport
recruit meet Lou a new kind of an extra
cable our Swiss engineering team wanted
to create a short ball tech that metal
indistinguishable from a non power board
which you think to near perfect design
for both fun and transportation
it's been life and simple
exactly does what it's supposed to do
where the fruit in between our tree in
the park hey but don't be afraid to get
it hard Lewbert you stand attract a navy
3 millimeters in that observant
polyurethane statements with one
important difference there's 2 1.5 kilo
watt motor inside robbing them to use
the control speed over very fashionable
style and travel over when
we took special care designing a
wireless tennis rental for acceleration
and braking design we have any
unnecessary declaration yes we are sweet
and a cross title on deck and competent
origin on functional side it helps a
list with food-grade you increase
stability let's face it getting it's
more fun biking and not more convenient
no need to waste time looking for a
local spot nothing happy to help the
lombardi prequels it small enough for
Erin commuters like me to take away
train but our unity
the carbon fiber shell and we're more
durable than anyone sent you and keeps
the bark to the last for detective
sensitive electronic and or just a
venturi inside
if our manufacture lined up we have our
global distribution network in place and
most importantly it's fun you never look
at how we travel the same way again
