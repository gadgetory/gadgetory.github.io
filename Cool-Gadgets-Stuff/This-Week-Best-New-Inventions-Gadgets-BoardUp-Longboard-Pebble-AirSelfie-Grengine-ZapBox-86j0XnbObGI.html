guys that's right right but when you
bring it to the bus station to the
school when carrying it under your arm
it becomes a hassle
we knew there could be a better way so
we took to the streets and crafted
something that beginners to Pro boarders
love and called it board up say goodbye
to all those hassles the patent-pending
mechanism will guarantee no folding
while cruising or doing tricks the
Canadian maple deck and a back seven
bearings are reinforced with an aircraft
grade aluminum hinge capable of
supporting 400 pounds to keep your hands
safe the hinge has a built-in protection
apparatus board up only folds into your
hands when you press down on the front
nose of the longboard at the right angle
at 7 pounds board up is tough yet light
at just over 30 inches long board up
offers you the calm rush of surfing the
streets while easily storing in your bag
in your locker or your office now you
can fit it in and travel anywhere with
boredom hey do you like you like
I love it
salt-and-pepper I have a charger port it
says me electronic portable microphone
sprinkler head an attachment for a
camera or something
does it go to eleven pebble is the
world's smallest true wireless speaker
that produces sound beyond its size the
new pebble sound system provides
unparalleled clarity as well as sound
separation you can pair your pebble
speakers together allowing them to play
music simultaneously amplifying your
sound or you can place your pebble
speakers in separate rooms
sharing a music in various spaces to
create an incredibly flexible audio
experience pebble so compact that you
can take it with you everywhere and
pebble is so small you'll barely notice
it whether it's at the office and the
park or on vacation enjoy the freedom of
creating your own personalized sound
environment for both indoors and out you
can really create like a home stereo
system using just these three just like
in like very covert locations throughout
like your house I guess in a room
alright I can hear you that's amazing
pebble packs enough power to keep you
entertained throughout the day and
pebble comes in a variety of color
options including black silver gold rose
gold and jet blue one for all my friends
honey they shrank the speaker
pebble-sized matters
you see amazing isn't it this is the air
selfie the only portable flying camera
integrated into your mobile phone cover
micro and ultralight it comes with it's
very own device for storage and charging
with an easy one-hand control from its
own where did the idea come from
well I'll show you look at this what an
epic day out a bonafide selfie time as
they say just need to squeeze a teeny
bit no never mind ah a more manageable
group just two guys actually that want
to take a selfie to remember this
wonderful place well I guess they can
just describe the view to their friends
back home right okay one more try this
time a good old barbecue outside on a
sunny day with lots of friends let's try
the selfie stick strategy still can't
fit everybody in
annoying situations am i right we've all
been there buddy
that's how air selfie was born a perfect
team gathered together working in London
Milan and Shanghai to combine micro
flying technologies ultralight HD
cameras with in flight stability systems
air selfie can travel in a 20 meter
radius and hovers for up to three
minutes it's easily controllable from
both iOS or Android smartphone apps it's
only 52 grams and it slots into its
phone cover and recharges so what if the
guys had an air selfie with them they'd
make it hover find the perfect angle and
leave the controls finally snap an
amazing photo with the selfie delay
timer mode while it is autonomously
flying and keeping its position in the
air awesome what about the two explorers
they select the classic flying mode from
the three options available control air
selfie through the app by holding the
phone horizontally and take both
memorable photos and videos
and what would have happened at the
barbecue enough with the squeezing just
select the selfie mode use only two
buttons to find the right distance to
shoot and take a great picture what
about an indoor location whatever it may
be a party at somebody's house or a
night out in a club there are no issues
but their selfie flies easily it's
simple to control and very safe look at
that thing sleek space-age 50 darn
high-tech the heck is that
hmm the evolution of portable power ok
the Grendon is of interest to everyone
because everyone uses power my title is
the mad scientist and I'm the inventor
of the grameen okay you're right mad
scientist everyone does use power
well I create this thing generators are
actually enormous polluters the amount
of carbon monoxide that a generator puts
out in one hour is the equivalent of
thriving the Honda Civic from LA to
Atlanta L hate to Atlanta that's crazy I
had no idea they were that bad for the
environment and how does the Granton
compared compared with a drench in which
is zero emission obviously it's the best
bang for your buck it costs you nothing
when you charge with a solar panel the
real change factor I think was when
working with Brad our industrial
designer we came up with the stackable
interchangeable power system brad is our
Lego master Berger he does most of the
engineering and backend of putting those
products together
is that Brad the nerd gotta have a nerd
product design and development has been
yeah poor my skills and that's what I've
been working on both mechanical and the
electrical design the Gretchen is
different from other types of solar
generators currently on the market with
our system you simply swap batteries and
you can have as many batteries as you
like or you can stop them that allows
you to work virtually indefinitely some
of the things you could use the grunting
for our general uses like camping
construction sites and kind of general
power tools are often very good used for
these a big areas definitely home backup
you could do just about anything you can
think of because it can go with you
anywhere this is great so I could boost
my buddies truck my friend Ashley can
use it to play music on the corner and I
can hold a popcorn filled outdoor
midnight horror show screening for my
friends nice how do I get one we're
launching an IndieGoGo campaign in order
to complete the production of our
Gretchen and make a genuine impact on
the environment yeah it's just something
that's so much better than what's
already out there I'm excited to see
this keep going I'm excited to keep
developing and I see us making this
being the flagship of possibly many and
it boasts many new industry ok mad
scientist Connie top reasons for picking
up a grant you go we all use power you
need it it's silent and it's admission
free and when you use a Gretchen you're
using something that's not just good for
you it's good for the whole planet tada
indeed Brad any last coming right Brett
ok the world's first and only emissions
free silent solar generator with a
stackable interchangeable battery system
or engine the evolution affordable power
hey Kickstarter I'd like to show you
something mind-blowing this is that box
imagine a science lesson where you can
send a probe to the surface of Mars or
painting in 3d space and walking around
your creations or turning your office
into a mini golf course
all in fully tracked room scale mixed
reality what you've just seen as some
examples of mixed reality or Emma that
you'll be able to experience for
yourself with zap box in EM are virtual
objects and environments are anchored to
things in the real world providing a new
and intuitive way for users to interact
with virtual content for developers it
represents an untapped medium with
created possibilities that are only just
beginning to be explored here at zapper
were really excited by the created
possibilities of Emma what's less
exciting is the high price tag that
comes with it to try out microsoft
hololens right now will set you back
$3,000 we set ourselves the challenge of
creating a much more affordable mixed
reality solution by leveraging the
wealth of sensors and impressive
performance of existing smartphone
Hardware combined with our years of
expertise in fast and robust image
processing on mobile devices we've
designed the entire zat box offering
from the underlying software to the
physical components to offer the best
possible mixed reality experiences using
existing smartphones and without
requiring expensive at additional
hardware we're now ready to share that
box with the Kickstarter community and
to offer you the opportunity to
experience
MRR from your existing smartphone for
only $30 200 times cheaper than a
hololens dev kit for your $30 pledge
you'll get a cardboard headset two
cardboard controllers a wide-angle lens
adapter and Assessor point codes to get
started just place your point codes
around your environment
scam that part of the room
put on your headset and away you go
we've built some great content ourselves
that will come with Zappos at launch but
with the help of the Kickstarter
community we can take this to the next
level the experiences that you've just
seen are some examples of what's
possible with zap box built by our team
