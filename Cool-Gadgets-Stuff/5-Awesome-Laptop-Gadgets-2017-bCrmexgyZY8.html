programmer any engineer any designer
will tell you that if you want to do
your job productively if you want to do
it well you need at least two monitors
you need one to write the code and you
need another to check the graphical user
interface changes that are made back in
the old days we had desktops to do this
which were great but you needed to add
an extra graphic card to add another
monitor to it but for us
luckily laptops came along soon after
and made everything a lot more
convenient laptops are great they allow
you the flexibility to work from home
hotels restaurants and friends houses so
all of a sudden with laptops everything
got a lot easier and more convenient for
everybody but for people like us who
still need more than one monitor it
wasn't that simple you can't take a
monitor into a coffee shop a it'd be
weird be it totally defeats the purpose
of the ease and convenience of a laptop
so what we do we came up with expand de
expand expands your laptop's display
real estate expander is a secondary
monitor for laptops that slips on and
doubles as protection it runs
efficiently through only your USB port
that's right no extra power cables to
deal with it keeps you portable while
greatly increasing your productivity
Expando only needs one USB port for both
video and power it offsets the very low
consumption of the LED panel with
photovoltaic solar panels on its
backside these panels provide a trickle
that will continue charging your laptop
even when it's not in use on the macbook
model expander we'll add two extra USB
ports allowing for charging and other
peripherals while you're using expander
essentially we've given you the best of
both worlds you get all the portability
and convenience of a laptop plus double
the working space so you can truly work

want technology makes us increasingly
