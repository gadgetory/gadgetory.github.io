biogas that means banana pancakes
a 2015 we launched the first IndieGoGo
campaign showing the world how to turn
this into this an idea from a backyard
appliance that turns organic food scraps
into cooking gas must first of its kind
we were so excited to see all these
people from all over the world enjoying
the system
the first campaign enabled us to get
home bogus to the heart of remote
communities they need people who have
been cooking over fire would suddenly
had clean free energy it was a huge step
in fulfilling our vision the amazing
support inspired us to think forward
what if we could take the humble gas
appliance make it even better and reduce
its overall cost it took us over a year
home bogus 2.0 is an advanced appliance
that produces green renewable energy
installation is now simpler just fill
the digester with water
mount the gas container using the
supplied sandbags and you're ready to go
the 2.0 version is 50 percent more
productive easier to maintain and super
durable we've also added a home ba gas
stove to give you the perfect solution
an average family produces about two
liters of waste a day
why should organic waste go into giant
polluting landfills when it can go back
into nature home bogus 2.0 can now
produce up to three hours of cooking gas
per day more than enough for an average
family plus a top quality completely
organic fertilizer that goes back into
the soil your own backyard eco cycle
once food waste goes in the bacteria
digest the organic material and released
bogus and fertilizer no electricity is
required it is completely safe to use
order less and can digest anything from
fruits and veggies to meat and dairy
more and more people are beginning to
reduce reuse and recycle as a way of
life Nature has given us so much now
it's time to give back
we have evolved alongside the honeybee
in the symbiotic relationship we care
for them they pollinate our crops and of
course made lots of delicious honey but
getting the golden nectar has always
been quite a task I just thought it was
crazy to have to crack the hive open for
the hive apart stress out all the bees
and spend all day in the shed just to
get your honey and I thought hmm there
must be a better way so my dad and I got
to work and we've done it now you can
simply turn a tap and pure fresh honey
flows right out of your mind
delicious ready for you to eat that's
amazing it's amazing it's honey on tap
for those that don't know harvesting
your honey used to be a real labor of
love you had to protect yourself from
stings fire for smoker to sedate the
bass crack the hive open lift heavy
boxes pull out the frames try not to
squash bees brush them off the comb so
use a leaf blower transport the frames
to a processing shed cut the wax capping
off filter the honey and clean up all
the mess then the frames have to get
back to the hives again now you don't
need to do any of that turner tap sit
back and watch the honey pour out it's
pure unprocessed untouched delicious
honey directly from the hive no mess no
fuss no expensive equipment and much
more friendly for the bees this is the
first time in the world this has been
possible there is nothing else like it
it really is a revolution we can see
into the hive we can see when the
honey's ready and we can take it away in
such a gentle way
what a wonderful thing the flow frames
are designed with clear ends so you can
easily check the hive is healthy and the
colony is Jong you can watch all the
girls handing nectar into honey and see
when it's ready and isolate individual
combs allowing you to taste all the
different flavours of the seasons you
can just have us one frame and get three
kilograms of honey or harvest more than
20 kilograms per box but you know tap it
off so easily means that when there is a
good honey flow you can keep up with the
bees and harvest a lot more honey so how
does it work the flow foam consists have
already partly formed honeycomb cells
the bees complete the comb with their
wax and fill the cells with honey
capping it off ready for harvest when
you turn the handle our patented split
cell technology creates channels inside
the comb allowing the honey to flow down
and out of the hive while the bees are
undisturbed on the comb surface turn the
tap again which resets the comb into the
original position and allows the bees to
cheer the wax back and fill it with
honey again for the commercial beekeeper
the frames are built to accommodate a
pneumatic system which means you can
flick a switch and harvest your whole a
pre at once we've been testing
prototypes with beekeepers from around
the world I've spent hours taking honey
out of highs this system is just blows
my mind I'm sorry I was very excited too
and it actually worked
Oh actually put the tubes in and watch
the honey come out I was sitting there
going I was completely amazed and
surprised at the amount of honey that
came out it was easy to use and there
was a very little disturbance to the
whole hive
it's this over-simplistic idea of how
I've been working again here we've
actually accomplished that one year go
we promised you a solar car that cost
sixteen thousand year and has a range of
250 kilometres and guess what we made it
but why did we build a sign humanity
burns 61% of the world's oil resources
only for transportation we were sick of
being part of this problem so we decided
to build a car in our garage which will
become a part of the solution to spread
our vision we launched a crowdfunding
campaign with an unbelievable result the
campaign became a huge success thousands
of people from all over the world
started to support us
we recruited an excellent team and moved
into a bigger office with the right
partners on our side we could finally
start building design cars body is
covered with highly efficient solar
cells thanks to this feature design
becomes a mobile power station you can
also recharge other electric vehicles
anywhere anytime as an air filter we
integrated a special moss it filters up
to 20% of the fine dust while requiring
no special care the sign costs 16,000
years concerning the battery you can
either decide to rent it or buy it right
away
we kept the car as simple as possible
without compromising on safety and
usability so no motors has only come so
far because of all the great people who
share our vision and supported us from
the very beginning to go into volume
production we need five thousand
pre-orders together we can achieve this
goal and end our dependency on oil
majority of my childhood was always
within the water there's nothing worse
than being out there surrounded by
plastic I was a product designer in
another life and it was my job to make
plastic products and after a while I
realized that we didn't need the stuff
that I was making and so I stopped
I met Andrew and he told me about his
project and I just clicked for me the
project was amazing we could have a
better time at the beach because we're
not swimming in plastic and pollution
anymore we'd even eat better because the
fish healthier arenas ports and yacht
clubs is the perfect place for the
Sieben there's no massive ocean storms
it's a controlled environment
it catches everything floating in the
water plastic bottles paper oil fuel and
detergent 24 hours a day seven days a
week 365 days a year
another good thing with the location of
the CBN is that people can see what
we're catching what they're swimming in
it's been a big change in our life we
quit our jobs we've taken all our money
and we're putting their heart and souls
into making this happen one of our goals
is to make the seaman from our own
plastics to create another seven to
capture more it's a domino effect the
second goal is to create a world where
we don't need the sea beans imagine that
we have a pollution-free ocean for our
future generations
in 2010 I lived with a boot boot tribe
in Kalinga
with no electricity they would leave at
3 a.m. to walk 6 hours to buy a supply
of kerosene they did this every two days
so they could have light in the evenings
salt and water are in all Filipino homes
I wanted to help with my background in
science I asked myself if I could find a
chemical reaction with basic salt and
water to make sustainable electricity I
was told this was impossible I tried and
failed repeatedly after many attempts we
had our breakthrough
one day I got a call from the White
House they wanted me to speak on a panel
with President Obama an ecommerce
billionaire Jack Ma for the 2015 a cup
summit since then we had lucrative drug
venture offers from different countries
but my dreams to have our invention
completely designed manufactured and
distributed from the Philippines our
innovation is not restricted to lands
this technology is scaleable my vision
is to make seawater power plants that
fuel entire islands in the Philippines
and beyond</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
