of dead line skateboards
I've always been really passionate about
skateboarding as well as the whole skate
and surf culture from a very young age
so a few years ago I got hold of a
couple of black boards and I drew my own
shapes element drilled the holes and
ship them from start to finish and I
find the whole process really rewarding
I knew it was something I wanted to
continue doing so I decided to start
sourcing everything myself and start
making boards completely from scratch so
I started Deadline skateboards in late
2013 after spending a couple of years
setting up my workshop and learning the
whole process that goes into making
boards
I started deadline with the hope of
preserving the handmade approach to
manufacturing used by the earliest
skateboarders which I think for the most
part has been lost today due to mass
manufacturing I also wanted to remind
people at the roots of skateboarding by
providing them with something that has a
sense of craftsmanship as well as being
something they can really appreciate
so all my boards are completely
handcrafted from start to finish here my
workshop in Northern Ireland from
pressing the veneers to screen printing
the artwork every stage of the process
is done under this one roof I used a lot
of Canadian maple to make my skateboard
decks and I also make like old school
hardwood cruisers using wood such as
Irish oak and Irish cherry which are all
sourced from local sawmills I feel like
I'm now at a stage where I'm ready to
take deadline to the next level and
hopefully develop it into a fully
functioning business and hopefully try
and make a living doing something I love
hi I'm Corey and this is the transformer
rail it is the first and only rail they
can transform from a bench to a flat bar
or round rail giving skaters the ability
to create a versatile skates pot
anywhere
growing up without access to a local
skate park my friends and I were always
skating homemade obstacles in our
driveway or at the neighborhood tennis
courts you didn't have any places to
skate so we're always trying to get a
lot out of space we have the need to get
the most out of every obstacle led me to
the concept of a transformable grind
rail the Transformer rail gives skaters
the ability to take one obstacle and
create dozens of unique and challenging
setups anywhere it is the first rail to
provide a bench flat bar and brown rail
all in one combined with the extensive
height and angle settings the
Transformer rail offers a total of 128
different positions our precision design
results in a rail that feels solid under
your board this allows for easier
smoother grinds combined with the rails
versatility this allows skaters to
practice more tricks and progress faster
than with traditional non transformable
rails we're excited to introduce the
Transformer rail to skateboarding and we
appreciate your help in bringing the
Transformer rail to skaters everywhere
thanks for your support
we're just releasing it to the public
now but we've been riding these boards
for like two years and this black ice is
like no joke the first second you put
this board on and you go do a nose slide
or a tail slide whatever you want to do
you're going to notice that instantly
it's like no friction slides even does
not whack you're still sliding shouldn't
be any new news that I like to slide I
like the slide as long as I possibly can
with this new black ice it really helps
me to do that that's that layer that you
know mainly when you're skating and
you're busting long slides you're going
to slide through it the black ice it's
always slick no matter what that's why I
love it
I'm serious dude it's no joke it's no
gimmick it's black ice
so two weeks ago I went to the Bears run
onto the boards I don't have no more of
that guys so I had this board at home
like one of my first traffic head up
that board came for like five hours five
hours I've tried like switch back switch
back something and I wasn't able to flip
out of the board
a week later I went back with a black
high school and I just did like two
tries yeah that consistent slide you
know so like I that I need to like flip
out of the trick you know I just got to
use base Cavendish for like the fats
like two years and then like I cannot
skate anything else it just feels
completely different I'm trying to trick
in the ledge is gonna take me make five
or four hours whatever you know we
thought the black guys might take me
like four or five days who knows you
know I didn't expect anything you know
too drastic you know you always hear
about certain skateboard technologies or
this or that and you know it never
really makes a huge impact on you know
everyday skating so I kind of was like a
little hesitant about it but you know I
want I wanted to try it I knew it was
gonna help me slide better so I just
wanted to really try it out so I just
like you know purposely tried to like
stand on a nose slide and I said okay
you know and it you know it went it just
kept going so this is good it's just one
of those things that I thought it was
cool I think you should always be trying
new stuff and kind of make things better
and at least experimenting you know yeah
a black ice is kind of a trip like not
only does it like help you slide a lot
better the actual like the black ice
layer makes the board stronger black ice
holds the board together structurally
better and it doesn't let the board sort
of SOG out is easy and flatten out and
hold it spot longer so that's sort of a
side effect to it six flies of wood and
a seven once to one to makes it strong
you know that's the only thing I've been
skating I can't skate with anything else
I'll hyper see people trying this do you
see what I feel when I slide my tricks
it makes a graphic look different too
like it's super shiny underneath it and
so like once you start skating off your
graphic it goes into the actual black
eyes to board actually stays looking
pretty fresh you know I think it's great
for Plan B to try new stuff and try and
make boards better and you you know be
pushing that construction and make life
easier on the skater so I think that's
good
Oh
the idea came from just wanting to
maximize the amount of riding living in
Michigan here we have short seasons surf
seasons and just a thought was - how can
I extend that season and so I got into
logging boarding and this idea here kind
of came from surfing because we wanted
to get a feel that kind of had a
fluid-filled below like liquid below a
surfboard and so that's where the spring
comes from and so when you're riding and
carving all your motion comes from your
spring instead of the deck so it's a
different feel it's a different ride and
it's that more of a surfeit feel
ah
what do you think it that's pretty wild
it's like heaven
you
