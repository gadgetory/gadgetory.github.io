anywhere it's so clever it activates by
recognizing you just launch it from the
palm of your hands
it even returns when you call it and
land like this easy can't get everyone
in the shot no problem
watch as it hovers precisely in place
always at your command control it with
your hands
remote controller mobile device or DJI
goggles using GPS spark knows where it

obstacles to avoid things in front of it
and come home safely
thank you guys movemove bar footage is
smoothest it takes the shake out of your
shine so you look like a pro

let's talk about taking the perfect
photo first compose the shot
check the histogram adjust the exposure
focus on your subject compute the
hyperfocal distance to keep everything
sharp enable bracketing to get more
dynamic range and a neutral density
filter update the exposure and then take
the shot
we built a better way today's DSLR and
mirrorless cameras have amazing optics
and sensor but they do very little to
actually help you take a good photo
finding the right sentence involves a
series of complex techniques and
formulas as an engineer with a
background in artificial intelligence I
knew I could build a tool to simplify
the process I wanted something that
would let me focus on the composition
but would handle the details for me so I
created arsonist the world's first AI
photography assistant with one tap
arsenal find settings take the best
photo possible Arsenal's AI searches
thousands of images in its database
sister just good settings next it fine
Tunes the suggestions by analyzing 18
different factors Arsenal uses state of
the art machine learning to help you
take a great photo in any condition
oh joy
many of the memorable shots you see
today are captured by combining multiple
exposures through a labor-intensive
process called photo second with Arsenal
you can do this in seconds to capture
all the details and scenes with high
dynamic range get everything in sharp
focus and create long exposures without
buying expensive filters using these
advanced techniques Arsenal lets you go
beyond the limitations of your camera
since the hurl in four times when you
want complete control you can wirelessly
adjust manual settings see a live
preview and trigger the shutter all from
up to 100 feet away
Arsenal also improves the experience of
reviewing photos in the field you can
flip through the photos on your camera
zoom in to check out details at full
resolution then share your favorite
photos right from your phone
and finally Arsenal makes it easy to
capture stunning time-lapse

changing light giving you a smooth
day-to-night transition you can even
watch a high-def preview of your
time-lapse while it's being taken
whether you're a pro who is already
mastered manual shooting or you just
bought your first DSLR Arsenal can help
take your photography to the next level
so before you replace your gear try
upgrading your techniques with Arsenal
there are moments when the future
arrives right before our eyes
moments when our idea of what is
considered modern and stylish even our
ideas of what is possible in terms of
performance and technology are
completely transformed it is in these
moments that the world as we know it is
forever change this could very well be
one of those
today we introduce you the future of
modern speakers the Galleon down here
our cutting-edge Bluetooth speaker takes
the form of a futuristic polygonal
humanoid for the last two years we've
been working through every conceivable
detail with the most qualified experts
in design and sound engineering it was
our mission
to create a true representative of the
height of modern technology integrated
and what is no doubt a show-stopping
speaker but the striking design of this
piece is just the pearl out of the story
you'll be blown away by what's inside
now hero is back to the next generation
features such as a wireless charging
dock charging adapters that those
haven't yet made the leap to wireless a
Wi-Fi range extender a battery life that
lasts up to eight hours when all the
features are being used and 48 hours on
standby adopt quality leaders and
subwoofers for crystal clear higher than
a growl will rage
mmm
stem feller options in either matte or
metallic and two sizes difficult for any
kind of settle her multiple sound here
suppose that marge desktop speakers
remote-controlled ambient library and an
awesome smoke dispenser the Callum sound
hero can mesmerize the entire room at
the dangle Oh features reflect over 16
million colors emitted by the RGB LED
light and it's not so back our project
today and take a trip into the future
through the Callie and South you
hey Kickstarter's two years ago you made
history by backing the splash drone the
first waterproof drone that can float
and take pictures and video underwater
into the air today we're back on
Kickstarter to bring you the much more
advanced splash drone three auto and
fishermen edition the splash drone is
now modular and comes with a 4k
detachable camera and a stronger payload
release system to deliver your bader
payload over water if you have a drone
you know what it feels like to fly over
water and if you still don't you've
probably seen video of the thousands of
drones that have crashed in the water to
never be seen again our goal is to
change the way you fly by removing the
fear of flying over water or even land
on it the new camera captures 4k video
at 25 frames per second and 14 megapixel
pictures
the gimbal has stronger motors for
better stable video underwater and in
the air
it also has a quick-release clip that
allows you to store your splash drone in
this redesigned compact travel case
we've also redesigned the flight
controller to make it more stable and
reposition the GPS to provide more
accurate location hold while still
giving you features that make flying
easier than ever
features like return to home at the flip
of a switch Waypoint navigation Follow
Me mode and tap to fly to a specific
location on the map all features that
can be accessed on the swell pro mobile
app available for Android and iOS
devices the splash drone fishermen
Edition now comes with a completely
redesigned payload release system that's
equipped with a high-resolution fixed
camera that allows you to see where
you're dropping your bait or fly vest by
redesigning the remote control from the
ground up we were able to integrate a
high-resolution video monitor with an
on-screen display that shows the health
of the splash drone and vibrates to
alert you when the battery's running low
the entire propulsion system has also
been re-engineered for more stable and
longer flights and the quick lock
propellers allow it to fly it up to 35
miles an hour today we're coming back to
Kickstarter and hope that you can help
us continue the dream of delivering the
best splash drone yet thanks
you
