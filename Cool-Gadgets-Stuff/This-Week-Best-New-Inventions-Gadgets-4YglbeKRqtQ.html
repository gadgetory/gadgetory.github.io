stare at your little bubble for nearly
500 years it's time to grow up
introducing the Lummi level the most
accurate easy-to-use level that everyone
will want in the toolbox that little
vial has been transformed into a
beautiful set of lights ten times its
size and unlike a traditional level you
can view it from any angle and in any
lighting condition the easy pitch system
which has indicators for 1/8 inch
quarter inch 3/8 inch and 1/2 inch
slopes makes it absolutely perfect for
sloping drain pipes or custom shower
pans a plumbers dream but what about
accuracy well that's where the Lummi
level really shines quite literally
each light represents a point to degree
interval but when you get to the middle
light a secondary set of lights
pinpoints the accuracy down to 1/100 of
a degree making this the world's most
accurate level and each 90-degree
orientation is individually calibrated
for perfect results no matter which way
you use it and as if the Lummi level
didn't have enough brains already it
even comes with special gesture
controlled features you need a light
just give it a quick shake and the Lummi
level lights up like magic when your
work demands perfection make sure you've
got the perfect tools
get yourself a Lumi level and upgrade

hi guys I'm Bruno laughs Romulan and I
want to introduce you to something
really really special so I got to have
traditionally the literary brother run
surprise fancy sunglasses outfit Island
the action in caramel bar been that much
the smoothly because of the mana for the
deities in industry we want to change
that that's what we create their product
for people just like you trouble people
sports people fashion people the ones
who are constantly losing the sunglasses
as a problem as they got adventurers
as they leave the same people who are
the friends to be high quality that
lenses to be polarized and approved to
be 100% eco-friendly and made of
recycled materials and also
budget-friendly Sitting Bull's who will
write the many moans of how how many
trips around looking for a better
materials and companies the world with
we finally level a the product that we
wanted to we have designed the perfect
collection of sunglasses for people like
us for people like you we're gonna film
that we make passing glasses you can get
for an accessible price but all of our
sunglasses are producing high versus
entry side polycarbonate another
lightweight material that is truly top
an officer uniquely using all the
recycled materials allowing us to reduce
contamination and reduce the waste
believes in our factories
in addition we use three assitant lenses
made of cellulose which is an organic -
raw material as well
they provide total UV 400 protection
against the Sun Symbian radiation on our
polarized which makes them perfect for
outdoor activities especially to vote
reflections in the snow or water we are
natural numbers and always trying to
find the purpose in everything we do
more than thousand kilos of plastic end
up in the sea every five seconds
as a result 40% of the air solution
areas have already been taken away by
plastic as a way to give back to you and
make you print aggression even more
meaningful
we are compromising on remove one keel
of plastic from the ocean for each
bucket have a side and of course we
forget about the packaging a beautiful
box which you can reuse to make sure
that the sunglasses will arrive safely
and something to take them to go and
that's from lightweight microfiber pouch
with a marching clothe aberlin
sunglasses a shot where you need this is
a reason why we're here
we went Kickstarter's used to be the
first one to get access to our
collection with the best process this is
a story about how two young
entrepreneurs from Amsterdam took a
romantic trip to Portugal and one year
later had created the most
technologically advanced polo shirt in
the world
this is Casper Casper's from Denmark
when he was a young man he worked in the
Middle East in Africa
wearing a suit and tie in the baking Sun
every day these days Casper stays fresh
but let's come back to that later
meet lota she's from the Netherlands
she loves the planet and she hates doing
laundry so they came up with an idea and
what are the Dutch known for around the
world that's right
repelling water just like our polos do
what we do is work hard to create the
most advanced cotton garments in the
world
the live fresh journey started two years
ago when Lata and Casper shot a video in
their apartment and became the most back
european apparel project in crowdfunding
history it was the wildest moments of
our life we quit our jobs we rented a
small office in the red-light district
of Amsterdam and we went all in on
making the most advanced cotton fabrics
in the world we're not live with our
third idea - the integrals
stain and odor repellent polo made of
100% cotton by heavy craftsmen right
here in Portugal one year ago we told
our community we started developing a
pique fabric we thought of how hard
could it be
well it turns out pretty hard it ended
up taking a full year and many
prototypes for them to get it right
PK is an amazing fabric it was invented
in the thirties by French tennis
champion and Lacoste and it's one of the
most versatile and breathable
constructions because of the fine
knitted structure it was hard to make it
stain repellent without compromising on
the hand feel and breathability we call
the technology fresco by adding a
protective layers to the cotton fibers
it's possible to create a fabric that
prepares everything from red wine coffee
beer and many other substances a saline
quad treatment is also added to the yarn
which kills 99.9% of all bacteria in no
bacteria means no smell all treatments
are invisible and oeko-tex certified so
there's literally no way for the human
eye to tell that this polo is special
until the wine starts flashing not all
heroes wear capes some of them wear lab
coats and we tend to work with the best
of them in Switzerland a particle that's
right we are not the heroes of this
story we are supported by people who
move mountains with their knowledge by
building a dedicated supply scene and
Ragman internet we make sure that the
smart inventions of these creators are
making it out of the lab and into
closets all across the globe so how do
we test it we work with the best
European laughs but we take it further
than that we literally force the whole
team to live into prototypes
sleeping them working out wearing them
for non-stop for 20 days fashion is a
dirty game but not when you were getting
that fresh blood fresh that's kind of a
weird name for a fashion we think so too
and that's why we like it because net
produce the opposite of a fashion brand
we want you to buy less and wash less so
you can keep your clothing for many
years instead of buying new stuff all
the time
join our journey to clean up the fashion
industry and make it life easier in the
process please back our campaign today
