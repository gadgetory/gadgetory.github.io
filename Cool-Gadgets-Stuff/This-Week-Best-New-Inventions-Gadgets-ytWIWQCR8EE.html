things play a part in almost everything
we do most of the stuff that's around
you isn't that important but some things
are there are things had really mean a
lot to you things you just can't lose it
might be work something expensive your
keys
something or someone special to you
where the sheer thought of losing them
is enough to make your heart beat a
little faster that's why we developed a
litte a small piece of technology that
gives you its precise location anywhere
in the world within seconds hi
Kickstarter my name is Martin and I'm
the founder of tablets in 2016 we became
one of the largest distributors of GPS
watches for kids in Europe in 2017 we
developed our new firmware which was
supported by the new vision government
research console we sold more than
17,000 units and received amazing
reviews businesses organizations parents
all sent us pictures and reviews of how
they are now in full control with
tenants so now exclusively on
Kickstarter we introduced of a GPS
tracking firmware in four new casing
tail it the world's smallest GPS tracker
with global range seamless design
waterproof wireless charging three weeks
battery and allocation accuracy of five
meter
tell it plus when prolong battery time
is needed tablet plus increases battery
time up to eight weeks so you can hide
it and leave it for months
tell it pets a tiny GPS tracker for even
the smallest cats and dogs with the
weight of only 22 grams and size of coin
your pet will never notice expressing
feelings but real time will give you a
peace of mind tail it bike a smart GPS
tracker specially designed to be hidden
inside your bicycle it's a special
design key to install and remove the
hide it anywhere waterproof is six weeks
battery time from a single frog in 2018
is totally unnecessary to lose anything
when you can tail it at first it seems
like a regular top you give it a spin
and it's spins then time passes minutes
become more minutes someone comes in to
ask a question he notices that it's
already been two minutes and this top on
your table hasn't stopped spinning you
tell him that's limbo and it's actually
been 15 he calls a friend over they wait
more people gather you show them a trick
you can do
you show them a few
someone points to the design you tell
them it's made from high-grade metals
you show them a video tell was made
the delivery guy says that it looks like
that top from that movie
everyone agrees
a few people finally ask how it works
maybe you tell them maybe you don't
maybe a friend who already knows tells
them that there's a battery-operated
gyro inside and that the entire thing is
rechargeable a girl who knows her text
says wow that's pretty impressive a few
of them not everyone continues to stare
you go out to a meeting you come back
you type that spreadsheet you were
working on all afternoon people come in
and out limbo keeps spinning you go home
only after four hours of past limbo
rests tomorrow it will all start again
Geron MIT we've noticed a shifting trend
in people's working behavior more and
more people are no longer working in
their offices they were working at
coffee shops they're working in
co-working spaces they're even working
on trains airplanes anywhere they have
not really needed to stay productive I'm
Steven I'm Jack and we're mobile pixels
mobile pixels provides a secondary
laptop monitor that gives laptop users
the productivity desktop monitors
provide for anywhere work takes them a
second laptop monitor can actually
increase worker productivity by up to 50
percent that's what you always doing it
gives them that extra productivity
anywhere they go dual is ready to go
right out of box you clip it to the back
of your laptop or your magnetic
adhesives you plug in a single USB cable
slide it out adjust your viewing angle
and do always-on it works with all
laptops do all has that presentation
mode where if you flip the screen 180
degrees you could easily screen share
with someone who's sitting next to you
or across from you it's a great tool
during conference this low footprint
makes it an ideal tool for all sorts of
travel conditions
lowest sleek and durable the only way
1.5 pounds in this energy efficient so
he won't drain your battery and most
importantly we wanted to create a
product that's affordable so it's
accessible by everyone
we understand that people really want to
maximize their productivity when they're
working so during their time off they
can enjoy the things they love doing and
that's what makes us excited we want to
partner with you so we could build
something amazing together
