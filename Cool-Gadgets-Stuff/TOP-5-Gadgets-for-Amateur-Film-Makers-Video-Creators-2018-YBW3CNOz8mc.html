fact that you can just throw a camera in
between these little spots and cracks
you've never been able to do before
it's masane priceless really hi I'm
Andrea from Barrow where we aim to make
the impossible film shop possible
introducing the next generation cable
cam we enable easy filming in places
even drones can't go
this is the viral life the first ever
portable and easy to use cable cam the
light kit is the perfect extension to
your existing camera setup the viral
light is foldable making it easy to
carry with you in a backpack and with
intuitive mounting system make it is set
up in less than three minutes we wanted
to create something that will make
people go WOW how did they do that when
they saw the video going through windows
through cars really Packwood's
or other places where you would never
imagine flying a camera but at the same
time keep it so simple that anyone can
use it
even though it's the first time
operating a cable cam you would
definitely be successful the viral life
goes fast enough to follow the action of
high speed and slow enough to capture
that perfect time-lapse shot and the
battery will it last up to three hours
with lights indicating how much you have
left
that is exactly the tool that we needed
in the sport it takes less than a minute
setup and your way to go get the bangin
shots just like the pros with our
background from arranging and filming
extreme sport events and festivals we
have seen that more and more filmmakers
from beginner to pro level are seeking
new angles when capturing their most
extreme and memorable moments on video
that's why we wanted to make viral life
available for everyone and compatible
with any camera and stabilizer up to
three point three pops we are bit banger
a few years ago we kick-started pixel
stick an innovative tool that lit up the
night and inspired photographers to
rethink long exposure and now we're back
with something new this is color spike
the first multi-purpose light that puts
the power of color in the palm of your
hand
color spike is driven by a robust
pattern based system capable of
producing an endless variety of creative
lighting solutions still shooters can
quickly get multiple looks in a short
period of time without stopping down to
manually adjust lights or swap gels
video shooters can use the powerful
editor to me bespoke effects that help
realize their vision and drive narrative
this flexibility combined with
thoughtfully designed hardware and a
full-featured Bluetooth app completely
redefines what's possible with a single
light color Spike's app comes pre-loaded
with a wide range of patterns that can
be stored on the device for use with or
without pairing to a phone use the
real-time editor to tweak existing looks
or create entirely new ones
patterns are driven by color palettes
each palette stores up to eight colors
and is easily edited to change its look
and feel custom motion curves give you
the power to create everything from
simple to dynamic behaviors combining
multiple layers ensures that no effect
is out of reach when you're finished
save your creation it can live on your
phone or the device itself for easy
access on the go
color spike software is complemented by
pro hardware designed to streamline your
process enclosed within the rugged
aluminum housing is an array of color
LEDs ultra bright and flicker free their
tight spacing and single row
configuration produces smooth shadows
and clean edges color spike was designed
with versatility in mind the internal
storage can hold hundreds of custom
patterns which can be tweaked from the
on-board interface or from your phone
power is available from the included DC
adapter or the built-in battery and you
can even connect to multiple color
spikes simultaneously to control an
entire lighting setup from your phone
color spike has tremendous creative
potential no matter what you shoot as a
still shooter color spike simplifies
your workflow helping you get more looks
and less time and freeing you to focus
on the creative process color spike
isn't just for stills it's a video
shooter secret weapon
helping tell your story with the power
of color and motion
in your pocket is one of the most
revolutionary cameras ever made but how
do you turn amateur footage into a
cinematic masterpiece
the answer is movement introducing
emotion it's a fully automatic slider
that lets you do hollywood-style camera
moves at the push of a button it has
custom modes for any situation and it
works with all smartphones GoPros and
mirrorless cameras it comes with 15-inch
rails that can be extended to double the
sun's yet it easily breaks down to fit
in your bed using an integrated panning
mechanism it automatically creates a
parallax movement as it slides it's
great for products such interviews or
anytime you want a cinematic look
reverse the camera and the parallax
becomes a panning slide giving you a 36
degree wider viewing angle than regular
sliders for vloggers in motion lets you
forget about the camera and focus on
your content using our motion tracking
algorithms face following intelligently
keeps you in frame as you move around
and with the live-streaming inside the
app building a following is easier than
ever before for photographers in motion
lets you create motion time lapses right
on your phone just customize your
settings in the app and hit start
the motion unit can also be removed for
flawless panoramic shots or panning
time-lapses for night shots time lapses
captured more light and maximize your
video quality after this you select one
of the many pre simples
then via cloud computing your files will
be color graded automatically for action
sports there's motion trigger using two
Bluetooth sensors you can set up a
trigger for subjects that are up to 30
feet away when activated and motion can
start recording immediately or give you
some lead time for a smoother transition
in motion was built five filmmakers for
film makers you can build a fooled rig
thanks to its three-quarter inch
mounting points and it even has a
built-in USB fast charging port in the
app you have full control of the camera
and slider to create the exact look you
want from a slow track that reveals a
key plot detail to slow cushions for
dramatic effect in motion gives you a
cinematic shot every time a
Kickstarter's my name is Brigham RC and
a little over a year ago I launched the
parrot teleprompter the world's most
affordable and portable teleprompter
since then it has been used on indie
films corporate videos trainings
advertisements and much much more along
the way you gave us some great feedback
on how to make the parrot teleprompter
even better we took your suggestions to
heart and we're proud to present the
parrot to
the first thing you'll notice is it's
wider allowing it to accommodate wider
phones like the iPhone 6s plus and the
galaxy s7 edge with knees next we added
mechanical clips to hold the glass in
place not only does it look cleaner but
it also retains the glass better so it
won't fall out but if you ever need to
reach out the glass
now you can we also improved the grip so
that it still holds your phone in place
but it's a little easier to take out
when you need to my favorite changes are
at the front and the back of the
teleprompter
the new lid is much easier to open and
close by simply sliding it in place the
back now slides and locks into place as
well so you can pull it out and quickly
mount the teleprompter or switch
adapters you may not be able to tell at
first glance but we've improved the
materials as well the new ABS
polycarbonate blend is much tougher and
a little more rigid which helps to
protect your teleprompter even more
against the occasional drop the lid
won't scratch easily like the old
version did and it's still very
lightweight as always we're using only
the best high-end teleprompter glass to
ensure you can read your lines clearly
without affecting your video quality
finally we're including all the most
common adapters with the teleprompter so
you don't have to worry about ordering
the right one the parrot teleprompter
literally sets up in seconds you just
mount the correct adapter to your lens
and snap the teleprompter in place now
remove the front cover
and insert your phone
there really is that easy
you
we believe in phonography the phone that
we all have in our pocket it's not just
a phone it's a camera it's a production
tool the tool that allows you to capture
