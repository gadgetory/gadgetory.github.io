photo first compose the shot check the
histogram adjust the exposure focus on
your subject compute the hyperfocal
distance to keep everything sharp enable
bracketing to get more dynamic range and
a neutral density filter update the
exposure and then take the shot we built
a better way today's DSLR and mirrorless
cameras have amazing optics and sensor
but they do very little to actually help
you take a good photo
finding the right settings involves a
series of complex techniques and
formulas as an engineer with a
background in artificial intelligence I
knew I could build a tool to simplify
the project I wanted something that
would let me focus on the compositions
but would handle the details for me so I
created Arsenal the world's first AI
photography assistant with one tap
arsenal find settings take the best
photo possible Arsenal's AI searches
thousands of images in its database to
suggest good settings next it fine Tunes
the suggestions by analyzing 18
different factors Arsenal uses
state-of-the-art machine learning to
help you take a great photo in any
condition
Oh
I know
many of the memorable shots the key
today are captured by combining multiple
exposures through a labor-intensive
process called photo stacking with
Arsenal you can do this in seconds to
capture all the details and seams with
high dynamic range get everything in
sharp focus and create long exposures
without buying expensive filters using
these advanced techniques Arsenal lets
you go beyond the limitations of your
camera sensor or Lin four times when you
want complete control you can wirelessly
adjust manual settings see a live
preview and trigger the shutter all from
up to 100 feet away
Arsenal also improves the experience of
reviewing photos in the field you can
flip through the photos on your camera
zoom in to check out details at full
resolution then share your favorite
photos right from your phone
and finally Arsenal makes it easy to
capture stunning time-lapse
it automatically adjusts the exposure in
changing lights giving you a smooth
day-to-night transition you can even
watch a high-def preview of your
time-lapse while it's being taken
whether you're a pro who is already
mastered manual shooting or you just
bought your first DSLR Arsenal can help
take your photography to the next level
so before you replace your gear try
upgrading your technique with Arsenal we
started the folio to make a simple
studio for everyone thanks to you guys
people all around the world are using
the folio for their product photography
the size has increased approximately two
times from folio to the folio three is
the bigger and better solution for your
products photography for folio three we
invented a new design to upgrade the
size and portability the folio 3 also
comes as a magnetic structure making it
easy for everyone to use the lighting
device of the folio breeze is redesigned
for better performance the triple LED
lighting is more powerful than before
helping to decrease shadows more
efficiently we've created an additional
lighting device the halo bar which can
be used with the full view 3 to improve
lighting conditions attached the halo
bars to the folio 3 then control
additional lighting or you can use the
halo bars only to create a totally
different atmosphere now start creating
more amazing photos with the folio 3 a
perfect studio for your products
photography
it's a solution to upgrade your photos
for your hobby website or work site
don't forget you can use the folio 350
with the folio three to create 360
images of your product
well the thing I love most about this is
the fact that I can grab these three
tiny lenses throw them in my like tiny
messenger bag and just run out and go
one landing system unlimited
possibilities meet the Neptune
convertibles art lens system it's got
three fixed focal lengths and the dual
aperture system in one compact design
it's everything you need attach the 35
millimeter to the Lance Bass to shoot
street scenes architecture and rustle -
switch to 50 millimetres the fashion
editorial or the daily grind and use the
80 millimeter for people sports and the
great outdoors rather than having to
invest thousands of dollars in all
different types of lenses you have one
kit that's ready to go
with this art lens system you can nail
the frame every single time one thing
that's really cool about this is that I
can kind of twitch really quickly
between the lenses and be able to switch
between film and digital and also get a
different variety of focal length for my
couple expect razor sharp focus strong
saturated colors and smooth Bakke at
larger apertures the matching
convertible art lens system works
simultaneously with a stockless
diaphragm aperture and special drop in
place that path of your frame with
delicate fuzzy
well the Neptune system is I think is an
interesting lens kit I think that the
glass is beautiful it's super sharp and
it's something fun to play with
inspired by the world's first
convertible end invented by Charles
Chevalier in 1840 we've reimagined this
original concept small and please if
everything you need in your bag no
matter where your adventures take key
size of it is great being able to have
three lenses in my pocket the durability
and the size it's really I like that a
lot
as this Artland system is expandable the
journey has only just begun with more
lenses plans for future and possible
focal lengths ranging from 15 to 400
millimeters the potential of the
matching convertible Artland system is
unlimited life is unpredictable with the
Neptune convertible Artland system
you'll be ready for anything
I remember when I was a kid
less than 10 years old my dad used to
have a camera sometimes I stole it and
started to take false readings I have
always enjoyed taking pictures but the
editing part that's not always fun to me
editing always felt unpractical
economically poor and very
time-consuming so I started to search
for a tool that could solve these
problems and bring me closer to the
professionals and their workflow I
didn't find anything so then I got the
idea of luminix an ultimate editing
tools
I didn't know how to start how to build
such sexual but I knew esse he had a
very strong background from Nokia and he
would be the right man for the job
Oh team background is in nokia very
designed smartphones to the proper
markets I've been using Lightroom as my
hobby and I got Miko's idea right away
our engineers got so excited that we
actually built the first prototype in
just a few days you show how the product
can be built I've been an advertising
photographer for the past twelve years
and I like to think that I've seen it
all but low-tech is something I really
haven't seen before because it's totally
different to just use your fingers it
makes it makes you feel like you're
doing handicraft
it's just fun it's good fun this is the
chance to take your photo editing to the
next level star slider is a motorized
camera slider with modular components
and a plug and play system that lets you
create smooth camera movements mono
light is the additional module which
allows you to have rotary movements
around multiple axes panning tilting and
rolling as you prefer by turning a few
knobs you can couple to mana lights with
star slider and get the three axis
motorisation system then you only need
to mount the camera on it whichever
model it is plug in the battery and use
your smartphone with a dedicated app to
take control of your shoe
we pushed flexibility into the project
so you can choose the bundle that best
suit you adapting the system to your
specific needs each module is indeed
matchable with the other giving the
opportunity of limitless configuration
use to mana lights together mount them
on star slider or use them separately
for breathtaking still life shots move
the camera and the subject at the same
time and you'll be the only thing
staying still
we also tried to reduce this noise we
tried again but unfortunately we
couldn't fix our coffee machine so we
decided to develop stealth mode motion
just in case you want to record live
audio sessions or interviews
the motors are able to lift small
payloads average payloads or very very
heavy payloads as well and just in case
you want to shoot camera car mount the
magnetic feet stick star slider on a
metal surface and drive away safely the
wireless control allows you to set the
motion from unlimited distances and you
can free your imagination finding out
extraordinary points of view the star
slider app has a user-friendly interface
featuring simple manual mode control or
a more complex target point driven
preset mode set up to five key frames
you want your shot and twist your camera
moves without take a look
the same logic is applied to time-lapse
mode allowing you to move towards face
and time settings in just a few clicks
at the end you can always save and load
preset movements to remake the same shot
or combine it with another in a
different environment it will enhance
your creativity</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
