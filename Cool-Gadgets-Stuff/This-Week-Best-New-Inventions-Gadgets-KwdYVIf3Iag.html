January 2013 I was living in Beijing
with the air pocket obstruct the air
pollution was so bad it was beyond index
so decided to go out and buy a purifier
but I found that market was full of
thousand-dollar expensive imported
machines and companies saying that their
patented HEPA technology was the best I
wanted to know what's inside those magic
boxes that costs a thousand dollars so I
opened one up to find out and it turns
out the active ingredient in most air
purifiers is a HEPA filter then there's
a fan to push air through that filter
and that's it that's all you need to
remove dangerous particles from your air
the DOI is great but now I want to take
things up a notch see the DIY has a few
problems first its outgoing business
owners wouldn't want to put this in
their restaurants or cafes for customers
to see
second it's kind of a hassle it'd be
much more convenient if you could just
open the box and plug it in with the
help of an aeronautical engineer we
designed a new purifier from the ground
up by keeping things simple the square
puts out more clean air than that fancy
Swiss import and costs less than 5% the
price the square is also sleek and
stylish enough that it'll fit right into
your home we designed it to do one thing
and do it well it cleans your air and it
doesn't complicate your life and because
we cut out the middleman and all the
needless gimmicks that ionisers UV
lights that purifier companies add to
their machines the square costs less
than the others I've donated 6 years of
my life to smart air because I want to
make clean air affordable the square
does that but now I need your help I
have the prototype but it costs hundreds
of thousands of dollars to produce them
at scale if you support our campaign the
square will disrupt the market for safe
air and make it affordable for thousands
of people who can't afford it right now
in the past 100 years we've gone from
the Industrial Age to the Information
Age personal items security solution
becomes smarter almost every lock has a
key or a password in the world it's easy
to lose keys to forget passwords at this
time the only solution is to break the
lock
oh it becomes useless when it's broken
50 lakhs fingerprint lock solves all
these problems your finger is your key
50 lock features the high speed CPU and
accurate fingerprint identification high
penetration rate quick recognition lower
error rate and loss within one second
the passwords can be deciphered the
mechanical key can be replicated but
compared with mechanical keys
fingerprints are unique
my friend complained to me that the lock
of his locker that was broken and his
valuables got lost I asked him why don't
you use 50 lakh 50 lakh is compact about
one-fifth the size of a smartphone
aluminium alloy casing was seamless
one-piece moulding streamlined design
and drawing process shows technology and
fashion sippy lock has various colors to
suit your backpacks and clothing easily
100 kilogram weight capacity - keeps you
out of the strip your outdoors lasts for
two years on just one charge with 50 la
