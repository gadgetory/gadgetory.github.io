industry could not offer to you quick
and responsive comfortable an turns
heads wherever you go
Oh
Oh
what if there was a video game
controller that could replace all the
video game controllers in your
collection right now controllers like
this and this one that one of course
this that this and even one of these ok
maybe not that but how about these two
well we've made something that can do
everything these controls can do and a
little bit more and what would we call
control that can replace all the
controllers in your collection well you
would call it the all controller for the
past two years we've been designing this
controller by creating a bunch of
different models coming up with
different internal components and
external pieces to really get the best
features we could possibly fit in a tiny
package right out of the box our
controller has a bunch of different
drivers built into it so that you can
connect to virtually any operating
system on any computer you own and not
only that you'll be able to play any
video game ever made and when we say any
video game we literally mean that if the
game didn't have controller support
initially you'll be able to control your
mouse and keyboard directly from the
controller itself the old controller can
connect to Windows Mac and Linux and it
also has the ability to connect to iOS
and Android just use the built-in screen
on the controller to select the device
you want to connect to and then connect
it's just that easy and that built-in
screen isn't just for connecting to
different devices you're also able to
customize the controller and a bunch of
different ways remap every single button
every single joystick invert them adjust
their dead zones adjust their
sensitivity and adjust the trigger
sensitivity whatever you want to do
you're capable of doing it with our
built-in operating system within the
controller itself if you want you can
even set up the entire controller to
just do macros or set up macros on the
fly
whatever game you're playing however you
want to play it this can
we'll give you more options than any
other controller ever made we're adding
new support for devices all the time
through software updates for our
controller and those software updates
are totally free once you've gotten the
controller
we'll be adding new features as time
goes on alongside the old controller
we'll also be releasing the dongle that
allows you to connect to the Xbox 360
Xbox one PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4
and all the features you've seen all
that customizability also works on those
systems as well everything you've seen
in this video is based off of a real
controller that already works but what
we need your help to do is raise enough
money so that we can produce these
things on a larger scale and start
sending them out to people so if you
want to help us check out our
Kickstarter page below and thank you so
much for watching
life can get rough hate crimes are on
the rise street harassment is rampant
abuse of power often goes unaddressed
it's not hard to imagine it happening to
you
perpetrators think that they can get
away with it because in many cases it's
going to be their word against yours
unless you have video proof that's why
we're making the showing scream-can a
wearable personal security camera that
instantly secures video in the cloud
using cellular networks children scream
cam is almost completely hands-free
it doesn't require any precision and
starts documenting your experience at
the tap of a button stream can provide
the choice of cellular or Wi-Fi
connectivity and your videos are
uploaded automatically to secure a cloud
and any video remaining on the camera
itself is completely encrypted you can
set the camera to record to whatever
destination you want using the Shonan
app you can record to micro SD card
stream to the show and cloud or set it
to broadcast to services like Facebook
live you can even set it to stream and
record to micro SD at the same time the
Shonan app makes it easy to customize
almost anything on the device and also
provides an easy way to instantly watch
and share your video we've also designed
Shonen stream cam to be rugged and
waterproof so you can depend on it to
work in any environment and just like a
security camera Shonen stream cameras
visibility and iconic design can act as
a possible deterrent to aggressors
the simple clipping mechanism lets you
easily wear the device in multiple ways
without struggling with mounts or having
to buy new equipment but Shonen stream
cam does work with Universal mounts as
well and if you need more recording time
you can simply snap on the extended
battery pack showing stream cam works in
any scenario biking to work going for a
run walking home at night or joining
marches or process whenever you need a
witness on your side showing extreme
kamas they're ready for anything we've
all seen in the media how video has the
power to drive societal change from the
grassroots video is set to become the
transformative force of our generation
it has the power to move government's
and billion-dollar corporations because
it's got the power to move people so
join us
this is it the start of your day you
wake up walk to the bathroom and repeat
one of the oldest traditions of mankind
shaving now let me ask you something how
much money do you spend on shaving each
year well let me tell you that it's way
too much so that's why I want to
introduce you to the happy shaver the
happy shaver is a strip developed to
shop in your blade before every shake
just rub your razor upwards against the
strip to reuse one blade up to 90 times
and save up to $160 every year so listen
to your inner voice and don't let the
industry for you it's time to spend your
money on the things that make you happy
top by using the happy shaver you also
contribute to a better environment while
reducing the waste of disposable razor
place the strip under travel case a hand
made in Europe using washed denim and
real Italian leather after picking the
right material size and design they
finally make the perfect trip to
reinvent shaving so please stop thinking
about the small things that can change
your life together we can bring this new
shaving experience to your local stores
your kids on one hand you know they have
tremendous potential and you're
confident they'll have an incredible job
in a developing market on the other hand
they can enjoy eating an entire tube of
toothpaste when getting them a new toy
you want it to be fun because they're
just kids but you also want to develop
their more intellectual side because
they can't really eat paste for a living
meat algal Rex smart coating blocks that
teach your kids actual coding it's a
simple concept choose and build a robot
code it to do nearly anything then press
play and watch it go here's what's
special about algal banks while there
are many stem products the teacher kid
to think analytically algorithm or than
that it teaches your kids how to
actually code the code a robot your kid
uses two types of bricks functions and
parameters just like in code their
function blocks for sound movement and
lights stacking parameters on top of
functions create the different actions
big parameters for small children and
small ones for more complex commands
here's a line of code that will make the
Algol cannon play music moves straight
then spin a write while blinking its
eyes and blue and red lights then shoot
balls for six seconds here's how that
line will look in real code
Algol breaks even helps your kids be
bugged their code by lighting up what's
currently running want to make it even
more interesting add sensors to the bot
to respond to sound touch the distance
and lights and it all connects to an
Arduino ring with all these options the
possibilities are endless here's an algo
bot that takes a bite every time you
clap your hands and this sparest wheel
starts spinning when you open its door
you don't have to invent your own
activities algal brakes comes with
various activity boards and activity
cards that will lead your kids step by
step on the path to becoming a coder
once your kid masters a little bit the
transition to real code is a cinch all
you need to do is sit back watch your
kids expand their minds and then clean
up the carpet because after all there's
still kids
now that sounds great but you've heard
about stuff like this before and you
know what happens buy a new toy your
kids get excited then five minutes later
they're back on their tablet not without
rubrics and rubrics is compatible with
Lego bricks
remember when you were kid and couldn't
stop playing with them now imagine if
you can make anything you created make
sounds light up and come to life algal
bricks was created by two people Amir
and dad both obsessed with education
through games
danny has a PhD in robotics and Amir is
an education tech entrepreneur and
founder of young engineers an
educational network that teaches stem in
over 40 countries worldwide together
they want to take coding education to a
whole new level so if you want to bring
out your kids full potential and teach
them how to actually code get out of the
wings your kids will have an incredible
time and a bright future algal Brix
watch the tutorial videos on our
campaign page to see what your kid will
learn with algal Brix</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
