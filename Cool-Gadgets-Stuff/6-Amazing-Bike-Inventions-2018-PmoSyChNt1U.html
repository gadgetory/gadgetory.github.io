hi this is Harry my name is Paul we are
the founders of Macbeth and we would
like to introduce you today our magnetic
pedal innovation
well it's a real new innovative panel
which was designed to give you solid
performance as you saw a club with
supporting force without fear
hassle-free pikey this is one of our
first prototypes we had to do a lot of
innovations to come to this product
exactly and what's really good on this
panel we can equip with different magnet
sizes so what you see here is our
standard panel this gives you a pulling
force of about 15 kilograms
click on solidly and you pull up
straight but as soon as you start to
shift your foot a little bit even in
case of critical situation you will get
up very easily in fact you will almost
not feel the magnet on the shoe we have
a metallic plate it fits on every SPD
compatible shoe one of the big
advantages of this setup is that it is
totally insensitive 2/3 you will not
stretch any floors because this is all
inside the sole without any elevations
it's a much lighter pedal and we have a
strong neodymium magnet which is the
strongest magnet that is available in
the market we have a simmer damper unit
on it which gives us the ability to
adjust the magnet height to fit the shoe
and also to give you that solid feel
when you come back onto your shoe and
when you write
all the best for a safe ride really hope
to see you out there
hopefully view from Macbeth on your bike
hi I'm Lucas Switzerland but this is not
about cheese in sports you want to leave
as little as possible to chance you want
to optimize the way you train the way
you regenerate the way you eat the way
you drink and drinking has a massive
effect on your performance so why do we
settle for water that tastes bad
contaminated by a plastic bubble now a
metal bottle or a glass bottle might
give you a better taste but it's too
heavy it's too much of a distraction
when you have to unscrew it it slows you
down you want to keep your pace right
keep your focus also you see I'm a team
player and in every good team you share
your bottle but then it's very important
you can have contact less drinking for
hygienic reasons so you want to squeeze
the bottle to push the water out Everest
is amazing equipment
everything's high-tech but then we drink
from the cheap plastic bottles our water
deserves better we deserve better
many told me it's not possible but I
kept going looking for the right
technology looking for the right people
and here we are the world's first
squeezable metal bottle Kegel pour in
Switzerland designed in Vienna produced
in Denmark and that's where the magic
happens a groundbreaking layering
process makes it possible to create a
titanium that's super light extremely
durable and most of all flexible
by the way the company mastering this
process is also renowned for producing
accelerator parts for CERN now all we
need to keep going is your support to
buy the tools and the materials for our
first production run help us bring key
go to life help us build the first
squeezable metal puddle
you
technology is moving at a lightning pace
from rockets that can explore the depths
of space to driverless smart cars while
some forms of transport have evolved
entirely innovation has neglected the
humble bicycle we've seen modern-day
bikes get sleeker and light but
commuting to work on a bike can often be
physically exhausting and embarrassing
while most have ignored this modest form
of transportation the evo wheel comes in
five sizes and fits over 95% of all
bikes in the market and allows you to
transform your bike into a pedal assist
by in a mere 30 seconds attaching the
wheel is simple and hassle-free
by simply replacing the front wheel of
your bike the first of our fully
wirelessly control options is our
Bluetooth enabled control unit you can
decide how much you want the innovative
power assist system to help you pedal
accurate from zero to a hundred percent
you can monitor your speed travel
distance and battery power in real time
alternatively you may use a dedicated
app to control the assist level that you
want the app displays five different
mode sets
giving you more authority over your
cycling experience Evel wheels
incredible pedal assist systems make
cycling uphill a walk in the park
charging the wheel is as simple as
plugging it into any socket a single
charge can allow you to travel up to 54
miles meaning your commute to work the
next day will be easy and hassle-free
make your commute to work enjoyable with
the state-of-the-art Eva will support us
