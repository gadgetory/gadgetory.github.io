less that's one of the main reasons we
designed the chameleon backpack the most
versatile backpack in the world a more
evolved more advanced form we all want
more time in the great outdoors and
every minute you spend packing and
prepping for a day trip is less time to
enjoy the trail so we combined the
everyday use and function of a day pack
with the convenience and comfort of an
ultralight chair we thought what's the
same backpack that used to carry loads
that help you take a load off
far more than a backpack to chair
transformation it's everything else
about the chameleon that makes it so
versatile let's start with design one
thing nobody likes about typical pack is
having to dig through your gear to get
to what you need with the chameleon you
don't have to dig at a glance you'll
notice the unique differ a range but
this is our pension if technology and
allows for easy access to the top middle
and bottom of the pack so you can get to
exactly what you need another
game-changer is the chameleons -
included patent-pending switch bags
these fill the entire volume of the pack
interior for maximum storage and
organization these bags will hold all of
the gear when you switch from backpack
the chair but also accessible from the
top for easy loading when housed inside
the pack but feature two full-length
double zippers on either side allowing
accessibility from any angle even for
lounging in your chair the chameleon
works great as a rucksack if you decide
to leave the chair frame and the switch
bags at home or pre pack your switch
bags for certain adventures then simply
snap in the ones you need and you're
ready to go when you arrive at your site
just snap them off with your gear inside
and store them in your tent and keep the
chair by the fire but you could also
connect the switch bags together forming
a drawstring backpack for some light
exploring for family adventures it's
nice to have extra switch bags for the
kids to help all some of the gear it's
also a good way to free up more space in
the chameleon for other
essentials for less primitive adventures
it makes a great travel pack it meets
the FAA standards and is the perfect
size for carry-on luggage we made sure
to water bladder and laptop storage
spaces along with the side cuff holder
and we designed the fact with molly's
and military and tactical bags you can
attach your desired items and increase
your capacity to suit your needs the
lashing buckles work great to carry
larger items like fishing poles tents
compound bones and more there's not a
path on the planet that does what our
pack does no backpack gives you this
much adaptability like the chameleon
does at trail form we break away from
the well-trodden path and we forge new
trails others will follow we are
Wayfarers the city is our wilderness and
the wilderness is our city we believe
that the outdoors is worth exploring and
that there's no defined space for it we
journey we explore and we sweat to reach
our destination and let's be honest
we're not going to climb Mount Everest
or swim across the Atlantic solo we
believe in unity and that moments are
meant to be shared so we create tools
that are designed to help us explore
that are strong enough for the woods
and sophisticated enough for the city
introducing the wolf and grizzly grill a
compact stainless steel grill that you
can install within seconds we've
engineered the wolf and grizzly grill in
two parts for simple assembly a frame
that you pull apart and a surface that
you unrolled and secure in place and
because there's no such thing as one
fire fits all the WG grill features many
different height configurations a high
position to cook above a wood fire a mid
position for a charcoal barbecue in your
backyard and the flat mode that lets you
use what you have around you to cook as
high or as low as you feel compelled to
compact and weighing about a kilogram
the grill is designed for easy transport
and everyday use
and because of the carefully selected
materials and finished a beautiful
patina develops over time you'll be

I'm C Damien Henning like many of you I
love spending time outdoors in the Sun
but we need protection sunscreen is
beneficial but running out by more
reapplying it getting it into our eyes
having a greasy face for the rest of the
day can be irritating to say the least
all caps don't offer much protection for
the face and numb to the neck lobby
crushes or Sun hats a little rims with
little protectors larger brim hats and
give more protection but wind can easily
blow the front brim up and the back can
be annoying if you're playing a sport
where you have to wake up or hiking with
a big backpack plus there are paying to
transport without bending or crushing
the wrong way and cleaning it you could
take a long time in meticulously clean
it by hand or throw it in the washing
machine is permanently warped the shape
many stiff brim Sun hats lose their
shape over a little time I've spent over
half of my adult life traveling and
trekking all over the world
and almost every single day I had a Sun
Hat with me after I was fed up with
buying a new Sun Hat every few months I
designed the shapeshifter the
shapeshifter Sun Hat is truly
revolutionary and it's the last Sun Hat
you'll ever need my pals and I are going
to show you the improvements I've made
to conventional Sun apps the
shapeshifter has a durable bendable wire
built into the brim that not only bends
to any shape but holds that shape and
won't break after multiple bends the
shape shifters brim will not fold or
flop and wind up to 65 miles an hour the
shapeshifter also fits well over a
winter cap or jacket hood keep the rain
off your face even in a torrential
downpour the brim won't buckle and it
floats bend it to any shape that suits
you while hiking so the brim doesn't
smack your pack or make sure the brim
doesn't hit your back while you're
playing sport
fine-tune the brim as much as you want
if you like sports shooting then decide
up when you need to for a clear shot
if photo shooting is more your thing
flips the brim up easily take your shot
and put it right back down or do the
same if you want to actually see your
face in the photo while leaving the hat
on relying solely on a neck cape and the
sweltering heat can make for some sweaty
times from the lack of ventilation but
for those occasions a cape will suit you
the shapeshifter comes with a cape that
tucks into a pouch under the bridge that
can be deployed when you need it if you
work outside in industries like
agriculture or landscaping you know how
hard it can be to store your Sun Hat
anew they're just not meant for bags but
thanks to the durable and bendable brim
cable you can fold up the shapeshifter
and fit it easily your tool bags
backpacks messenger bag small day bag or
a purse you can even slip it into a
pocket the shapeshifter also comes with
a zip off ground it's a great way to
avoid sweaty hat especially for those
with long thick hair you might not want
it squash down or maybe you just like to
let your hair fly free you can shape
this hat in an infinite amount of ways
including Ozzie Bushman cowboy
gold prospectors eighteenth-century
tricorn and the classic fedora plus it's
totally washer and dryer safe
hey there I'm Marcus and this is Ken for
the past two years our company anywhere
wild has produced apparel and
accessories for hikers backpackers and
outdoor enthusiasts we're excited to
debut our latest product exclusively to
the Kickstarter community introducing
the Sierra trail Gator these are a
must-have accessory for hikers
backpackers trail runners or anyone
who's sick of debris hitching a ride
we've all been there you're making your
way down the trail and you have to stop
to dig out all the little bits of nature
your shoes have picked up along the way
this guy knows what I'm talking about
well we decided to get to work designing
the perfect solution to this common
problem our Gators are an ultra
lightweight and simple way to keep rocks
sticks and other debris out of your
shoes they're easy to use slip them over
your foot like a sock attached under
your shoes and you're off we've tested
multiple prototypes to get the materials
and fit just right our product tester
has told us they were so light and
comfortable they forgot they were even
on one of the things that makes our
trail Gators so unique is the technology
we use to construct them rather than
traditional sewn seams that are prone to
breaking and create friction points we
use what is called a bonded seam which
is a high-tech process that fuses
fabrics together without the need for
thread originally developed for use in
pro cycling apparel the technology is
tried-and-true
and we're excited to put it on your feet
we've also worked with a fabric mill to
produce custom fabric that is
comfortable and lightweight but still
provides the protection we're looking
for on top of the construction we wanted
to keep you looking good on the trail if
you're traipsing around in the dirt you
should look good doing it we developed
for custom patterns that draw
inspiration from different features of
nature topo Cragg wash and pine are
already at home in the forest mountains
or wherever you find yourself
as you can see we've thought of every
little thing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
