welcome to the string cleaner by toun
year the screen cleaner is the only
product that cleans 360 degrees of all
strings simultaneously and simply is the
ultimate string cleaning tool this
revolutionary product removes all the
harmful oils and corrosive substances
left behind from your fingers and if
used after every time you play your
guitar the string cleaner will extend
the life of your strings up to ten times
longer than normal and on our model for
bass guitar we extended the microfiber
to cover the bottom of the device so
that it also cleans the fretboard to
open the string cleaner simply place
your thumb on the hinge side of the
device and with your first and second
fingers apply downward pressure to
release the latches then with your
instrument in a flat position slide the
string cleaner underneath the strings
and snap it closed once it is closed
grab the handle and confidently run the
device up and down the neck of the
guitar the string cleaner was designed
with beveled edges that we call fret
ramps and they allowed a device to
smoothly hop up and glide along without
creating any lateral pressure to the
frets or fretboard
the string cleaner is not a disposable
item for its specially designed
microfiber pads our cleanable simply run
under warm water with a drop of soap
gently rinse out any debris then with a
dry cloth Pat the pads
and then leave it out the fully air dry
introducing the NS micro clip free tuner
it's a discreet headstock tuning
solution that stays put and stays out of
sight first attach the clip free tuner
to the included mount by sliding it in
place then remove the screw from one of
your tuning machines

screw hole and use one of the included
screws to fasten the tuner to the tuning
machine being careful not to
over-tighten power it on find your
favorite angle and set the orientation

vaults truth works if you're tired of a
slippery pic or having to play with only
a specific brand you are like the rest
of us and likely tried the sticky and
messy stuff out there only to find it
wasn't a clean solution that is why we
have made monster grips utilizing a
patented silicone that provides the
ultimate non-slip grip that isn't sticky
and stays clean we have applied it as a
simple sticker surprisingly durable yet
ultra thin it is extremely comfortable
and is certain to enhance your playing
experience while we had set out to make
the most perfect pick rig solution we
discovered the enormous possibilities it
inherently carried monster grips are the
perfect answer for guitar picks drum
sticks effects pedals and equipment
woodwinds brass instruments and anything
else your heart desires to give a
non-slip grip we put this in the hands
of local musicians and they simply can't
believe they ever played without it
monster grips amazing properties allow
you to hold the pick even more lightly
producing even better articulation while
reducing fatigue
we have teamed up with the amazingly
talented Matt Crystal so be sure to
check out the various offers thank you
and rock on
