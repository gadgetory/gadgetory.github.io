a good space so we set out to make the
best shower experience we have developed
the next generation of showering
hi my name is David I'm CEO here at met
our company spent over 130 years
engineering showers right here in New
Zealand New Zealand is an island nation
we have a strong spirit of innovation we
believe that taking care of the earth
most precious resource water is now our
responsibility existing shower
technologies can save water but the
experience is often compromised so you
get weak water mists and water clarity
or jet ruin has more coverage than
conventional showers and delivers
increased total spray booze this is a
major leap forward in designing water
efficient chair experience
hello my name's Andy Gregor I'm the
global head of design and innovation
here at me we've spent over two years
creating lower our most advanced shell
system today Brewer uses way less water
under two gallons per minute rules
design defies convention with this
combination of intriguing sculptural
contours and sophisticated simplicity
we've made sure that water sailing no
longer means a bad shower experience
Methvin has been around for a few years
actually more than a hundred and thirty
and we used all our experience and
talent to create this technology right
now we are finishing the beta testing of
our shower system and we're ready to
launch manufacturing by the end of the
year
bringing these innovations to life and
creating awareness is not that easy from
music that's why we need your help
help us to crowd fund our project scale
our manufacturing and bring this project
to life saving water has never felt so
amazing and looked so beautiful why
should a luxury watch cost you a fortune
you see over the past few decades some
of the biggest luxury brands in the
industry have been inflating their
prices without adding much value for us
they're our customers and that's why
we've been working with industry experts
for the last four years to offer
unprecedented value at low prices
because of your help the previous two
collections we introduced on Kickstarter
launched a revolution in the luxury
industry with a single goal to make
luxury watches accessible to everyone
and that's why we are back on
Kickstarter so you our early supporters
can be the first to own the future of
luxury but more on that in a moment
first we substantially upgraded our
Venice and Rome collections together
with senior designers from Switzerland
we have found a way to infuse our
collections with even more elegance
charm and sophistication we have managed
to do so without affecting the
affordable prices you have come to
expect from us introducing the new and
improved Rome series a study in elegant
simplicity and understated classic
design and here's the Venice collection
an even more sophisticated design
featuring our original day and night
complication
but then we thought how can we push
ourselves even further and so we noticed
that more and more of our clients who
are asking us about the rise of
smartwatches when we looked into it more
carefully we identified two main
problems on the one hand tech companies
are making smart watches that look like
gadgets on the other hand traditional
watch makers are introducing smart
watches but to nobody's surprise they're
overpricing them like they always do and
then it dawned on us we could use our
knowledge and design the most epic
luxury SmartWatch and make it truly
affordable and that's why with the
introduction of our new collection we
set out to expand the revolution and
bridge the gap between traditional
craftsmanship and technology introducing
the Filip already Renaissance our first
affordable luxury smart punch you will
be able to choose from two styles with
either white or blue dial our hybrid
luxury SmartWatch will allow you to
monitor your sleep patterns track daily
activity keep you focused and control
your mobile and smart home devices it
has all the relevant tech functionality
of a SmartWatch but it looks like a
classic high-end luxury timepiece in the
past people have had serious problems
with SmartWatch battery life not anymore
the filly polarity Renaissance can run
for over a year on a single charge the
best part of all is that we're going to
co-develop this project together with
you we will use your feedback to build
tailor-made products and technology that
will actually meet your needs back our
project now and reserve your timepiece
at the lowest price we will ever offer
join us today and let's transform the
luxury industry together
hi i'm ryan and i'm elias we are part of
the team behind sonic soak sonic soak is
a smartphone sized device that uses
ultrasound technology to clean almost
anything in ways never before possible
it clings to the microscopic level
beyond what any laundry machine or
cleaning spray can do the inspiration
for this device came from the fact that
we were frequent travelers and cleaning
our clothes while on the go was always a
hassle so we had to set out to find a
good solution
it's also quiet and can be used to clean
more than clothes it can clean glasses
jewelry fruits razors baby bottles the
products that are tough to clean using
sponges or rags or your hands or soap
and water I think they get the idea is
ok I just want to be clear this is the
best way to clean
pretty much anything sonic soap works by
generating ultrasonic sound waves that
create microscopic high pressure bubbles
to wash away dirt grime and oils we had
no idea at the time that we come up with
was a device that had so many benefits
outside of travelers wanting an easy way
to wash clothes while on the go it's
also simple to use you simply place it
in water add some soap turn on the
built-in timer and walk away 30 minutes
later your clothes are cleaner than ever
before
sonic Stoke is designed for travelers
moms neat freaks looking for a thorough
cleanse and not just on clothes by the
way but on fruits and vegetables to
folks with small loads of laundry
fashionistas that eat a better solution
for their gentle cycle or hand wash only
clothes folks that don't have the space
for a full sized laundry machine really
it's for anyone who wants a cleaner will
almost anything because sonic soak is
more than a great way to clean your
laundry it can clean just about anything
you can stick in the water with it so if
you like things clean free from all
those nasty things you can only see up
close

is ready to be shipped just after our
campaign ends we just need you to help
