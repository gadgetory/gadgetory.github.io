blocks at Casa Bella my cuacamole stays
fresh the days just fill smooth hover
fresh and store days later and fill
fresh ready to serve no need for a cell
block lock works with all my favorite
dip ready to fiesta hopefully our
leftovers doors going going not gone bla
black bye Casa Bella make it save it
crave it if you're used to microwave
cooking then you're probably used to the
compromises that it brings
but with new microwave cookware by Mike
oh you can instantly improve your meals
with our simple easy to use products
thanks to advanced heat wave technology
these delicious meals and snacks were
created using just a regular microwave
and myko microwavable cookware markers
heat wave technology allows you to
utilize your microwave to bake grill try
and poach we wanted to combine the
simplicity of using a microwave with the
benefits that you get from using the
traditional appliance and this is where
my tech comes into its element the three
products in the micro range are each
designed to enable you to cook the
perfect snack perfectly grilled toasted
cheese sandwiches are just as good as
those made in a sandwich maker baked
potatoes crisp on the outside
fluffy on the inside and just as if they
were up in Vegas but cooked in a
fraction of the time in the myko potato
baker eggs that have been delicately
poached or perfectly fried the egg
cooker is faster than cooking in a pan
and unlike other microwavable products
delivers delicious runny yolks every
time
Mico is ideal for busy lifestyles
working lunches and click tasty snacks
and mix in no time and when you finish
there is no hassle the whole thing can
go straight in the dishwasher we
discovered this new technology heat wave
technology the next phase is like how do
we apply that to a product there are
many many different prototypes that we
have to create and refine the design
make sure everything works and also
refine the technology so we get the best
heat transfer into the food firstly we
actually utilize the microwave to cook
the inside potato really quickly so in
around 8 minutes you've got the inside
cut perfectly we then put the lid on top
switch create another new environment
and heat wave technology in this case
absorbs the microwaves he cooks around
230 degrees and they create a really
crispy outer shell and baked potato I've
been working on a micro project now for
12 months a lot of effort has been put
in by all the guys within the class
after we've proven the principles we've
got prototypes that work and now we
can't wait to get these into
by batching this glass house project on
IndieGoGo you can be one of the first to
get your hands on my Co the new method
in your microwave every year in the UK
alone almost 50 million litres of wine
are poured down the plughole that's a
massive 270 million pounds down the
drain you know how it is you crack open
that one last bottle with friends the
weekend and then the rest ends up on
your kitchen counter for three days
exposed to oxygen and your vino turns to
vinegar sure this wine preservation
devices out there but are either
ineffective as the wine is still in
contact with some air or expensive and
you tied in too pricey refills which got
me thinking there had to be a better way
to preserve your wines for flavor no
matter how much you had left so I came
up with a tall simple elegant and it
really works here's how to count your
whole bottle into it all this opens up
the wine and brings out its character
pour yourself a glass a sharp lip is
drip free pouring but then here's the
magic push down on the neck and the
unique patented design forms a complete
seal preventing any further contact with
oxygen to preserve your wines full
flavor
ideally store etter in the fridge to
keep both white and red in perfect
condition until you decide it's time for
another glass then simply tip Ã«til and
the innovative valve automatically opens
as you pour no gases no pumping that can
strip wine of its flavor
just good practical design to test its
preservation capability we took our
prototypes the laboratories of banger
University
we tested at all against leaving wine in
a quart bottle and the number of other
well-known preservation solutions the
results were indisputable at all far out
performs them all I was really amazed
and I have to say surprise when I first
tried it I couldn't believe that a wine
which had been decanted into it seven
days beforehand tasted every bit as
fresh at the wine which had come from a
recently opened bottle but it also had
the added benefits of decanting in that
the wine was breathing it was opening up
it was tasting absolutely delicious we
built over 60 prototypes tested to
achieve the perfect seal and simplify
ethyl for easy cleaning and assembly
it's also been designed for durability
and all materials are of the highest
quality all rigorously tested to ensure
they have no effect on the wines flavor
in 2015 we launched the for no bread
event on Kickstarter to help home bakers
make awesome bread at home with the
support of almost 800 backers and 20
countries we brought the Forno to life
now we're back here on Kickstarter to
tell you about how we've made for no
even better and we're excited to
introduce you for know 2.0 here's how it
works
just like with the four-note classic you
place the 4-node 2.0 in your oven to
preheat when your oven gets up to
temperature we place your bread on our
new baking tray and slide it into the
floor no use a new removable handle the
tray stays in the floor no is you bake
by closing the hatch you'll trap the
steam from the baking bread a magic
ingredient for creating a delicious
crust and getting amazing oven spring
the removable handle makes this easier
than ever when the bread is cooked just
remove the hatch and slide the tray out
for no 2.0 is designed to help make the
floor no bread oven even easier and
safer
and to give you even more creative
control over your bread pieces and other
delicious cakes gives best of all if you
already own the for know bread up it's
easy to upgrade to 2.0 all you need to
do is add the new components which are
totally compatible here to the same oven
we're passionate about making tools and
make it fun and easy to cook at home
we're confident that for a know 2.0 will
help you make your best bread ever Bon
Appetit and let's keep making real
friend
in a world full of digital innovation
and efficiency there's a place in
everyone's life that's still a dangerous
jungle of mismanagement and
disorientation looking for a cold drink
and missing the best part of the game
sound familiar
come on buddy you can make it warm
warmer cold colder yep there you go and
it only took you a whole minute we think
getting a cold drink out of your fridge
shouldn't feel like pissing in the wind
from now on you can make sure you grab
the coldest drink and nothing else every
time you want one with cool bro warm in
cold out or as we say just chill angry
