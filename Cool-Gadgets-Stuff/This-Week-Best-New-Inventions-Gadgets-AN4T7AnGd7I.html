past and that's toilet paper it doesn't
work as well as it should and it's a
serious strain on the environment
flushable wipes seemed like a step in
the right direction but they're actually
even worse
wipe drop I found the future an
alternative that's more hygienic
environmentally friendly affordable and
it looks awesome
meet sunny it's a portable bidet you
might be thinking but de what am i some
sort of offensive pants French
aristocrat no but now you can be as
clean as one sunny doesn't require
installation and can live discreetly in
any bathroom using sunny is simple just
charge it fill it with water and enjoy a
revitalizing micro shower where you need
it most
now let's watch my wife give a
demonstration wait what in abstract
demonstration oh cool using dry paper to
clean a creamy or chunky situation is
just downright counterintuitive this is
disgusting I know right now try this
water really is the best solution and
not just for after going number two but
also for numbers three through five
menstrual post-coital and postnatal
cleanliness you don't have to
demonstrate those do we know it's
obvious that sunny keeps your behind
clean but it can do the same for your
conscience as well before this modern
marvel my lovely wife and I plowed
through 112 rolls of toilet paper every
year we're not proud that's just the
average as their beloved wacky neighbor
I can tell you these two used a lot more
I don't like knowing that you know that
you know what I don't like knowing that
in the US alone we wasted five hundred
billion gallons of water and decimated
fifteen million trees a year for this
I'm not saying they're better than us
but Europe and Japan have been riding
the bidet train for decades meanwhile
we're taking the future of our planet
and we're wiping our asses with it which
is why now is the time for this water
wand to weave its earth rescuing magic
hey I spent a lot of money on those
exactly all that cash will save the
sunny practically pays for itself
so do I get reimbursed or what's the
deal guys
maybe you've already spent time and
money installing a bad day on your home
commode
what happens if you have to go on the go
what really sets Sonny apart from the
competition is that it's 100% portable
this way you can be the best cleanest
version of yourself no matter where you
are push the button on my phone and now
a car is here to whisk us away not too
long ago that may have sounded insane
but now we couldn't imagine living
without it yeah
innovation makes our lives better and
now it's time to take that forward
thinking to our backsides what are you
guys shooting some kind of commercial
yeah we're doing a commercial for a
portable bidet I can really use one of
those yeah you look like you could honey
Hey look I'm sorry about that what do
you say we start fresh the only thing I
want to wipe away is the past and that's
toilet paper today we're always on the
move we're driving more than ever before
as a result our cars are becoming more
advanced they now have all of these
features but what has never changed
is this the car waste disposal system if
anything our cars come equipped with
only an ashtray so we try to find
solutions and the products on the market
are sub-optimal and they take away
essential functions of our car's
interior introducing snack bags the
ultimate driver friendly car waste bin
that does not distract the driver nor
compromise any function of the car
snap bag helps you manage your car waste
effortlessly and systematically while
driving and without any distraction you
easily open snap bags store your waste
and snap it back into its sealed
snap begs patent-pending mechanism
flexible v-shaped engineering and
compact design allowing you to dispose
of large amounts of waste in just a
small space it expands progressively
even when full it barely affects legroom
space for passengers in the backseat we
made sure that snap bag is leak proof so
you no longer have to worry about
spilling liquids that stain your car
interior we equipped snap bag with
strong magnets to firmly closed at all
times keeping waste and smell away from
your senses in your mind
snap bag simply blends with your car's
interior while maintaining the comfort
of everyone in the car thanks to its
premium materials and well-thought-out
colors it becomes a natural extension of
your car snap bags recycling pack allows
you to sort your waste so that for the
first time recycling can start from
within the car snap bags installation is
an easy one-time process you secure the
top strap on the headrest adjust the
height to your convenience then tie the
bottom laces to secure snap bag in place
when full unbutton the three inner
buttons on each side to remove the
disposable bag and replace it with a new
one
I'm Andrew Gibbs Dabney founder of lives
and designs
it lives in we make clothing for people
who value experiences more than stuff by
creating with durability and versatility
in mind our clothing is designed to
allow you to own less and live more our
design process starts with mixing
technical outdoor features with modern
style in order to look good enough to
wear everyday be tough enough to stand
up to anything and be so comfortable you
won't want to wear anything else last
year we assembled an experienced team an
amazing factory and launched on
Kickstarter we successfully filled
pledges to over 500 backers and went on
to sell out of our remaining stock in a
matter of weeks
what happened next blew us away with
hundreds of flex camest pants being
tested in the wild we started to hear
from you we received over fifty five
star reviews from fans who let us know
their lives and pants had become their
instant favorite and they wear them
every day
we also heard your feedback about how we
can make them better and we listened and
now we're back on Kickstarter
introducing the refined updated and more
sustainable flex canvas pants version to
your favorite pants are now even better
our flex canvas pants are constructed
with a robust blend of organic cotton
recycled polyester and spandex fabric
that really moves when you move made
even more versatile by adding a
hydrophobic c6 DWR treatment to shed
water and fight stains we pair this
incredible fabric with a gusseted crotch
and articulated knees to offer
unparalleled range of motion features
like a hidden security pocket mesh line
seat and zippered rear pockets and a
rollup leg system our thoughtfully and
subtly assembled into a pair of pants
equally at home on the trail or in the
office and after extensive field testing
by ourselves and you we optimized the
upper dimensions for a more flattering
silhouette we made the front pockets
deeper to accommodate more styles of
phones we made the knife pockets bigger
to accommodate bigger knives
put it on both legs we improved the
roll-up system to make it more intuitive
and improve the quality and durability
of the button that it's fixed on we
believe truly sustainable clothing is
built to last and then taken care of and
that's why we offer a lifetime at cost
repair program for all of our clothing
helping you get more out of your
belongings and keeping our apparel out
of the landfill it's important to me to
express my gratitude for you for helping
us get this company off the ground one
year ago our team is ready to do it
again and further our mission to create
durable versatile clothing so we can own
less and live more
