Philippines where generations of
indigenous people through centuries of
survival and real-life use have
perfected the design of their most
valuable tool the machete we proudly
bring you the trail blade based on the
original this machete merges their
legendary design with modern materials
and engineering to create the ultimate
outdoor tool so one of the things I
really like about the trail blade is the
shape first of all you'll notice it's
flared towards the end a lot more weight
towards the end kind of gives it a skin
makes an idea for chopping it balances
out really nice actually but right here
get a nice chop the cutting edge is
completely straight so all the way to
the tip all the way here is usable
cutting edge palawan has made their
machetes out of Springs from trucks but
one of the problems with that was that
they rust terribly and when you're in a
jungle environment where it's moist damp
all the time they just rust they just
rust this however is that is an
improvement this is a crucibles s35vn
stainless steel it's corrosion resistant
but on top of that they've they've
engineered this to be very hard it holds
an edge extremely well and yet it's not
too hard to sharpen in its chip
resistant which is also really important
you get some of these harder skills this
is a hard steel but you get some harder
steel and you hit a rock or something
like that you'll end up with a big chip
out of it and if that happens yeah
that's the problem we had with deep loud
machete blunt that what happened we also
have a really interesting take on the
home they've got a home it's convex
rather than flat ground or even concave
which makes it so that when you're
chopping into something something a
piece of wood or tree all that force
that pinching force that happens when
you cut into that tree is happening
really close to the sharp edge of the
blade
