energy provider the exclusive control in
the supply of a commodity is called a
monopoly today 81 percent of our energy
still comes from burning fossil fuels
the United States withdrawal from the
Paris climate change agreement to pursue
coal production is a step backwards for
humankind there's very little incentive
for energy companies to quickly adopt
clean energy the fossil fuels are the
source of their profits
we're plx devices a Silicon Valley
California company and we created
Allegiant solar Legion Solar is energy
delivered to your door last May we
launched this do-it-yourself solar
system thanks to 400 backers we made
this vision a reality
backers learned how easy it is to
generate their own electricity and
monitor their savings we deployed our
starter set which consists of
lightweight high efficiency solar panels
a micro inverter to convert sunlight
into grid energy a solar hub for
internet-connected monitoring via
smartphone app and plug and play wiring
for easy installation backers enjoyed
setting up their system in minutes and
scaling their production by connecting
expansion sets in the daisy chain legion
Soler's three times more affordable than
traditional systems achieving unmatched
return on investment Legion solar - they
exert yourself forward to the next level
with three new innovations so our
builder Roxanne finder and Solari going
there with solar builder simply log in
to Legion solar comm pull up your
property satellite image and build your
system by stepping through simple
questions you'll be able to customize
your system size that best suits you
specify your mounting options and
explore production strategies once
complete your customized system will
automatically ship straight to your door
in a typical solar system the cost of
installation can be up to one half the
cost making solar an impractical
solution we solve this problem and we
created Raptor finder this device
unlocks a secret to locating your
rafters allowing you to do a
professional installation easily by
yourself rafter finder will be included
free of charge with the purchase of your
roofs mounting hardware for those of you
who have a single direction utility
meter solar is now possible with solar
regulator solar regulator is a device
that safely attaches to your power lines
to sense current flow to and from the
grid solar regulator communicates with
your inverters to regulate energy
production so that you'll never produce
more energy than your current
consumption solar regulator also works
with bi-directional meters to prevent
putting energy back into the grid due to
the highly disproportionate incentives
for production versus consumption a
smarter strategy is to keep energy on
your side of the meter by implementing
creative DIY solutions such as setting
up a timer for your pool pump or hot tub
during peak Sun run your washer/dryer
dishwasher air conditioner or charge
your electric vehicle to avoid consuming
creative energy at night additionally
with rapidly growing home battery
storage solutions bleach and solar will
allow you to store excess energy
produced during the day for consumption
at night your first step to carbon free
energy independence with the pledge for
Allegiant solar starter set experience
firsthand how
it is for you to generate your own clean
energy we need your help so that we can
move one step closer to a carbon for
your world become a legion today people
try to lose fat in different ways some
exercise some diet and some do nothing
but are they happy with the results yeah
except for these thunder thighs
well this mommy told me is impossible
these handles done get much love let's
face it we all have those stubborn areas
of fat we just can't get rid of meat
silicon lipo the first targeted fat
reduction device for home use that
really works no diet no exercise simply
use silken lipo for just 15 minutes a
day and get results no diet no exercise
only 15 minutes a day that's right just
eight weeks targeting stubborn areas
will reduce fat and strengthen
underlying muscles so you can give your
body the shape you've always wanted
I don't know silken lipo really works
silken lipo uses the same proven
technology found in a large professional
light therapy machines found in the
world's most advanced and expensive
beauty clinics we've simply shrunk that
same technology into the first-ever
affordable easy-to-use home device to
make it even better we've combined the
low-level light therapy with electrical
muscle stimulation technology EMS to
optimize the fat reduction and
strengthen underlying muscles
low level light therapy is a proven
technology for the permanent reduction
of fat with years of clinical experience
in my own clinic low level light therapy
is one of the most popular it can
permanently slim firm and shape areas
without downtime without pain without
discomfort without the side effects
associated with traditional surgical
treatments when I first heard that
they've been able to compact lower light
therapy into a simple little home device
I was understandably skeptical but when
I reviewed the basic science and the
results I've come to realize a Silk'n
lipo is as effective as some of my large
body contouring Lovera P systems I use
in the office that the patient can use
15 minutes a day and over the same kind
of permanent fat contouring and body
slimming results I've been able to
achieve within office treatments how
does it work that is accumulated by your
body and stored in fat cells under your
skin Silk'n lipo uses specifically
calibrated frequencies of light to
perforate fat cell walls releasing their
fatty contents and harmlessly causing
shrinkage in the region once outside the
cell your body's natural processes flush
the fatty acids out of your system in
the same natural way regular dietary
fibers expelled to accelerate this
process and to help build strength and
muscle tone silk an added EMS technology
this stimulates muscle activity and
circulation in the treated area speeding
up the rate at which the excess fat is
flushed out of your system leaving your
body looking at
silk'n the pioneers of permanent hair
removal technology shrunk down for home
use now brings you clinically proven
non-invasive fat reduction technology to
let you target those stubborn areas and
give your body the shape you want one
last thing for the first time on
IndieGoGo we're promising to ship by
Christmas or your money back guaranteed
say goodbye to stubborn fat
safety is made of lightweight durable
aluminum frame and polycarbonate on top
of that it is also outstandingly
designed we have created a temp roof
back that you can lock with a
three-digit combination lock or a
fingerprint model
you can lock safety to something sturdy
and prevent a theft
this is achieved by unique cut resisting
strap that is made of thin wire ropes
additional safety is proved by motion
detector and alarm both
built-in components of the back
which say if you back you will travel
without stress your money credit cards
documents or your phone will be safely
stored however they won't be kept safe
only from the thieves but also from
water because safety is also waterproof
you can also recharge your device
because of an efficient built-in power
bank safety is also perfect back for the
beach just put your phone in and enjoy
yourself while swimming if anybody tries
to steal it the alarm will go on
it can also be used as a portable alarm
device in a hotel or anywhere else where
you can hang it on the door
if anybody enters safety through volume
this is a new process
visitin process one year ago we launched
one of the most popular 3d printers in
Denmark to make it even better we
collected all our users feedback and
created the most user-friendly 3d
printer ever now we will put it to the
ultimate user test we gathered six
participants with no experience in 3d
printing we set up a studio can they
print their first object with no help
wow it's really light very easy simply
find models to print there's a lot of
like designs here I'm gonna select this
base so I just push print okay so it's
talking right now without me knowing
it's eating some cinnamon I don't know
if it's tasty Oz says it's warming up
and I have to wait until 190 degrees
it's 92 degrees what's going pretty
quick I thought it was gonna take a long
time it says 140 oh it's done it's doing
something
moving what's making it oh that's really
cool
five minutes ago there wasn't anything
just a little string popped up it's not
necessarily the most environments well I
think before so it's not plastic
okay then I'm on board I can't believe
it
what much lighter than I thought it's
amazing it's hard for me to believe that
I made it like this that was it looks
like something that could only make
small sizes like this like a tennis ball
you can actually make a football with no
prior knowledge ready for action
just made this unbelievable I'm not very
good at this kind of thing so I think we
got it to work at all this amazing thing
I made a fashion bracelet I can use it
without any instructions prior there was
a small humming from a machine like a PC
but that was only dose like two or three
clicks away it's not that hard back us
today and make 3d printing for everyone
planet earth over time man has adapted
to their environment by creating tools
to help perform their tasks as time
progresses the need for different types
of tools our eyes with the technology
available to design and create new tools
constantly evolving where stat gear and
over the past few years we've shipped
over 10,000 products to our Kickstarter
backers in 2015 we successfully funded
the original bits blade with over 700
backers introducing the bits plate 2.0
an evolved multi-tool designed with your
everyday needs in mind the bits plate
2.0 has 26 functions such as 9
double-sided s2 steel bits or 4 TC
stainless steel knife blade a box cutter
and a scraper a bottle opener
a pry bar a hex wrench a carbide tip
window punch and an LED light
machined from an aircraft grade aluminum
the bitts blade 2.0 is super strong yet
weighs less than three ounces
designed to the middle compartment to
store one of the three interchangeable
tools one of the nine double-sided bits
can also remain within the tool
staying secured by an internal magnet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
