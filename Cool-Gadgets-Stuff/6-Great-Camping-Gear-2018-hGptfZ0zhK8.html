mosquitoes are actually a growing
problem there's new diseases there's
Zika there's dengue there's West Nile
the season for mosquitoes is getting
longer and longer and they just get in a
way of spending time outdoors enjoying
the activities that each of us love and
spending time with friends and family in
our backyard sprays and repellents that
you put on your skin just get in the way
of outdoor fun
so thermos L solution to that is zone
repellency so we came out with radius
radius is a new and better way to fight
mosquitos you just turn it on and
mosquitoes are gone the radius of ice is
so easy to use it's push-button simple
literally one button on the front of the
vise push that to turn it on you
instantly see the light come on and that
lets you know that the device is active
and working radius uses an epa-approved
active ingredient that is based on a
naturally occurring repellent found in
the chrysanthemum flower and our
scientists have worked on a formula that
can be activated at a lower temperature
which enables us to use a rechargeable
lithium-ion battery as the heat source
this is the first time that battery
power technology has been combined with
this active ingredient
I love the refill of the system to
deliver a simple refill system it had to
last a long time longer than any of the
products that are out there what we
deliberated was an incredibly easy to
use easy to replace refill process it
was definitely a great moment for us
when we were first able to put the
product out in the field and see that
everything that we knew on paper
hypothetically was supposed to work
actually did work we've been through
several rounds of prototype testing on
radius and we do that before we even
begin to think about mass production our
test facility in Georgia has put radius
through its paces in fact they're seeing
reductions in mosquito pressure amongst
the best they've ever seen radius is
convenient it's portable you can take it
with you anywhere and because it's
lithium ion powered you can even take it
on a plane so your next trip or
adventurer destination you can take
radius with you
oh hey there got me in the design studio
again Kelly from Kokopelli Pat craft hey
I got a quick question for you
do you know what the pack raft is this
is a pack raft at five pounds and just
over the size of a roll of paper towels
you can take in almost anywhere and did
I mention you don't even need a pump
just the nifty inflation bag we've been
building pack rafts for five years now
and that's alright if you know it's more
than our right our community you guys
have been taking us around the world on
your adventures showing us ways to use
our pack rafts in ways we could have
never imagined pack rafting and viking
pack rafting and hiking pack rafting and
fishing pack rafting and skiing pack
rafting in puppies hey I want to show
you guys something come with me we think
everyone's outdoor experiences can be
enhanced with a pack raft that's why
we're introducing the Rogue series copy

video thank you so much for your support
we'll see you out on the water
rocket the world's first portable
battery-powered heated blanket that is
compatible with all types of portable
USB batteries here we see a camper who
stayed warm through the long night with
rocket heated blanket with its instant
heating it only takes 30 seconds to heat
up and - up to nine hours let's start an
adventure pack simply and lightly and be
hassle-free
stay warm anywhere at anytime
with chvotkin premium goose down blanket
the most advanced heated blanket rockin
rockin heated blanket is the safest
heated blanket on the market and
compatible with any portable USB battery
which doesn't have to be plugged into a
110 volt or 220 volt outlet since five
volts is non hazardous low voltage you
and your children are safe from electric
shock when exposed to water you can
easily adjust the temperature using the
three level heat modes heating lasts for
four hours and 30 minutes for red LED at
high heat setting seven hours for blue
LED at medium heat setting and nine
hours for green LED at low heat center
and it warms you in just 30 seconds all
this with just 5 volts SF I am a new
composite heating material used in
rocket is a special patented heating
water technology we have developed that
is capable of heating a wide surface
area large enough to keep an adult warm
when sleeping outdoors with just 5 volts
with SF I am we have replicated the
sun's infrared radiation that is
delivered to earth in the form of heat
SFI M emits infrared rays that deeply
permeate your body delivering the
coziest and most comfortable warmth you
can ever imagine SF I am heating wires
are very durable and flexible as there
are less than two millimeters thick did
you leave a stain on the blanket don't
worry about the wires rockin is water
repellent and 100% washable
rocking comes in two sizes and five
colors so plenty of options for you to
choose from
filled with premium goose down rockin
keeps you warm even when the heating is
not on you can just wash it and lay it
flat to dry
compact packing makes it portable and
handy sometimes your tent pole breaks
sometimes your snowboard binding breaks
or your bag strap breaks sometimes your
suitcase spills open sometimes you need
to protect something fragile for transit
or stop something getting damaged in use
sometimes you need to stop a leak
sometimes you need to make stuff smaller
sometimes you need to tie stuff down or
dry stuff out sometimes you need to fix
your boot not a sort of boot that's
better
we'll simply hold up your socks it's
times like these you need adventure tape
we spent the last three years developing
and perfecting adventure tape and it's
got some amazing properties
which means that you can replace all of
this stuff
with adventure tape it's so strong and
stretchy you can do this with it because
adventure tape is self tacky it doesn't
slip meaning you can fasten it with a
simple tug and because there's no
adhesive it will leave no gluey residue
on your kit will rip apart your bubble
wrap unlike regular packing tape
adventure tape is also highly abrasion
and cut resistant meaning you can use it
to stop wear or damage to precious items
or equipment it's completely waterproof
so you can use it to fix leaks and in
fact if it gets dusty or dirty just wash
it off under the tap or in a string
adventure tape has hundreds of uses in
outdoor activities and adventures as
well as in sports weekend's away or to
help you out with day-to-day fixes
