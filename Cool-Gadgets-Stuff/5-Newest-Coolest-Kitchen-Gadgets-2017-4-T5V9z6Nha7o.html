at the movies it's light buttery and
delicious it's the perfect snack but
when you try to make it at home
it's either burnt bland or just plain
bad that's why we made the popcorn twist
popcorn twists makes perfect movie
theater popcorn every time right at home
the trick is in the twist just like in
movie theaters the popcorn twists spin
so that all of the kernel T evenly which
means that they all pop and none of them
get burned let me show you how fast and
easy it is to use first add the oil to
the pan and set it to medium high then
add your popcorn
add some salt or sugar
if you're feeling sweet it's time to
twist put the popcorn twist into the pan
and power now you twist for 30 seconds
and then set it to meet it
once the popcorn stops popping pour it
into a bowl and enjoy movie theater
popcorn right at home every kernel
popped plump and delicious
say goodbye to biting into unpopped
kernels say goodbye to guessing games
within microwave
say goodbye to dry burns and flavorless
popcorn and say hello to the popcorn

hey everyone my name is Mark bar chi-x
eeo of these kitchen supplies I started
the company because my wife loves to
cook I love food and I have six years
experience in product design now the
goal of the company is to create simple
solutions to everyday kitchen products
so our newest product that we're working
on is one of the most traditional and
essential products in the kitchen the
rolling pin so this is a traditional
rolling pin that you'll find in most
kitchens some of the problems with this
pin are that the handles sometimes comes
in they're also cheap quality so the
handles even come off in addition to
this the handles themselves are close to
the working surface so it's hard to get
your hands around my wife actually just
uses the center roller itself and puts
her hand on the top this is a French
rolling pin it's preferred among a lot
of Baker's from professionals because of
its tapered handle it will have solid
construction the reason this is good is
because it gives you a lot of control
and feel over the dough that you're
rolling some of the issues though is
that it's so lightweight that you have
to put a lot of effort into the roll as
well as the diameter so tiny that to get
a continuous roll is very difficult so
our solution of these problems is the
large French rolling pin
you
people want to grill food spontaneously
and many times I thought to myself hey
you know I want to build this but I
don't want to go through the motions of
having to start a grill and doing the
whole cleanup so I thought to myself
well how can I get this done in 10
minutes it raised the grill it works
from feels like an appliance the razor
drill combines the best of a chimney
starter with utility of a political
grill it means that we can get this
thing started with minimal effort and
the skills just like an extension of
something to use in a kitchen
usually you know you live by yourself
you don't really grow up in yourself you
know whether that really happen but now
you can do it but this you can just say
like hey I want to have that state I
want to have that charcoal for her and
you know this is going to give you that
that taste that you know charcoal in
your life but often times when I come
back home from work and you know 8:00
p.m. at night and I can think to myself
hey you know I'd love to throw the grass
complaining of starfish grill and in ten
minutes
it's ready so this is really you know
giving a lot of flexibility one of the
key features is that it can start in
seven minutes so this is something that
takes about long as it takes to boil pot
of water say it is that easy to get
started it's really manageable so you
can get that thing going and in 15
minutes you can have food ready on your
plate this grill is portable enough that
you can use on a balcony a patio it's
really low key you can use in a public
space it's great for a lot of occasions
I've cooked for three or four people on
this one when we're grilling with
friends we want you to the socialize and
be closer to everyone
and this grill allows you to grill and
at the same time and so it's something
that anyone everyone in hopefully has
dissipated
this grill uses so little charcoal
reduces approximately 1/3 of a typical
portable grill just start it you would
use some kindling materials like
crumpled up paper or I recommend using a
starter key and then you just stand back
and after seven minutes already has a 10
by 10 inch grill surface so that would
accommodate the for hamburger patties or
two states and a cleanup it's really
easy to with all the charcoal is
contained inside this container that are
decided to burn out in a half hour or
you can use water and simply put it out
because it's so easy to use it for
flexible you're going to be able to do
spontaneous grilling everyone deserves
to be able to spontaneously grill and
the way the grill does that spread the
word and be one of the first people to
experience the Raisa grill the world's
best structure metro
you
hi my name is David Herren in 2006 I was
doing home to home cooking demonstration
I realized that in every house the same
it should kept coming up life cookies
ready a place near Baskerville and your
cooking utensils without making a mess I
take a look all that will cultivate the
solution and presenting to you today
because all of those challenges that you
face I present to you today
shaaka a universal pack of a folder with
fullness living in the city counter
space is one of the most precious
resources inside my house and so I'm
looking for anything and everything I
can do to make sure that I can have
clean and spacious counters especially
with two kids running around today has
been one of the first times in and
actually hook with a tough cover in a
very long time I didn't see this little
troll kitchen I really don't have space
from anything saying and you cover for
Somalia and if I'm lucky I'm trying to
do something I sit down it just picked
up too much room it makes a messy I need
space and now I can just have a place to
put my pot edit use me I even have a
place to put this ladle when I'm done so
nothing spills and it has made such a
difference if you want through space if
you want free hands if you want your
kitchen to be as neat and tidy as
possible I definitely recommend pot cuts
for you
selecting one of the options to do your
kids get to get in your conscious is not
yet to obtain a countertop in business
yes to free and so you can multitask
when you cook and David help and I
it's nice
you
