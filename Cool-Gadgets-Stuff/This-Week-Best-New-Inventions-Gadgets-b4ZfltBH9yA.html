changing film short in the world
hi my name is stone and I'm going to
tell you something more about these
famous shirts one year ago I said in a
train and it was certainly thinking how
cool would it be if there was a stream
short that could change color when it
gets an interaction with the water I was
looking online for this product but I
couldn't find it so I decided to make
them myself I did a lot of research and
I found out that there were a few other
products that had the same ability as a
waste for my shorts to change color a
few months later I understood how it
worked so started to make prototypes
research was quite expensive so try to
raise money through entrepreneurial
awards in the beginning I didn't add a
product to show so made a color change
extreme short with a computer the jury
believed it was real
so they approved me to the next round
and by the time I made it to the finals
the real working prototype unfortunately
I didn't win but I received a lot of
feedback and this helped me to make the
product even better and after more than
a year of research the shorts are
finally ready
the swim shorts changed color when they
get an interaction with water this isn't
because of the moisture but because of
the temperature of the water water is
more cold than the temperature above
surface that's exactly replaced the
color shifted point as short becomes
right first column reveals again and so
on because they react to temperature
changes they can be customized so you're
sure to never have the same color or
pattern they made at a home % polyester
and that means that they are very
durable and dry quickly it Stewart's
have a perfect fit because we've tested
a lot of other shorts we've taken the
best aspects from each stream shorts and
combine them to make our stream shorts
kids also love it they can really play
with the stream short and they will
enjoy the time being in the water so if
that also buys them a swim short they
have a cool short and the cool looking
that but the best thing after all this
short to really let you stand now
whether you are on the beach are just in
a swimming pool now I want to make sure
you can all wear those shorts this
summer but I need your help I need to
raise at least 15,000 euros to start the
production so please support this
project and share it with your friends
and family and together we're going to
make every summer a little bit better
hi i'm jihun and this is a mon and we
started ministers fly about five years
ago right here in Boston so we know a
thing or two about being cold all the
time we tried everything
coffee jackets tons a layered and none
of it worked so we decided to invent
something better much warmer
it's an intelligent heated jacket our
most ambitious project ever
so to create the intelligent heating
system we started off with three carbon
fiber heating elements the system is
controlled by our custom chip which
allows to integrate our temperature
sensors accelerometer and also
communicate to an application over
bluetooth to use the jacket it's super
simple we just plug in this USB battery
and the jacket is in automatic mode to
control the temperature simply turn the
heat up or down or leave it just as is
the way our machine learning algorithm
works is it looks at what is the
temperature that you want maximum heat
and then what's also the temperature at
which you want the jacket to shut off
based on your input we can create the
ideal performance model for you and over
time the jacket will learn your
preferences so it'll get better and more
and more you use them I think one of the
coolest moments is when you take our
most recent sample and you pick it up
and it automatically turns on or even
coolers when you walk outside and
automatically turns up and this idea
that it knows what you want before you
can even tell it
as a two-layer waterproof breathable
membrane it allows your vapors to pass
through but not rain droplets it has 100
gram of recycled polyester insulation
which actually provides a little bit of
odor control because it has copy grounds
embedded in it there's also a very
low-profile waterproof zipper as well as
a durable water repellent to keep the
jacket dry wanted something that looked
just as comfortable in a city but also
had the protection for the mountain to
keep a really clean profile we use
ultrasonic baffling to keep the
insulation in place it also allows the
whole garment to stretch which is really
cute the jacket also features an easily
removable head it has a Qi charging mat
so if you take your while if smartphone
slide it into the smartphone pocket next
to it it'll automatically start to
charge
it's taken us a few years of dozens of
prototypes and countless hours of
garment developed but also kind of
technology development to figure out how
to create each of the components for
these you know hundreds of wash cycles
on a machine to make sure that heating
pads don't erode color fastness tests
wash ability tests everything you can
imagine to figure out how to make each
of these components that when we bring
it all together
it's truly both beautiful and
indestructible which is a tough
combination to find this is the first
time that we felt we can actually create
a garment that got better the more you
used it and make a garment that does a
better job at what you want it to do so
the jacket it's keep you warm that's
what the future of kind of wearable
technology should be it can seamlessly
work into our day and in many cases
anticipate you know the functionality
that we need hi my name is Michaela
mercury if I'm a small time gear
designer and inventor best known for the
ember lit stove but today I want to
introduce you to the world's first
production emergency super shelter warm
all over
it is it's like if you can imagine what
a rotisserie chicken would feel like
that's basically what you're doing is
sitting in a like a solar oven almost
okay we're at 75 okay right now and it's
still climbing
we're almost at 80 degrees there are
five heat loss mechanisms that you have
to watch out for in a cold environment
number one is conduction that simply
means touching something colder than you
are if you sit on a cold bench
you're gonna lose heat through your butt
to that bench it's the way it works
number two is convection convection is
wind you all heard of wind chill so you
know just how effective the wind could
be at accelerating your heat loss number
three is radiation a lot of people don't
realize it but we are actually
constantly radiating long wave thermal
radiation out into our environment up
into space next we have respiration when
I take a deep breath over that cold
mountain air is refreshing but as I
exhale I'm exhaling warm moist air from
my lungs and that's heat coming out of
my body finally we have evaporation if
you're wet from sweating or you've been
in the rain or the snow or you've fallen
in the creek the water evaporating from
your skin greatly accelerates your heat
loss there are a lot of inexpensive
actually kind of cheap tube tents and
mylar blankets that are available on the
market they do an okay job at insulating
you against those five heat loss
mechanisms they get you out of the wind
and the rain
they help reflect a lot of your body
heat back at you but honestly one of the
little secrets that is pretty well known
in the bushcraft and survival community
is you can do just about the same job
with a garbage bag well all these
different shelters including the garbage
bag
they all have the same limitation and
that limitation is they don't actually
help you produce heat all they do is try
to stem the loss of heat from your body
and so if you are sick if you're injured
if you're already wet or malnourished or
tired there's a good chance that your
body might not be able to produce enough
heat to take advantage of one of those
shelters anyways at the very least
you're getting to be miserable and
uncomfortable shivering all night long
so how does a super shelter work well it
does the same job that all those other
shelters do it takes you out of the wind
and out of the rain and snow it reflects
a lot of your body heat but it does
something they don't and that it can be
heated from the outside with a small
campfire you ever notice how when you're
next to a campfire or wood stove that it
feels like it warms your bones it's
because it kind of does that fire is
giving off thermal radiation like a big
spotlight and it actually penetrates
your tissue and starts to warm you from
the inside and so what the super shelter
does is acts like a greenhouse by
collecting that radiation by collecting
that warm energy coming off a fire and
it traps it inside there with you so
that it can warm you as well this is
where the genius of the super shelter
comes into play and I wish it was my
genius but it's not all credit goes to a
gentleman named Morris Kochanski
Morris is a highly respected and
knowledgeable wilderness living skills
and survival instructor he came up with
the concept for the super shelter in the
1980s I believe it was inspired by his
observations of how igloos function and
it is still today regularly improvised
and built in the field by bushcraft and
survival nerds alike by utilizing this
method with a little bit of space-age
materials and put it into a tiny package
that you can throw in the back of your
snowmobile in the back of your pack or
your day pack you could be in your
t-shirt and a pair of shorts even when
it's below freezing outside as long as
you know how to tend a small fire and
you have of course a super shelter so
here I am once again Kickstarter coming
to you with my idea asking you to help
me make it a reality
I've teamed up with an incredible
company called heat sheets they are the
premier manufacturers
thermal reflective materials here in the
United States there NASA approve their
universe government approved their space
approved they got all sorts of approvals
I don't even know they are the people to
go to for making this type of material
and I'm really honored that they're
working with me to make me shelter
however we need your help because in
order to make manufacturing possible we
have a minimum order of materials that
we have to buy and so I need your help
to raise enough to submit that minimum
order so that we can get everything
affordable and in the process you get to
have your own emergency super shelter
thank you so very much asthma Kyle and I
look forward to your support on my
project at nomadic we make the most
functional bags ever and today we're
excited to introduce the nomadic
messenger and laptop bag
ematic is a kickstarter born company and
thanks to our incredible supporters we
have successfully brought five products
to life through Kickstarter in our last
campaign we delivered over 12,000
backpacks on time and in response
received hundreds of glowing reviews
customers all over the world are loving
their bags so we had a quick celebration
then jacob said let's get back to work
we'd open head first researching the
market and sketching up designs meeting
with our manufacturing partners and
testing prototype after prototype we
didn't want to just create another
messenger and laptop bag we wanted
something more functional accessible and
versatile after a year of thinking
through every last inch and 16
prototypes later we finally got it just
right the laptop bag is designed to hold
your everyday essentials no more no less
while the messenger bag offers 50% more
space and has a few more tricks up its
sleeve
both the messenger and laptop bag are
made with strong waterproof zippers and
tarpaulin material that will last
forever our custom magnetic buckles are
awesome they give 360 degree rotation
providing maximum comfort with the
perfect angle every time and when you
want to go from shoulder carry to
briefcase rotate the strap opposite the
normal carry position and pull then like
magic they snap back on at any angle the
innovative spring-loaded compression
buckle allows you to adjust the strap
length and lock it down both bags have a
documents pocket and a TSA ready laptop
and tablet compartment which lay flat
and make TSA checkpoints a breeze and
while traveling you can easily slide
either bag on your luggage handle
to keep you visible in the dark both
bags have reflective ink the messenger
and laptop bags offer plenty of pockets
to help you stay organized multiple mesh
elastic pockets RFID blocking and
lockable security pocket zipper pockets
and a notebook and documents pocket
basically whatever you're carrying these
bags have a spot for it but each bag has
a slightly different layout to maximize
space first let's take a look at the
laptop bag while this bag may be small
it packs a serious punch the full
perimeter zipper gives you a wide open
view for easy access to your essentials
inside you'll find plenty of pockets to
organize your cords power bank and other
small items
each bag includes a removable sunglasses
shell to keep your glasses protected
while on the move next we added a
retractable key leash easily lock up
with one hand release the key and watch
it effortlessly returned to its pocket
in the bag now let's walk through the
messenger bag and see what additional
features it has to offer on the outside
of the bag we have added our innovative
magnetic water bottle pockets they snap
shut and look sleek when not in use and
expand when you need the space this bag
will also stand up straight on its own
on the top of the bag you get a quick
access fleece pocket for valuables the
full perimeter zipper gives a wide open
view of the inside for better visibility
and packing each messenger bag comes
with two interchangeable velcro panels
the organizer panel comes with three
mesh pockets and a paper sleeve the
compartments panel was designed to
organize larger items with the velcro
walls built in the compartments can
easily be customized to fit your needs
also in this main compartment you get a
removable sunglasses shell and the
retractable key leash on the front of
the bag you will find a separate
accessories pocket which includes mesh
pockets records and other small items on
the other side you get a lockable RFID
safe pocket zipper pocket and a notebook
in document sleeve and last but not
least the messenger bag has cord
pass-through hole to keep your
electronics charged on the move
we have spent countless hours perfecting
these two bags and are so excited to
share them with you we are so confident
in our product that if you are not 100%
satisfied with the quality send it back
and we'll refund you no questions asked
their bags that can go anywhere and do
anything they can help you look
professional or help you escape the
demands of your profession we can't wait
to see how the nomadic messenger and
laptop bag will help you live life on
the move</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
