kid you have lots of energy you're
eating a lot of sugar as you get older
people tend to ride their bikes less and
less often one of the reasons being that
they have to go to work they have to do
things where they don't want to be
arriving to their destination sweaty
with electric bikes you not only have
the advantage of being able to arrive to
your destination in a more composed
manner but you're also able to extend
the range of where you want to travel so
instead of maybe having to take your
vehicle somewhere now you can easily
take your electric bike there
my name is Oscar stark I'm an engineer
and I've been working with in the
renewable energy field for the last
several years
once the inception of electric bikes
came around I got really interested in
having electric bike myself one of the
things that was holding me back from
owning one was the fact that they were
so expensive so I started investigating
why do they cost thousands of dollars
and we actually couldn't find anything
that made electric bikes really
expensive except for the battery packs
that were available at the time this is
why we came upon to build an electric
bike for the masses that was affordable
and with my team we were able to find a
factory that was willing to produce
these electric bikes for us at a price
that was almost unbelievable one of the
things that I've noticed in the electric
bike market is these bikes look really
electric they have these big ugly
batteries attached to them we wanted to
make it look like a normal bicycle plus
we wanted to have an electric bike where
you are able to secure it in such a way
that it would be impossible for someone
to steal your electric bike what we've
done here with the electric bike is you
have your options you can either go with
the throttle meaning that you don't have
to pedal whatsoever and you can get to
your destination without having to worry
about being sweaty or being warm but if
you're looking to exercise you can
adjust the assist mode that comes with
the bicycle so the lowest one providing
you very little assist that you can
still get a bit of a workout and with
the highest one you're almost making no
effort as long as
you're peddling another thing that we
discovered is by the time that you do
get an electric bike to your door that
electric bike has actually gone through
several different middlemen so something
that you know might have costs 20 or 30
dollars for example ends up costing you
200 or 300 dollars when it gets to your
door our goal with this campaign is to
really launch electric bikes into the
mainstream so that anyone that was
interested in getting electric bike
really the cost should no longer be a
factor for them it's the same thing with
the cell phone revolution anyone with a
flip phone nowadays they would have that
more as a retro fashion accessory
everyone else has a smartphone and if
you don't have a smartphone the question
is why this is the same kind of thing
that we're looking to achieve with our
Stark Drive electric bikes everyone
should have an electric bike and if you
don't have an electric bike that's fine
you want to be retro and you want to
live in the past that's really cool but
ultimately you're probably going to have
that retro bike for the weekends and
then when you're out going to work
you're going to be using an electric
bike every year over one hundred sixty
four thousand people visit the emergency
room due to a fall from the ladder of
these 164 thousand injuries
over 300 of them resulted in fatality my
name is Joe and I'm the inventor of the
ladder anchor the ladder anchor is a
simple durable life-saving solution to
serious health hazard I found that
ladder injuries occurred due to two
primary ladder failures either the
ladder slips out from underneath the
user or the ladder tips to the side
these failures can be attributed to
ladders having two small shoes that
barely extend to be on the ladder rails
this results in ladders that can easily
slip out or tip sideways during use the
ladder anchor was designed to solve both
of these failure methods by using the
oversized base which extends beyond the
ladder and by using ladder anchor your
ladders contact area is increased by 12
times this means that the force that
makes a ladder slip out
underneath.you is reduced to 1/12 of
what it was before the ladder anchor
also extends beyond the laterals so that
for a user to tip the ladder over to the
side requires 30% more torque my team
and I have worked to validate these
claims through numerical calculations
computer simulations and physical
testing we also plan to have ladder
anchors tested by a third-party
laboratory which will validate our
findings and provide you with the safest
product possible the ladder anchor is
designed to be easy to install by simply
sliding in the metal retaining straps
placing your ladder anchor on your
ladder and tightening the bolts the
ladder anchor is also multi surfaced if
your on concrete wood linoleum or any
solid surface use the non-slip pad if
you're in mud grass or dirt simply pull
the retaining pin and flip the base over
onto the spike cleat side for traction
on soft surfaces the ladder anchor is
especially useful for when climbing with
a partner no longer do you have to have
a partner brace a liner for you
utilizing our domestic manufacturing
partner we will deliver a high quality
product and we'll meet our stringent
quality control requirements
being a safety product we will accept
nothing less than the best of materials
assemblers and final quality it is
signed to make every ladder safer with
your help we can complete the production
joy may back to the initial production
run and lab tests the ladder anchor to
validate its performance we believe that
everyone deserves to be safe in the
climbing ladder we hope to have your
support and bring its market thank you
amanda is a maker a practitioner of tech
wizardry
and DIY magic and this maker just got a
new magic wand this is the new optimist
the optimist is a modular three-in-one
machine that includes a 3d printer a
laser and CNC mill it assembles into two
configurations and creates finished
products this machine can make anything
except waffles so we designed the
Optimus for people like Amanda she's
full cool ideas and wants to create
something new the way that it's been
though if you wanted to start making
you'd have to strike a deal with the
devil to finance a lot of machines and a
huge space to use them and unless you're
Tony Stark this situation is about as
convenient as a harpoon to the face not
convenient at all so we changed that and
created one flexible machine with three
essential tools that fits on your
desktop
this machine was forged in our small
team of makers engineers and designers
and we're driven by this idea that
making could be more fun easy and just a
better experience overall
so with that thinking we made the
Optimus simple to operate and maintain
and along with this machine we've
created an app to control it and also a
simplified 3d design program so a man
that could start making fast while it's
easy to use this machine was built for
professionals who require top grade
tools this is what we're all about and
with quality in mind we built the
Optimus with all metal parts this
ensures that it's going to be reliable
sturdy and that it can bring your ideas
to life year after year
the modular design enables the whole rig
to quickly transform back and forth in
just a few minutes and the modular
design means it's easy to manufacture
and transport and because you don't need
to buy three separate machines you'll
save money then maybe you can buy that
waffle maker too
we know firsthand about the excitement
of holding your own designs so while
others may not get while you make
tinkerer cosplay we do and we want to
help you make more stuff now you can
bring the optimist into full production
we have successfully built and tested 20
machines now the optimist is ready back
us and get your own three-in-one makers
dream machine or check out rewards made
with the Optimus is this you sleeping
not really sleeping tossing and turning
watching TV to go to bed ever notice how
really late night TV commercials make
you feel like your life's falling apart
yeah why is that because it is you are
falling apart and by the time you
actually fall asleep and realize this is
all a terrible dream it's time to wake
up and start another tired exhausting
day it's time to get to sleep you
deserve it salumi I sound alesis it's a
sleep mask oh but it's so much more like
sunsets love who doesn't and Lumia helps
you go to bed by simulating a sunset a
series of soft red lights slowly dim to
ease you into restlessly
you like sunrises but they're the
coolest well instead of that aggressive
alarm clock the loony simulates the
sunrise by waking you up to a soft and
bright NASA you know the space people
they use the same blue and red lights at
the International Space Station to
regulate astronauts circadian rhythm
that's crazy amazing crazy amazing is
being able to control your bedtime and
wake up from your smartphone or computer
and take it on trips wherever you go to
enjoy great rest anyway I'm not gonna be
a disaster anymore much less of a
disaster it's so comfortable you're
gonna want to wear it all the time but
don't no no no don't wear it all the
time just to sleep only weird to sleep
lelou me sleep better awake better
