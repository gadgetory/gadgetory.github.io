knife by bomber in company this is the
bigger beefier straightedge edition of
Bombers line of fully concealable pocket
knives inspired by the infamous b-2
stealth bomber one of the most
innovative warplanes in history the
Blitz is engineered to the standards of
military grade equipment at only 3.7
inches in length the Blitz is
constructed with 440 carbon black
stainless steel this stocky compact
knife is a tiny monster and small enough
to carry in a coin pocket but sturdy
enough to take on any task you might
throw at it and like every knife in the
company's b2 collection the Blitz
straight edge comes with a full lifetime
warranty
it is engineered to withstand years and
years of heavy use
the vision was to make charging your
phone as simple as placing it on a
surface and to achieve this vision we
created the world's first long-distance
wireless charger with a range of 40
millimeters charge your phone on the
surface by placing the charger
underneath is a true wireless charging
experience that disappears into your
environments introducing energy the
invisible fast wireless charger
simply mount your energy wireless
charger using the adhesive mounts or
screws for more permanent effects and
begin charging your phone with energy
you can charge your phone through any
organic surface such as wood granite
marble glass cords through thick cases
and pop sockets and because energy is
achieved wireless charger it can charge
all currents wireless charging
smartphones including flagship Apple and
Android devices out of the box
energy follows the next generation chi
power transfer system utilizing magnetic
resonance and enabling energy to charge
wirelessly at 10 watts with a range of
40 millimeters and energy nano with a
range of 15 in black
two years ago when we learned that one
in three North Americans suffer from
insomnia or anxiety we set out to create
a solution that would change that and
now after many iterations we've created
the softest most luxurious cooling
weighted blanket in the world
introducing the hush ice the hush ice is
a complete redesign of our best-selling
sleep inducing blanket that uses the
science of deep touch pressure
stimulation to help you quickly fall
into a deep restful sleep the outer
layer is made of a patent-pending blend
of bamboo and cotton guaranteed to keep
you cool all night long it's also ultra
soft so comfortable and stretchy other
way to bike a company is only sell the
inner blanket or tell you to remove the
outer layer in order to cool off at that
point you may as well be sleeping under
a piece of plywood we knew we had to
create a new solution that would provide
comfort and coolness to all of our
customers year-round if you're a hot
sleeper or you have trouble flying
asleep this is the blanket for you Emily
our entire marriage we're the
co-founders of hush blankets and we're
proud to say we've helped bring a good
night's rest over ten thousand people
who struggle with sleep in the last year
alone throughout our journey the biggest
feedback we received from you is that
you wanted a cooler option especially
for the summer months so we got to work
I spent the last nine months perfecting
the design and prototyping of the hush
ice now we're ready to start
manufacturing we just need your support
to get started way to blankets are
changing the way people sleep all around
the world for the better but not if
we're too hot and uncomfortable with
your help we can change that right Aaron
support our project by backing us today
risk free with our 100 night guarantee
and share it with someone you know Aaron
come on you're drooling
it's the next step in music production
it's that wonderful Eureka moment you
get when you see text sometimes for me
this was like being a kid at Christmas I
was blown away you're no longer bound by
not having musical knowledge just
allowed me to do what I wanted to do so
much easier or quicker if I had
something like that
when I started making music I'd be
completely way ahead my ideas and my
workflow this is it the double studio
kit converts your voice into the
ultimate MIDI controller so you can
select samples control sense control
effects or live and all using the voice
I'm George the founder of vocal music
and I've been working on the double
studio kit for three years so what we
wanted to do was think is there
something that we could create that
could allow you to use your voice
directly into your workflow the double
studio kit is a combination of a
dedicated USB microphone we selected
components for low latency and for noise
reduction of handling noise combined
with our desktop software which is Mac
or PC and it's a standalone app so it
works with any door so if you're using a
digital audio workstation and that can
be anything from something like
GarageBand all the way through to logic
reason Cubase Ableton then you can lay
down any part using your voice and using
the doubler studio kit
so to use the double studio kit you open
up the desktop software it's a
standalone app and you go into your door
and you choose doubler in the drop down
list of mini devices as you would any
MIDI controller the functionality is
basically split into two parts you've
got triggering samples and you've got
controlling since on the controlling
since side it's tracking pitch and you
can also do things like lock the pitch
key if you want
the second part of the functionality is
to do with triggering samples and for
this you teach it your specific voice
you can just pick the mic up use your
voice and the sound that you're trying
to create will will translate 10 seconds
per hear pick the note that you want
it's translate to pull up a kit that I'm
liking the sound of and I can literally
just go just translate that into the
MIDI that I need it to
in actual fact maybe you don't even want
to do any beatboxing maybe you want to
use clicking and clapping or tapping on
different things and you can teach it
all of those sounds and use any of them
to be triggering samples through your
door you can pass the mic and my
footstep triggered a drum loop when I
realize hang on I can use my feet to
trigger I can use clap so you can use
clicks I don't manage to make beats
using my body and the mic which is so so
exciting it certainly speeds up elements
of the workflow you can do that very
quickly and intuitively but actually
people will be using in all sorts of
different ways I thought automatically
it's a way for me to simultaneously put
down my beats layer whilst I'm playing
something intricate on the piano so for
me I'd be able to play two instruments
at once it's doing what I'm doing my
voice in real time it's incredible I've
not found any other piece of care that's
able to do that not even close
I can see it changing the way we work in
the sense that is going to be a lot
quicker just stop trying to describe it
and just actually just do it here's the
mic just do it I'm a person who has a
million ideas going through my head at
once especially when I'm making music my
first reaction when I tread the the
double of studio kit was I was very
surprised at how quick I could get
things done I think one of the main
things that cripples producers is their
workflow I use this for the drums
what do you need on such a shiny sunny
day like this now I want to introduce
you to an amazing brilliant hat in my
pocket it's a hat called
vocab that can be folded right into a
pouch you can simply take it in your bag
or carrier
it's also very convenient to use when
you go for a run
just fold it up and put it in your
pocket and that's it from a small pouch
the size of a cell phone
your hat pops up
the common hats are hard brand and hard
to blend
however thanks to the flexible material
poke app does not crumple and is always
shaved and it has perfect stability as
well also it is made of waterproof
fabric so he can bounce the water
so you can just put it in your pouch
easily by folding it
we've been working on this for a year to
develop this amazing print part
a whole new value we provide vocab will
become a new essential good to help you
in your daily life
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
