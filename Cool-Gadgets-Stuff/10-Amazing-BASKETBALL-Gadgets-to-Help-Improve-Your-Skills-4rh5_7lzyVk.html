you that they never lost control during
the game would definitely be lying so
you'll know when a player doesn't belong
in a certain level especially the guard
position when he's turning the ball over
to second I've seen guys getting a game
and they're not comfortable room in the
basketball and lead levels can't get the
ball across half court this guy's are
physical you know especially in the a
you gave him the high school game you
see guys were under equipment the column
hands anti grip glove works on ball
handling hand strength and hand speed
all in one it's anti grip so the ball
becomes more slippery than trying to
dribble it now when you add the weight
now you're working on hand strength as
well since I've been playing that game a
basketball hands plate is immensely
important a lot of levels I think as you
build the strength that's where hand
speed comes into play I'm attacking my
opponent if I want to do a move that's
right in front of him obviously hands be
can be slow skill development extremely
important especially to me because you
know my size my speed I was able to get
where I wanted on the floor and play
against whoever we trained with power
hands all the way from the fourth grade
all the way to the NBA it's not like
just high school kids use them they
really develop especially at a young age
getting the feel of the ball developing
a quick handle which is extremely
important makes you more explosive
especially with the power hands on and
the ball graph wall slips out of your
hands when you take it off
elevate better they hold onto the ball
better and they catch the ball with one
hand two hands it sticks to one you know
the way I described this in simple terms
is it and you take the gloves off where
you take a slick ball wrap off you just
feel incredible applause it's almost
like you have the supernatural grip on
the basketball some of the drills we do
especially with the power hair products
there's two ball drills we do a lot of
stuff with one ball on the move
combinations moving the ball trying to
get the ball a lot of kids hair any
player that has a specialty of their
game whether it's incredible shooter
whether it's an incredible ball handler
whether it's an incredible defender or
whatever the case might be they had to
put a lot of time in on them so for me I
have like great imagination so I might
just get in a half-court three hours
imagine I'm in a game you'll hit the
game-winning shots and that's kind of
how I went about practice a lot but
that's a drill within itself you know
and if I was younger I would have the
opportunity to have some power hands on
during it you could have only been
better
having that shot lock on there just
forces the player to take the ball off
the palm of their hands and have it roll
cleanly off their fingertips it does
force you to spread your fingers give
you more ball control as a shooter which
is just gonna help your consistency help
your shooting mechanics overall all this
is gonna translate over giving the
correct training taking that muscle
memory into a game situation it is just
an easy thing to slide on slide off and
it's gonna become second nature just to
spread those fingers and have that
correct follow-through it fits on a
variety of different hands it's gonna be
comfortable soft fit but also durable
the instant impact that the shot lock
can have on your game is invaluable
I'm Dylan I'm Eric and we're the
co-founders of dream dribble I've been
playing basketball since I was a kid and
when I dribble in the house my sisters
would both be like stop dribbling that
ball in the house I can't hear myself
think at that moment I wish there was a
way that I can practice inside without
disturbing anyone
and that's when dream durable was born
as you can hear dribbling on a better
floor is very loud disruptive and it's
so annoying oh the dream dribble it's
almost silent our design allows the
player to dribble within their own
bodies based and effectively silences
the dribble without affecting the balls
flight path this product allows players
to practice their dribbling and ball
handling without all the noise wherever
they are and whenever they want and it's
lightweight and it's easy to store
design lets players fold it up pack it
away when they're done practicing and
even take it with them when they're on
the go training with the shooting target
is ideal to be able to locate it quickly
square up to the basket and have that
target to shoot at and visualize is key
the shooting targets the only product
that's gonna give you that true focus
point for a shooter you're gonna see
that target in the game you're gonna hit
that target um you're gonna make the
shot the reason for the bright color so
that yellow would be just embedded in
that shooters mine after training with
it they take that same vision of that
shooting target into the game the great
thing about shooting bar is the
simplicity of it the bungee moves easily
out of the way once it's impacted by the
ball the clips
attached very easily to the net hooks of
that color and that quick recognition of
where your target is just gives you that
extra advantage within the game to be
quicker off the dribbles to be quicker
with your release and just more
comfortable training with the shooting
targets just going to take that game and
you're shooting to the next level
it's not just about the game or the
score
it's about your performance in how you
can always improve get the tools the
blast basketball precision motion sensor
captures your movements just clip it on
and go during your training blast
basketball collects all the important
data the highly accurate metrics
calculate your acceleration vertical
height hang time rotation a measure of
your overall performance you can easily
access it and track it on your Bluetooth
enabled iPad or iPhone to review later
now with integrated smart video capture

your device and the blast basketball app
