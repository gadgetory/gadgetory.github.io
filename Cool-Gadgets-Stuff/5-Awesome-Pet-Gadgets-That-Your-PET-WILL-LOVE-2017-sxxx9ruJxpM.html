clean my name is Daniel Lent
and I want to tell you about an
innovative pet baby product I've been
working on called the Aqua ball it
combines your bathing brush and your
water sprayer into an intuitive bathing
glow it's one size fits all straps onto
either hand and it's activated by simply
pressing a button in the center of the
palm the Aqua paw allows you to soak
your pet by essentially petting them and
at the same time you have both your
hands to keep it set under control and
thoroughly rinse the coat and because
the glove is soft and flexible it can be
worn during the entire bathing cross
even while applying shampoo it's also a
scrubber so it helps you lather your
pets coat even delicate areas like their
neck and underside you can bathe most
pets in less than five minutes the Aqua
ball quickly connects to an upper ticket
or to any household shower using our
simple to install splitter our goal is
to make the bathing experience as
enjoyable as possible for both you and
your net and by using the Aqua fall you
can drastically reduce the time and
chaos involved in baptized and spend
more time with your freshly claimed test
hello I'm Chuck Martin general manager
of innovation here at Bissell if this
will we no pets in the message they make
around the home and when it's time to
bathe them the message they get even
bigger we focus on cleaning up the
messes that life brings including the
pet messes now we're bringing these
insights to the dog bathing process but
this will bark that truly is the next
generation of baiting your dog a faster
easier and less messy way this will
strengths are really around
understanding the consumer in the needs
of the consumer especially the pet
parent and we know pets we know how pets
interact with the household and the
messages they make it at home we
realized that people are very frustrated
with the bathing process and we took a
look at that and we thought well if
we're cleaning up after the dogs when
they come into the house and they leave
spots and stains on the carpet and
poultry and when never really addressing
the animals felt that is dirty so we
started taking a look at the technology
and the knowledge we had of both pets
and cleaning and we found this great new
idea and this new concept about saving
your animals anywhere in your home so
marrying the insights that we have
around the consumer experience and
around the consumer with the engineering
knowledge is the perfect match because
we know pets you know pet parents we
know message we know dirt bark bath is
really important because it gives the
consumer a new way outside of their
traditional way of bathing to actually
bathe their dog anywhere in their home
that they want whenever they want what
it also allows people to do is clean
more frequently in ten minutes I can
have all three dogs just just a slight
cleaning and the smell goes away and
everything I mean it works great because
you could actually bathe your dog every
other day if you wanted to and it
wouldn't be a chore or where before it
was a charge of a three dog you can use
it in your kitchen and just within less
than ten minutes you can wash your dog
this is different because we're actually
changing the way that you wash the
animal normally you would wash from the
fur down and what we're doing is we're
leaning from the skin up that's how we
can actually use less water because in
the traditional bathtub method of
you're done you use about 19 gallons of
water to wash an 80 pound dog
we use less than 48 ounces of water
because we're much more efficient at the
process so our no wring shampoo is
really unique because it doesn't have a
lot of the harsh chemicals that other
shampoos might and it's really safe and
effective on the animal are you going to
give yourself a ball it was perfect
there was no mess and that was about an
hour shorter than what it would have
taken me to give him a normal bath
it was great and he dried a lot faster
when I first saw the product I thought
there was no way that this was actually
going to work an Oreo she's got too much
hair it really really worked good it's
better for the homeowner because they'll
use a lot less water better for the
homeowner because they won't have to
wrestle the dog to get them in and out
of the bathtub
and it really delivers on the promises
supposed to give to the pet parent which
is we're going to take care of your dog
in a way that's never been done it's
easier for you and easier for your dog
please join us in this new adventure in
caring for your dog be one of the first
