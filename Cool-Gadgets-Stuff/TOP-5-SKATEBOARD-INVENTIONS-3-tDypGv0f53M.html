director stuff maker I was contacted by
the World Wildlife Fund is here for
Earth Hour they asked 15 artists from
around the world to take stuff that
already exists repurpose it give it a
new life that pretty much what I do for
everything so so I rephrased the
challenge in my brain I thought what do
I give a about and can that be made
out of trash and like one second after I
was on the phone with Don and I have Don
Sanford I am a home builder carpenter
woodworker
my eldest daughter had a birthday I want
to buy her scape went to this local
skate shop and some kid working there
was like check this out I just I lock
game with them immediately just thought
they were the most beautiful things I've
ever seen
would you remember when we bought your
skateboard yes what kind of board was it
do you remember do you like riding it
yes there you go and then I was like I
gotta figure out who these people are
there for shapes is myself my wife I
nephews have all their friends that
create handcrafted Cruiser skateboards
so fast forward here and a half all Don
Jose dude a year ago I bought a board I
love it I ride it every day you remember
me kill me to get board up trash
Don was like I have to think about that
for a few days drove to the next jobsite
the stack of six or eight buckets all
piled in one another and all of a sudden
I'm like whoa that's it interesting
leave my mathematical mind is going to
work diameter that buck it's about 12
inches as that by pi we know we had a to
old paint buckets cut off and flattened
out and took some old wood and put it
through the bandsaw move it in and put
it together clamp it down and talked it
out and actually work buckets
there are thousands of them on every job
site thrown away so this stuff goes in
the earth and it stays there forever has
a home builder it always bothered me how
much material went to waste so the
concept of taking stuff out of the
landfill giving it a second life it's
just fascinating and now we're thinking
like what if we can make this stuff and
give them to people who need them
there's no material cost and these
things are free all I have to do is fill
them and now there's something for
someone who otherwise wouldn't have had
it and that thing is now a tool for
empowerment tool for self-expression win
win win all the way around like when I
got a skateboard when I was kid I didn't
just learn how to roll I learned how to
express myself
for a while in my life a curb was just a
curb and then suddenly occurred was an
opportunity and that changed the way I
saw the world once there was trash now
there a skateboard it warms my heart to
think of that if I can play some small
role in making that transference I can't
think of anything better to do make
skateboards
my name's Andy car or in San Clemente
California and I'm the inventor of sick
jerks chick tricks is an indoor ollie
board that has pop and teaches kids
different variations of all tricks today
my son one day was on the couch which
gave me the idea he was bouncing and
getting pop off the couch with just a
blank skate deck before I got the sick
trick correct I had three different
versions of the board the first version
of the sick trick board was Springs
coils and I drilled the board out and
made too much noise and then I went to a
bigger coil and it was a little too
expensive and then figured it out that
the air bladder was the best and the
quietest and the most user-friendly the
whole concept just Citrix is to apply
the tricks that you learn in the house
to your skating
your surfing your snowboarding on a
daily basis my two-year-old learned an
ollie within probably first few days of
being on the board and all is one of the
biggest tricks and in today's sports as
far as surfing and skating
kanan car is my son and the sick trick
board has taught him all the balance and
the ollie
he was all-in at age four and he now is
riding switch and swears the six record
was winning two biggest things that
helped them anyone can use sick tricks
whether they're two years old or 15
years old or even a 60 year old that
never learned how to ollie
I have friends that don't know how to
ollie that have learned how to ollie
because of the sick trick board this is
third kind of skateboard lights
growing up in Florida the night became
our sanctuary from the scorching Florida
Sun making darkness our playground after
nearly 20 years of skating I thought why
not light our night I wanted to try
something different I wanted to create
something no one had ever seen before
something unique something beyond I
found light to be that element so I set
out to create a light worthy of a
skateboard for skaters to further
portray their individual style and
personality
first created in my garage for the rad
factor I quickly realized lights are
more than beauty or a way of greater
expression lights creates safety from
the first call I received claiming that
my lights had saved a fellow skaters
life I knew I was on to something more
with the inspiration and personal
obligation to do more I dedicated the
last two and a half years of my life to
designing and testing to create a high
quality product
able to stand up to even the most
hardcore skater
this is all possible with our patented
mounting design using a thin attachment
similar to a shock pad we are able to
securely attach our skateboard lights
using the skateboards own hardware as a
skater
I knew the biggest challenge I had to
overcome was creating a product that
would not alter or have any ill effect
to the performance of the board and that
is exactly what I did
able to be easily added to any skate
without additional hardware or altering
the board in any way Third Kind
skateboard lights can be seen for up to
a mile and last 10 hours per charge our
latest design features military
recognization
extreme water resistant c7 selectable
colors and USB or recharge ability
simply plug into your computer wall or
car and take light to your favorite spot
or remain lit and safe on your night
commute
with help and support from friends and
family we have created and patented a
quality product from grassroots I can't
skate at night without my lights anymore
it's it's impossible it's impossible
you
real seals a longboarding accessory that
upgrades your ride with six powerful
features here's why you need real Swift
hey getting soaked with long boarding to
class or work typically your wheels will
fling dirty rain and slug all over your
clothes
reto shields acts similar to a mud flap
on a bike keeping you dry in a riding
French well downhill now you all lock
wheels with other riders their wheels
will lock against yours but your wheels
will keep rotating because they are
protected by wheel shields giving you
the confidence to ski tighter lines
around opposition sick of the same old
tricks
reowww shields allow riders to stand
directly on top of their wheels opening
up all sorts of new trick possibilities
you can invent brand new coleman's
slides manuals and dances with wheel
shields by focusing on load-bearing
strength during development we managed
to engineer an incredibly robust and
durable longboard upgrade real shields
were designed by professional prop
developers and are a modern marvel of
material science and what FDA testing to
achieve real white guy you down by
creating a physical barrier around each
wheel wheel shields eliminate wheel bite
and allow wheels to rotate through
instead of your board hit the wheel
it is stopped by the dealership sick of
replacing your bearings of refuse wheel
shields fits snugly against the outer
bearing of each wheel without creating
additional friction this keeps water
from entering the barrier protecting it
from Russ an increase in usable life hey
true bite you'll no longer accidentally
step on your wheels which can happen
when you the new tricks are taking
selling no horseshoe bite makes wheel
shields excellent for community plus
you'll also stay drive wheel seals are
made from aircraft aluminum
a set of four wheel shields adds just
one pound to your longboard installation
is easy
reowww shields come with the free skate
tool speed rings and the custom nuts
needed for installation real shields
work for almost all wheels 75
millimeters and under the only reels
that will not fit are those with more
than one inch between the bearing and
outer lip which is very ring wheel
shields even work on uber wide wheels
like baby hogs it's taken 12 months 20
prototypes and countless all-nighters to
get to this point but real SEOs are now
ready for longboarders worldwide</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
