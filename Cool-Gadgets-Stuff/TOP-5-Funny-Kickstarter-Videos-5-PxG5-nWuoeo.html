yesterday my girlfriend was watching I
got broken toilet
I dropped a break in every toilet in our
house I dropped a brick this big it's
crazy I dropped two bricks in the toilet
but then I took one out and put it in
the toilet upstairs the brick I dropped
was the same size as my dad's you want
to see I can feel it in here
my brick was so big the toilet filled up
with less water
I saved water by dropping a brick in the
toilet if we all drop a brick in our
toilets will save California 67 million
gallons of water a day in a state that's
facing its worst drought in history so
go into your bathroom muster up a brick
and plop it into the top tank
it feels Dre
hello I'm Alison Wilkes had a market
research of red barrels creators of the
upcoming survival horror game outlast to
the launch of our demo has created its
fair share of reactions that we've
witnessed by analyzing social media data
a very disturbing trend
alakay wrote yeah I just finished the
demo need to change my past
thanks red barrels min and Mitchell
wrote on the first catered for 15
minutes myself I never went back on good
games gals Alton wrote hide your kids
hide your wife get your diapers get your
headphones it's coming and it goes on
and on when the mammals are confronted
with a severe threat to their survival
the adrenal medulla produces a hormonal
cascade that results in high blood
pressure elevated heartbeat and in cases
of extreme fear sudden voiding of the
bowels so he found a way to release our
last you without you worrying about the
release of number two introducing our
Kickstarter project under scares outlast
to diapers
oh yeah they're real weeper under scares
through rigorous beta testing
until we reach the pinnacle of diapered
technology
so now you can play in a state of abject
terror and total comfort
and there's even a limited edition with
a wearable night-night this is a real
product from this project get your
diaper and outlast to steam key and a
sincere thank you from the bottom of our
bottoms to those of you who support this
project I'm totally cool they say this
is good luck but good luck or not it's
still a mess and a mess like this can't
be clean with just paper you need water
to get the job done right whether you're
cleaning your car or your hands so why
when it comes to that do we use just
toilet paper bathroom goers meet your
new best friend
what oh sorry Pete not you buddy
bathroom doors meet your new best friend
the swash 1400 it's a new seat for the
toilet you already have that will give
your butt the Royal Treatment it
deserves
with a heated seat dual positionable
stainless steel nozzles adjustable warm
water spray at the touch of a button and
a warm air dryer your butt will think
you've died and gone
you get it so what's so great about bran
Del's new swash bidet seat it's simple
wash don't wipe it uses water to clean
the messes that can't be clean with just
paper he's always doing stuff like that
and with bran Del's bidet seat he can
because it has a citable lid you think
that'd be standard issue with bidet
toilet seats right wrong
unlike most bidet seat lids brondell
supports a person's weight meaning Pete
can use it however he wants another
great feature stainless-steel nozzles
their positionable because they got to
hit you in just the right spot and
there's self-sterilizing I mean they're
washing my butt they're washing Pete's
butt move you got to make sure those
things are clean meant what's up Pete
Oh
oh yeah that's another feature of
rondelle's new seat it has a nightlight
did I mention Braun Dells new swash
bidet seat has customizable memory
settings that means I press one button
and get the seat temperature nozzle
position and water temperature I want I
don't have to remember anything because
my swash does it for me
are you kidding me
I think it's pretty clear now to
everyone that when it comes to this
stuff wash don't wipe if you're ready to
change the way you clean click the green
back this project button and pre-order
your very own brondell swash 1400 today
believe me you won't regret it
screws I drink screws
I love screwing sure the word screw is
an innuendo well buckle up
is this invitations full of wood shaft
head holes nuts
yeah let's grow up now believe you got
that out of our system we can get down
to business and a chance for you to join
a revolution in an industry that's been
largely unchanged in 80 years
what if you could have contributed to
the iPod being created or on the team
building the first airplane this is your
opportunity to be a part of something
big really big like have a bust of you
sitting in a museum one day big how many
people have thought to improve screws
which is why the last major innovation
screw technology was in the 1930s the
parking meter FM radio were also
introduced in that decade good times
have that better our current screwing
experiences just ok screw strip they
break they wobble off the bit and no one
ever remembered a half-decent screw so
we got to thinking and decided to find a
way to make a better screw a screw that
you will remember forever the world's
best screw the outlaw screw itself is
1000 our salt spray test certified
encoded a CQ safe the type 17
self-tapping cutting head takes away the
need to pre-drill oh this is great but
you're probably thinking it looks like a
lot of other screws and you're partially
right because the real magic happens
the head a tiered hexagonal screw head
features 18 different points of slip
free strip free wobble free contact
insert the drive system with yuna grip
technology and you get a perfect screw
every time after countless hours of
engineering testing shooting blanks and
lots of screwing we came up with this
the outlaw deck screw powered by the
unit grip drive system one bit is all
you need to drive any screw we create
from a half an inch to eight inches in
length this time size doesn't matter the
head and bit shape prevent stripped
screws too bad
say goodbye to stripping what are we
gonna do now on the weekends we're gonna
actually screw our screws won't wobble
or fall off the bit they're always ready
to go whenever they need to screw
strikes our deck screws prevent board
jacking and the self counter sinking
nibs eliminate splintering to leave your
screw hole nice and clean plus our
screws hold tight in the bit so you can
do this awesome
we built the prototype but we need to
get this screw into production that's
why we're here on Kickstarter in front
of all of you by helping fund us we can
promise you a lead role in contributing
to a huge advancement every day hardware
you'll be one of the first to receive a
box of the world's best deck screw along
with the drive system which can be used
with any screw we create you get some
swag and killer rewards and if you don't
contribute then well screw you we thank
you thank you thank you thank you thank
you for helping us bring our vision for
a better screw to life screwing is never
been so yeah I'm not even gonna say that
one be sure to check back in often as
we'll be updating our page with our
progress

leaving the toilet seat

you are too lazy to put the seat down
after your midnight tinkle okay man

life get an Illumina little nightlight
that lets you see when you tinkle and
stops women from ever falling in again a
