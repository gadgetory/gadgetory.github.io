the weather in the galaxy it's certainly
the most exciting rain saber has
everything a watertight carbon
fiber-reinforced handle only modular
design for the doozy DIY repairs
state of the art FX drivers with instant
blade color change and then magical
build brain savers right here Mike but
to do that I'll have to move the
production out of my one-bedroom
apartment if they have of you heroes out
there and join the fight against the
elements
I can also unlock wholesale prices from
suppliers which will help me to reduce
costs and make rain saber accessible to
more citizens of the galaxy I'm asking
Kickstarter to help me level up everyone
needs a rain saber and not just to
protect themselves from foul weather but
from its evil allies too
in the 21st century you've got to marvel
at mini-pc advanced technology compared
with a regular laptop you'll find many
advantages from our mini PC you can
carry me comfortably in your handbag or
pocket without experiencing any back
pain our mean mini PC is ideal for
travelling shopping fast note-taking
presentations and completing your urgent
projects anyway hi my name is Leah me
offers the same functionality and
performance as a laptop and tablet now
you may be worried about its cost in
fact it's much cheaper than a laptop and
a tablet
moreover me even consumes less battery
energy and generates less heat let me
show you our me mini PC it's only 5
inches and made out of aluminium both
Windows 10 and android 5.1 OS is
pre-installed and you can switch between
the two often it has 8 gigabytes of RAM
and the internal storage is a 128
gigabyte SSD even though you're doing a
lot of things it's still smooth this is
a touchscreen it has an HD resolution of
1280 by 720 pixels letting you interact
quickly when you're on the go alright
let me play a video to check out the
sound quality and functionality
performance of course you may think you
have smartphones but this was a larger
display
sometimes if I get an urgent project I
can continue and finish my work while an
enchanter
I'll open a word document type something
now
here you'll see audio output HDMI to USB
slots Gigabit Ethernet DC 5 volt input
on this side USB see two more USB ports
one of which is USB 3.0 and a TF card
slot inside is the juban Wi-Fi antenna
and on the front stereo speakers and the
home button it comes with a stylish
stand cover and keyboard and two extra
pockets so you can take a keyboard or
mini pc review individually with the me
mini pc you can replace a tablet and a
laptop with a single device that fits
right in your pocket now light gives you
access to instant lights and power
whatever the weather wherever you are
we've created a really simple easy and
efficient way of generating renewable
power using you anytime we all take
access to instant lights and power for
granted but what do you do for a light
and a power outage how do you charge
your phone when camping and how about
the 1 in 7 people who do not have access
to electricity this is why we've
creative now light a renewable source of
light and power ready whenever you need
it current renewable energy solutions
are either solely dependent on the Sun
or rely on inefficient and awkward
manual charging we knew we could develop
a better solution
we've spent years working on the optimum
way to harness human power
now light combines a highly efficient
dynamo with cutting-edge battery
technology just one second of manual
charging finds a whole minute of life
we're excited to introduce now lights
lets you generate light and power
instantly to get started just hookup now
light pull once to turn on and keep
pulling to charge just one minute of
pulling generates an hour of light if
the sun shining attach the three watt
solar panel to charge up your now light
now lights has five brightness levels
from night lights to an ultra bright
light and the live power display adapts
to the amount of power you're using and
now I can even charge your devices just
plug in your phone or any other USB
powered device with an additional
satellite you can also spread light
around a room or use it as a task light
our team of innovators and experienced
product designers are driven by the
desire to develop affordable renewable
solutions that can empower people
worldwide just as we develop gravity
light to replace dangerous and polluting
kerosene lamps we're doing the same but
better with now lights we're building
partnerships worldwide to enable us to
reach off-grid homes with clean safe and
affordable power
it's not a lamp and it's not a window
it's a completely new sort of product
so loose is essentially a sunshine
distribution system where you put a
mirror dish on the roof and use
fiber-optic cables to lead in sunshine
into any dark rooms of your building
if you're underground for instance or if
you're deep within buildings you can
install a solar system and you can get
the sunlight without the heat most
people prefer sunlight to artificial
light sunlight prevents depression
sunlight makes us feel better it makes
us more productive and yet ninety
percent of our day are spent indoors in
electric light this electric light or as
we like to call it fake light makes up
for twenty percent of the global
electricity consumption using real light
instead we save money and lead a
healthier more sustainable lifestyle
ceruse means sun flower in swedish and
like our system it follows the sun i am
you know stood founder and engineer at
solar oven I worked with sunlight since
2011 and we wanted to make a system that
was affordable easy to use and robust we
wanted to make the Sun Shine available
to everyone the sunshine is very natural
product so the experience should be
physical without taking too much space
by working on designing the solar system
dish and the soldiers box I'm doing it
in very traditional Scandinavian way in
order to fit the most environments we
are aiming to sell internationally so we
have to think of many different home
interiors we also want to design a
product which is affordable but has
great quality in all details and
finishes
the solar system is really easy to
install all you have to do is Mount the
system where you have some put the
cables inside the room we want to light
and turn it on and then will
automatically find the Sun and you will
get sunlight in your room
the setup and storage for Pocket monkey
is faster and easier than ever before we
upgraded the design to a hyper
functional system that fits seamlessly
into your life the simple and smooth key
functionality allows you to setup and
store pocket monkey in seconds we
upgraded the system to a stronger and
more robust doorstop
pocket monkey is 40% smaller than monkey
bars - and weighs less than 1 pound so
it's even easier to take anyway we
wanted pocket monkey to look as good as
the workouts we've been working side by
side with our manufacturer to improve
the finishes and make a more aesthetic
design there are now finished edges
smooth corners and a more durable
construction this was all done without
sacrificing any quality the foot straps
are such a powerful and integral part of
monkey training we had to make them
better our foot straps now have a
stronger thicker more comfortable
material and requires zero set-up time
they are built directly into the system
back by popular demand the lower
triangle returns to our system this
feature provides more comfort and helps
to balance the bars during workouts to
keep your workouts flowing the new
single point adjustment system makes
changing the height of your bars as easy
as the push of the button we eliminated
every feature part or function that was
unnecessary or slowed you down
pocket monkey makes your workouts fun
and easy anytime anywhere there are
limited numbers so don't wait and back
us on day one whether you are traveling
at home or outside you can do the same
exercises as before but in a smaller
more portable monkey friendly design a
power practical we're all about lighting
it up
but we're tired of lighters a blow out
in the wind and run out of fuel
introducing two new ways to light it up
spark your flip and sparker with sparker
flip is the rechargeable solution for
disposable lighters it's slim teardrop
design fits easily into your pocket or
bag
with a simple button push the powerful
electric arcs are revealed and packed a
punishment sparker flips secondary
bottom button makes lighting up those
hard-to-reach places comfortable and
easy
sparker wick lets you reach even further
designed with an extendable six inch
neck tilted head and cross pattern spark
the wick easily takes on candles
barbecues and more USB rechargeable and
windproof bold sparklers give you the
flexibility to reach further and light
more join us as we ditch the disposable
lighter and start sparking please back
or share our project
hey kickstarter in 2015 we had an idea
to make air travel more comfortable and
we asked you for help and you pledged
over seventy thousand dollars to help
our dream come true and we can't thank
you enough and then we took off and have
sales in 70 countries around the world
we've been featured in over a hundred
publications including a spot on HSN s
american dreams and we were honored to
be the first product to win Steve
Harvey's Thunderdome on ABC and now
we're back with the next evolution in
travel comfort the air hook 2.0
installation is the same open a tray
table and place the air hooks anchor
over the top of it and then close and
lock that tray table our first edition
is the stabilizer bar to make the entire
setup more secure push against the tray
table to create a clamping effect then
fully tighten the lower knob
to make it easier to set up your
electronics device we've moved the
bungee adjustment button to the back of
the device Burch place the anchor over
the top of your device push the button
and pull down on the bungee to secure it
into place you now have full range of
movement and your devices can be
adjusted to any viewing angles the air
hook will support cell phones and
tablets up to nine and a half inches
tall and with this version you can move
into convertible mode when your cup
support is not in use loosen and simply
fold out of the way fold back up when
you want to support your favorite
beverage can support is now built
directly into the base operate with a
simple push and it automatically locks
into place
last but not least we are so very
excited for the biggest update of all
the air hook works outside of a plane
now - we designed the crossbar a
spring-loaded coupling for your air hook
that attaches to your vehicle's headrest
unlock tighten and slide your air hook
into the base from here use the air hook
just like you would in play by
supporting your electronics device and a
beverage or enjoy device support only
like it was built into your headrest as
a bonus the crossbar fits within your
luggage handlebars to watch your
favorite movie hands-free or get some
work done while you're sitting at the
game</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
