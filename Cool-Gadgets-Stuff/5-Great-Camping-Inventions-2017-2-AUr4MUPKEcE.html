and creator of the stag camp in 2009 my
family and I hit the road and covered
58,000 miles all across North America
over three years I was traveling with my
wife and two daughters and we weren't
satisfied with the comfort of a
traditional tent or the time to pitch it
we settled on a pop-up trailer but it
was a drag and a pain to set up after
going back home I found it I camper and
after many tests prototypes and
improvement on our previous three models
my team and I are proud to have found
the answer introducing the sky camp the
world's first expandable hard shell
rooftop tent as featured in tech insider
The Sunday Times Lonely Planet insider
design G gadgets Mashable Asia and
Business Insider the sky camp is truly
exceptional it is a treehouse dream come
true
except that it is bigger mobile and more
comfortable it is made for life on the
road so you can take off whenever
stopped wherever and fall asleep looking
up at the stars the sky camp is of the
highest quality so you can keep camping
in your rooftop tent night after night
waterproof tent fabric a fiber
reinforced hard shell top aluminum or
stainless steel metal components to
prevent rust we did not sacrifice
quality for price the sky camp is
perfect for a family trip poor road trip
with friends it can fit two adults and
two children or three adults the
extension floor folds out to reveal a
comfortable king-size mattress made of
high density memory foam pillows and
bedding can conveniently be left inside
the tent when you close it worried about
weight I camp or take safety seriously
the floor is made of aluminum honeycomb
panels that are extremely strong and can
hold up to 900 pounds the sky camp
weighs only 150 pounds including the
ladder and mattress so two people can
easily mount it within a few minutes its
Universal mounting system and light
weight make it compatible with most
crossbars or roof racks we know how
difficult and annoying it can be to
pitch a tent open a pop-up trailer or
soft top roof
only to have to pack it up the next
morning day after day the sky camp can
be set up easily in less than a minute
one person can open it on his or her own
and closing it is just as simple you
love your car and we wanted it to look
just as good with a rooftop tent mounted
on it the sky camp
fiber reinforced hardshell is
aerodynamic lightweight and available in
glossy black or white want more
customize your sky camp by adding an
awning to protect you from the rain or
Sun can annex room to hang out in or
store gear a rack to keep your shoes dry
and away from bugs and animals hanging
storage shelves or a wind deflector the
sky camp is my dream come true
and now I want to share it with you
embark on your own journey and follow
your dreams back this project and help
travelers around the world grow closer
to people and nature
many of our favorite memories are made
in the great outdoors
or around the dinner table but for us
the very best memories are made around
the dinner table in the great outdoors
hi I'm David and I'm Adam we are the
creators of the hitch knick table and we
love going on adventures with our
friends family all too often finally
gives in your table in the great
outdoors it's easier said than done many
of our favorite destinations have picnic
tables that always seem to be full or
they don't have any picnic tables at all
the portable picnic tables that we've
tried take up too much space in our
vehicle don't fit our whole family and
are generally flimsy solve this problem
we created the hitch sink table the only
table that stores your gear and doesn't
take up space it's the first ever go
anywhere picnic table that converts into
a cargo rack for traveling you can have
a large sturdy picnic table wherever
your adventures take you the his mix
table attaches easily and securely into
any vehicle with the 2 inch receiver for
extra security you can easily lock it on
your vehicle with a padlock
the cargo rack can hold up to 300 pounds
and has a deep cargo area with side
plates to accommodate your ear the flat
bottom allows you to easily slide it
into a truck bed or trailer if you have
something else attached to your hitch it
can quickly and easily be set up in as
little as one minutes the table and
benches are over five and a half feet
long providing a comfortable dining
experience for up to eight people it
even has an umbrella hole for added
protection against the elements
we designed the hitch NIC table using
the same high quality materials another
popular less portable picnic table
option
we paid special attention to the
stability make sure the hitch NIC table
has the same feel as the stationary
table it has been designed to stand up
to whatever adventures we throw at so
that's in your back yard in the
mountains or at the beach
introducing my canoe the world's first
foldable origami canoe traditional
canoes are cumbersome and nearly
impossible to travel with in a small
vehicle we wanted to experience the joy
of canoeing wherever our travels take us
or simply out our back door a canoe that
folds into a compact sock with the best
solution my canoe is packed and carried
to any location easily without
sacrificing quality or performance and
will fit any lifestyle my canoe kind of
was able to make first my requirements
as being lightweight small and compact
that I can put it away in storage but
also allow me to versatility to still
have weekends away and go on these
benches with our life
my canoe is easily assembled at any
location in 10 to 15 minutes every piece
in the kit is used in the bill just
really simple couple of clicks and it
was all done
it was important to us that my canoe not
sacrifice um quality and durability just
to fit into a box
we tested my canoe to exceed
professional standards developing our
hull from a proprietary polypropylene
with a UV treatment that has been rated
up to 20,000 sold
while ensuring quality it was important
to us to make sure that we kept the
experience true to traditional canoes
once again on the water is exactly like
any other tune of ever paddle
earthquakes tornadoes floods and
hurricane
leave us without running water gas and
electricity quick stove was born because
Lisa I need to provide affordable but
reliable camping and emergency
preparedness cooking solutions we
designed this emergency cook kit to
provide you and your loved ones with the
assurance that you will have a way to
cook food and boil water in any
situation the quick stove cook kit
includes a custom stainless steel pot
with a sturdy handle that locks the lid
down for easy transportation the lid can
also be used as a cooking pan eating
plate or flipped upside down while
cooking to be used as a double boiler
when not in use the pot holds the stove
and to fuel disks for easy
transportation as a self-contained kit
the cube stove weighs less than a pound
and is made of durable steel which makes
the stove strong enough to support any
sized pot or pen you would like to use
the stove is optimized to burn the quick
stove fuel disks but easily burns other
fuel sources like six amines real
tablets sterno cans wood charcoal and
alcohol burner
when using the provided pot and fire
starters you can boil four cups of water
in under four minutes the fuel disc is
made of cedar and wax and will burn for
25 to 35 minutes the fuel disc is
essential for emergency preparedness
because it is waterproof and because it
can be stored for years without going
bad we hope you never have to use this
emergency cook kit but in the event that
you do you will be prepared to cook food
boil water and provide heat in any
situation thank you for supporting our
Kickstarter and make sure to keep a kit
in your car office and home the kit is
great for gifts so make sure you buy
extras for friends and family
I'm Jason thought director of MCC
innovation with inventors of the hugely
successful pod 10 brand but has taken
the camping world by storm over the last
few years
products changed the face of camping by
allowing them to be connected together
and we are now ready for launch of quick
pitch modular camping version couldn't Q
cube offers quick pitching times of less
than 2 minutes straight out the bag and
fully pitch
unlike other quick pitching tents in
fact like many other tents in the
camping world you can stand up in all of
our variation on the two men right
through to the format the cube isn't
easy to pack away as it is to set up and
it means you won't need to be an expert
in our Radames to try and get it back
into the bag when you're ready to come
home
once the major issues which standard
tent is being woken up by the Sun so
with the cube tent we've added a black
line into our material and this blocks
out the sunlight our extensive
ventilation system means that a cooler
environment inside our tent
the material is clean yukos's and rated
to are hydrostatic head ratings of 4,000
meanings you'll be nice and dry even
under heavy rain conditions a heavy-duty
300 z nylon material means this tent is
built to last for many years to come the
key to the cube is that lect easy to
erect and they offer you a great space
in size in addition we have a few extras
that we think will make this 10 in a
class of its own
unlike other tents you can connect them
together the universal tunnel system
means you can build your own bespoke set
up of interconnected fence on every cube
you can connect to every corner means
the possibilities to join are absolutely
endless
just imagine the fun of roots of mates
could have connecting together these at
a festival for instance securing your
very own party area as part of this
campaign we are offering a tumor free
man and form and versions of the tents
in blue red and orange color options we
are also adding some add-ons offering
you with solar panels that can be
flipped inside the window of the cube to
store power and a thirteen thousand
milliamp battery pack this collective
has a huge capacity why not use it to
use one of our ultra called LED lighting
strips we're offering this LED light
strip in white or if you want to a sense
of either party tent then you can use
the color-changing version</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
