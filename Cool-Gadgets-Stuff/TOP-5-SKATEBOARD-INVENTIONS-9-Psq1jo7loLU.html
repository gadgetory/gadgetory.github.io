ever need its patented lock and release
technology lets you transform your play
in seconds
just drop extensions into the deck and
turn 90 degrees to flex trigger locks
and you're ready to roll
scoots lean to steer suspension lets you
carve tight turns and blasts down
streets while the rear brake lets you
stop on a dime lock in the bounce
extension strap in and grab some air
no Sun no problem more fort is
year-round play droppin the balanced
extension and you're ready to ride
anywhere anytime you're bored your
tricks this skate setup is the real deal
with new extensions decks and colors
drop in every season more fort is an
ever-expanding ecosystem for concrete
snow off-road indoors and out
more sport one board countless options
endless play
I think anyone who skates
understands how expensive it can be
which makes our mission pretty
straightforward saving your shoes saves
you money today griptape is made from
sandpaper a material built to cut and
grind things then over the years there's
been a lot of ideas to prolong the life
of your shoes however while everyone
seems focused on fixing the shoe we
realized that the real problem is
sandpaper
detailed grip tape isn't made from
sandpaper it's not a type of foam if we
had to compare it to something it's most
similar to the rubber found on ping pong
paddles this similarity gives it the
same flank same friction without being
abrasive finally after four years of
research and hundreds of prototypes
we're ready to launch
what if there was an effective and
affordable way to carry any bard on any
backpack that would be useful
my name's Robert Simpson and I'm the
inventor of the deck hook
I wanted to create a device for carrying
any bard on any backpack easily it's
securely and safely I recognized the
need for the debt cook after exploring
the current options out there
neither you need to buy a specific
skateboard rucksack or carry the bard
off when you through the straps my
favorite thing about the debt cook is
its versatility it can fit on any to
strap backpack and carry any longboard
keyboard oscarbot plus the debt clock
works on traditional and reverse kings
in trucks so you can carry anybody like
the peasant pending debt Cooke is
crafted from high grade aluminium alloy
and is finished with black powder
coating it makes use of the patented FID
locks snap system to effortlessly
locator straps the male snap car locks
into place magnetically and the forces
held mechanically each snap lock can
hold up to 40 kilos each we design the
debt cook with the typical backpack in
mind as all box actual design for a
brief juror
there was no need for any adjustment on
the deck of itself rubber pads protects
the board's trucks and hold it securely
in place while the angled design of the
straps on the flat ship hold your bar to
carry in place while it's not against
your backpack I teamed up with my friend
Ashish manga who specializes in product
development we wanted to make sure that
we could take the idea from design to
development through to mass manufacture
to produce a great product and the
father walk price unlike a lot of kick
starters that fall down at the last
hurdle when it comes to manufacturing
the deck cook will be ready to go into
manufacture as soon as the campaign ends
not every skateboarder has an ideal
place to go and ride
we here at Bo's wheels wanted to design
a wheel that could not only be used for
cruising and general writing but also to
support skaters in areas without any
access to smooth terrain we believe we
have succeeded at developing such a
wheel and we have it here in our product
line known as Rough Riders they come in
a variety of colors white black red
green orange and yellow and come in two
sizes 56 and 59 millimeter the challenge
for us was not just to design a wheel
that could handle riding on rough
surfaces but to design a wheel that
would thrive on many different types of
harsh terrain first we needed to design
a hub to support the types of impacts
the wheels would receive on rougher
terrain as well as protect the bearings
from these same stresses we also needed
the hub to bond naturally to our ATF
formula without the aid of any
mechanical bonds this natural bond
allows more synergy between the hub and
the urethane giving you optimum rebound
and an unbelievable rollover harsh
terrain the two formulas within this one
wheel the hub and the all-terrain farmer
are designed to work together to create
a higher rebound when rolling over
obstacles in your path the energy
absorbed by impacts on the wheel are
then transferred into acceleration when
passing over these obstacles this is
what we mean by higher rebound these
improved technologies for Rough Riders
have opened many doors to terrain that
was once overlooked
Rough Riders are not only used on roads
less traveled but they're also a great
cruiser wheel to cruise to the store and
get that six-pack
hello i'm gabriel and i'm very excited
to show you what I've been working on
for the last two years since I was a kid
skateboarding snowboarding have been
very popular nowadays skateboarding has
become one of the main transportations
around schools and snowboarding is
probably the most chosen one on the
slopes I've always wanted to have a
skateboarding feeling when snowboarding
have a board that allowed me to turn and
to have control with the size and
versatility of a skateboard a board that
could be used on the resort's and to
play around the city many have tried to
bring escape wording into snowboarding
but nobody tried to do it using the same
word two years ago I started developing
products that for the price of one give
you the experience of two sports I know
anyone who likes to skateboard or
snowboard is going to love these sports
after a lot of investigation prototyping
and real writers using our boards we
have developed three different models
which easily translate skateboarding
into the snow and are easy to use
whether you have practices sports or not
it is a really basic idea take the
wheels off and you can a deck that is
surface for the snow depending on the
model you choose you can attach
snowboard bindings and have metal edges
if you feel like carving more on the
snow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
