things make our life easier in the
workshop or how we can work on the
exactness of our products

have you ever imagined at all the turns
idea of any scale into reality without
restrictions of limited space Goliath
it's a CNC portable robot that moves
autonomously and can be placed directly
on your work surface
grab flexibility makes it much more
affordable than a work Center both for
carpentry and shared workspaces such as
fablabs schools and universities
the Goliath CNC for me is interesting in
terms of being able to produce very
quickly custom designs or more
spontaneously to be able to change our
ideas and put them into practice as
quick as possible

especially due to the size of the
machine we don't have to have it fixed
in one place so we can use it in lots of

we have spent many hours testing and
proof typing with Goliath now we are
very close for the final product for
mass production
one of the best thing we experienced was
seeing so many different people having
ideas about how and where they will use
Goliath
I strongly believe in the digital
fabrication and we can't wait to see
what you are going to make with Goliath
the average person spends three to five
hours a day on mobile devices for
entertainment however to make your
entertainment portable you sacrifice
picture size sound quality and more
everyone makes this compromise but we
shouldn't have to

introducing capsule by nebula the
world's most advanced pocket cinema a
soda-can sized pico projector with
remarkable picture and sound when we
started building a powerful speaker into
such a small device without compromising
the picture seemed like an impossible
challenge so we had to get creative we
proactively built in a 360-degree
speaker with enhanced bass and boosted
trouble and cut 9000 holes into the
speaker grill to make capsule the
world's first pico projector with
omnidirectional sound but we didn't just
want it to be small and loud we wanted
to make it really smart traditionally so
called smart projectors come with TV
chipsets which make them big and laggy
we integrated the most advanced
smartphone chipset ever used in a pico
projector into capsule making it the
smartest projector the world has ever
seen
capsule is the first projector ever
equipped with Android 7.0 OS you can
seamlessly watch Netflix YouTube and any
other streaming app directly plus
capsule can wirelessly mirror content
from virtually any mobile device to
display it up to 100 inches big powered

making something out of thin air
it's all about balance between walking
and flying between the body and the
machine to the fun and safety we all
know about hoverboards they were soda in
a millions last year some say or soon be
one of the main means of poking
transportation it could be if it's done
the right way if we find the right
balance that's what I told the engineers
are receding a small team enthuses that
has become the world leader hub for
technologies patents tell them first
generation of hoverboards was fun but it
lacked precision some were produced by
amateurs who gave this great invention
badger continued a total as making more
fun more precise and absolutely safe
let's
revolutionising
I think they hurt me never introduced
with the inventor
take a slope because I'm a girl
no because you're beginners safety first
that's wrong the pie is unique in many
ways because design a sleepy smooth
pleasant to the eye pleasant to the
touch a specific shape makes it awesome
aerodynamic very sturdy
it's elegant and solid as a circle we
had to call upon but hold on the Sheik
class are just cute he goes up to seven
miles per hour and time 15 degree slope
easy as a turning radius of zero feet
and a range over 15 months and all that
important control thanks to the
slip-resistant redesigned flippers you
can change them any color you want
I like are the most precise AI driven
pressure sensors on the market you can
have fun in dust sand and yes the cheek
pie is wonderful so we got the look the
power the fun what about the safety this
is what our dedicated team worked the
hardest a few remaining happiness this
is the traditional mainframe made of two
parts a nice deep and solid aluminum
cylinder is the tryina volume and frame
this is a traditional battery time
inside is completely safe of minyan case
is the button an exclusive pie battery
no wires and family you'll be highly
visible and any weather anytime
thanks to the back of front LED bars
that you can customize with a dedicated
app as you can see sheikh pie has other
features and technology to become a new
standard a new revolution
I'm almost done
and then ba you can count on us we have
all the Preferences then know how we
won't let you down you will use your
sheet pop we count on you to help us
start the hovering revolution oh and one
more thing
it doesn't really hover I'll give you
that but it sure does feel like it
since the time we launched our first
Kickstarter campaign in June 2016 the
wireless earphones landscape has changed
tremendously the launch of the air pod
by Apple is undeniably one of the main
reasons it did as always they called it
a revolution well you know we all want
to change the world hmm okay but
seriously what is this white thing
hanging out of your ear what the audio
signature is the same as the ear pod a
product launched in 2012 what if we tell
you that we have created a product that
has a superior connectivity that
connects automatically without any push
for five seconds kind of button that
fits perfectly and will stay in your
ears no matter what you do that has the
audio signature of a wired premium pair
of earphones and arguably that looks
like an actual pair of premium earphones
what if I tell you that you can get it
now and hear at a fraction of the price
the EOC air follows the awarded design
of the AOC one because we all know if it
ain't broke don't fix it however the
similarity ends here
the eos z air is the complete new beast
thanks to its charging case these tiny
earbuds can last over 48 hours of play
time and instead of packing the limited
space with unused and overrated tech we
used it to host to eight millimeters
large customized dynamic drivers our pc
b--'s most thing the very latest csr
bluetooth 5.0 chipsets are custom
designed and assembled in-house our
unique around-the-ear design does not
only secure the earphones on the ears it
makes it the world's first Bluetooth
earphones with an antenna outside the
casing giving it a much better and wider
exposure made in a special alloy of high
conductive copper they will create a
secure and flawless connectivity</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
