smart way for anyone to play and learn
music in minutes Lumi Keys is the
world's most advanced portable keyboard
with a full-color illuminated keyboard
that has the brightest keys ever made
and class-leading playability
Portability and expandability lumi is
also a fully integrated app that lets
you seamlessly play and learn songs you
love let's see how easy it is to get
started just choose a song on the loonie
app all of the notes of the song will
light up on the wikis just follow the
colors at your own pace and you'll be
playing a song in no time you can play
along in whatever way is best for you
not only can you learn songs note by
note but you can also jam along see how
Louie Keys lights up with the chord and
the scale of that song that's all you
need to start getting creative
Lumi Keys lets you play and learn your
win learn fundamental keyboard
techniques like finger position and
scales by following interactive videos
so you can learn by doing and not just
watching here at Rowley were reinventing
music making musicians love our products
but we've had one consistent piece of
feedback from folks who don't already
play music it's just too hard to learn
so we went back to the piano keyboard on
a mission to reinvent it in a totally
different way this time to make it
easier to learn and more fun every step
of the way
with Lumi we have created a new way of
playing and learning music one that
begins with a song people want to play
and learn one that lets anyone get
started in minutes one that lets people
choose how they want to learn one that
grows with them with Lumi we chose to
light up the keyboard it's a great way
to start to play
just follow the lights no need to
understand sheet music or know your
notes your scales each color represents
a note the beauty of lumi is that you
can choose how you want to learn whether
that's by color or by reading music and
with Lumet you can play and learn
wherever and whenever you like
Lumi is super portable and easy to use
so you can play it in your house at a
cafe or during your lunch break anywhere
really
with each play you're building real
musical skill from piano techniques to
even creating your own jams and when
you're ready you can try bite-sized
lessons Lumi lets you play and learn
your own way interactive videos so you
can learn by doing not just watching
want more notes our patented DNA
connectors and our edge to edge design I
mean you can simply click to blue myse
together to expand your planning keep
playing and you can do this and this -
and as you grow you can use luma keys
with cutting-edge software to produce
and perform after four years of
development we're launching looming it
leverages everything we've learned there
already
from hardware software design sound and
more to deliver a brighter and more
vibrant way to learn but what we're most
excited about is that it's not just for
absolute beginners and it's not just for
existing musicians it's a product that
has something unique to offer everyone
regardless of age or stage

that smell is that yesterday's lunch
whose turn is it to take out the trash
oh is that garbage juice all over the
floor life is messy it's busy and it
gets real gooey and sticky
sometimes you don't have the time and
energy to deal with everything the last
thing you want to deal with is your
trash that's why I choose to use Tonio a
trash can designed to be the cleaner
simpler and faster way to deal with your
trash with tonu in your home you don't
have to deal with the smell that sticky
build-up or that gross feeling that
comes from having to touch the trash you
see with a wave of your hand tonews lid
automatically opens but most
impressively this trash can secret
weapon is an innovative sealing
technology that seals the bag for you so
you can simply toss a trash without
having to look at the mess or smell
yesterday's leftovers then it's smart
enough to close itself up and
automatically pulls a new bag into place
Tony was able to do this because the
bags are not your traditional individual
bags but rather an affordable removable
ring of recyclable materials which is
cut and sealed by the built-in thermal
plastic sealing technology each refill
ring can create up to 25 durable trash
bags and can be bought in bulk and it
doesn't end there
it also has an overload feature that
detects when the trashcan is really full
lifting the top so it can seal the bag
guaranteeing you no spillage all you
have to do is grab the bag and throw it
away no leakage no stink no mess if you
could make taking out the trash
just a tad cleaner a bit easier and a
little faster wouldn't you
tonu a little less messy even on a good
day meet the eight in mini book a mobile

the bees are disappearing more than 80%
of our global food supply is made
possible by bees bees are fundamental to
the natural ecosystem and our survival
as humans on this planet but existing
ways beekeeping are often old-fashioned
and our scene is too complicated by
anyone that's not a professional the
most common methods also require a lot
of open space a luxury most of us don't
have at being we are bringing the next
generation of beekeeping to you
introducing bee box an innovative hive
design that's better for humans and the
bees now you too can join the fight to
save the bees bee box is safer for
humans with our bee chimney the only
entrance and exit for bees is 2.2 meters
or 7.2 feet above the ground that means
you can get up close and personal to
observe your hive without disturbing
your bees bee box is also easy to use
our patent-pending honey harvesting
system safely separates the honey from
where the bees live
once the system is activated the bees
will exit but can no longer enter the
honeycomb area
just a pull of a lever you can harvest
your honey in a bee free environment no
protective clothing required
Bbox is a hundred percent urban friendly
and can function optimally in a space of
just 1 meter square B box is also be
friendly sometimes we forget that honey
is our bees food too that's why we
developed our modular honeycomb by
taking only a small section instead of a
large sheet beam control exactly what
impact our honey consumption has on our
hives healthy
finally Bbox is interactive clear walls
are hidden below the warm and cozy wood
exterior panels of VBox allowing you to
observe your hive anytime you like
Bbox is more than a new type of beehive
it's the start of a movement to make
widespread urban beekeeping a reality
with patent-pending technology that
allows you to monitor your bees and
extract honey without disturbing your
hive its harmony with nature at its best
bees are in our blood hi my name is Luca
Vienna hi my name is little bit about
the story of being started two
generations ago with Roberto's
grandparents they kept bees in the
Italian countryside and those traditions
have been handed down Roberto combined
that traditional knowledge and passion
with Gabriella's experience technology
and being was born we are already a
fixture in the beekeeping community in
Italy offering IOT technology for
traditional hives and providing regular
educational opportunities and community
initiatives we've learned a lot from
working so closely with professional
beekeepers across the country and have
brought this expertise to the creation
of bee box</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
