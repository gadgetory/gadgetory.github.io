plane does there's flying and there's
flying meet powerup darts a paper
airplane that's not just flying it's
flying
this is shy a pilot industrial designer
and inventor shine loves everything
airborne four years ago he was
challenged by a friend to create a
smartphone controlled paper airplane
which I accepted the challenge and
created powerup 3 the first ever
smartphone controlled paper airplane
then two years ago that same friend
challenged him to put a camera on the
plane so shy created powerup fpv the
first ever smartphone controlled paper
airplane with a streaming camera shiz
friend looked at those creations and
said cool but you can't make a paper
plane that can do a loop and a barrel
roll and then stall turn then just I
stopped his Fred before he
hyperventilated and said challenge
accepted
now after a year of prototyping and
testing it's here power up dart the
first ever smartphone control paper
airplane that can do aerobatics yes
other planes can fly but they can't loop
or barrel roll or fly very dark can it
is incredible and it is small just take
a piece of paper fold it into a plane
catch the module
download the app and tell your friends
GeForce got nothing on you
you're an aerobatic pilot now powerup
dark gets its incredible aerobatic
capability from the high
thrust-to-weight ratio and unique shape
of the plane despite being so incredible
flying the dart is easy and intuitive
move the phone to any direction and the
wings will follow when you start the
plane goes to 70% of its throttle so you
can fly it like a regular plane but
press the boost button and you give the
plane that extra kick that transforms it
into a flying monster a small flying
monster power-ups bluetooth module
easily charges through its microUSB port
and the entire thing is made of carbon
fiber an island so it's nearly
indestructible
dart invites you to make many planes in
many shapes because every plane brings
with it new tricks and with them new
gasps for air try 5 10 50 planes then
fly them all together make a real show
arrange dogfights break every barrier
previously set by less incredible planes
and this little bugger is so cool it can
even fly around the office yeah you just
sent a love note through a smartphone
control paper airplane you have lived
powerup dart is ready for production so
if you want to fly aerobatics with the
most incredible all incredible planes
back power up dart and start flying we'd

oh my god this is like a real massage
should I keep this oh where was this ten
years ago this feels so good
it's like a real massage it's cool
perfect the reason why these people are
so excited is they just experienced the
recovery force wearable massage for the
first time chances are you or someone
that you know has experienced low back
pain which is why we developed this
product so here's the problem we sit all
day you're probably sitting right now I
am sitting right now all this sitting
causes the muscles in the lower back to
become tight the recovery force wearable
massage increases blood flow to those
muscles and allows them for the recovery
force wearable massage comes in four
sizes and is adjustable for the perfect
fit what I like so much about recovery
forces unique wearable massage
technology is that it has four functions
that I believe are essential for pain
relief and recovery it has an active
compression component that compresses
not only the low back but around the
core it also has a heating function a
soothing pulse function as well as a
therapeutic massage function any of
which can be tailored to a person's
preference hearing is believing sound
natural immersive full range sound is an
essential component to every human
experience our ears are incredibly
complex organs we live in a
three-dimensional world and our audio
systems need to accurately reproduce it
welcome to Yara 3dx the world's first 3d
sound projector Yara 3dx
delivers an exact recreation of the
world around us our research team
includes scientists engineers
programmers and product designers with
over 75 years of experience in high-end
audio it feels like I'm in the theater
I wasn't expecting anything special but
in real life sounds come from every
direction our ears receive filter and
localize individual audio events based
on several critical things where you are
the direction you're facing your own
anatomy and the convolutions of your
outer ear traditional speakers and
headphones even so-called 3d headphones
simply aren't capable of reproducing
convincing 3d sound
imagine being sonically transport
to a live EDM event or concert Yara 3dx
is capable of reproducing sounds in 360
degrees by targeting discrete beams of
sound into your left ear and right ear
yar 3dx delivers game audio unlike any
current technology by delivering
situational awareness to players
advances in the science of acoustics
auditory anatomy neuroscience and
digital signal processing allow us to
model sound fields for individual
listeners in ways that were impossible
just a few years ago in the advanced
audio lab here at UCSD we found that
adding digital signal processors to an
identical array of small speakers allows
us to tailor sounds for each individual
listener turns out that smaller DSP
enabled drivers can deliver big sound
the unique appeal of yarra 3dx goes well
beyond its innovative technologies its
style works equally well in the living
room under a large flat-screen TV or on
a gamers desktop our designers explore
dozens of different configurations and
prototypes to ensure that the unit
actually delivers on its promises this
is not a concept product we have working
prototypes and AB demo the system for
hundreds of people we want yara 3dx to
become the standard for gamers VR and AR
fans high-end music enthusiasts and
movie buffs this is truly the future of
audio
life has many troubles and some of them
are defined by climate maybe you are too
hot on a summer's day and wish you could
take all your clothes off or perhaps you
were too cold during the winter and
can't even send a text because your
hands are too shaky from shivery or how
about having those dreaded night sweats
and you can't turn on the
air-conditioner or a/c because your wife
has cold feet what is one to do
introducing that aircon watch the aircon
watch is a new revolutionary product
that will allow you to get that
much-needed thermal satisfaction without
disturbing the soul you can warm
yourself up or cool yourself down even
if you are out in the scorching Sun or
in a frigid winter's night doing any
outdoor activity most times depends on
the temperature and the climate on the
other hand being inside all depends and
if your heater or air conditioner is on
and using up electricity the aircon
watch offers the convenience that you
need by freeing you from an energy
wasting air conditioner but never
limiting you to the outside temperature
and all within the form of a small watch
the human body has a natural body
temperature of 98.6 degrees fahrenheit
but depending on the weather and
external temperature our body responds
by sending a signal to the nervous
system whereby the brain receives the
signal which gives the sensation that we
are feeling at that exact moment but
what if we could change the signal that
our nervous system sends to the brain by
using the aircon watch to generate
pulses of heat or cold by this method we
can trick our brain into thinking that
we are cooler or warmer
we really honor the secret is in the
straps it contains a small device that
has within it our climber con technology
this tiny device will fit on the inner
wrist in an area where the nerves are
closer to the skin surface so as to
allow for maximum transfer of
temperature the watch can be used during
any temperature in the season or any
time zone if you suffer from night
sweats you can now finally have a cozy
night if you like climbing or outdoor
photography aircon watch could be your
best friend
but one of the reasons why we developed
this product was to help women during
menopause menopause often has hot
flashes which can be extremely annoying
to the extent where it becomes painful
but what if you could get some relief
from small device that emits a soothing
cool temperature the aircon watch has
been tested with more than a hundred
people and using several prototypes our
experienced design team has worked for
more than two years and research and
development to improve aircon watch and
reach the design and level that we are
at today
global warming is gradually destroying
the Earth's entire ecosystem so why not
turn that a/c off and turn on the aircon
watch it most definitely will help keep
your pocket fuller and your body cooler
