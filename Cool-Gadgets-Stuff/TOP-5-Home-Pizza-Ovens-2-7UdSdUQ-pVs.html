style Chicago style grandma pies stuffed
crust thin crust calzones you could
never go wrong with a good slice of
pizza but the king of pizzas is
hands-down than Neapolitan pizza crisp
tender airy crusts using melted cheese
and otherworldly flavors from even the
simplest ingredients will forever change
how you think of pizza plus they're
cooked in under two minutes but there's
one problem
a proper Neapolitan pizza must be big in
about 90 seconds in an oven reaching
around 900 degrees Fahrenheit usually
the only way to do this is to get a
massive expensive wood-fired oven but
not everyone can afford one or has the
space for conventional ovens typically
max out at 550 degrees Fahrenheit and
can only reach a bit higher on the
broiler set but what if you could go
higher
with pizza shelf you can introducing
pizza shelf
pizza shelf is a stainless-steel baking
device that uses patent-pending heat
flexion technology to reflect and
concentrate the heat from your broiler
allowing you to achieve temperatures up
to 900 degrees Fahrenheit this means you
can make authentic Neapolitan pizza in
about 90 seconds at home with your own
oven just place your pizza shelf on the
top row pre-heat your oven to its max
setting then switch it to broiler and
pop in your pizza in about 90 seconds
you'll enjoy crispy Airy cheesy goodness
with all your friends and family and you
don't have to stick the Neapolitan pizza
either since pizza shelf is made of
heavy-duty stainless steel it won't
crack or rust and perfectly distributes
heat over the baking surface you can
make a perfect New York pizza in 5
minutes

grandma's pie or keep interesting with

perfect for any kind of
if that's not enough you can even use
pizza shelf is an ideal griddle on your
grill anyone up for scallops get the
perfect pizza with the perfect crust in
your own oven with pizza shelf
this is the Breville crispy crust pizza
maker it's one of the first countertop
home appliances that can actually heat
to six hundred and sixty degrees that
it's hot enough to create a super crispy
restaurant style crust I've already
preheated the pizza maker I'm now going
to select the thickness of the crust I'm
going to be making and for this pizza
we're going to make a thin crust so just
simply turn the dial to thin I've
already rolled out my dough and I've
covered it in pizza sauce and some fresh
mozzarella my pizza peel is covered in a
little semolina flour so it should slide
off really easily
another tip though is you can always
roll out your pizza dough on a piece of
parchment paper slide the entire thing
paper included into the pizza maker and
then after about two minutes of cooking
remove the paper but today I'm just
going with a simile nough lift the top
of the pizza maker and be careful it is
hot I will just gently slide it onto the
hot pizza stone close the lid and a thin
crust pizza like this should cook in
just about five or six minutes
this handy viewing window right on top
will let me keep track of how the cheese
is melting and how the crust is bubbling
up no matter what thickness you choose
you're going to want to roll out your
dough to about ten inches in diameter
and it's been just a few minutes and
already I can see my sauce bubbling the
cheese melting and the dough starting to
get nice and puffy on the crust you may
notice a little smoke coming out the
back that's because this pizza stone is
brand new but over time when your stone
gets well-seasoned you'll notice that
the level of smoke definitely decreases
a bit but this is completely normal and
nothing to worry about it's been just a
few minutes and my pizza is already
finished let's take a look how gorgeous
is that with a nice big spatula I'm just
going to lift it up and look at how
crispy that crust is
and put that right back on my peel
gorgeous homemade fresh margarita pizza
in just a few minutes for a thick crust
pizza I'm going to turn my dial all the
way to thick
I've already put my sauce cheese
pepperoni and green bell peppers on it
slide it on to the hot stone great close
the lid and this will take about 8 to 10
minutes to fully cook the other two
settings on the dial are low and keep
warm low is really handy for warming up
other breads like naan or tortillas keep
warm is great if you're having a pizza
party let's say and you want to keep it
Pizza warm in between serving it my
pizza looks ready how gorgeous is that
grab a large spatula look at how easily
it lifts off and how crispy that crust
is so whether it's thin crust or thick
crust you can have restaurant style
