line laptops built with the most premium
components and known for their iconic
sleek design people expect to use these
laptops for everything professional work
communication leisure but I can't play
any of the latest games on my laptop and
I can't use the oculus rift and I can't
handle my design and video projects hi
I'm Dino and I love my laptop but it's
just not powerful enough I'm told that
if I want a laptop I have to sacrifice
performance for portability so to get
the performance I need I have to either
buy an expensive desktop computer or
build my own I can buy an external hard
drive to increase the storage of my
laptop so why can't I buy something that
I just plug in to increase its
performance as well that's why we've
created the wolf the no hassle solution
that turns your laptop into a mobile
powerhouse plug-in power up and do all
the gaming graphic design and other
professional work on the device you
already own you never have to buy a
desktop again the core of the wolf is
powered by a professional vest top level
graphics card giving you 10 times the
graphical computing speed of today's
typical consumer laptops bi-directional
data flows allow for both external and
internal display in the sturdy
construction and ergonomic design of the
central housing are optimized for both
thermal dissipation and portability the
wolf brings an entirely new set of
possibilities and applications to laptop
users high speed rendering professional
level 3 modeling graphic design hardware
accelerated programming all things that
until now would force you to purchase a
desktop and of course the wolf can run
all the latest Triple A games at a level
that completely outperforms the Xbox one
ps4 and even most desktops but what
we're most excited about is the fact
that the wolf lets you use the HTC vive
and oculus rift on your macbook and more
the first product in the world that can
do that we are incredibly proud to be
the ones that let you finally experience
VR at an affordable price we've been
developing the wolf for over a year at
Harvard's innovation
in Cambridge after countless iterations
were finally ready to deliver a product
that we really think you're going above
and one that we've confirmed we can
produce at scale as gamers designers and
programmers the wolf has already
improved our lives dramatically and we
want to share that feeling with everyone
you can breathe life into your old
computer or supercharge your new one the
wolf enhances productivity development
and entertainment for everyone on both
Windows and Mac OS we want to be the
guys to bridge the performance gap and
bring VR and game developers to every
platform
at sin so we're developing the next
generation of input devices we're trying
to replace the archaic keyboard and
mouse with an interface that's
upgradeable it's customizable and it
really captures all the nuance an
expression that our hands are capable of
our first product looks like a trackpad
but we've actually packed 20,000 sensor
elements into this form factor each of
these sensor elements can detect the
full range of forces that human hands
are capable of that means that when you
touch this device we can tell not only
where your fingers are but also how hard
each one is pressing
we're precise and accurate enough to
even detect bristles from this
paintbrush because we sense force we can
detect touches through any flexible
material we've started developing these
three-dimensional tactile overlays that
when placed on top of the morph change
the device into any type of interface
you can imagine the overlays include
magnets making them easy to swap in and
out and software inside the morph
automatically changes modes based on the
overlay you can connect it to your
computer with a USB cable and it can
even talk to your tablet or phone via
built-in Bluetooth we believe this
product will dramatically change the way
people interact with technology and we
reached out to a few of our friends to
see what they would create with a sensor
morph with Centel morph I'm able to work
with the brush very naturally in a
nuance way for instance if I let go of
the brush too soon the bristles kind of
sort like sweep off and it picks that up
the tools disappear and you're left to
your creativity and that's what's
exciting
the reason why paper and pencil work
well together is because pencil will
carve into paper that's something that
in the digital world today doesn't
actually really happen all that often
that tactility that extra level of
dimension is is what makes art
designing in interphase is probably a
necessity for example the drum rack or
effects turning knobs up and down or
piano keys and all of that you know one
controller does it all to me it's
appealing for a user to touch this
device and interact with the physical
world in a different way a new way we
didn't have the the force sensitivity
that the stencil pad has I just don't
think it would be as magical of an
experience the morph is taking all of
these things that I want access to but
are typically in separate devices and
now we have them all combined into one
device you've spent years developing
this technology and partnered with frog
design to refine the product and build
out some core use cases in art music and
gaming but we've only scratched the
surface of what this technology is
capable of that's where we need your
help we want you to experiment prototype
and push the bounds of what this
technology can do we're also developing
an online tool that will let you build
your own interface along with your own
custom overlay and for those of you who
can code we have an open source API that
allows you to feed in raw pressure data
or touch information into your
application we believe that the sensor
morph will pave the way for a new
generation of tactile responsive and
expressive interfaces and we need your
support to bring this vision to life
thanks Kickstarter
your smartphone has your whole life on
it it's your point of connection to the
people and the world around you it's
also an incredibly powerful computer the
speed and power of our smartphones
rarely holds us back for the small
screens and limited interface often do
that's why we created the super book a
simple plug-and-play device that turns
your Android smartphone into a beautiful
laptop computer just connect your phone
to the super book using a USB cable the
super book provides the keyboard
multi-touch trackpad and display in your
smartphone brings the computing power
along with your files and apps and of
course the super book can use your
smartphone's data Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
connectivity the super book has over 8
hours of battery life and it even
charges your smartphone it works with
all modern Android devices and it's
future proof when you get a new
smartphone it'll still work with your
super book it's like getting a brand-new
laptop every time you upgrade starting
at just $99 the super book is a fraction
of the cost of a traditional laptop and
is even more convenient hi i'm andrew
co-founder of and roam 'i'm makers of
the super book I was frustrated with
having such a powerful smartphone but
with an interface designed purely for
mobile use our goal the super book is to
eliminate the restrictions that hold
smartphones back the software side of
the Superbook is and romeow an app that
makes Android function like a familiar
desktop operating system you get a mouse
cursor keyboard shortcuts desktop class
browsing and easy file management
everything is intuitive and optimized
for productivity there's no custom
firmware to install and no technical
knowledge needed simply download the app
from the Play Store and connect to your
super book you can use one of our native
apps or any of the millions of Android
apps in the Play Store
so check this out this is $99 right now
on IndieGoGo this is a touch screen
cherry trail PC there's no windows 10
license it includes Windows 10 but
there's no license fee because it's a
touchscreen so it's like a tablet and
you have HDMI a speaker output to usb on
this side gigabit ethernet you can
charge it with that or you can charge it
with a micro micro SD card micro USB for
charging with the power bank and two
more USB one is 3.1 so this is a
prototype the first prototype that just
came out from the Design House right now
and this is going to be $99 on IndieGoGo
shipping directly from China to the
whole world
people can have a PC like this you can
connect I'm just going to connect a USB
keyboard and mouse you can use full
keyboard and mouse to do all kinds of
stuff with it
scrolling around and you can open an
edge Cortana and Twitter and everything
in Windows and you can browse around the
internet right here so output in the
external display with the HDMI or you
can use this screen if you want if it
has to be some kind of control or pass
device or something else and and then
you have this 2.5 inch adapter for a
hard drive or SSD it's going to it's
going to fit directly under it somehow
there's a solution to connect and power
right here and it's just going to be
directly under it shipping within six
months with a dual band Wi-Fi with a
free Windows license because it's a
tablet basically and even there's even a
battery with one and a half hours it can
run on a battery so all this included
there it is small very small all-in-one
all-in-one computer PC
