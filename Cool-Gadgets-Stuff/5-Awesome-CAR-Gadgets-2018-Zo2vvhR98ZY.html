driving while looking down at your phone
is not safe so what if we put our phone
on our windshield that's not any better
if you can't see me then I obviously
can't see you
we're here to provide a safer way to
access the calls text and navigation you
need without taking your eyes off the
road since 2015 we had hardly have been
developing products to help people drive
safer after launching our first head-up
display we took customer feedback from
the audio enthusiasts to the everyday
driver helped develop our
second-generation product the hudley
Wireless
our new head-up display is now wireless
and boasts a larger sharper display just
like before you can customize your
driving experience by casting any app
directly in your line of sight and it
works in virtually any car public
Wireless decreases the likelihood of an
accent by letting you see both the road
and vital driving information at the
same time why not just mount your phone
to the windshield not only does this
block your view but it also forces your
eyes to refocus every time you look away
from the road and down at your phone for
directions hudley cast your directions
into the distance eliminating this need
to refocus and increasing your awareness
of what's happening on the road hudley
also adapts your environment
automatically adjusting brightness based
on the lighting conditions outside best
part setup is easy and there is no
technical knowledge required
what really sets Hundley apart from the
competition is our 6.2 inch
high-resolution display that uses a flat
panel to achieve a one-to-one reflection
unlike the curved displays on the market
while curved displays magnified images
they also degrade image quality our
product has been engineered to have the
widest viewing angle allowing both the
driver and passenger to be able to see
the information casted we've made no
compromises to color clarity or image
quality and believe that we have the
best head-up display around what's
really exciting about hudley is that it
is a seamless experience just like
everything else in my household so from
Apple Play to Sonos to my nest hudley
fits right in
I really appreciate just the quality in
terms of clarity
especially with mounts like this like
you want something to be dead simple
super clear and giant X that makes the
driving experience really safe it's it's
one of those things you know if you're
paying attention to the road I think
it's pretty easy to be a safe driver but
nowadays with like technology and stuff
I'm I'm constantly looking at my phone
and I think that's caused more issues
for me than anything else so having what
I need kind of right in front of me
without really obstructing my view or
causing me to look away from the road
has made a big difference while there
are many great apps for hunting we
weren't completely satisfied so we
designed our own app we designed it to
take full advantage of Uglies hardware
advancements your phone now acts as a
secondary control panel with quick
access to programs optimized for a
head-up display
cars have had powerful computers inside
them for years but that hasn't really
improved the way that we drive them in
creating automatic we set out to unlock
our cars potential and redefine people's
relationship to driving making it safer
more efficient and fun we did this by
introducing your car to your smartphone
it all starts with the automatic link
just plug it into your car's data port
and follow the simple instructions on
screen now your car and smartphone will
connect wirelessly whenever you drive
most people don't realize just how big
an impact their driving style can have
on fuel efficiency you can save up to
1/3 on gas with only a few adjustments
to how you drive an automatic helps you
do that without being a backseat driver
it learns about your driving style and
gives you subtle audio cues when you do
things that waste gas like accelerating
quickly the app shows your weekly Drive
score and trip timeline so you can track
your progress and see where to improve a
high score could save you hundreds on
gas every year
when you drive automatic monitors your
car's health and warns you if
something's wrong so if your check
engine light comes on you'll see a
description of the problem and possible
solutions you can even clear the light
yourself and save a trip to the mechanic
because Adam attic connects to your car
when you drive it always knows where you
parked your family can even access that
location for seamless car sharing
accidents happen and far too often there
isn't someone there to help if you're
ever in a crash automatic alerts 9-1-1
with your location it can even contact
your loved ones to let them know what's
happened and that help is on the way we
wanted to reimagine what driving could
be and I think we did that with
automatic we believe that cars should
live up to their potential and that
every driver can be a smarter driver
that's why we created automatic the
smart driving assistant
these are advanced wheel locks designed
to foil every method thieves used to
steal your wheels our patent-pending
design is unlike any other it features a
conical shaped body with non coplanar
engagement surfaces and what does that
mean it means when a thief tries to get
a wrench across the lock it simply slips
off the conical shape also prevents
common methods of wheel lock removal
from being used against them 12-point
sockets and wheel lock removal tools
were in part because they are stronger
than the lock recognizing this we made
advanced wheel locks from an alloy so
strong they resist almost anything
designed to bite into steel we tested
them against everything from tools made
to remove rounded off bolts and nuts to
a pipe wrench we did not stop until we
arrived at a material so durable
nothing could grip it
the design and material are only part of
the story the other half of our unique
patent-pending lock is the removal tool
the inside of the tool features key
plates that act like fixed tumblers in a
traditional lock these plates are made
from a hardened alloy steel nearly as
tough as the nut and are designed to
withstand the abuse of an impact wrench
just like the lock and key on your house
our key plate design means we can offer
nearly infinite combinations all of this
adds up to an unsurpassed level of
security because of our innovative
design CNC machining is the only way we
can manufacture them other wheel locks
are made by using a forging process and
materials not nearly as tough as ours
for that reason other wheel locks will
never be as good as ours we are ready to
go to manufacturing with two Master
sizes between the two we have
applications for most vehicles and we
are currently working on designs that
will cover the rest
join our Kickstarter campaign and be one
of the first to own this revolutionary
new product because what we really want
is to end wheel theft for good
