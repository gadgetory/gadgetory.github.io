the rigid easy change faucet tool
the cheater pipe wrench saved me a lot
of time you don't need three or four
different pipe wrenches coming into the
jobsite you can get away with two
sometimes even one you can change it
from a 10 inch pipe wrench to an 18 to a
24 so you don't have to lug around three
different pipe wrenches it's just one I
can easily move around in a tight
furnace area or go downstairs and put
some 2-inch together it's very versatile
the jaws are narrower so you have the 10
inch jaws I'm gonna tight spaces where
you are working with larger diameter
pipe you still have the large jaw on a
small handled wrench the steel aluminum
pipe wrenches definitely feel durable
the overbite that's on that jaw is just
phenomenal for grip it just seems to fit
snug on anything you put it on the grip
on the jaw is not slipping it's easy to
move the grip it stays in place it's
much better than the competitors the
handles are finally shaped to your hand
I think all the Milwaukee pipe wrenches
have been made to fit the trades from
the world leader in cordless innovation
Milwaukee introduces the ports logic
press tool system the smallest most
intelligent press tools on the market
it's fine to install half-inch to 4 inch
copper fittings and is compatible with
all major fitting manufacturers
as a plumber you knock though a lot of
different tools the Milwaukee tool is
very lightweight very durable
the Milwaukee tools are more user
friendly to us plumbers they've been
engineered to get a nice tight spots the
cylindrical shape all right with no
extra appendages at all right angles
allowed our technician to get straight
in clamp the job press it and he's done
having the force logic in all the
different crimping bands it makes it
very versatile we've been able to
interchange between brands and still
have had the jaws in the system work
Conor percent
when you're soldering fittings together
there's always at worries there gonna be
a pinhole leak with the force logic tool
you crimp it and it's done I've no I
made a consistent and secure joint with
the force logic tool by listening to the
operation of the Machine and then
verifying with the green light on the
trigger if it's not set right it won't
work which is like the old ones it'll
just press whatever the partial pipe
with this technology milwaukee's using
you know it's very good if you don't put
it on the right way it'll stop and it'll
save you a lot of headaches red lithium
batteries outlast other batteries that
we've used and they hold their charge a
long time with the Milwaukee we can use
one battery for three different tools
and not waste time the Cajun batteries
looking for different charges and stuff
like that one setup done I think was a
home run I jumped on as soon as I saw it
I said I'm gonna buy this one
