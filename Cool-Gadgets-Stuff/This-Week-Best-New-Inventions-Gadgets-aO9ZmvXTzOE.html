okay move up let's go
what is this
any ideas I'll be right back
cheer up Caesar Chinese sorry I'm deep
in three two one
fancy a flyer ok lumo go
honeybees and humans depend on each
other we care for them they do the
amazing thing we call pollination and of
course make lots of delicious honey
it's here the next evolution flow hope
to we listen to your feedback and have
taken our best-selling flow hope classic
and made it even better to celebrate a
third birthday we have a limited release
exclusive to IndieGoGo my dad and I
spent a decade inventing a new way to
harvest honey a way that's gentle on the
bees and a lot easier for the beekeeper
a way where the honey doesn't require
any process you know and there's no need
to go through that long messy sweaty
process of conventional harvesting just
simply turn the head off and watch as
delicious raw honey fills your jar ready
for you to it
IndieGoGo is where we started and we're
forever grateful for everyone who
supported us in 2015 we were awed by the
huge global response which allowed us to
take our invention to the world in a way
we never thought possible honey
harvesting is such a pain and it's a
tremendous amount of work and it makes a
huge mess it's very disruptive to the
bees it's just it's a kind of a disaster
every time I harvested I was killing a
lot of bees just for bees kind of stuck
in their own honey so I actually just
have it pour out of the side of the hive
into a jar and skip all of that mess
it's amazing we have delivered 50,000
flow hives to a hundred and thirty
countries so far it's a wonderful
feeling to have helped inspire so many
to take up the art of beekeeping and
learn to do all the things necessary to
keep their bees happy and healthy one of
the coolest things I've ever done in my
life was pull out the first frame
crawling with bees you see all of these
little heads pop up and look at you and
just go why didn't I do this 20 years
ago
as inventors we're always looking at how
we can make things better
so we've redesigned the flow height from
the ground up with lots of new features
inspired by all the great feedback from
our amazing customers the flow hive tune
now includes double observation windows
on the honey super so you can now get
even more insight into the amazing world
of bees the all new hive base now
features a built in trait for managing
pests with three ventilation options
built in spirit levels and an optional
adjustable hive stand allows you to set
up your home perfectly inside is a
second-generation patented flow frames
which allows you to share the new
experience of harvesting pure untouched
honey directly from the hive and
eliminates the need for costly
harvesting equipment by popular request
we've included an adjustable harvesting
shelf to make it easy to collect your
very own fresh honey each hive includes
a tool and screws to make it easy to
assemble even by hand the roof shingles
now come pre glued together for better
weather protection with roof locks for
high winds all handles and latches are
now robust solid brass the hive is made
from highly durable sustainably sourced
a grade Western redcedar
we're now manufacturing our own in-house
workshop using precision laser cutting
to make sure every hive is of the
highest quality if you're new to be
don't worry we've created lots of
educational resources and our team is on
hand to give you guidance and support as
you enter the fascinating wonderful
world of think music so to celebrate our
third birthday we're offering the
IndieGoGo community first option on the
limited early release glow I have two
whether you're in your backyard rooftop
community garden or school there's
nothing quite like tasting the utterly
unique flavors of your very own honey
order here and join our engaged global
community of beekeepers if we look after
the bees they'll look after us and the
honey really is an amazing bonus
