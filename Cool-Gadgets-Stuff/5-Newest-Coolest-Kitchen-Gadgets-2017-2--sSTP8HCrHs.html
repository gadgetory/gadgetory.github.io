effective forms of healthy living yet
the problem with home juicing is that
it's way too much work all those
cumbersome parts the weird angles that
seem intentionally designed to outsmart
your sponge so much effort every time
for it seems to be so little reward
until now introducing juicer juicing
without the cleaning imagine a machine
that squeezes every single drop of juice
from the fruit to repress using 8 tons
of force a machine that is so beautiful
and so simple to use that it'd be a
crime to put it anywhere other than your
kitchen bench how does it work
simply chop your fruit and vegetables
and put them in the single use for
multiple use environmentally friendly
juicing back and then into the juicer it
goes the machine is so simple to use
that all you need to do is press one
button and 90 seconds later you will
have the fruit squash to almost a paper
like thinness and virtually every drop
of nutritious juice in the glass simply
recycle or reuse the youth bag it's
entirely up to you juicers uniquely
designed juicing bags means no fruit or
vegetable ever touch the machine which
means no cleaning no pulling the Machine
apart no rinsing just juice at juicer we
came up with the ultimate solution
simple elegant and most importantly
convenient enough to make juicing a
daily healthy habit and we think we've
gone beyond just that we believe that
everybody should be able to maintain a
healthy lifestyle with ease leaving time
for the more important things in life
and right now we are ready to launch
toosha to the world all we need is your
help to make this product cheaper to
produce please help us by backing this
campaign thank you please NASA

almonds are a great source of protein
and almond milk is a delicious
replacement for Dairy Milk most people
buy it at the store but store-bought
almond milk has unnecessary additives
and contains very little in the way of
actual almonds but if you control the
process you know exactly what you're
getting so we designed the machine that
simplifies this process there's no mess
a quick cleanup you have almond milk and
30 seconds here's how it works
first soak almonds overnight once
they're soaked add almonds to the
machine then add any garnish you want
here I'm adding a date for sweetness but
maple syrup works great for sweetnesses
way attach the filter cup to the head
and turn then add water to the machine
spill line you can add a pinch of salt
and a splash of vanilla to your life
then attach the head to the base and
plug it in push the button and the milk
will be ready in 30 seconds then you
just pour it and enjoy and cleanup is
just as easy first detach the cup for
the Machine and remove the pulp you can
save the pulp if you'd like it's a great
flower substitute that can be composted
as well then quickly rinse the cup and
head under the tech and do the same with
the inside of the machine and read to
dry and that's it
the whole process takes less than five
minutes you have delicious homemade
almond milk and you know what's in it

I am Rudy the Creator Costilla I'm you
enjoy eating tortillas tacos or
quesadillas when heating up a corn
tortilla you have four choices you can
heat up in the microwave yuck you're
left with a soggy tortilla or worse
you've overheated it and now your turkey
has hardened rubbery
maybe you have a gas stove where you
heat it up over a flame trying not to
burn the tortilla or yourself in the
process or you can pull out a frying pan
and wait for it to heat up while
constantly turning your tortilla for the
right consistency
maybe you cook them in oil adding
unnecessary fat what if I told you
there's a simpler healthier faster way
to heat up your corn tortilla with no
dirty dishes and even my five-year-old
can do it did you know that 80% of
American households have a toaster and
that the only use it for one thing can
make toast well not anymore
Castilla is my new patent-pending
extended accessories for your toaster
just place your tortilla in the tosya
insert the toasty a' into the slot of
the toaster set the dial and out pops
the tortilla heated to perfection and
ready for taco night but there's a lot
more you can do with toasty oh you can
make healthy tostadas right in your
toaster no oils or edits s it can also
make things like pizzas costea's sausage
and egg breakfast ideas and lots of
other recipes we haven't even thought of
yet we went through a lot of prototypes
at first designed only for heating corn
tortillas then we realized that flight
design changes would allow it to be used
for all sorts of recipes
we designed it to have a simple sleek
look that fits in any toaster we use
stainless steel and food grade material
so your tosya won't run the high temp
plastic material on the handles allows
for easy removal from the toaster
without the need for an oven mix and it
can easily be thrown in the dishwasher
now that we have design completed the
materials in place we need your help
with your help we'll be able to take our
final step into production our hope is
that you partner with us to make us feel
reality thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
