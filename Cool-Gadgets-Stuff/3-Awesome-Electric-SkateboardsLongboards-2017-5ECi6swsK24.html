you
my name is nian Connolly I started -
electric first electric skateboard
designed for the real world
what's really great and we put a lot of
time into this is making our board
really repeat the ride we want people
who you know maybe have not lived long
where they asked to try like blog or
because it's actually easier to ride all
you do is step on because of our
progenitor brace you can actually pull
the board in place as you step on and
then all you is in beginner but use it
all the way forward on throttle and
control acceleration for you all you
need to focus on is standing on a
longboard to get comfortable when you're
ready you just turn on the or advanced
modes which will move the speed
limitation acceleration limit will be on
point
car motor is really unique and that it
can attach to any skateboard axle on the
market you can essentially use one tool
that's a standard skate tool and in just
a couple minutes spur it on and plug it
in you're ready to go huh motors are
really great because there were
extremely low maintenance because it's
sealed
it keeps debris and water out of the
motor and the tire the outside is
actually replaceable so that motor will
last a very long time and it's actually
zero maintenance because it's no doubt
strong place managing heat and brushless
motors is really important to you along
the life of the motor while you're
riding the board to counteract or keep
the motor from overheating
we actually limit the current that's
going to prevent overheating as well as
we inject an oil into the motor
it's actually magnetic it's called
ferrofluid it's really commonly used to
cool speaker drivers there are basically
magnets are moving usually were the
first company to actually use bare foot
to cool motors and food production
promoters are sealed so they keep water
and debris out as well as keep our
ferrofluid and I really like that our
motors are capable of going up just
about any he'll you're going to
encounter even on our base bottle board
and go a 15% grade with no effort
we spent a lot of time on our motors and
actually have sensors embedded in them
that tell the motor controller where the
motors at at all times so it runs at
optimal efficiency for Hill starts as
well as a braking pit board has
regenerative brakes which actually
charge the battery as your braking so
that increases to range at the end of
the day a battery pack we have really
interesting chemistry of batteries on
lithium iron phosphate and it's
extremely stable at handles cold weather
and hot weather better than standard
lithium ion batteries because it's more
stable and operates at a lower voltage
per cell we can actually charge our pack
up to 85% 30 minutes or full charging
power which is extremely fast for a
seven-ten webpage and our battery packs
are also hot swappable so their range is
not limited by the package under your
board let's undo the engineering and
design at Northeastern University and
that's where I started building - and
since then we've progressed through
multiple startup challenge including
becoming a finalist in Mass Challenge
2015 and we're now in green town labs
which is the green tech co-working space
and some of the last reasons where we
have a lot of tools at our disposal and
we're surrounded by a great ecosystem of
companies that are building really
innovative and green technologies of
future so it's really unique with our
design process we really focused on
manufacturing from our first sketch so
our manufacturing is actually scalable
and it's very easy for us to implement
which lowers our manufacturing risks
okay starter because we've basically
finished the development of our product
we have prototypes out there we've had
people test them and they're working
great
we want to producing the full production
and to do that we need your support
as fun as logical onboarding is even
more fun as your friends but feel free
to share our Kickstarter page so that we
can be our funding calls it always right
-
thank you for supporting our Kickstarter
we're really excited to get - into your
hands and we can't wait to hear your
feedback thank you
