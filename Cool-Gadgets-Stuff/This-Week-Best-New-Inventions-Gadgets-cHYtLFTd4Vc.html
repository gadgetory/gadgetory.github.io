I'll see you in a bit fun so you might
not been able to hear that but using Ori
I was able to have a call and that's
because Ori is a voice assistant bring
that turns your finger into a smart
phone
all through just a touch of the ear the
Y that's because the way in which we're
using the devices is changing changing
from a world where we use screens and
touch to one where we talk now Ori uses
bone conduction and bone conduction has
been used in many medical grade devices
we package it in a way that ascends
vibrations through your finger directly
into years only you can hear and that
allows you to hear and talk to just your
finger amen that's music like the thanks
to bone conduction and the dual noise
cancelling microphone you can hear and
talk even and loudly
so check this out
or is perfectly private and discreet
using it mixing futures like a secret
Asian Inori
is more than just a neat gadget for
taking and making calls because behind
it is powerful voice artificial
intelligence a French theory in Google
assistant it puts them exactly where you
need them think about all the different
things that you can do and one of my
favorite translation all you have to do
is just motion upwards and say Ori how
do I say where are the burritos in
Spanish hello amigos John's estan los
burritos and just like burritos come in
different flavors Ori comes in three
different colors I guarantee you there's
an oil ring for every outfit and every
occasion and even better Ori is splash
proof too look guys I know how popular
you are and that's why you have the Ori
app because it helps you filter out
everything else and there's four LED
lights that tell you what kind of
messages are coming through come on
let's hit the streets to see what people
think of already
hey oh it's really clear
thousands of people have tried already
and we're finally ready to start making
and sharing the origin with the rest of
the world and with everything that's
happened I can't help but think of our
inspiration my dad he also happens to be
visually impaired Ori doesn't just help
the visually impaired access something
that has difficulty before smartphones
but in terms they have inspired us to
use our devices the new natural screen
freeways I really want our venture in
darkness to power the screen freak
revolution thanks for watching guys
remember to practice today because one
day with Ori you too can find your voice
this is Steven aka DJ question mark he
is a professional DJ and music producer

standard and that's great because it
means that many things can fit together
