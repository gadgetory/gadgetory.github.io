at first glance this appears to be a
standard road bike but take another look
no chain and no sprockets less drag less
maintenance longer pedal cracks more
leverage more torque vertical motion
more gravity more speed cycling is a
sport where the leg is attached directly
to a machine the bike with linear motion
there's less stress to the body so less
blood oxygen requirements to the legs
less strain on the heart and less
flexing of the hips knees and ankles 15
years ago this was just an idea to go
faster but with the help of competitive
riders engineers medical professionals
production machinists bike retailers and
experience in designing and building an
experimental aircraft what it became is
faster simpler and safer riding pedal
cranks over two times longer delivered
twice the power to the rear wheel and
vertical pedaling takes advantage of
gravity throughout the entire stroke the
prototype frame weighs under three
pounds a new computer design weighs even
less improves its strengths and
simplifies production the gearbox that
converts a linear pedaling to rotational
motion weighs less than the chain and
sprockets of a 10 speed and a built in
mechanism prevents horizontally-opposed
Locka of the drive levers by advancing
one pedal at the top of the stroke and
retarding the opposite pedal at the
bottom it also provides for a smooth
natural transition from one stroke to
the next removing the rear wheel as
quick and simple open to quick release
levers and disconnect the shifter cable
that's it and for transporting it all
fits easily and securely in the back of
a car
so here it is new bike or benefits
