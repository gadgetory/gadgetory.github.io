day one because getting outside helps
you reconnect to what matters whether
it's who you with or where you are a
sense of adventure or just relaxation
we're here to help you get there we're
so low stove and fire is what we do best
wherever whenever
compact efficient durable and all you
need is wood that's right no gas just
wood less smoke less hassle way less
hassle and a flame so clean you'd never
guess you were using wood we've made
products for the backcountry the car
camper and the backyard but when it came
to our largest fire pit we noticed one
size did not fit all you asked us for a
bigger flame and that
introducing the solo stove Yukon the
biggest fire pit we've made yet same
amazing flames same efficient design
just wait
but a lot of you asked for something
smaller for travellers in city dwellers
so we size down the original fire pit to
fit with you wherever you go
introducing the solo stove ranger same
powerful flame smaller footprint perfect
for life on the road and life in the
city this is Kickstarter number three in
2014 we funded our first production of
the campfire and in 2016 we were the
ones who brought the bonfire to life we
make things we want to use and we get
our inspiration from you our backers we
want to keep making products that help
you get outside and reconnect to what
matters whatever that is for you so
thank you for giving them
the opportunity keep doing what we love
and whatever you do make sure to get
outside
hi I'm Fabien the creator of Eddie the
smallest and lightest Aaron kit for
bicycles that converts any bicycle into
a powerfully bike within seconds you
simply mount the drive unit to an
existing bike attach the battery switch
it on and off you go
three years ago we successfully launched
the first version of Eddie since then
thousands of bikes all over the world
have been equipped with Eddie making the
owners pasta and happier
the reasons why area is so popular are
clear it is extremely light extremely
powerful very compact and you can use it
on any existing bike the only downside
of a friction roller Drive is this it
can be quite noisy however the new
generation of Eddy will sound more like
this and that's not the result of our
sound engineer playing around the volume
control it's the result of a solid
one-year Austrian engineering process
that has left to 90% noise reduction
like in the previous version of Eddy
there is no friction in standby mode in
all mode you can choose between five
support levels once your pedal Eddy
starts within half a second if you stop
pedaling Eddy stops automatically one
battery can last up to four hours in
constant use and can be exchanged or
charged easily another big step forward
of this wireless sensors not only
because they're much more sensitive but
to make the installation so easy no
matter which bike you're using
in case you still want help with the
installation
we do have an extensive and permanent
groves or network we are so proud of
this new generation of Eddy it really
describes our vision of the future of
cycling now we need your help to
accelerate the production and establish
Eddy next on the market if you already
own the previous version of edit check
out our update perk to get all the
advantages Eddy next join our campaign
and emotion your bike with it
you
the building block is one of the most
basic and fundamental toys yet for
decades it has remained unchanged until
now hi my name is Matt and I'm Marc and
two years ago we launched a fidget cue
with the help of over 150,000 backers we
brought the project to life
now we're back on Kickstarter for the
first time since 2016 to show you what
we've been working on introducing pixel
pixel is a magnetic building system that
is infinitely expandable so you can
build as small or as big as you want
with no grooves notches or specific
sides to line up we've reimagined what a
building block can be with the help of
rare earth magnets which we've designed
to auto-rotate
simply take one pixel block place it
next to another pixel block and watch
them snap together from there you can
choose to build things to the side to
keep things 2-dimensional or you can
build in all directions to make them
three dimensional and with pixel
available in four different sizes and 52
different colors you have a vast palette
to work with don't know what to build no
problem with a pixel companion app
you'll be able to find inspiration from
other users designs or build your own
designs an app and share them with the
rest of the pixel community if 2d art is
more your style upload an image and let
the app do the rest converting your
picture into an easy to follow along
blueprint made from the exact pixel
palette of 52 colors you can also choose
to manually customize your blueprints
block-by-block
we've spent a lot of time working on
pixel so this is where you come in we've
got tooling underway but we're turning
to you to take this system and community
to the next level
be sure to check out our project rewards
and choose the one that's right for you
as an SI Labs our priority has always
been and will continue to be to create
interesting unique and fun products made
with high-quality materials and
standards and we're confident in saying
that we met those goals with pixel
