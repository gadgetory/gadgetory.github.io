global warming or that whole issue
Lucien is a problem I don't care who you
are or what your scientific belief
system is we know that that's bad we
need to get rid of it is there a way to
get totally clean energy with no
pollution and unlimited energy so our
first question was where's the energy
and there's only one answer and that's
right here few miles underneath us is
unlimited power unlimited energy before
you go the hotter it gets you take that
energy and you bring it up is there a
way to bring up just the energy what it
takes is just doing the right things and
inventing the right things you can't use
copper wire because it'll melt so we
found this material called graphene
graphene is a substance that is really
made out of graphite which is like
pencil line and what they discovered was
that if they take one molecule layer at
a time off this graphite that's called
graphene it's hundred times better
conductor than copper it's lighter than
air stronger than steel it transfers
heat really efficiently if you put
hundred degrees here you get hundred on
the other side instantly in the middle
is completely cool so the heat that you
put in gets all the way there whether
you go 10 feet or you go miles you could
bring up unlimited energy from deep
underground to the surface pollution
free
so I approached the graphene guys that I
said could you make me a string so if
you make me a string I'll put those
strings together and make a cable then
I'll put the cable underneath the ground
and that cable will bring up the heat
and so at first they were a little wary
because it seemed too simple they have
already made the first set of books for
us the short ones they have tested it
and found it to work perfectly fine we
are using that and working with stage
two in Michigan
Stage two has a platform we are building
they will test everything out and then
that product will be commercially
manufactured and propagated from
Singapore this would be the greatest
invention maybe ever because if you can
get unlimited energy from underneath the
earth pollution free that's everything
that's everything you've no pollution
you have no fossil fuel issues you have
no you no co2 coming out greenhouse
gases you know none of that all of that
is gone here's the answer
you
the world demands cleaner low-cost
alternatives to fossil fuels all Tarot's
energies is answering that call with a
high altitude wind turbine the bat for
the first time affordable wind energy
can be delivered to the furthest points
of the earth
powering remote communities off-grid
industries and disaster relief
the Altera's bat furnaces stronger more
consistent winds found at higher
altitudes at these Heights it produces
twice the energy of an ordinary wind
turbine the reason altitude is so
exciting and worth going out this is
really very simple there's just a lot
more reimagining proven aerospace
technology the bat uses an inflatable
helium shed to lift a lightweight
turbine into the air power is sent to
the ground using high-strength
conductive tethers the bat also offers a
unique platform to expand internet and
phone services weather monitoring and
much more designed to be rapidly
deployed anywhere the bat significantly
reduces human and wildlife impact when
compared to ordinary wind turbines I
think it offers a breakthrough formed
out of MIT Montero's is working with the
Alaska Energy Authority to launch the
first commercial high altitude wind
turbine
less expensive more flexible and
significantly more efficient the bat is
the next generation of wind power
in September 2012 representatives of the
Chinese and dodge governments signed an
agreement to continue investing in the
implementation of dynamic tidal power in
China by combining Chinese and Dutch
expertise the construction of a dynamic
tidal power Dam can be developed into an
economically viable and environmentally
sustainable investment dynamic tidal
power is designed to generate electric
energy from the kinetics of tidal water
a long term of at least 30 kilometers
perpendicular to the coast interacts
with the tidal flow to create a
hydraulic head a barrier parallel to the
coastline at the far end of the dam
giving it a t-shape amplifies the head
on either side of the structure this
hydraulic head together
with the shape of the tunnels results in
the acceleration of water that drives
the many turbines in the dam significant
to making such a high level of energy
production possible is the use of highly
advanced turbines that are designed
specifically for this purpose they work
with an extremely low head a
bi-directional and have a peak output of
5 megawatts each a dam of 40 kilometres
in length and can accommodate 2,000
turbines enough to supply millions of
households with sustainable energy
areas with good potential for the
implementation of DTP of relatively
shallow and have tidal currents running
parallel to the coastline numerous areas
in Europe as well as along the entire
coastline of the Chinese mainland and
the Korean Peninsula offer excellent
locations with the latest knowledge and
technology China sets itself up to
achieve its objective of generating more
than 15% of its energy from renewable
sources by the year 2020</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
