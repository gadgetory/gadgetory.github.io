I'm chase beach I'm a director of sales
at Hsu Dex and I'm here with rust Maliki
russki tell you tell us a little bit
where we are what your job entails and
specifically what this application is by
job entail it's the most time always
welding pipe welding structural you've
been doing this job for a number of
years and and where's where's the pain
points like where where is that the kind
of strain that you're getting throughout
the day mostly might a little bit
sometimes shoulders sometimes swords and
that's just doing repeated prolonged
work where you're in a bending position
bending the most time I'm with rock and
mark and we're gonna do some scaffolding
using these shoulder axe to help bring
the scalping up and the leg axe in the
squatted position and the leg X is
integrated with the fall protection
harness you guys are doing a lot of a
lot of overhead work for so we're
helping it all with you know picking
things up or is it more kind of that
concept more of lifting it up right and
then picking it up more so what thing
you're wearing the leg axe and so can
you describe how the how the leg X is
helping you more compression and I've
looked at more of my legs and said my
back
the way you think about heat stress
management and cooling products is about
to change
introducing the newest addition to our
Chile's cooling line the patented 66 85
dry evaporative cooling best heat stress
is a major productivity drain on the
worksite that's why we've developed the
66 85 dry evaporative cooling vest to be
a lightweight durable and long-lasting
cooling solution the dr s uses the
latest in revolutionary new cooling
technology dry evaporation the
principles of dry evaporation are
similar to what evaporation in that
water as well as air flow are required
to activate the cooling process the heat
from your body as well as the
surrounding air will cause the water
within the best to evaporate keeping the
wearer cool the dry evaporative cooling
vest is designed specifically for those
working long hours in hot environments
the vest features a v-neck with zip
closure for easy on and off a convenient
hanging loop located above the valve
provides an additional hanging option
the watertight valve on the back of the
vest is easy to open and fill side mesh
panels provide additional ventilation as
well as comfort and stretch for active
movement the elastic binding at the
bottom of the vest helps keep it in
place
to activate locate the valve on the back
of the vest open the valve cap and pour
in fresh cool water
close the cap
close the valve cap and distribute the
water evenly from the back of the vest
through the shoulders to the front the
reservoirs inner membrane will begin
absorbing the water cooling is immediate
and will reach an optimal 59 degrees
Fahrenheit within five minutes cooling
lasts up to three days with not in use
store the vest in an open environment
until the water has completely
evaporated from the inside reservoir
this can take up to three days once dry
the vest can be stored in any manner to
prevent foreign materials from impairing
the vest effectiveness keep the cap
closed at all times once water has
evaporated simply refill to reactivate a
target on we offer a multitude of heat
stress PPE solutions within our Chile's
line of cooling products our most
popular gear from that line features
evaporative technologies to keep workers
cool in even the most extreme
temperatures some of these products may
look similar but they cool using
different technologies
the first is a traditional and very
effective cooling technology that uses
non-toxic super absorbent acrylic
polymer crystals to retain water and
provide cooling belief to activate place
the product in a sink bucket or cooler
of ice water let it sit for 2 to 5
minutes or until plumb the second
cooling technology utilizes a unique
hyper evaporative polyvinyl acetate or
PVA material which retains water while
remaining damp to the touch Ct products
are less bulky than traditional cooled
products plus there's no residue no time
wasted waiting for activation and no
need to wash your hands after use to
activate simply hold a CT product
underwater for about a minute or until
the PVA material is fully saturated give
the product a good twirl and enjoy up to
4 hours of cooling relief our newest
evaporative cooling technologies are
microfiber cooling line made of a
lightweight woven material it wicks away
moisture from the wear this
next-generation cooling material is soft
machine washable and utilizes a 50 plus
UPF treatment to provide superior
protection from harmful UV rays activate
by simply wetting the towel snap to
accelerate the air flow and activation
process cooling relief should last up to
two and a half hours to regulate the
core body temperature place your chill
it's cooling product around your head or
neck the head and neck contain large
blood vessels near the surface of the
skin that will help keep the body
temperature regulated for more
