riding my bike two wheels my own power
and the possibilities for adventure were
unlimited but as I got older I realized
I was writing less and less my wrist
neck and groin hurt or went numb every
time I rode more than a few miles as a
doctor who has reviewed the medical
research on the subject I knew those
symptoms can mean serious trouble I also
knew there had to be a better way my
name is Jim Parker I'm the director of
cruise by my wife Maria and I decided to
invest in an alternative healthier bike
design we helped start a new company
called cruise bike and for the past 12
years we've been testing and improving
our various models to make them faster
healthier and more fun in 2013 Maria
raced 3,000 miles in a cruise bike to
win the race across america between us
we hold dozens of cycling records
especially in long distance events and
that's just the two of us people in the
Crucified tribe have lost weight gotten
in shape traveled the world and commuted
to work and raced farther and faster
than they ever thought they could now we
focus our effort into creating a healthy
affordable bike that is all about
freedom years of writing racing and
innovation have led to a simple elegant
new design introducing the crews bike
t-50 the healthiest most comfortable
most affordable bike ever free your body
from the pain of a traditional bike so
you can ride more it in shape and enjoy
the simple pleasure of a bike ride our
unique front-wheel drive design
harnesses the compact drivetrain of the
traditional bicycle it connects your
upper body and core to the cranks so you
can climb and accelerate like you would
on a traditional bike it delivers a
tight turning radius it also fits on
most trainers so you can exercise
indoors it's about the same length as
traditional bikes and all the components
are standard the t-50 won't cause the
discomfort and pain that a traditional
by can in addition to being amazingly
ergonomic you can share your t-50 with
your taller and shorter friends thanks
to the adjustable front tube and you can
take your t-50 anywhere since it fits on
standard bike racks and works well with
a variety
bags and trailers making it ideal for
bike packing camping or a trip to the
market the t-50 gives you freedom you
decide what to do with it
imagine being cocooned by a pure mist
warm gentle and luxurious Cirrus is like
showering in the clouds wow that was a
phenomenal experience I'm totally blown
away I'm really impressed it was an
amazing shower they say that it's like
showering in a cloud it really is
dearest is a revolutionary showerhead
that elevates the bathing ritual into
the stratosphere our atomizing cloud
maker nozzle technology produces a myth
so fine that it totally envelops you and
by creating a myth so fine Cirrus
reduces water and energy consumption by
75 percent compared to conventional
showerheads meaning you'll see a rapid
return on your investment Cirrus also
purifies the water in which he obeys our
easy to replace nano filters contain
three layers of mineralized stones which
enhance water quality by filtering
impurities reducing chlorine adding
minerals and balancing pH levels each
nano filter last two to three months of
use for an average family you can also
choose from our range of organic
essential oil aromatherapy infusers
simply add an infuser each time you
shower for a completely invigorating
experience personally I'm not really one
for the aromatherapy put my girlfriend
is she said it's like having a spa our
essential oils are both colorless and
soap free meaning they do not perfume
your hair or body or discolor the water
so how does Cirrus work our eco-friendly
cloud maker water atomizing technology
delivers the consistent spray by
splitting the incoming water stream into
myriad nano droplets creating a mist
that is both all-embracing and highly
efficient well to be honest I was a
little skeptical about the water savings
but I've been using it
for about a month now and I've seen a
significant drop in water consumption I
can see this thing paying for itself in
no time and cirrus does not compromise
rinse ability in fact foamy shampoo
rinses out of your hair easier with
Cirrus thanks to its optimized water
distribution I'm really surprised if
anything the shower rinsed off the
shampoo on my hair faster than a normal
shower which really surprised me because
my hair is really sick Paris is designed
in France and uses chrome and white
polycarbonate to produce a stylish
unapologetically modern bathroom shower
heads it's made with standard universal
fittings and installs in seconds it is
adaptable to any bathroom and setup is
both tool lists and foolproof the
installation is the easiest thing in the
world I'm no handyman it took me seconds
to do it if I can do it anyone can do it
so where's the catch the catch is now
I'll take even longer to get ready now
if you'll excuse me
cirrus like showering in the clouds

nowadays there is something wrong with
the market of climate equipment on the
one hand there are plenty of absolutely
inefficient small devices that don't
prevent suffering from heat on the other
hand there are overpriced bulky
solutions that consume sounds of energy
they require complicated maintenance and
to be honest not always provide you with
desired level of comfort I don't know
about you but I would like to have a
device that combines possibility of
desktop gadget with efficiency of modern
technology mid next generation of evil

these neutral refreshing breeze one can
feel as the Seacoast and i found the
dryer hair and skin the report produced
moist and taking care of your house and
beauty everybody has their own
temperature of comfort and the optimal
humidity level this is definitely not
something that central air conditioning
systems respect also cooling effect
spread and evenly and those who are
close to an air conditioner always too
hot and others always feel to call
during the summer season fully
air-conditioned spaces become unbearable
and regular heat wave make it much worse
even best climate systems often can cope
and you need some extra cooling power
