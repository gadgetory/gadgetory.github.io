hi I'm Rachel and this is my dog river
I love bring river on all of my
adventures with me but when we moved
back to the Pacific Northwest an
overnight trip to Mount Hood took a
dangerous turn
when River couldn't stop shivering I had
to start leaving him behind I looked and
looked for a better solution but I just
couldn't find anything good enough so I
decided to invent my own river and I
have been working together to create the
ultimate sleeping bag for dogs
we call it the doggy bag
the doggy bag is made to go everywhere
with you it also comes with its own
stuff sack so you can easily pack up and
get the doggy bag is lightweight and
compressible enough for a day pack or
even for your dogs pack
River comes alive out on the trail the
doggy bag reflects this feeling of
freedom with its two-part design
allowing you to use the two pieces
separately as a lightweight travel bed
or quilt or together as a plush travel
bed or sleeping bag we've constructed
the doggy bag out of durable
water-resistant materials to withstand a
lifetime of outdoor adventures together
each detail has been carefully designed
with your dog's comfort and safety at
the core of everything we do
that's why we've used snaps instead of
zippers we didn't want to risk catching
a pups fur or tail in the zipper or have
them feeling trapped inside their
sleeping bag all of the materials we use
are made of human grade quality with a
lightweight ripstop nylon shell and warm
compressible insulation it even includes
a draft sleep rigger and I have spent
the last year of designing prototyping
and testing our doggy bag now we need
your help to bring it to life these days
we're completely dependent on our mobile
devices when we're out and about the

it's running out of battery but where do
you find a reliable solid power supply
to use on the go that works every time
