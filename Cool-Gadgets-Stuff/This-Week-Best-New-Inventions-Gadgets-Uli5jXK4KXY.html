outdoors the wild because it is nature
is not tamed a river does not ask where
to flow
to cope in nature's unpredictable
conditions you need the best gear with
you
this is calm bar the only heavy duty
multi-tool that combines the core tools
needed for the outdoors an ax a hammer
and a spade along with dedicated room in
the handle for a magazine or comm bars
knife and saw all tools fold into a
rapid activation system that weighs only
3.2 pounds as former officers and the
IDF Special Forces and about outdoorsmen
we know that the only way to execute a
successful operation is by sweating the
details
cutting absolutely no corners and
planning for every possible outcome we
applied the exact same logic when
creating Kalmar our first role was to
make a tool with a lifetime warranty the
starting point was to ensure that each
tool was developed according to US
military spec standards but since no
such combined tool exists there are no
standards for it so we created a new
standard we put comm bar under heavy
loads and smash the rocks with it we
left it in water for a week and poured
sand into every opening after every
torture test we double-checked that each
tool was still fully functional and
locked securely in place making sure
safety mechanisms are up to the
challenge the only way to create a life
lasting tool is to use life lasting
materials comm bars main body is made of
aircraft-grade aluminum the hammer is
stainless steel the Spade is made of a
single piece of titanium and the axe
combines both titanium and stainless
steel between able sharpening the
different parts are meticulously fused
together to a single sturdy unit can
outperform any task to provide a great
grip while using these tools VI
ergonomically designed and well balanced
handle completes calm bar into a tool
that feels perfect in your hand
inside the handle there's room for calm
bars not made of stainless steel and
crafted as a top survival knife next to
it is a place where the saw made of
aircraft aluminum and polymer with a
blade replacement mechanism for full
flexibility to carry combi we created a
holster and a case designed for
durability and rapid activation because
nature doesn't wait for you to find your
gear we've been developing comm bar for
three and a half years to make sure it
comes out perfect light sturdy iconic
wherever you go with it and whatever you
do with it comm bar is the perfect
heavy-duty outdoor multi-tool whether
you're an off-roader an avid outdoorsman
casual camper or a hardcore survivalist
comm bar will become an inherent part of
your travels get one and be ready for
whatever comes your way

throttle just plug and play Swift pause
is for any dog who needs a little extra
mental or physical exercise swift paws
is a game of tag or chase for dogs where
they chase the lure around the field and
they have a great deal of fun and get a
lot of exercise all dogs are
pre-programmed if they want to run and
play and chase something and swift paws
creates a great form of exercise for
them it lets them use their brains and
get their energy out and it's pretty low
energy for us but I know we're so busy
these days so we need something that
lets them get the maximum amount of
exercise and fun out for them and an
easy way for us to do it we're very
pleased with a new product we've done
three generations of professional lure
chasing equipment we've taken the
properties of that the quality and the
safety and integrated them into our new
home unit the machine is connected to a
series of pulleys that you put out in
whatever shape you want any size any
shape it can fit in any backyard or even
indoors once you set up the pulleys
around the machine you take some string
and you run that around the series of
pulleys you tie it together to form a
closed loop and when you pull the
trigger it goes zipping around one of my
favorite things about Swift paws is
watching a dog's face light up when they
see it for the first time and one of my
second favorite things about Swift paws
is watching their owner light up just as
much
we have been dedicated to Swift paws for
over five years now and we need your
help to bring it to everybody's backyard
everywhere we go were always asked the
question who let the dogs out we let the
dogs out

doing it on a world home and as shocking
as it is the truth is that asthma

Indonesia five years ago to study
Business and Economics five years later
