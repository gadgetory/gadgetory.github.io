an action in construction thank you this
mirror is an average guy with an average
passion for working out he struggled to
find the right training equipment
he tried from it that results and
deliberately nothing
this sound familiar
do you often end up with exercise
equipment a part you made out of now
sustainable materials quickly looks
terrible it's time to wake up and make a
change
hi my name is matheus Cochrane I'm the
co-founder and CEO of it would have
Scandinavia would you agree that most of
the home fitness equipment don't offer
the quality and experience you're
looking for oh and they are definitely
not sustainably made they don't look
very good either
so you just end up hiding them for

sustainability scandinavian design and
on training methods that are proven to
actually bring results and are used by
the professional athletes all around the

dual generator the chest trainer
converts your pedaling power into
electricity which gets stored in a
removable device charger called the

levels of resistance to help you burn
anywhere from 500 to 1200 calories per
hour and thanks to the spark will you

devices such as laptops phones and
tablets when you're on the go better
