pick me up hello Andy go go my name is
Peter Treadway and I am CTO and
co-founder at Acton Acton is a company
that designs and manufactures personal
transportation we are introducing a
longboard the likes of which the world
has never seen
carbon fiber pressure cast aluminum
extruded aluminum CNC cut we are using
four hub motors all wheel drive people
all wheel drive the one that will get
you up most of the steepest hills in
America and around the world
but wait there's more if you're looking
for something a little more affordable
we've got you we have two more models
what we call the blink s and the blink s
- it's a different construction than the
Quattro it's made of wood but it has
aluminum extrusion along the bottom and
an aluminum plate on top to kind of
sandwich the batteries inside of the
deck so there's actually a hole that
goes clear through it the s2 version of
this board is a little bit longer than
the s and that's because it has the
extra motor it goes a little faster and
just needs to be a little longer for
more stability
so you get to choose from three boards
you get the cuatro or the blink guess or
the blink s2
now we're releasing three products at
the same time here so of course this is
why we're on IndieGoGo but we have
finished the development on these and we
have of course factory minimums that we
need to meet and that's why we're here
and that's why we need your help help us
out and get yourself onto an active
board and glide uphill into the future
of personal transportation thank you

hi everyone it is our pleasure to
present the Adam fly we started to
design and create the Adam fly a little
bit more than a year and a half ago our
idea was to make the best and the most
durable hoverboard on the market we have
finally made a fully functional
prototype after many tasks with many
different components and we are ready to
hit the market you can ride your Adam
over a variety of terrains that come
across your path ride down streets and
you'll feel like you are surfing on
waves in the ocean
Adam is made with an aluminum alloy
frame and you can even ride down stairs
without any problems feel the freedom of
movement at a top speed of 12 miles per
hour
Adam fly is water resistant so if you
see a pile of water don't hesitate just
run over it we have created Adam to fit
everyone take your Adam on a rocky
surface or even on grass it is up to
your imagination
Adam fly will work for seven and a half
miles on a single charge so you can plan
a trip and go for a distance without a
problem we have tested adam on different
obstacles and terrains you can easily
ride over bumps and go up hill or ride
down stairs like a champ we wanted to
create a hoverboard that feels like a
skateboard or surfboard it also works as
a transportation vehicle that takes you
wherever you want we're developing an
application that supports both iOS and
Android that will make it easy to adjust
the settings of your Adam it will also
have an anti-theft function which means
your Adam can only be started when you
turn off the anti-theft function on your
end
the lights of Adam switch at the same
time you switch the direction you are
going that means you will always have a
bright light on the front and a red
light on back
no matter how many times you turn around
Adam is the ultimate off-road
all-terrain vehicle we are ready for
production and now we need your help to
get Adam fly to the market how much
freedom can you fit in a bag the freedom
of knowledge the freedom to share
freedom to dream freedom of movement now
it fits with linky
you
mobility is freedom with linky strong
patented folding mechanism it's freedom
in your bag it's a last mile mobility
solution that means no more traffic no
more bus timetables no more pollution
linkie is the first foldable electric
skateboard the team behind linky wants
to improve the way we experience cities
wherever we were in the world we found
ourselves wanting a mode of
transportation that is eco sustainable
easy to carry around and really fun to
ride we've applied our technical
engineering and sales backgrounds to
fill a gap in the market nothing out
there is truly portable so that's why we
need linkie to fit in a bag we are ready
to go into production but we need a
minimum number of orders to make this
possible your support right now we left
keep costs down so we can guarantee a
great level of service and a truly
exciting electric longboard
the unborn is the world's smallest
licensed electric skateboard it was
designed to be an ideal complement to
publisher sports systems in major cities
and urban areas and we're looking to
change the way people move
hi my name is Tony I'm in the street
designer hi I'm Rita I'm a mechanical
engineer and I'm a chef and I guess I'm
a hustler a we thought was team 2 years
ago we came together to find a solution
to the last mile problem in our home
country Singapore and has been an
amazing journey developing and refining
the design of the US but with the help
of our community
five months ago we launched a free
production sale for local exporters in
Singapore the intention of the
pre-production board but to gather
feedback on both hardware and software
so we could quickly iterate and make
improvements to the album through this
process the unborn has become a much
better product that we could have the
chief on our own
the unbought is based on the 2013
skateboard format and raised in a tree
and 1/2 kg it is light and compact
enough to be the perfect last mile
solution it also has enough power to
take the average person up to 18
kilometers and goes up to a speed of 25
pigs an hour having enough range to take
you from the train station and back and
still be powerful enough to give you a
trail of a right pill grid is also a 15
percent which would be enough to take
almost to arrange in any other hero</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
