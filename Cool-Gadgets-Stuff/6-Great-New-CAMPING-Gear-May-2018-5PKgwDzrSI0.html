outdoors the wild because it is nature
is not tamed a river does not ask where
to flow to cope in nature's
unpredictable conditions you need the
best gear with you
this is calm bar the only heavy-duty
multi-tool that combines the core tools
needed for the outdoors an ax a hammer
and a spade along with dedicated room in
the handle for a magazine or comm bars
knife and soft all tools fold into a
rapid activation system that weighs only
3.2 pounds as former officers and the
IDF Special Forces and about outdoorsmen
we know that the only way to execute a
successful operation is by sweating the
details
cutting absolutely no corners and
planning for every possible outcome we
applied the exact same logic when
creating calm our our first role was to
make a tool with a lifetime warranty the
starting point was to ensure that each
tool was developed according to US
military spec standards but since no
such combined tool exists there are no
standards for it so we created a new
standard we put comm bar under heavy
loads and smashed rocks with it we left
it in water for a week and poured sand
into every opening after every torture
test we double check that each tool was
still fully functional and locked
securely in place making sure our safety
mechanisms are up to the challenge the
only way to create a life lasting tool
is to use life lasting materials comm
bars main body is made of aircraft-grade
aluminum the hammer is stainless steel
the Spade is made of a single piece of
titanium and the axe combines both
titanium and stainless steel to enable
sharpening
the different parts are meticulously
fused together to a single sturdy unit
can outperform any task to provide a
great grip while using these tools VI
ergonomically designed and well balanced
handle completes calm bar into a tool
that feels perfect in your hand inside
the handle there's room for calm bars
not made of stainless steel and crafted
as a top survival knife next to it is a
place for the saw made of aircraft
aluminum and polymer with a blade
replacement mechanism for full
flexibility to carry combi we created a
holster and a case designed for
durability and rapid activation because
nature doesn't wait for you to find your
gear we've been developing calm bar for
three and a half years to make sure it
comes out perfect light sturdy iconic
wherever you go with it and whatever you
do with it calm bar is the perfect heavy
duty outdoor multi-tool whether you're
an off-roader an avid outdoorsman casual
camper or a hardcore survivalist calm
bar will become an inherent part of your
travels get one and be ready for
whatever comes your way kamar

the further your adventure takes you the
less you can rely on cell coverage what
if you're separated from your group what
if you need to adapt to the weather what

fits in the palm of your hand and
instantly turns your Smartphone into a
satellite communications device unlike
cell so you no matter where you are in

the peace and quiet of nature with the
peace of mind that you're not alone
your family will always know that you're
safe
and you can rest easy knowing the
conditions you'll face tomorrow
using the somewhere mobile app the
hotspot supports text messages weather
reports local alerts and location
sharing with many more features to come
and if things get really rough somewhere
will even help calling for a rescue
never before has the power of satellite
connectivities been in your fingertips
outdoor activity has been a part of my
life however one thing troubled me for
so long ere product is suitable for
outdoor activities
but the air inflation has always been a
big problem until we spend two years to
created this max pump - max pump - is
the tiniest outdoor air pump it is only
145 grams which can be easily put into
your package or backpack
it is capable of inflating all your
product the inside battery of 3000
milliamp scan inflating 60 swim rings
we're Outback logic two years ago we
launched our first product that siesta
for here on Kickstarter the response was
incredible and with the money raised we
delivered the world's first heat and
light blocking tent with built-in fans
thank you so much to everyone who backed
our last project the feedback has been
amazing and over the last two summers
happy customers have clocked up
thousands of hours of extra sleep thanks
to our heat and light blocking fabric
now we're back on Kickstarter to launch
our next game changing product the
siesta - a compact lightweight two
person backpacking tent that's
dramatically cooler than other tents and
sunny weather and keeps you warmer in
cold conditions we took all the
knowledge and experience we gained from
making the siesta four and developed a
brand new heat and light blocking fabric
with a core of 20 denier nylon ripstop
it's incredibly lightweight and durable
the waterproof fly enables exceptional
comfort by blocking infrared ultraviolet
and visible-light
while the inner mesh can be fully closed
to keep out dust and cold drafts when
designing the siesta - we wanted a
completely freestanding structure with
an awesome strength to weight ratio so
we integrated a full length trust pole
that extends right to the ground the
unique profile also allows orientation
towards the Sun so the doors are always
in the shade this enables maximum
ventilation without direct sunlight
entering the tent and if you've room in
your pack why not grab the optional fan
and enjoy even more airflow
game-changing comfort across hot and
cold temperatures while being compact
and lightweight with top-quality
aluminum fittings makes the siesta - the
most versatile backpacking tent ever
made we've already proven our production
processes so you can be sure of
world-class quality and reliability
you
my name is Ryan dimeric founder of
reform life and creator of the Nestea
booth ten it all began in 2014 when I
started exploring more after purchasing
a BW SD and renovating it to my dream
circle of you I started spending more
time outside finding Beauty all around
but I found more than just that I
realized the world of my dreams existed
just outside my comfort so I took a
plunge minimizing my possessions within
the band then put my lucrative corporate
career so I could trade my desk for the
outdoors but it wasn't perfect my
vintage vans engine have caught on fire
and had its share of challenges which
kept me thinking if only my West he
could attach to a daily driver so I went
to the drawing board utilizing my six
years in brand and product development
to create the Nestea an ultra low
profile premium roof tech built minimal
and rugged the nostalgic to a classic
the Nessie transforms any vehicle into a
home on wheels dream packing into a slim
8-inch profile which averages four to
seven inches slimmer the most softshell
tents and two feet shorter than
hardshell tents it opens up to a
spacious and comfortable two-person
suite for the two inch high density foam
mattress with the waterproof cover for
expansive windows with 360-degree
viewing screens for ventilation a
skylight with window for improved
lighting by day and stargazing by night
soft integrated twinkle lights and
storage pockets for all the essentials
water phones laptops etc underneath that
includes sixty rings - hang accessories
or string hanging system for wet gear or
whatever you'd like the Nestea handles
all rugs and seasons with its premium
build quality a durable - in turn 80
gram poly cotton blends the properties
of insulation and breathability for
improved temperature regulation a
completely waterproof 420 denier rain
fly protects from rain in rough weather
premium YKK zippers prevent snags
heavy-duty double stitching increases
durability
Hardcore alloy brackets withstand years
of opening and closing and a lightweight
aluminum base towards up to 660 pounds
if it keeps the tent light at 110
fitting within the weight boundaries for
most roof racks setting up is quick
simply unzip and roll up to travel cover
unlatch the compression straps flip the
tent open with the ladder and deploy the
rainfly from our proprietary pole
storage pocket which eases and decreases
time of setup depending on weather side
rain flies can be draped down for more
warmth rolled up for more airflow or
extended for shape the main rain fly can
also be removed for increased
breathability just unclip and roll it up
for a simpler and quicker setup in
summer months</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
