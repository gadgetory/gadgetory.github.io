reaching your fitness goals is being
consistent you get a strap rack you can
get to work on your time my name is
Jason and my name is Anthony
we are both mechanical engineers who
graduated from elementary
idea I got was basically seeing all the
issues with the current bullet bar that
we were using there are obvious defects
with that pull-up bar was damaging our
doorframe I was way too easy to fall off
you're doing pull-ups very limited on
features I remember just doing some
pull-ups and I was like what if we
actually had a full vkr on our doorway
how cool would that be
and so I decided to kind of draft up
this thing that I thought would be able
to be that something I've never seen
before basically that wasn't on the
market you know like where engineers
like we can actually make this we were
only going to make one for ourselves
that's how it started once we see that
we can put all these features on the
door like other people might like this
and the very first prototype failed
instantly it just snapped like snap
crackle pop it just crumbled under his
weight our product has the ability to
fold up and I actually got that idea
from one of those I from one of those
ironing boards that you kind of have in
the hotel and you could just like fold
it down iron your shirt and fold it back
up do your workout whatever you want to
do fold it up and you can walk right
under it the support towers that we call
them that rest against the doorframe
that are padded in the back they really
do a good job distributing your whole
weight along that doorframe so you're
not impacting the doorframe at one point
protecting the frame is probably our
number-one priority and then after that
from the fail videos that we seen like
the safety part like we wanted to make
sure it didn't come off we had a lot of
our friends test it up and they were
just loving this thing but just to see
how easy they took to it how it was so
natural for them they just hopped on and
they were ready to use I didn't have to
explain anything safety was a very
important part for us so one thing we
wanted to do is make sure that our
product can never fall off your door
our product stayed very light it folds
up it takes up zero floor space you can
move it easily so it's very convenient
for the user but once you bring the
straps with you and you have them
outside you can loop them around any bar
that you
and use it as a strap training system
there you can do your rows there you can
do your push-ups you can do ground work
with your legs in them meet solar crew
the smallest and lightest foldable solar
panel charger
charge your device with solar energy
efficiently
the highly sensitive panels can charge
even in the shade
charger cell phones power banks speakers
or earbuds add more panels to have
Sylla crew is small and slim
one-tenth of an inch thick when in years
you can also fold your silica
magnetic clasp protection makes it easy
to carry
you can simply hook it onto your back
solar crew is made of durable scratch
resistant
no need to worry about water on the
panels as solar crew is also water
resistance
solar trip welcome to a solar world
is it down jacket your only choice to
resist the cold weather you know it has
two major problems while its lightweight
the jacket itself can be bulky and once
it gets wet it loses all its insulation
but we have invented a new fabric
technology that solves both of these
problems meet the Kistler aerogel jacket
the warmest and thinnest jacket on earth
it promises to keep you warm in
temperatures as low as negative 320
degrees Fahrenheit the aerogel solid was
first created by Samuel Stevens Kistler
in 1931 it's the lightest solid in the
world and is 300 percent more effective
than traditional insulation materials
even NASA trusts the aerogel technology
to be used in their spacesuits however
when used in clothing aerogel can be
heavy and reduces mobility due to its
thick quality our research and
development team in the Silicon Valley
has taken traditional aerogel technology
and advanced it to be lighter thinner
breathable and more flexible without
sacrificing warmth let's do a liquid
nitrogen experiment to test its
performance spray liquid nitrogen on
both a piece of fresh pork and a person
wearing the Kistler aerogel jacket as
you can see the fresh pork can be
directly broken by hand however the
person in the Kistler aerogel jacket
felt no discomfort after being sprayed
and his body temperature remain normal
although you can see there was obvious
ice on the back of his jacket the
temperature there reached negative 320
degrees Fahrenheit at isler we offer a
range of different jacket styles varying
in thickness and cold resistance that
meet different needs levels are thickest
jacket uses a three millimeter
insulation layer and is only about one
and a half kilograms in weight 50%
lighter than the leading aerogel jackets
currently on the market our thinnest
aerogel jacket comes in at only half a
millimeter in thickness and weighs only
450 grams for the first time in the
world we've created an ultra-thin 3d
mesh composite of aerogel which enables
the application of aerogel within
clothes production much more efficiently
the Kistler aerogel jacket also has a
variety of high-tech features the jacket
has a thermochromic logo and a
thermometer the sense external
temperature changes our thickest jacket
includes the recco reflector which helps
pinpoint a person's location in case of
an avalanche attack as an added bonus
some of our Kistler aerogel jackets are
water repellent the Kistler aerogel
jackets are made for skiers snowboarders
commuters and everyone in between no
matter what you do we have a jacket that
fits your lifestyle it's time to kick
last year's winter jacket to the curb
back us now to have the warmest and
thinnest jacket on earth we know that
gaming headsets are getting more and
more complex and expensive choosing one

james donkey wants to make it easier

master a comfy premium and affordable
gaming headset we know sound quality is

master attaches great importance to your
comfort built with lightweight and
comfortable components you may even
forget its existence made out of twenty
two millimeter memory foam and skin
friendly leather the removable soft
earpieces offer long lasting comfort
