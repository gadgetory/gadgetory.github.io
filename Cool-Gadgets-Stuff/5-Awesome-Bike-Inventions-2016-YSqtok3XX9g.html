Reba lights I'm here today to share with
you an idea we've been working on for
the last year the Revo lights Eclipse as
with the original this new version of
Revo lights will provide unprecedented
360-degree visibility with a functional
headlight that allows you to see where
you're going in a smart taillight that
can sense your speed and will flash when
slowing down
we're on IndieGoGo to add the next level
of function into our newest version of
the lights we want to add in the ability
to connect our already smart lights to
your phone to provide a number of
awesome features for starters real time
battery life so you can make sure your
lights are always ready for your next
ride with Eclipse the battery now snaps
directly into the ring making it much
more accessible while removing any need
for cables or parts near the hub and
making installation there snap we want
our lights to work with any riding style
so this new version will include a
feature that recognizes the time of day
and turns the lights on for you if it
senses you're about to ride to achieve
the lighting effect Revo lights
calculate your speed and for the first
time we'll be able to give you this data
so you can accurately track your speed
and distance and work towards riding
goals when developing Revo lights we
focused on creating innovative essential
tools for commuters like handlebar
activated turn signals to make it easier
to grab a drivers attention when turning
we also plan to add features for any
commuter like weather alerts letting you
know ahead of time what to expect and
ensuring you never get caught without
your jacket but with all these added
functions we wanted to make sure your
lights are secure so just like with the
previous version of our lights they are
designed to be locked up along with your
wheels so if you do have to leave your
bike on the street you don't have to
worry about removing them or having them
stolen
strange or what you spend so much time
every year in traffic jams and moan
about it because you're not getting
anything from life but that doesn't help
at all you don't want to get to the
office all sweaty that's for sure you
have no time for exercise because you
waste your life in your car hey your
life is outside not in your car you just
have to reach out and get it leave your
car in the garage because your bike can
be electric
with BIOS if more people had more fun on
bikes and things would be better on the
roads for our environment and for you
too and if more people switch to bikes
the better off we will be
Deimos has the power that you don't have
in the mornings you're a gateway drug
you're strong ally and the slopes and
against headwinds your trainer if you
want a ride up mountains went on the
flats it listens to your heart when
you're training you and your bike become
one
it shows your friends where you went and
if you want you can do something good
for others by describing your roots and
sharing them with your friends by moss
is not heavy not complicated or
expensive how can this all work well
because the Primus is a smart direct
drive the most incredible stuff can be
done with a little intelligence and it
fits almost any bike in a few minutes
it's ready child's play remove crank put
on the battery pack put on by mos
put on the switch ready any other
questions
it goes for the power and the bike needs
to be not on the rear or on the front
wheel but in the middle where it should
be no transmission no gears no gadgets
Oh junk you do not need any machine
noises to get up a mountain and it works
by moss
turns you into a super hero because by
most gives you the feeling that the
power comes from your legs somehow
between a tail wind and a slight
downhill on the mountain but only if
that is what you want without the drive
your bike is your bike you can ride it
like your bike and on the whole it looks
just like your bike you can remove the
battery you can charge it at home your
phone your music your ride they've never
mixed well until now meet the Kouros
link smart cycling helmet the ultimate
audio platform with bone conduction
technology that gets you a wireless
Bloodless precision audio experience as
arrived it's a helmet for cyclists who
want to ride safely and enjoy the
features of their smartphone music calls
communication voice navigation ride data
and more the Kouros links helmet system
includes the Kouros smart helmet smart
remote and smart app all tied together
to your smartphone Kouros bone
conduction technology channels precision
audio to your inner ear this means your
ears are open to your environment for a
safer ride with a click of the Kouros
Smart Remote play and pause music accept
calls adjust your audio controls and
more hey I'm all fair I'll see you in a
couple minutes
current speed 23 miles per hour 2 miles
to destination your hands stay where
they're supposed to be on the bike turn
right to 228 Street
Lengths transforms your ride experience
through the power of wireless bloodless
precision audio connected to your smart
phone yeah that sounds good
cycling is more enjoyable social and
safe the Kouros app takes it one step
further and lets you set routes track
ride data share and compete all of this
integrated in a performance helmet that
is comfortable aerodynamic and cool
imagine the perfect road the feeling of
flying over smooth pavement gliding from
curve to curve unfortunately for most of
us the reality is not so smooth at
redshifts sports we want every road to
feel like the perfect Road which is why
we're so excited to be back here on
Kickstarter to introduce the Shox top
suspension step the shock stop is a
pivoting suspension step that isolates
your body from bumps shocks and road
buzz compared to a regular step the
shock stop dramatically reduces impact
forces on your hands and wrists we
designed the stem from the ground up
specifically for road riding and it's
available in a variety of lengths and
angles with adjustable stiffness so
everyone from performance cyclists to
recreational riders and commuters can
find the perfect fit I love riding my
road bike but it's really stiff and it
tends to transmit every little bump
straight to my hands and arms I use
gloves extra bar tape and I even
upgraded to a carbon-fiber frame but in
reality those changes only added a tiny
amount of cushioning you've probably
felt fatigue numbness or even pain in
your hands after a long ride and usually
it's just annoying but the vibrations
and impacts actually slow you down and
cause a loss of control
and over time they can even lead to
long-term injury the shocks top stem has
an integrated pivot joint with twin
adjustable elastomers that smooth out
the road letting you relax and enjoy the
ride instead of dodging every little
bump and crack you can focus on the road
ahead
every shock your body absorbs actually
slows you down the shop stop lets you
ride faster at the same energy level and
it also reduces fatigue so you feel
fresher at the end of every ride at the
end of the day the shock stop just makes
every part of your ride feel better
installing the shop stop on your bike is
incredibly easy and you can choose from
different stiffness elastomers to get
the precise feel you want we design the
shop stop to be lightweight torsionally
rigid and completely maintenance-free
our pivot design uses the same fully
sealed cartridge bearings that are used
in full suspension mountain bikes and we
chose the highest quality components and
materials to ensure that the shock stop
would stand up to even the roughest
roads let's be honest the suspension
stems of the past were a bit of an
eyesore and they definitely weren't
optimised for a road riding we tuned the
travel feel and aesthetics of the shocks
top to perfectly compliment modern road
bikes and the roads we ride on
hi my name is Morris Ostrow the inventor
of iPhone and this is our third
Kickstarter project the first
Kickstarter project was for my I pump
micro the world's lightest bicycle air
which weighs only 21 grams I was amazed
that within minutes of launching died on
my crew we already had backers and
within 24 hours we already reached up I
was overjoyed and my success and forever
grateful to the Kickstarter community
for giving me this opportunity to turn
my dream into reality
thank you after the release of type of
microbe some hardcore cyclists wrote in
and suggested that I add a small handle
that would facilitate pumping to higher
pressures so I did just that I started
tinkering building prototypes and asked
him all my bicycle friends to try out
the different prototypes until I came up
with I consider that perfect I am twist
and that was my second successful
Kickstarter project now two years after
my first Kickstarter project I have
finally come up with the I comment floor
the world's lightest floor
many backers and friends have suggested
that I invent a floor pump that makes
pumping even easier
the I pump floor is strong smart looking
and user-friendly it is compact enough
to be stored in a bicycle frame and is
very easy to use it has a twist handle
which rotates 90 degrees to facilitate
pumping a very strong high-pressure
polyurethane holes and a default press
the connector a clamp device which is
very easy to use a rubber cap mount at
the bottom of the pump to prevent the
pump from accidentally slipping while
pumping which could result in a broken
air valve or even worse an injury to use
the item floor first simply pull out the
poly with in yellow holes then press the
extending end of the hose into the
OneTouch quick release clamp and screw
the Presta valve connector onto the
press to hair valve and pump to release
the hose from the clamp simply pressed
around one touch quick release button
and pull the hose out of the truck then
simply insert the hose into the pump and
then store the pump under your saddle on
your frame or in your bag
with awesomeness yeah I mean that's very
nice
- manufactured item floor many
cutting-edge technologies are required
carbon pipe forming technology injection
molding CNC machinery rubber press
forming technology string forming
technology ultrasound welding technology
and so on and all the parts are made
right here in Japan
