longboard brands out there focus on
trying to add more features to their
boards there's a lot of them that now
have battery packs their electric their
motorized they have different kinds of
trucks Hiro took the approach of
creating something that's incredibly
simplistic and very authentic
the deck of the here longboard is two
parts it's a deck which is you typically
think of a deck for a longboard and then
it's also a spine the deck is a
composite material it's FRP fiberglass
which is the same material that's used
in skyscrapers it's used to replace I
beams the spine is about 2 inches wide
and a quarter inch thick and it runs the
length of the trucks on the underside of
the board and what it allows us to do is
create an incredibly thin deck while
allowing the board to still be very
rigid one of the other really unique
properties of FRP is it allows the rider
to feel flex not only horizontally and
vertically but also diagonal so it
allows the board to actually twist as
somebody's carving or cutting dining for
something that you don't get with a
typical maple world
each deck is hand-finished
in southern california through a process
that involves a lot of sanding and
shaping everything is hand drilled it's
hand inspected the grip tape is hand
laid the trucks that were using on hero
are 180 millimeter wide reverse kingpin
we put custom urethane bushings in there
so they pop back out of a turn more
quickly than some of the standard
bushings we tested a number of bearings
anywhere from a vector3 de Becque nine
the ones that we ended up going with
we're actually not given a specific ABEC
rating instead they're automotive grade
bearings in a number of tests that we
put the bearings through as far as
coasting distance carving durability
resistance to grit the ones that we went
with ended up outperforming anything
else that we tried by about 20 percent
these ones also have hard plastic ritual
ow to some extent you to go through
gravel and dust and sand without
affecting the performance of the very
took us about nine months to hand select
each component of the hero because we
wanted to make sure that every aspect
met certain criteria in regards to
quality performance
for those of you out there don't know
what a slide Punk is it's basically a
piece of plastic that longboarders
velcro to their gloves in order to
protect their hands will slide the
mission behind our company is simple we
sought out to maximize the potential of
the slide book we recognized a common
problem between long borders the task of
having to carry around these schedules
of them we solve this problem
by combining the simple slide book and
escape tool we looked at this piece of
equipment and we asked ourselves how can
you make this the ultimate slide book
well the first thing we did is we
embedded a steel socket in the center to
fit the kingpin nut on your longboard so
you never have to use a skate tool to
adjust your trucks ever again the second
most important thing is that the puck is
made of UHMW polyethylene now this
plastic is self lubricating so it always
creates a layer of oil between itself
and the pavement so that it will
actually out wear steel and it'll out
where every other plastic on the market
also the edges of our puck are highly
beveled all the way down to the base so
that as your Punk shaves down you'll
still have an angle to protect the puck
from catching on cracks in the pavement
and being ripped off your hand
finally our industrial-strength velcro
is glued on by hand with an incredibly
strong resin adhesive instead of the
sticky back velcro that other slide box
uses I always find in a problem with em
to carry around my two legs
skate but with these new pugs makes it
easy going his tables my mom what's up
guys it's Pablo from a drowning that's
Gage and about the Meraki
scheduled sidewalk I think it's a very
unique idea I think everybody's going to
love it you're gonna love it just
because it's it's something that were
always asking everybody for in schedule
nobody's got one you can have everything
your own my pocket I think it's awesome
yes like Redondo
you
hi Kickstarter our story is simple we
had a dream apply state of art yacht and
car racing technology to performance
longboard and skates our goal was to
make a revolutionary lifetime board with
totally innovative technologies style
and features with real advantages for
borders and trust us we did it and now
the reasons why are into our boards our
top performers
it's easy to carry with you because the
urban version is about 25% lighter than
over boards take our longboard in your
hands it's 1.6 kilograms
compared to the 2 kilograms that other
37 inch boards weigh our end to our
boards are built to be indestructible
with a long-term resistance that is 5%
better than that of VTR and 70% better
than wood all details are made to
guarantee the perfection and an
extremely low use consumption with an
impressive shock resistance this board
is built for life and doesn't suffer
impact therefore the board comes with a
three-year warranty outperforming the
whole market and at an incredible
discounted price just for you the AB
core give us free substantial
improvements when compared to all
monolithic materials used until today on
boards best flexural rigidity existing
on the market less weight and top
sturdiness our technology gives to you a
unique personality and style that
everybody can immediately identify so
enjoyed in the city with our urban
version and in the extreme downhill with
our rock th version now it's your turn
to sustain us thanks
hi I'm Ross I'm Cody and I'm rod and we
started a project called concrete native
and we've created a backpack
specifically designed to carry long
boards so four years ago my brother and
I refused around our local campus got to
the bomb of bombing a hill walking back
up like man it's great to have a
longboard backpack drop back home search
the web couldn't find anything so we
decided why not let's make our own with
this bag idea in place we went home and
we cut two backs completely apart and
put them back together
we knew that one works over the past
three years we've worked with companies
in California and in Oregon and we
finally found a prototyping bag that
we're comfortable with all the features
so to go over some of the key features
of the bag first and foremost is the
strap system we created a strap system
specifically designed to carry a
longboard once we did this we actually
realized it holds a regular skateboard
and a snowboard better than any other
bag on the market on top of that we've
added two straps at the base of the bag
that hook around your bottom trucks any
longboard longer than 40 inches this is
going to help stabilize your board on
the bag all the straps in this bag are
hideaway so if you're not carrying the
board you can hide them and your bag
just looks like a typical backpack we
also added an abrasion resistant
material at the front of the bag so your
grip tape doesn't scratch your bag up on
top of that this bag has everything
feature you'd expect from a quality
backpack
we have pockets to hold your phone iPod
skate tool and anything else has a
fleece line sunglass pocket water bottle
pocket we've added a laptop sleeve a
padded back
ergonomic back straps and we have a
sternum strap so what we need from you
guys is your support all the one you
give us is going straight to the
manufacturer to backpack donate get some
cool stuff and let's get spotted for the
people suburbs
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
