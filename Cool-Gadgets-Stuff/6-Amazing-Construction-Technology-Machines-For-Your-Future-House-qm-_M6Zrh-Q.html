concrete more than 2,000 years ago the
Pantheon is the best preserved ancient
Roman monument built in 120 ad doing the
longevity of concrete construction from
the past
building construction today with juda-as
insulated concrete forms ICF's means
faster installation times maximum safety
from natural disasters including
hurricanes and tornadoes a four-hour
fire protection rating you're building
is being built to last and retain its
value new Jura along with its
manufacturing partner polyform a leader
in design and manufacturing of ICF since
1963
is the largest provider of ICF's in
North America new juror is a proud
primary and founding member of the
insulated concrete forms Manufacturers
Association ICF ma the ICF ma
commissioned club laboratories to do a
study comparing a traditional insulated
wood frame cavity wall to an insulating
concrete form ICF wall the results of
the comparative study provided a 58
percent better r-value RSI than the
tested two by six wood wall assembly the
ICF wall generated up to 60% better
energy savings why would you design or
build with anything else but new dura
insulated concrete forms new dura
insulated concrete forms provide design
professionals architects contractors and
building owners the freedom and
versatility to design and build
sustainable and cost-effective
structures nuder ICF's provide
multi-dimensional design factors to help
build structures as they were envisioned
one new dura standard form gives you 12
square feet of reinforced insulated wall
area that snaps together like Lego and
is ready for interior and exterior
finishes
near duro products comply with
evaluation guidelines across North
American British and European building
codes and standards with new dura you
can maximize the energy efficiency of
your building achieve greater comfort
and sound resistance provide greater
safety for occupants provide better
indoor air quality and neuter ICF's are
proven to be mold and mildew resistant
new dura ICF's give you the opportunity
to build faster and more efficiently
build an eco-friendly structure with
substantial benefits that contribute to
long-term energy savings learn from the
past build based on sustainable
construction proven to be safer and more
energy efficient filled with new dura
insulated concrete forms
so our system is called Sam for
semi-automated Mason and it's been
developed by our company construction
robotics the Sam system is working
alongside Mason's helping them install
brick it can handle a wide variety of
bricks that are used out there in
construction primarily for veneer
commercial construction in most your
institutions or schools it's really
designed to help your commercial masonry
contractors increase their productivity
and and help reduce some of the heavy
lifting from the Mason the Mason still
works alongside Sam's they're still
responsible for setting Sam up they're
still responsible for striking the
joints and ensuring the best wall
quality and using some of the knowledge
and the skills that they have but they
don't have to have the physical demand
on their body that they might previously
that can help even some of the older
Mason's work alongside Sam and not have
to lift in place every brick and we're
successful here and we can bring
robotics and automation in the industry
if we can help construction as a whole
be more successful that's really going
to ultimately help the US economy and
even help jobs in the US we can help
provide a very interesting dynamic
aspect of the construction process where
you're using robotics and construction
at the same time and you can really help
attract young talent into the industry
Construction is expensive time-consuming
and tedious at my IB we redefine
reinvent and simplify construction with
interlocking brick building system first
we eliminate costly and time-consuming
plaster works by using fair faced bricks
in various designs the traditional way
of brick laying is slow tedious and
costly so we reinvent the brick laying
concept by using interlocking bricks
which require no mortar in between the
layers the process is unbelievably fast
just dry stack the bricks pour in
inexpensive mortar and add Steel's
vertically to reinforce the walls
conventional column and beam
construction are complicated
with our system you can construct column
and beams of any size without using
conventional formwork forget bricklaying
it is now brick stacking our
interlocking bricks come in various
designs offering you timeless and
beautiful finishes mathematics don't lie
our system requires no plaster works
minor Barban works less cement fewer
workers and even less time to build
resulting in lower cost by eliminating
all the time consuming processes your
projects can be completed faster did we
also mention that high compacted bricks
results in higher density which
translates into higher thermal mass just
walk into a house built with our system
and you will feel cool as you're within
unplastered clay brick walls tests have
shown that by using these interlocking
bricks you will have a cooler interior
there's no need to switch on the
air-conditioner or you might not even
need to install one resulting in less
energy consumption and of course more
cost savings a layman or unskilled
worker may find it difficult learning
the conventional way of construction
while a seasoned construction worker may
have a tough time learning to
unconventional building system with my
IB system anyone can construct without
the help of an expert
instead of inventing a new
unconventional building system we just
simplify the brick and mortar concept
it's as simple as playing this game</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
