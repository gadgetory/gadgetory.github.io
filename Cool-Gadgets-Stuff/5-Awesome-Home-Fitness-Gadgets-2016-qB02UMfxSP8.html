meet stealth the world's first dynamic
core trainer powered by game-playing
technology simply follow the stealth
gaming app and feel all your muscles
working together to build the strongest
view possible
it's called gaming your core firing up
all 29 of your core muscles to guide and
execute movements for gameplay leaving
you feeling energized and accomplished
tilt right tilt left twist hit your
target the excitement builds each and
every second the more you score the
stronger you get the better you feel
it's easy to get started using stealth
simply download the stealth gaming app
on your smartphone place it inside spell
choose your game get into the plank
position
and start gaming your core your core
muscles act as a joystick for playing
the game compete with anyone anywhere
using stealth multiplayer function
challenging and motivational all-in-one
stealth your way to great looking abs
and a strong healthy back another three
minutes a day I'm Howie inventor of
stealth I've been a professional trainer
and fitness enthusiast my whole life but
a year ago I was at the gym staring down
at my phone doing the plank exercise and
I was so bored that's when I had my idea
imagine being able to use my core to
play games while I exercise the next day
I called my buddy Don Brown I call him
the king of all ABS he developed the ab
roller sold in millions of homes I knew
that he could take my idea and bring it
to reality I've been designing fitness
products for over 30 years when how he
shared his idea for stealth I was all-in
I love the concept of using your core
muscles to play games on your phone now
that's exciting now we needed to prove
the concept so I made a few sketches we
created a prototype to try it it worked
perfectly we went through dozens of
designs and testing until we finalized
stealth we shared our prototype with
real users to hear their feedback you
know as a trainer especially a trainer
to celebrities I'm the Gateway to those
people I always look all over
the place for the newest products and
innovations to give my clients the edge
well a three-minute ab workout per day
can really engage your core
everything radiates from the center so
if we make the center of your body all
of those 29 muscles stronger everything
else has a much better base to sort of
come out of it's a great great solution
I'm really into video games so the fact
that I'm working my core but at the same
time I'm playing a video game you
completely forget about the whole
feeling of working out because you're
focusing on the game I'm really
competitive so being able to compete
against other people when on it is so
fun clients are extremely boring this
stealth machine just makes you want to
do them because it's it's fun I think
that's the best part about it is that
you get a great workout you're working a
lot of different muscle groups but
you're also having fun
Oh tonics it's ultimate workout gear hey
sorry about that
we're tone ik's and we're not saying
that we're the ultimate gear because we
know that the ultimate gear is you what
we are as the best year to improve and
enhance the workout that you do tone
aches is a full body resistance gear
made out of two bands that strap on your
back and you can control their intensity
you won't it can help you get there but
this guy probably worked his entire life
to get these abs let's say you're doing
a run you work on your quads your
hamstrings and your hips for tone X
you'll also add upper body toning and
strengthen your core muscles that will
help with your posture and divide your
body's mass all over your body not just
your feet and knees and that prevents
injuries and if you prefer walking well
it's basically the same as running with
toe necks you don't need to change your
workout routine or make crazy moves
whatever your favorite workout is tonics
will intensify your muscle use due to
its design tonics allows for the pump to
stay open so you can use it with any
sports you get a better more
comprehensive workout strengthen your
muscles and burn more calories you don't
have to say these things once taking off
the back tonics becomes an easy to use
portable gym its bands are adjustable so
you can control its intensity and there
are tons of ways to use it there's even
an app to suggest workouts for you and
once you're done
tone X folds away into a very compact
package this is the design team behind
tone X this is hen he's the inventor of
tone X physical therapist and a personal
trainer you can be sure tone X is made
with special care for your body's
well-being this is the design team they
worked on the design for two years to
ensure the tone X is durable and
comfortable 95% of the people who try
tell necks said that not only do they
love it but they will also recommend it
to a friend and he will recommend it to
a friend and he will and so on
to bring tonics to life we need your
help if you're interested in making the
ultimate you support us tonics is
incredible yeah we can agree in that
we can measure a lot with breath
specifically we can measure the amount
of carbon dioxide you breathe out and
the amount of oxygen you breathe in if
we take a ratio of those two numbers we
get what's called our ER and our er can
give us basically how much carbohydrates
versus fat you're burning you can see
when we run a test in the lab person
exercising longer and longer they're
going to be very more carbohydrates
the duration of exercise at a certain
intensity dramatically changes their
body's metabolism for 24 hours with the
band on your wrist you use breath for
five minutes once a month while you take
a walk after five minutes of analysis
the app shows you how you bought fat in
those five minutes how much you could
burn in 24 hours in your capacity to
lose weight this month other fitness
trackers based on heart rate zone
training and create you to workout at
low intensity for a prolonged period of
time and make assumptions for your fat
or sugar bird instead path precisely
measures how you burn fat for your
breath and knows when you stall 45 over
time Pat learns how your exercise
changes of fat and sugar run throughout
the day and starts recommending the
minimum minutes of exercise you need
every day to achieve your goal challenge
or how do you determine someone's 24
hours metabolism with only 2 minutes of
great analysis so we collected personal
break data of almost 300 individuals in
the lab not just during the exercise but
also after they eat and why they steamed
it months of testing we use this data to
payment based on machine learning
algorithms which now can predict your
metabolism with 90 to 95% endless path
measures our oxygen and co2 levels
during each stage to measure your
metabolism to the minute which is
equivalent to a wheel to some max sense
according to several research studies
half of the fitness tracker users end of
abandoning their devices but ours is
different it's the most personal and the
Terr support we could help everybody
reach its true potential Thank You
Kickstarter
