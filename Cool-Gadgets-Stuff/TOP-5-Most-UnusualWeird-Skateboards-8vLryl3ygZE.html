experience of riding we combine the
motion sensing technology from a
smartphone the motor and battery
technology like you find in a Tesla
create a self-balancing electric
skateboard controlled simply by leaning
your body we started with a dream of a
hoverboard the smooth feeling of flying
over pavement inspired by this vision in
the future we created an incredible ride
that feels like a natural extension of
your balance one wheel is designed to be
intuitive whether you're a pro or never
been on a board you can learn the basics
and under a minute and there's plenty of
room to challenge yourself by riding
more aggressively or inventing new
tricks there are no hand controls you
just lean toward your front foot to go
faster and your back foot to slow down
or even reverse regenerative braking
kicks in as you come to a stop at the
heart of one wheel is a state-of-the-art
direct drive brushless motor in the hub
of the loom
movement and balance are achieved by a
custom controller the Reed zero and
accelerometer sensors thousands times of
seconds the high-speed charger gives a
lithium batteries meant for minister
we made one wheel unusable and dynamic
experience and unlike skateboarding
where you feel every little crack and
pebble in the street one wheel feels a
lot more like surfing or snowboarding a
large tire and carefully tuned
algorithms allow you to carve the
pavement as if it were water or fresh
powder I remember as a kid watching back
to the future and just dreamy what it'd
be like to be on a board floating above
the street every time I want a one wheel
I think about that it feels like just
flying down the road it's this wonderful
feeling of just stepping on this thing
and thinking about where you want to go
and you're off you lean very much like
you do on a snowboard you just kind of
lean into the turns you want to go on
and one wheel just kind of carves for
you it's a pretty magical experience
it's like taking that mountain laying it
up flat every street becomes like a
fresh powder run
it's time to take skateboarding off road
who needs a smooth sidewalk when you
have the rock or descender the first
all-terrain skateboard and we mean all
terrains grass gravel concrete wooden
pads no matter where you want to go the
rock board descender will chew him up
and spit him out
it's a skateboard dipped in awesome
toughest nails treads that grip about
any downhill surface durable
construction that can easily survive any
season wet dry hot cold this bad boy can
handle it all it's the next level in
skateboarding the rock board descender
the rock board descender all-terrain
technology for old-fashioned outdoor fun
steering just like a traditional
skateboard only now you can go anywhere
the heavy rollers and tank treads easily
move from grass to concrete to dirt and
all you have to do is skate
Oh
Oh
yeah
you
you are breaking
you
the plugboard driven by the patent Ajit
car system or TCS allows you the car 45
degree turns giving the same motion as a
surfboard wakeboarder snowboard on
concrete so if there are no waves out no
snow not a boat or lake nearby
all you need is a floor board and some
paved concrete to take advantage with a
thrill of all those sports and one no
other board offers so much variety the
floorboard is becoming known as the
board for all board riders here's what
the press is saying about the flow board
you act now you'll also receive a free
25 minutes action pack dean hundred-50
390 432 the plate roll order or log on
to flow laughs calm
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
