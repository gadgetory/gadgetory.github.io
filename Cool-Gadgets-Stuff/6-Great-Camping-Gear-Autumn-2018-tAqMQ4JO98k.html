red founder of CR Madre and we've
created a phenomenal product that we
know you're gonna love we've all been
there right just trying to get out and
connect with nature but never really
getting any sleep we wake up feeling
like a caveman when we sleep on the
ground for like a banana when we sleep
in a hammock about six months ago we
decided to create the flattest laying
camping hammock we wanted to be able to
lay on our back our side or even our
stomach comfortably suspended in the air
so we created over 25 designs in search
of the flattest lay then we sent them
out to our customers all over the world
to get feedback the results have been
incredible and as a community we've been
able to dial in the world's flattest
lane symmetrical camping hammock meet
the 9 ox hammock it's the next evolution
of air camp nine oxes the flat lay
hammock that allows you to sleep however
you want and wherever you want with
supreme comfort to create this ultra
flat lay we started with the pattern of
the hammock body rather than sewing up a
rectangular piece of fabric like
everyone else we invented and perfected
a wave shaped pattern that naturally
creates a space for your head and your
feet so you actually lay flat laying
flat is just the beginning to further
increase the nine oxes comfort we
develop a new fabric known as Teflon 3
it feels silky smooth and cradles you
with cloud-like softness it's 20%
lighter than our original Teslin fabric
yet it's incredibly strong
in fact we tested it just to make sure
that's over 1,500 pounds
next we added a spacious insect shield
to protect you from insects the
symmetric pilots at each corner give you
the room to spread out and the freedom
to lay in any direction it's also
removable so you can enjoy that
panoramic view we've taken the
complexity out of panic Canyon and made
the 9 ox knotless and incredibly easy it
sets up in seconds and the entire
hammock weighs less than 22 ounces
here's what other people are saying
about the 9 ox thumbs up it's the
flattest lay I've ever had in hammock
and this is comfortable
I could sleep this way every night delay
in this thing is absolutely amazing
great there's no bug net in my face I
can definitely get a very flat leg on my
back it's flat on my side it's flat on
my belly I don't know how they do it
definitely the flattest lay I have ever
had I'm laying flat I could sleep in
this to complete this system we created
a waterproof rain fly and a gear stash
specifically for the 9 ox they're super
lightweight and completely knotless
which means easy and fast to set up so
be sure to scroll down below to find out
about them and our new smart storage sex
you

redesign a classic outdoor wearable and

ultra-thin 330 lumen USB rechargeable
headlamp featuring 3d slim fit
construction that makes your hands-free
light wildly capable and so comfortable

the 3d slim fit construction is based on
three dimensions of a perfect fit
a flush front better balance and smart
fabrics seamlessly integrated housing
merges the electronics directly into the
band creating an ultra-thin front that
sits flush on your forehead with no
bouncing by reorienting the battery to
the back we keep the weight off the
front of your face reducing slippage and
creating a more natural fit and the
entire headlamp features moisture
wicking fabric that keeps you cool and
dry during activity clocking in at only
69 grams the headlamp features four
modes and the ability to control your
light through easy dim ability

disruption with easy recharging via
