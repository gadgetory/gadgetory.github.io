doctor neuroscientist and co-founder of
Morris I love helping people improve
their lives and I'm super passionate
about weight loss
I've been over we in the past and I know
how difficult it is to lose weight I
also know how difficult it is to keep
that we at loss going and Laureus we
believe this is much more than just diet
and exercise the source of your weight
loss problem lies deep within your brain
my co-founder is dr. Paul McGill and a
few years ago he made an amazing
discovery our brains have what's called
a set point that controls how much body
fat we have this varies from person to
person which is why two people can eat
the same and one will gain weight while
the other one we found a way to turn the
setpoint down and the implications of
this are profound a few years ago I
realized that there was a connection
between stimulation of the vestibular
nerve just behind your ear and weight
loss I was working in neurosurgery with
Jason at the time and knew of his
interest in electronics as a hobby from
the very beginning I've been using and
developing the moodiest prototypes on
myself within just one year my body fat
had almost halved and now almost one
year later I still haven't regained any
fat this technology has amazing
potential and we're inviting you to join
us at the more dias community we want
you to be the first group of people who
take part in the next generation of
weight loss mo Dias is really simple to
use just place it on your head attach
the sticky pads behind your ears
turn the headset on and then control it
using the app simple
use Moe Deus for just 45 minutes per
session and that's it
and the results well the technology was
tasted in overweight volunteers they
didn't change their diet or lifestyle
and received up to three hours of
stimulation a week after four months we
found that all of the volunteers that
lost body fat in one case as much as 16
percent statistically these results were
very significant also moodiest caused a
fall and appetite and a shift of the
metabolism towards burning fat we're
delighted by these initial results and
actually can't wait to see a effect of
moodiest will be when combined with some
lifestyle changes
you parked your car somewhere you feel
really uneasy about but you really need
to make it to that meeting with a client
where's your car
is it on 6 Street could it be 7th or
maybe you didn't see that sign yeah that
sign there's a lot of unexpected things
that can happen to you in your vehicle
so don't you wish there was a way to
record 24/7 and be alerted when an
incident occurs
Whalen's introduces the secure 360 a
camera that can monitor and record a
full 360 degree field of view so you
know what's happening in and around your
vehicle no matter where you are when the
camera sensors detect motion impact or
even a change in GPS coordinates secure
360 will immediately notify you through
the mobile app and simultaneously record
video to the cloud so here's how it
works the camera system actively scans
the perimeter of your vehicle using a
suite of advanced low-power sensors
we've combined radar a three axis
accelerometer as well as three axis gyro
for weeks of non-stop event detection
without draining your car battery the
secure 360 is designed for any vehicle
and every driver from the daily commuter
to rideshare services or families with
young drivers you can locate your car
quickly for the GPS map check in with an
elderly driver protect your driving
record
or catch a thief in the act so even if
this happens you'll have evidence to
provide authorities and your insurance
company we pack we travel we unpack and
pack and unpack and search and then
repack and unpack the whole process is
irritating and time-consuming that's why
we set out to reinvent the carry-on
suitcase to disrupt this ridiculous
process for you the frequent traveler
introducing the Rubel carry-on our
patent pending system allows you to take
your clothes on their hangers directly
from your closet and place them into the
Rubel carry-on once you've arrived at
your destination
simply hang up and unzip the suitcase
extend the mechanism and that's it your
unpacked no unfolding no organizing no
fuss as an added feature we've designed
the Rubel carry-on with a shelf for you
to keep your personal items together and
off unsanitary surfaces while designed
to hang within a closet the Rubel
carry-on can also hang on the back of a
door on a hook or can lay out flat
giving you easy access to your things
wherever you are our carry-on also has
easy access pockets we've integrated a
removable toiletry and liquids bag at
the top of the suitcase for easy access
making your trip through security or
unplanned stops a breeze then you have
your standard pockets which are perfect
for your laptop tablet and travel
documents internally we've included
removable pockets to store your socks
under clothes and accessories there's a
separate sleep for shoes and mesh
pockets for additional storage stop
packing and unpacking Rubel
imagine if you could see electricity as
it flowed through your home like a
superhero with x-ray vision you'd see
the energy used to cool your rooms cook
your food and light your home and when
it was being wasted rather than used
wisely you'd know right away we decided
you shouldn't need superpowers to see
where your energy goes so we created
glow glow is like a fitness tracker for
your home it gives you and everyone in
your home a sixth sense for how you use
energy so you can make smart decisions
that benefit your bank account and help
the environment glow analyzes your
home's energy usage to understand how
and when you use energy if you're using
more than normal
glow turns amber than red when you're
saving money it glows green and when you
have the extended high usage like if
someone accidentally left the coffeepot
on or the fridge door open Glo sends you
a helpful notification Glo also helps
you avoid nasty surprises on your
utility bill by forecasting your
electricity cost just tell Glo how much
you want to pay for electricity each
month and the app will help you stay on
track
getting started with Glo is as simple as
plugging it in and placing our
patent-pending inductive sensor on your
meter using magneto resistive sensing
and advanced algorithms Glo can measure
and understand your home's energy usage
without the need for professional
installation or dangerous modifications
to your home's wiring we may not all
have superpowers but with Glo we can
make a difference right here in our own
home
you
building your own robot to explore the
world is now finally something you can
do
meet crazy pot the first choice maker
board designed not just for professional
robot makers but for everyone the crazy
pike kit includes a main board robotic
shield board media board and accessories
which including chassis gimbal battery
and core sensors the latter are
connected magnetically so you can easily
put them together and start building
robots built by crazy pipe can do many
cool things after connecting Wi-Fi by
Sanjiv
via our p2m service you can activate
real-time video audio streaming and
remotely control it to take care of your
pets plants and kids or do something
romantic
connected to you arm then played chess
with your friend oversea with a fork a
lead our Slam function enables you to
draw map and navigate in new
environments with just one touch using
4G module and SIM cards you can also
control it to go outdoors and no need to
worry about the complicated road
surfaces all of these features are
possible because of our p2m cloud
service and crazy Pi with a quad-core
processor the crazy PI operates our OS
and Linux which are pre-installed and
open source to make building robots of
breeze customize your own robot through
our OS coding connect it with the media
board and turn it into a Linux mini PC
that you can put in your pocket you can
surf code and play games with it other
than that we offer a robotic shield
board that is compatible with Raspberry
Pi and also turn it into a robot that
can do slam and real-time video audio
streaming we believe that everybody is a
great maker crazy pi is your first
choice when it comes to starting your
dream crazy to imagine crazy to make</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
