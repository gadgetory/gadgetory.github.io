and you could only have one night for
the rest of your life which night would
you choose
so founder of ultimate survival tips I
could ask that question all the time
over the years I've tested and reviewed
hundreds of knives but I never found
that one night I could do everything I
wanted so on early 2014 I started
sketching integrating elements from
blades I loved along with features that
had never been seen before in one knife
like a micro survival kit in a handle a
two-in-one switchable nylon and Kydex
sheath that's packed with features and a
rugged knife built for tough jobs with
the finesse of a fine carving tool it's
called the MS k1 multi scenario knife to
build a knife like this I knew I needed
help so I teamed up with knife legend
Jeff Freeman the award-winning designer
many iconic gerber knives like the oh
six Auto the LMF 2 survival knife we
tossed around some ideas and you know he
sent me some sketches for things that he
wanted you know and we just developed it
from there we said ok well let's let's
make a product together and so he was
able to tell me the things as a product
designer did this product should do and
I was able to come up with solutions
present them to him and he could test
him in a real-world scenario
every msk one is fashioned from a single
piece of quarter-inch full-tang steel
that runs from piercing tip to rock
crushing but making it one of the
thickest most durable blades you can buy
for the msk one we chose american-made
black oxide coated d2 semi's stainless
high carbon steel because it's
ridiculously tough extremely wear
resistant holds a razor-sharp edge the
center-aligned clip point is exceptional
for piercing detailed tip carving or
precision drilling when I conceptualize
the msk one one of my major goals was to
create a knife combine the power of a
full sized chopper with a finesse and
fine cutting ability found mostly in
smaller blades we accomplished this by
raising the blade spine which
effectively shifts the center of gravity
forward just enough to make the msk 1 an
incredible chopper while the jump thumb
ramp increases knife control and directs
thumb pressure toward the edge making
every cut precise and efficient for more
intricate cutting and carving tasks the
oversized Choi allows you to safely grip
the knife fraction of an inch from the
blade for incredible control for
handling comfort and grip Jeff started
with advanced economics software to
ensure that the MS k1 handle was shaped
to perfectly fit the human hand
we chose canvas micarta handle slabs
because of their durability natural feel
shock absorption and comfort and cold
and wet environments front and rear
guards keep your hand in place while
cutting chopping pounding smashing or
breaking things using the MS k1 stout
butt end pummel mark was this fire
symbol our curved pummel and fire steel
striker gives you maximum leverage and
the ability to generate an aim more
sparks at your tinder than a straight
edge for quicker more efficient fire
starting for primitive fire generation
we've developed the first ever Center
balanced stainless steel bow drill divot
it transforms your knife into a solid
low resistance hands
that's reversible for right and
left-handed users with the handle slabs
removed three strategically placed
lanyard holes make it easy to add your
favorite paracord wrap or lash the msk
one to a branch to make a spear I
remember when I was a kid and I got my
first survival knife with a hollow
handle and a survival kit inside I felt
like Rambo even though the knife was
terrible in the survival kit mostly a
gimmick so my goal was to develop the
first truly useful handle survival kit
including hard to improvised items that
could actually help you stay alive in a
survival situation to do this I worked
with the team at was ooh survival gear
to develop a micro survival kit for the
msk one that includes items for fire
starting water collection and
purification fishing traps and snares
navigation repairing gear and first-aid
the best survival kit is the one you
wouldn't think of entering to the
untamed world without its small compact
easy to use and multifunctional it can
be taken anywhere knowing what this
ultra portable tool kit provides creates
peace of mind
remember the MS 5 is the easiest
survival toolkit to carry and one you'll
never want to leave behind
the motion raid ms5 lets you blend in
with nature and take advantage of all
its beauty it comes with a world class
water purifier explore the entire jungle
without losing your sense of direction
with the rugged military-style compass
that efficiently puts you right on track
survival requires the right set of tools
and skills
with its easy-fit blades magnesium fire
starter boring grill and flashlight the
ms5 has you covered
precision and perfection are easily
blended using premium materials we have
forged life-saving tools creating a
strong yet stylish product we go above
and beyond the contemporary to integrate
more usefulness in every product the ms5
has what you need to survive a USB
charger
SOS GPS tracker a micro burner fishing
tackle plus many more essentials
once in a blue moon
something comes along that works so damn
well that you don't need to fuss over
appearances it reminds us that above all
else we just want something useful
Jason freed said you need to get the
fundamentals right fun wears off cool
wears off useful never wears off
you
you
you
when we're rolling down the highway of
our lives what is it we want people to
see a rebel a trendsetter a man of
wealth and taste there's a funny old
saying from Mark Twain that goes clothes
make the man naked people have little or
no influence in society
but sometimes designers come along who
are the rebels they remind us that above
all else we just want something that can
be used
the world is getting smaller and more of
us are traveling to distant and remote
places when we travel one of our biggest
challenges is how to guarantee that the
water we are drinking is safe
there are currently dozens of personal
water filters and filter bottles on the
market that claim to solve this issue
the problem is that water filters only
trap bacteria insists that then remain
in the filter and continue to live and
multiply this can add up to a major
health concern in addition water filters
do not eliminate or even trap waterborne
viruses that are really the biggest
concern of all to be truly protected
from bacteria and viruses water must be
purified not just filter meat pure to go
the most advanced unique and
multifunctional true water purifier in
the world computer go kills bacteria and
viruses instantly on contact and on
demand while also completely eliminating
waterborne cysts such as crypto and
Giardia there is absolutely no waiting
time or preparation required as
contaminated water passes through peer
to go it is purified instantly without
the holding timer procedures other true
water purifiers require
here to go can be used by one person or
multiple users with cleanable and
replaceable insert cartridges it can be
used over and over again for many years
and more importantly it can be stored
for long periods without the same danger
posed by filters how do we come up with
this design over nearly half a century
water one has provided ultra pure water
to Science and Industry and premium
bottled drinking water to customers
throughout the world an industry
innovator we developed a proprietary
water purification mediafire robach that
kills bacteria and viruses on contact
and on demand so why is this different
peer to Go's insert cartridges provide
three tiers of filtration and
purification with a flow rate of up to
16 ounces per minute contaminated water
undergoes three separate filtration and
purification steps ensuring the water is
completely safe to drink with no danger
from any pathogens
including viruses the period ago comes
in two convenient packages first the
period ago travelers kit it fits in a
small travel pouch that takes up minimal
space in any suitcase or backpack inside
comes a 27 ounce collapsible water
bottle that screws directly into the
pier to go the second package option is
the pier to go kit like the travelers
kit it includes a collapsible water
bottle and a purifying filter but also a
lot more the go kit also contains a 2
litre gravity feed water bag a hand pump
suitable for water or air and lots of
other accessories for incredible
versatility Perrigo can even adapt
inline with hydration backpacks
hey guys it's Mike from outdoor element
and we love some carabiners they come in
a variety of shapes and sizes that third
hand that you can rely on and they've
been around for a while they've evolved
over the years as the adventure type we
wanted to develop an everyday beater
that can help you out when things get
crazy
Palmer we're slowly introducing the fire
bener understanding that fire creation
is crucial in times of emergency we've
introduced our ever spark technology to
the beaner
sometimes all you need is a spark to
totally change the situation designed to
be titanium coated stainless steel and
at one ounce this should be part of
everyone's everyday carry
we integrated a blade for those ad hoc
moments paracord fishing line
perhaps a seat belt and of course a
bottle opener for those moments of
celebration
so go on slap under keychain or put on
your pack and always be prepared and all
the features of the fighter beater come
in handy day in and day out
so get those grills and stoves lit clean
up those loose ends and get the backyard
