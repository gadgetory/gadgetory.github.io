first bike lights running on magnetic
energy today real light is mounted on
one out of three of all bikes in the
Danish cities and worldwide sales has
reached more than 10 million sets of
magnetic bike lights magnetic energy
means no battery which means that the
light is always on and this daytime
running light feature is what yields the
large is safety effect research based on
a large-scale test showed reductions in
accidents up to 19 percent now real
light introduces the next generation of
this life-saving magnetic bike light
relight co Mouse on your bike in seconds
with a new patent-pending mounting
system remount the light can be mounted
in any vertical position on the stage
and you can easily move it to another
bike the magnet on the spoke has become
smaller and more powerful most
importantly the light platform has been
upgraded to provide high light intensity
and good side visibility while the
repower technology keeps you safe even
at a standstill get the CEO by backing
our Kickstarter campaign and help us
increase the safety for vulnerable road
users
movement this is where it all begins
waves of air particles moving in various
speeds
they are called sound waves and we have
found a way to reproduce them better
than ever before
we are Mora a team of scientists
engineers and entrepreneurs with a
shared passion for high fidelity audio
and we have developed a new material
that will change the loudspeaker as you
know it
first let's go back to some of the bases
a sound signal travels through a voice
coil vibrates a thin membrane called the
cone and voila music to your ears the
quality of sound all depends on this
little got the cone and this is the
actual part of the speaker that's
responsible for converting mechanical
motion into sound and it needs to be as
light as possible most lightweight
materials will bend in vibrate in ways
that are not intended by the music to
create an ultra fidelity experience we
needed a super light material that's
stronger than anything we know graphene
is a new material isolated in 2004 it
has been dubbed the Wonder material
review a 100 layer of pure carbon where
the atoms are bonded together to form a
perfect wiggle motion and it is the
thinnest material possible and 200 times
stronger than steel basically the
ultimate material for a speaker cone now
we just had to prove it first we had to
come up with an industrial process to
form graphene into cones and we needed
to acoustically optimize the material
for use in loudspeakers that's how the
team came up with graphene cue our
proprietary nano composite formulation
which is 95% graphene by weight by the
way we noticed one of the smoothest
frequency response curves ever recorded
for a headphone driver and an impressive
reduction in power consumption this was
our answer to the perfect loud speaker
membrane it was now time to turn our
proof of concept into the ORA graphene
cue headphones we worked with product
designers engineers through many
iterations to make sure we weren't
compromising on anything we wanted them
to be practical for everyday use with an
intuitive user experience so you could
have incredible sound quality on the go
we incorporated a gesture control
trackpad on the right cup so you can
control your music without taking your
phone out there's wireless Bluetooth
connectivity but we also made sure you
have the option of using them wired so
you can always enjoy the best possible
audio experience
dear uncle remember when my friends and
I we had an idea to create the world's
first smart suitcase remember that we
went to you to borrow some money and you
said drop it
this is what just watch you
kick you morons
well dear uncle a few things happen
since then we gathered our friends and
family we made a video we went to the
internet and we launched a crowdfunding
campaign we had 10,000 people ordering
the product 10,000 travelling so we
moved to Hong Kong you got bigger and we
slept in factories until we shipped the
product then everyone received their new
bags they traveled everywhere and they
told their friends and things went crazy
here's the fastest man alive here
Shaquille O'Neal Tony Hawk Katy Neethu
even the Pope got one we got tons of
feedback we listened to everyone and I
mean everyone even got laid with the
bags
we took notes of everything we kept
learning improving designing and
executing to change the game again so
thank you uncle you pushed us to do
better and here is better
meet theory - not one but for fraud
check cabin laptop bag and passport
pouch all connected to our new app
enabling global location tracking super
charging capability digital Auto locking
system smart weight sensors powered by
our next-generation technology to
transform the way you travel the new
cabin now 25% bigger inside charge with
all your devices including laptops and
the new check features for smart weight
sensors that think with your airline and
prevent you from paying baggage be both
suitcases locked automatically when you
move away and you can track their
location any way the laptop bag charges
all your devices as you move notify you
if you leave it behind
it's TSA friendly expandable and has
every single pocket a traveler needs and
the new passport hub also connect to the
app making your passport impossible to
forget built with high quality
water-resistant material the best
protector for all of your essentials
this is what smart travel looks like all
products working together as a system to
assist you along the journey this is
blue smart theory to
this is Rob at first glance he is just a
regular man but that's only at first
glance in reality he had super abilities
because he has bolter man at first
glance Walter man is just the regular
wallet but that's only at first glance
in reality it has a stunning design and
it's packed with super abilities the
smart wallet helps rob in a variety of
situations
once when he was out with his girlfriend
Rob left his wallet in the cab but most
men notifies when it's been left behind
and it's being tracked easily by its
owner
voltar man is the only moment with
worldwide traceability excuse me I think
you have my wallet I've been tracking
you and I've got your photos opening it
right here you're my Superman Dave I'm
not Superman
I've got voltar man
Robb's lifestyle is very active and
occasionally he forgets his phone in
crowded places but multi-man notifies
you when you've left your phone behind
excuse me that's my phone
Thanks got it except some man I'm not
Superman I've got both your men and
there's more bolter man has great
functions for travellers as well when
you need internet anywhere in the world
instead of expensive roaming you can use
vulture man's Wi-Fi hotspot which is way
cheaper than regular Romans go ahead
talk as long as you want
Telling You my Superman babe I'm not
Superman I've got full term and
sometimes at very important moments your
battery dies cut cut cut
this is a problem that happens way too
often we can't have just one scene in
the video for this folks you try and
remember how many times your phone has
died at the worst possible moment when
you're filming your kids performance and
right in the middle of it your phone
shuts down or imagine you have to tell
your date you're running late picture
that disaster or your battery dies in
the middle of an important business call
your online poker tournament is
interrupted you're lost and you can't
look up online maps not only is voltar
man super slim and ultra lightweight
that's also got a built-in power bank so
you can charge any phone up to 100%
okay what about metal and you can charge
your phone wirelessly yeah my Superman
I'm not Superman
I've got Boulder man
