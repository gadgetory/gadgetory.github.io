self-defense tool called fast strike
what a median development on this
product I was looking for a self-defense
tool for my daughters and my wife the
product had to be something very simple
something required no special training
or special techniques to use offered
extended striking distances from your
attacker was able to be rapidly deployed
easily concealable and for the most part
non-lethal this is it fast right weighs
in at just about 3 ounces it's a very
effective striking tool let's go through
the product advantages one step at a
time simple to use the product requires
no special trainer techniques if you can
basically swing your arm or your wrist
you can effectively strike a small
movement the wrist
generates a significant amount of force
using the arm generates an incredible
amount of force all focused on the very
small striking tip striking distance
FastTrack gives you about it there's no
15 inches of striking distance over your
attacker deployment speed is dependent
on where and how you carry that
basically this will happen in a fraction
of a second if a strike whether you
intend to carry it on your waist in the
back here down your leg on a purse on a
backpack deployment is basically or from
the back the ability to carry fast
strike in a concealed fashion it was
important the handle clip it basically
allows you to push this inside your pant
leg it flexes with the body so you
really don't know you're wearing and you
can sit and work with it drive with it I
never take this off and I don't really
even know it's there
another method of concealment is to
carry it basically like a belt buckle
and a belt the belt clips allow you to
position this in different places around
your waist and you can also use your
belt loops in the same fashion but this
one holds the tip and this one holds the
the handle clip
and deployment is quick FasTrak is
constructed using spring steel for the
outer sheath and high-strength stainless
steel cable for the inner portion of the
striking portion the spring steel gives
it its reaction speed the high-strength
stainless steel cable gives it its
strength striking tip stainless steel
provides the weight and a very hard
striking surface the handle is made of
high-impact reinforced plastic the end
of this is a very brutal striking tool
in the event you have to use this the
attacker gets enclosed
it's used to drive into the soft tissue
and to the bone whether it's the spine
the kidneys cheek bones
wrists ribs anything you can get a hold
of this will hurt the handle clip is
designed to be able to put off be put on
either side depending on your whether
you're right-handed or left-handed it
can also be put on in multiple locations
forward and back as well as reversed to
the opposite direction depending on how
you're going to carry the item cable
tension is very important that allows
you to strike multiple times quickly it
also extends the life of the product by
not allowing it to flex too far in
either direction inside the handle of
the tensioning mechanism that allows you
to quickly adjust the tension by
extending this screw it's a very simple
method take four screws out tighten it
put it back in and you're off and on
