put he light is an airbag technology
company that has developed the fastest
mechanically activated airbag system on
the planet we have implemented this
airbag technology into vests and jackets
for motorcyclists to make you safe while
you're doing the thing that you love the
most in the world which is of course
writing your motorcycle no matter what
type of writing you do whether you are
riding on the street riding on the track
or even ripping it up in the dirt he
Lite wants you to be safe and protected
from serious injury motorcycle
performance technology has expanded and
advanced exponentially over the last
several decades but unfortunately the
same thing cannot be said about the
protective gear that motorcyclists wear
a he light system is even more important
now than ever before
he likes landmark technology starts with
this this is your lanyard and the
lanyard is connected to your motorcycle
every he light product you use utilizes
this same system the lanyard connects to
the bike at a hard point ideally at that
place where the seat and the tank come
into contact with each other when you're
ready to ride you'll walk up to your
motorcycle you'll click yourself into
your lanyard and you're protected and
ready to go in the event of an accident
it takes about 60 pounds of pressure to
deploy the airbag another really cool
feature of the airbag system is the
integrated SAS tech back protector this
is available in all jackets and vests
that he like makes it's actually where
the turtle technology gets its name this
is the hard outer shell and then the
airbag is the soft impact absorbing
inner liner all of this will protect you
from protruding injuries so what do you
do if you already have a back protector
in your jacket will you get to take
yours out and just use ours this
actually improves the ventilation of
your existing jacket and will actually
reduce a little bit of weight as well
so another really cool thing that sets
he lights airbag system apart from other
airbag technologies is that all of our
products are self serviceable if you
have a deployment if the airbag goes off
there is no need to have it repacked
that means you don't have to pack up
your jacket send it back to the
manufacturer and wait to get it back
before you can wear it again all it
takes is five minutes and this a
replacement cartridge and you're back on
the road and safer protected for your
next accident
connectivity has become a standard in
every facet of today's world and
motorcycling should be no exception this
is why new--this set out to become the
undisputed leader of augmented reality
and connected driving solutions after
years of hard work research development
and testing we are gearing up to
revolutionize the motorcycle experience
in 2017 with the first head-up display
for any motorcycle helmet new vis
enables a connected and enriched riding
experience our unique user spirits
finally allows riders to keep their eyes
where they belong on the road smart
sensors and an HD camera let riders
capture track and relive their
experiences like never before
nuvve is connecting writers the Atlas
throttle lock is a mechanical cruise
control that bolts on in two minutes and
requires no modification for most
motorcycles
it's made of heat treated hardened
stainless steel and held together with
u.s. military grade rivets it rotates
with your hand as you accelerate
allowing predictable engagement and
disengagement of the button with your
thumb it's natural and always right
where you expect it to be each kit comes
with everything you'll need to install
the Atlas on nearly any motorcycle the
Atlas was created to solve the issues
other throttle walks presented bike
designs that are motorcycle specific
forcing you to sell the device with the
bike taking up grip space when installed
or require a non dominant finger for
activation and guard interference or and
this one's a very common problem needing
to decelerate to disengage the unit the
Atlas suffers from none of these
shortcomings and is 100% sourced and
manufactured in the United States to
activate the Atlas you simply press the
button in pressure and friction are
applied to hold your throttle in place
to disengage the Atlas press slightly in
then down
with the Atlas engaged you can still
adjust your speed by rotating the
throttle if your motorcycle didn't come
with cruise control the Atlas throttle
lock will be your favorite accessory for
those long days in the saddle the idea
of this new throttle lock came to me
during an around-the-world motorcycle
trip while I was clocking hundreds of
miles on my motorcycle day in and day
out after receiving support and
suggestions from literally thousands of
riders we developed a throttle lock to
answer all of our long-distance needs
take a ride with the highest quality
most ergonomic throttle lock ever
if anything in this life is certain hey
if you're watching this more than likely
you're someone who lives life on two
wheels for me riding a motorcycle is
more than a hobby and a bike is more
than a toy living in LA I ride my
motorcycle every day and I depend on it
for almost all my transportation riding
in a city infamous for traffic has made
me a better rider but it also made me
aware that there are some idiots out
there who aren't looking out for you so
you got to look out for yourself knowing
that a teenager sending a text could
bring me down someday I set out looking
for some solid protective gear but what
I found was frustrating let's just say
high visibility jackets and baggy mom
jeans don't really jive too well with
the custom bobber
vintage bike and cafe racer aesthetic
that I personally prefer you shouldn't
have to sacrifice style for safety
tobacco motor wear company wants to
change all that we're about bringing you
premium quality american-made motor wear
in classic styles that look awesome on
and off the bike and we're starting with
tobacco's Kevlar lined five pocket jeans

will notice that they look and feel like
a kick-ass pair of jeans like you might
already wear day to day or when you're

represent the best of American
manufacturing fabrics and LA design but
inside every pair of tobacco's is over
half a yard of a hundred percent DuPont
Kevlar Kevlar is one of the strongest
fabrics in the world and is remarkably
resistant to abrasion Punk
our Kevlar lining covers all your high
abrasion areas from your waist to your
shin past the knee and we cover your
rear and back the lining is sewn
directly into the seam of the jeans so

fitted second skin 100% unique to you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
