feedback from our customers and their
amazing experience with the city log

community we've understood the
tendencies and demands are constantly
changing lately there's been a growing
use of urban vehicles the number of
electric bikes city bikes and cruisers
are increasing every day creating a
demand for extra comfortable seats that

this is a switch bike and so is this and
this and this one this one to switch is
an affordable state-of-the-art the
electric bike system that converts any
bike into an e bike and I mean any bike
with switch you can go faster and
further without breaking a sweat
turn the power up when you need it turn
it down when you don't or switch it back
into a regular bike simply put it's a
bike and an e bike within one my name is
Oliver I'm proud to be a British
engineer I studied at Oxford University
and I'm dedicated to inventing
low-carbon technologies that are good
for the planet the way we usually get
around is not environmentally friendly
or fun astonishingly most of the
journeys we make are less than 10 miles
a switch bike has a range of up to 50
miles so why not make some of those
journeys with one of these it's fast
convenient and way more fun than getting
on a bus here's how it works we send you
a brand new wheel with our lightweight
hub motor built in a pedal sensor brake
sensors and the bracket that connects
everything together simply attach the
switch bag to go further and faster it
really couldn't be easier
please support us by placing an order
now and we'll start putting together
your custom switch package right away
thank you
hi I'm Chris I love cycling but not so
much when it's wet full-length fenders
protect well but have too many screws
they rattle and take too long to install
and although short fenders are easier to
install they don't fully protect you in
wet weather so I decided to come up with
a better solution and I call it quick
guard quick guard is the first
full-length fender that takes just
seconds to install and remove requires
no tools and can be adjusted lower for
group riding to protect riders behind
you my short stay 100% dry which means I
stay warm and when you're warm your
muscles perform better and you feel
better
here's what biking expert Ben had to say
about quick guard hey guys I'm here
today talking about Chris Howard's
quick-release bike fender idea the
install process is super simple you
simply thread the nut off the end of
your skewer that goes through the axle
replace the the end of your skewer with
the fender you close down your
quick-release and there you have it the
fender is installed it's a 32nd install
it's really intended for anything with a
quick-release style rear axle fenders
are a nuisance you don't need them on
there 90% of time but there are
necessity for anyone who commutes on a
bike when it's wet out or is raining you
really want a fender and the fact that
you can simply mount or dismount this as
you need it he's gonna really
differentiate it from the rest of the
fenders in the market and I think make
it a standout and that's Chris Howard's
quick-release bike fender I designed the
quick guard to attach to the wheel not
the bicycle frame so it doesn't scratch
or rub the paintwork
it's simple minimalist design mounts on
one side with two sturdy stays that
keeps it from rattling or vibrating and
when installed you'll never know it's
there I've been using testing and
improving the quick guide prototype for
five years it spent two years in Belgium
being tested by pro riders on the
roughest roads and now it's ready for
you
meet s the bike light with a big vision

of mind bikes have been around for a
long time now but little change so I
thought what better time than ever to
