when I was 17 I entered a robotic arm I
created in my bedroom into the state
science fair in Colorado we had
individual finger motion I could toss
the ball to you could shake people's
hands to interact with them and I
noticed this one little girl came up to
my project she was fascinated by the arm
I built it was then when I realized that
she was missing her arm and is wearing a
prosthetic device the arm that she had
was simpler than what I was creating
essentially a human-like claw at one
motion open close and one sensor I found
out that her arm had cost about $80,000
the arm I built was about $400 and it
really motivated me to take what I was
doing for fun out of my bedroom and
impact as many people as possible that
was my aha moment they started the
company unlimited tomorrow to make that
reality unlimited tomorrow has received
some amazing support from advisors
mentors and investors about a year ago
we reached a huge milestone which was
printing our first device on a small
tenure girl named Momo
she was the first recipient of her
advanced new 3d printed technology and
has really set the bar for us
earlier this year we went through equity
crowdfunding which we had over 1200
investors
I raised 1.6 million dollars and really
just getting started
so now it's time to take the next step
there was almost 30 million amputees
worldwide and only 5% of them have
access to prosthetic devices this is a
big problem and by using new
technologies we can solve this problem
at a global level
nobody's inspired me more than the
amputees themselves Caldwell wants to be
a history teacher and be able to play a
musical instrument Nicole who's 19 wants
to rock climb around the world zoey is a
12 year old girl out of Colorado who is
an aspiring actor and singer these are
just three of the 100 lives we can
transform each living soul tenaciously
that you have to ask what would they be
able to do with both arms
we tried prosthetics in the past but
they were uncomfortable and had limited
use you can do whatever you set your
mind to do even when the odds are not
all in your favor my past prosthetics
have always defined really heavy and
bulky and they don't have any invisible
fingers they move just like one and they
just haven't they've gotten my way more
than actually helped me each device is
custom 3d printed using a 3d scan of
their other arm which allows us to make
one that matches their size and color
innovative materials make the arm
extremely lightweight and easy to
maneuver custom-built electronics and
software unlock a new world of
functionality and ease of use we even
built in a sensation of touch just like
a human hand and each unit will cost
less than $10,000 to produce and fit
that's about 10% of the conventional
cost of a prosthetic device the fact
that I could be able to just move my
finger really blows my mind I think
that's absolutely crazy I'm looking
forward to how realistic it's gonna look
I think that that's gonna be really cool
for acting and dancing and stuff and
also since 3d printed it's gonna be much
lighter
I've always want to hold like a cup of
coffee with like both hands
Wow Jesus there's no way that can't
break that all right can't break it it's
gonna cut through so then though I can't
