a blanket of dusted powder just waiting
to be explored those who dare add layers
lace up and clip in just to be
contenders in this frozen way sis
sadly our hammocks typically linger
behind inevitably marked as part of our
summer here we're Sierra Madre research
and we believe that winter should be
enjoyed in a hammock not avoided
nobody likes waking up with a frozen
back at 2:00 a.m. so we created the
inferno a thermal insulation system
designed specifically for your hammock
composed of two parts the top quilt and
the under quilt the inferno seamlessly
engulfs you in a cocoon of warmth when
camping in the hammock your backside is
most vulnerable to the cold so
protecting it is first priority the
unique stretch Tec pattern of our
full-length inferno under quote contours
perfectly to your back to eliminate cold
spots and our innovative draught caps
seal in warmth from both ends
we designed flow gate membranes to allow
heat to flow evenly around your body
while keeping the down right where you
need it providing consistent warmth
enjoying the vistas is one of the main
reasons we escaped into the wild the
inferno sock shaped bill keeps fabric
from interfering with those gran winter
escapes the plush hood and enclosed foot
nests
provides full-length heat retention
while the backless design makes getting
in and out incredibly easy forget your
pillow not a problem
the overstuffed hood works great and for
those extra chilly nights the dual
comfort cinches quickly to adapt to your
desired snugness we've put a lot of
research into the infernos thermal
design and detailed it with high quality
ultra lightweight materials like 800
fill power down tech and our weather
resistant Hydra shield fabrics keeping
your pack light and incremental weather
at bay so go ahead and pull your hammock
out of hibernation and bencher out into
the frosted winter wild with the inferno
you
camping backpacking hiking just being in
the outdoors gives us a chance for
adventure and of course the opportunity
to buy some really cool gear here at
bare minimum we love innovation and
we're changing the way you eat outdoors
camping has significantly evolved over
the years the sleeping bag has gone from
big and bulky to small and light the
lantern has done from heavy and
dangerous to light and bright the
cookpot has gone from this to this
cooking on the trail hasn't changed much
until now introducing the bear bowl a
super lightweight collapsible cooking
pot designed for hikers backpackers and
Preppers it's made of a food grade flame
resistant material the deceptively small
container can fit 32 ounces of water the
four inch base makes it easy to use with
a variety of heating sources we chose an
aluminum base because of the heat
resistance durability and weight so
you're asking yourself why I need one of
these well let me tell you it's about
the size of your wallet and it weighs
less than a cell phone hello mister bear
with four folds in two snaps it's so
simple to put together you can even do
it during a bear attack
easy
barring any unfortunate bear attacks you
can take your bear bowl from flat to
cook in no time well at least as fast as
it take the bear to get coffee at a
drive-thru simply reverse the process
and you can take your bear Bowl back to
flat and ready to pack clean up on the
trail can be a real bear but not with
the bear bowl simply open the bear ball
flat and wipe it clean it takes less
time and water to clean the barrel than
any other bowl on the market
we developed this product for people
with an active lifestyle those who carry
a backpack those who ride subway those
who ride their bike commuting to work
those who are adventurous growing up in
Colorado I found the real passion for
the natural world I want to live healthy
I want to eat healthy I want to have
that food with me all the time we've
made a reusable container that you can
take everywhere with you it's super
convenient it's wonderful to have and
it's worth its weight when you carry
around the majority of trash that I
create is from food waste wax cardboard
styrofoam plastic things that get thrown
away it's all packaging I want to do
everything I can to prevent the natural
world for being stuffed with trash what
does it mean to live in a world where
we're conscious about the way we create
waste there are ways to reduce it we
developed a product that doesn't break
easily is dishwasher safe and food safe
is approved by all the science
foundation's for food and it can clip
easily to your backpack so make it
highly portable it holds 33 ounces
that's a big enough meal for any size
and shape I look forward to how
convenient it can be to have home-cooked
food anywhere
I tried at first carrying food in for
instance Tupperware I constantly look
around for a container that won't leak
and none of them fit that bill they
always have some amount of liquid coming
out of them the green traveler allows
you to carry delicious healthy food with
you you can pack any food you want or
non-food items it won't leak it will
keep water out and you have four
compartments to choose from you get to
experience home-cooked food from
anywhere anyone who packs lunch for the
day needs a way to do that without
creating wait the green traveller is
food safe dishwasher safe liquid type
and you can clip it to your backpack we
see this is the most convenient way to
carry food with you students can take it
to college
adults can take it to work it can be
used for food it can be used for other
items as well first aid supplies mothers
can pack all the things their baby might
need go to a food truck or hot bar
without generating any more wasteful
packaging we want you to have a healthy
waste free meal anywhere you are
you
hey thanks for watching our video my
name is Colby and I built the best pair
of gloves possible I know that's a
pretty bold statement but there's
something you need to know about me I
have a hereditary muscle disorder
similar to Raynaud's syndrome that
causes me to lose motor function when I
get cold most people can warm their
hands back up fairly quickly and go on
about your business
unfortunately when my hands get cold it
may take several hours for me to regain
motor function this has been a problem
my entire life especially since I love
the outdoors I've struggled for years to
find a glove that was truly warm
waterproof and provided reasonable
dexterity for cold weather activities
that glove didn't exist until now the
steel hood
utilizing the one-piece patented
outdrive construction process creates
the ultimate waterproof breathable
barrier in gloves this impenetrable
layer is permanently heat bonded
directly to the outer fabric leaving no
seams no gaps and no way for water to
get in this allows us to build a thinner
lighter glove with maximum dexterity and
filled traditional waterproof gloves use
a membrane that is nothing more than a
giant bag inserted between glove layers
Moisture is trapped inside the glove
creating a cold damp feeling your hands
are dry but they are still cold because
you literally have a moisture barrier
that inhibits breathability and acts as
a cooling layer inside the glove how
much does this cooling effect have on
your hand temperature in a controlled
test we submersed a traditional membrane
glove and our steelhead glove in 50
degree water for five minutes
and used a military-grade thermal
imaging camera to record the results our
steelhead gloves outperformed the
leading competition by an astonishing
10.8 degree difference in hand
temperature
in the real world these are the only
gloves that allow me to function in cold
weather outdoor activities if they work
for me they'll work for you by
supporting our campaign you'll not only
receive our gratitude but the answer to
my lifelong dilemma the ultimate pair of
gloves
[Laughter]
