mobile device charging and the ability
to run small electronics during power
outages and outdoor activities
it weighs 7 pounds and it's rugged and
durable it has three floodlights and a
two setting spotlight the 12 volt port
lets you run small electronics the USB
port lets you charge mobile phones and
tablets to charge multiple mobile
devices use the included adapter plug
charge the power pack by plugging into
into any wall socket or use its built-in
solar panel or faster solar charging use
the solar briefcase sold separately to
check the battery level just push the
button the Hans power pack 150 is your
personal solar power plan never be
without lights or a charged mobile phone
again
now light gives you access to instant
lights and power whatever the weather
wherever you are we've created a really
simple easy and efficient way of
generating renewable power using you
anytime we all take access to instant
lights and power for granted but what
you do for a lights and a power outage
how do you charge your phone when
camping and how about the one in seven
people who do not have access to
electricity this is why we've creative
now light a renewable source of lights
and power ready whenever you need it
current renewable energy solutions are
either solely dependent on the Sun or
rely on inefficient and awkward manual
charging we knew we could develop a
better solution we've spent years
working on the optimum way to harness
human power
now light combines a highly efficient
dynamo with cutting-edge battery
technology just one second of manual
charging finds a whole minute of life
we're excited to introduce now lights
lets you generate light and power
instantly to get started just hook up
now light pull once to turn on and keep
pulling to charge just one minute of
pulling generates an hour of light if
the sun shining attach the three watt
solar panel to charge up your now light
now lights has five brightness levels
from night lights to an ultra bright
light and the live power display adapts
to the amount of power you're using and
now I can even charge your devices just
plug in your phone or any other USB
powered device with an additional
satellite you can also spread light
around a room or use it as a task light
hi my name is Martin Lambert from a
company called eco Solaris and we're
gonna show you today is our solar air
panel a product we developed in 2015 in
2016 and is now available for the market
in 2017 pretty much solar thermal panel
at the bottom as you can
in solar photovoltaic panel on top
combined together we have a
self-sufficient heating system that can
actually provide a lot of heat to give
you a very concrete like very good
example today outside is minus 15
degrees Celsius and air panel has a team
that throughout the day today we've gone
all the way up to 72 degrees Celsius
inside the solar thermal panel the solar
photovoltaic is used to provide enough
energy to kick a fan off and have it
circulate air from a space inside the
solar thermal and thus providing heat to
that space very efficient like I said
it's minus 15 degrees Celsius and we've
stabilized the temperature once the fan
is on for a while the temperature has
stabilized at 15 degrees Celsius so
minus 15 outside blowing hot air inside
the house at 15 degrees Celsius so huge
potential totally self-sufficient
doesn't need any electricity other than
the solar photovoltaic system panel
itself very efficient very affordable
probably the most affordable renewable
energy system on the market right now
and up for further market starting in
January 2017 on eco Solaris that CA
thank you very much
you
one year ago we promised you a solar car
that cost 16,000 you and has a range of
250 kilometers and guess what we made it
but why did we build a sign humanity
burns 61% of the world's oil resources
only for transportation we were sick of
being part of this problem so we decided
to build a car in our garage which will
become a part of the solution
to spread our vision we launched a
crowdfunding campaign with an
unbelievable result the campaign became
a huge success thousands of people from
all over the world started to support us
we recruited an excellent team and moved
into a bigger office with the right
partners on our side we could finally
start building design cars body is
covered with highly efficient solar
cells thanks to this feature design
becomes a mobile power station you can
also recharge other electric vehicles
anywhere anytime as an air filter we
integrated a special moss it filters up
to 20% of the fine dust while requiring
no special care the sign costs 16,000
years concerning the battery you can
either decide to rent it or buy it right
away
we kept the car as simple as possible
without compromising on safety and
usability so no motors has only come so
far because of all the great people who
share our vision and supported us from
the very beginning to go into volume
production we need five thousand
pre-orders together we can achieve the
scope and end our dependency on oil
sometimes we all need to get away but
the further your adventure takes you the
less you can rely on cell coverage what
if you're separated from your group what
if you need to adapt to the weather what
if you just want your family to know
that you're safe
communication is key to adventure and
somewhere ensures that you're covered no
matter where your trip takes you the
summer global hotspot is a device that
fits in the palm of your hand and
instantly turns your Smartphone into a
satellite communications device unlike
cell so you no matter where you are in
the world satellite works you can have
the peace and quiet of nature with the
peace of mind that you're not alone
your family will always know that you're
safe
and you can rest easy knowing the
conditions you'll face tomorrow
using the somewhere mobile app the
hotspot supports text messages weather
reports local alerts and location
sharing with many more features to come
and if things get really rough
somewhere I'll even help calling for a
rescue never before has the power of
satellite connectivities been in your
fingertips</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
