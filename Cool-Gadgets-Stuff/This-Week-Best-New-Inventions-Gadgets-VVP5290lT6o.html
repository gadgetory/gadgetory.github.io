your home office or business really be
as easy as screwing in a light bulb the
innovators at top met decided it should
be with years of development and design
they've created the Tom net light bulb
security camera which can be installed
in any light outlet to immediately begin
recording your premises the light bulb
security camera has a hundred and twenty
viewing angle that can be adjusted 360
degrees and his motion activated day or
night the camera is equipped with a
backup data storage system in an SD card
and the data can also be downloaded via
Wi-Fi to smart phones or computers a
dedicated app allows you to check your
cameras throughout the day not only does
the camera record video but there's a
two-way audio element they can both
record noise and project it into the
area remotely the light bulb security
camera can even send you an email alert
when motion has been detected
by using a compression video technology
you don't have to worry about running
out of space for your security
recordings so how does it work the unit
is all-in-one and requires no extra
installations beyond placing the tub
that light bulb security camera in a
compatible light socket once installed
it's simple to get it working with your
smartphone app or custom remote control
to have the security of your home office
or business at your fingertips
hi i'm joe jones inventor of turtle 15
years ago
I created Roomba small user friendly
robot that cleans home floors all by
itself
since rumors amazing success I've been
looking for opportunities for other
practical robots I found a great one in
the garden
it's called turtle turtle is a robot
that eliminates weeds if solar-powered
chemical-free and waterproof everyday it
charges itself in the Sun and what it
has enough energy it goes patrolling for
weeds my name is Rory McKean I'm the CEO
of Franklin robotics turtle uses the
height of the plant to decide if it's
good or if it's bad if it's taller than
an inch it leaves it alone if it's
smaller than an inch it cuts it turtle
has two methods of removing weeds the
first is a small nylon string on the
bottom of the robot that spins rapidly
to cut the weeds the second is the
design of the wheels as the robot drives
around the wheel scrubs the surface of
the soil damaging pre-emergent weeds
turtle doesn't need to pull weeds
because it chops them every day even if
a chopped weed sprouts again turtle will
keep chopping it down until it runs out
of store energy and dies there's no
mapping or programming required for
turtle you put the robot in the garden
press GO and the robot takes care of the
rest
turtle uses bluetooth to talk to the
user smartphone there's an app that
accompanies turtle through the app you
can learn about conditions in your
garden and what turtle has been doing
because turtle cuts the weeds every day
the clippings are small so they fall
back onto the ground and triple up
returning the nutrients to the soil to
inform turtle that you want to keep a
small plant you put one of the provided
plant collars around the seedling this
lets turtle know that it's a desired
plant once the plant is larger you can
remove the collar if you like turtle
collects some energy even on cloudy days
and it uses this energy very carefully
thus it can keep operating through
extended cloudy periods turtle is helped
by the fact that we'd can't grow very
fast when there's no Sun turtle can
easily cover the typical garden size in
the US which is about a hundred square
feet given favorable soil conditions or
sunny climates turtle is able to cover
more area than that
turtle is round it's short it has
four-wheel drive and extreme camber
wheels those are all design choices that
improve total mobility in the garden
turtle requires a barrier to keep it
from wandering away from the garden this
could be the edge of a race fed chicken
wire fence or some other type of border
because weeding sucks you should make a
robot do it physics and health tractors
have done a great job of helping people
understand the health and activities but
what if you could simply rejuvenate your
existing classic watch to become a smart
health and fitness device this is the
smart buckle a buckle that brings new
smart features to a watch you already
love without compromising your style it
tracks your date back to the seeing your
sleeve and feature specially designed
near former factories and intelligent
power management to extend battery life
so the buckle last up to a week on a
single 60 minute charge first of all it
should seamlessly with most modern or
plastic watches from cathode to Rolex
and work for that will help and Google
Fair
my button Agathe water-resistant and
doctorate
made from stainless steel with a brushed
metal finish feeling my father got in my
first auction 12 years old I mean
fascinated by what should have sent the
design mechanical boom and so forth we
saw that the real gas market for
bringing the elements of fitness and
sleep tracking to people who actually
want to wear their normal watches and
have those entrances welcome that's why
you bars on this journey developing
smart pocket and 15 grams the bottle is
only around 7% of the watches wait and
have been designed with antiperspirant
reef and fresh free material so it's as
seamlessly into your daily life
the automatic design challenge two
minutes like all the electronics into
the smallest all factor using our years
of experience we will ever do that and
at the same time as we came beauty and
for every girls which match which watch
quality standards we've got a team with
years of product development and
technology expertise we design products
that people like Apple and Amazon
previously you could like eleven people
your name right yes and also mastered in
nano biosensing which has really helped
us to address some of the technological
challenges I really will disappear the
world is moving which is about my
turning your devices with seamless
integration of technologies do a daily
lifestyle our algorithms no walk from
way meaning that the buckle is more
accurate in capturing health data than
many other leading health trackers on
the market and the sleep tracking
Spartan solutions automatically
monitoring both light and
be patent without having to charge every
single knife we set out to make a
product that would complement Swiss
quality craftsmanship embedding
cutting-edge technology based on years
of research and development to fit into
the smallest footprint unobtrusive and
powerful at the same time a classic
timepiece is never obsolete
but the smart buckle allows you to move
forward without having to leave things
behind by making your favorite watch
even smart don't you just loathe those
hot summer days at home when the heat is
simply unbearable leaving you feeling as
though you too could be melting away
with quillo you can cool a room down by
10 to 20 degrees you can easily add ice
to a dedicated ice compartment to cool
your room down even faster most other
swamp coolers and air conditioners are
super loud and noisy the quillo on the
other hand super quiet its soothing
ambient sound of water streaming and the
amber move light from the water level
indicator ensure that you sleep well
while staying cool the quillo even comes
with a sleek minimalistic remote control
so that you can also operate it from
across the room as far as 12 feet away
it's so simple you don't even need an
app for it even when the cold winter
months usually leave your skin dry you
can continue to use quillo as a
humidifier quillo naturally humidifies
the air to rehydrate your skin just be
sure to fill up the tank with water
what's more with the detachable power
cord the Quillen is extremely compact
lightweight and portable making it easy
to store when you don't need it as you
can see the cooler is a fan and
evaporative air cooler and a humidifier
all rolled into one when you add water
in the tank
willows evaporative cooling technology
rapidly reduces the temperature of
incoming warm air creating a refreshing
cool breeze will not only naturally
cools and humidifies a rule but it's
also energy efficient compact
lightweight and portable it's
surprisingly powerful it truly is a
marriage of design and engineering here
to tell you the secret behind the quilo
is our project manager hi nishan oh hi
there yes our secret lies in our
Universal DC motor which is the type
typically used in battery-powered
devices like laptops unlike an AC motor
which is typically used in most air
conditioners and air coolers this also
makes the coil oh very energy-efficient
it consumes a fraction of the
electricity of an air-conditioner in
fact it consumes as little electricity
as charging a light bulb or as charging
your iPad the quino was designed by an
award-winning German design agency we
asked the agency to reflect the essence
of the product its performance and
portability in a design that enhances
your space with a patent-pending
rationalise DC motor technology we
design the unit with a highly
controllable airflow which you can keep
on high in the sum of a cooling and low
in the winter for humidifying</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
