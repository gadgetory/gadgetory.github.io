some exercise some diet and some do
nothing
but are they happy with the results yeah
except for these thunder thighs
well this mommy told me is impossible
these handles don't get much love let's
face it we all have those stubborn areas
of fat we just can't get rid of meet
Silk'n lipo the first targeted fat
reduction device for home use that
really works no diet no exercise simply
use Silk'n lipo for just 15 minutes a
day and get results no diet no exercise
only 15 minutes a day
that's right just eight weeks targeting
stubborn areas will reduce fat and
strengthen underlying muscles so you can
give your body the shape you've always
wanted I don't know if Silk'n lipo
really works Silk'n lipo uses the same
proven technology found in a large
professional light therapy machines
found in the world's most advanced and
expensive beauty clinics we've simply
shrunk that same technology into the
first-ever affordable easy-to-use home
device to make it even better we've
combined the low level light therapy
with electrical muscle stimulation
technology EMS to optimize the fat
reduction and strengthen underlying
muscles
low level light therapy is a proven
technology for the permanent reduction
of fat with years of clinical experience
in my own clinic low level light therapy
is one of the most popular it can
permanently slim firm and shape areas
without downtime without pain without
discomfort without the side effects
associated with traditional surgical
treatments when I first heard that
they've been able to compact lower light
therapy into a simple little home device
I was understandably skeptical but when
I reviewed the basic science and the
results I've come to realize a Silk'n
lipo is as effective as some of my large
body contouring logo light therapy
systems I use in the office that the
patient can use 50 minutes a day and
deliver the same kind of permanent fat
contouring and body slimming results
I've been able to achieve within office
treatments how does it work that is
accumulated by your body and stored in
fat cells under your skin Silk'n lipo
uses specifically calibrated frequencies
of light to perforate fat cell walls
releasing their fatty contents and
harmlessly causing shrinkage in the
region once outside the cell your body's
natural processes flush the fatty acids
out of your system in the same natural
way regular dietary fibers expelled to
accelerate this process and to help
build strength and muscle tone so can
added EMS technology this stimulates
muscle activity and circulation in the
treated area speeding up the rate at
which the excess fat is flushed out of
your system leaving your body looking
its best Silk'n the pioneers of
permanent hair removal technology shrunk
down for home use now brings you
clinically proven non-invasive fat
reduction technology to let you target
those stubborn areas and give your body
the shape you want
say goodbye to stubborn fat

a technologically advanced indoor smart
bike is about to make its Kickstarter
debut introducing a virtue bike light
the new standard and indoor biking okay
now let's find out why we believe we
have the best new indoor bike system on
the market here we have John his living
room and a virtue by Clyde John takes a
fan connects it to virtue bike light and
turns on the Bluetooth switch then he
connects the smartphone to the TV and
adjust the bike to his recommended
position when it comes to cycling the
exercises posture is very very important
after putting his information in the app
suggests a workout mission according to
John's fitness level and then once
everything's ready you can ride any
course anywhere around the world
John chooses the 10 kilometer Alps
course he's got a great proper riding
position and looks just like a pro wow
what a great view the environment flies
by faster and faster as John quick as
his face and the wind blow is harder
depending on John's speed now as the
terrain gets steeper the auto resistant
system activates and adjusts accordingly
you can also shift gears freely while
riding great workout John you conquer
the Alps congratulations
birch let allows you to ride through the
most breathtaking scenarios in the world
like the Elvis Rocky Mountains Las Vegas
Paris London or Seoul you can ride all
of these bike courses all around the
world but that's not all and if it was
we wouldn't be showing our Kickstarter
here comes Lisa she connects her tablet
to the virtue bike light it finds a
mission and chooses a virtue studio you
can workout while your virtual expert
motivates and analyzes your vitals and
here's another innovation this isn't
just a scenic video resistance changes
automatically so you can just follow the
class and let the program do the work
simply change the wind speed with your
handlebar button just ride perch√© bike
will do the rest
or pacing now with my left shift down
the rear gear twice the device shown is
a wireless heart rate monitor the heart
monitoring app actively advises of a
recommended heart rate workout zone
depending on collected vitals remember
just ride and we do the rest you can
connect and compete with other virtue
light riders through our app you can
also play games with our 3d virtual
reality abilities use the buttons as
controllers and just like Netflix the
whole family can share a login so that
everyone can workout
hi I'm Jason McKeon
dr. neuroscientist and co-founder of
Morris I love helping people improve
their lives and I'm super passionate
about weight loss
I've been over we in the past and I know
how difficult it is to lose weight I
also know how difficult it is to keep
that we at loss going Laureus we believe
this is much more than just diet and
exercise the source of your weight loss
problem lies deep within your brain my
co-founder is doctor Paul McGill and a
few years ago he made an amazing
discovery our brains have what's called
a set point that controls how much body
fat we have this varies from person to
person which is why two people can eat
the same and one will gain weight while
the other one we found a way to turn the
setpoint down and the implications of
this are profound a few years ago and
realized that there was a connection
between stimulation of the vestibular
nerve just behind your ear and weight
loss I was working in neurosurgery with
Jason at the time and knew of his
interest in electronics as a hobby from
the very beginning I've been using and
developing the moodiest prototypes on
myself within just one year my body fat
had almost halved and now almost one
year later I still haven't regained any
fat this technology has amazing
potential and we're inviting you to join
us at the mauryas community we want you
to be the first group of people who take
part in the next generation of weight
loss
Moe Dias is really simple to use just
place it on your head
attach the sticky pads behind your ears
turn the headset on and then control it
using the app simple use moe Deus for
just forty five minutes per session and
that's it and the results well the
technology was tasted in overweight
volunteers they didn't change their diet
or lifestyle and received up to three
hours of stimulation a week after four
months we found that all of the
volunteers lost body fat in one case as
much as 16 percent statistically these
results are very significant also Moody
has caused a fallen appetite and a shift
of the metabolism towards burning fat
we're delighted by these initial results
and actually can't wait to see a effect
of Moody's will be when combined with
some lifestyle changes
this is amazing I'm on my cell phone I
burn 2,000 calories watching a movie hi
I'm Louie Crowe medical doctor the
researcher and an inventor I have done
the caloric equivalent of a marathon on
my couch watching TV
I've even trained for a marathon with no
running no pounding of the joints just
this panic chip an app and a wrap that
goes round it ties electronic impulses
stimulates and muscles to exercise the
users at low levels the equivalent of
walking you can burn calories at work
maybe to slim down you can train playing
video games it's pretty good
let's look at the heart rate data during
a session project 54 warm up and then
peak levels my heart is beating as fast
as it can maintain this for an hour and
stop I've got to Tyson's calories this
was a tough
it's well researched and proven we've
loved scientific publications we've even
tried it with European Space Agency in
zero-gravity it works up there too that
was fun
