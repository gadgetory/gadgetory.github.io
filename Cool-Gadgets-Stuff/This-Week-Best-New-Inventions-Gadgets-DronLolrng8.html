you don't let work hold you back you
don't let early mornings hold you back
you don't let a busy schedule hold you
back so why should your hair dryer with
Volo you have the freedom to choose you
have the freedom to explore you have the
freedom to do you
my name's Ryan Goldman I'm the founder
of Volvo beauty I've been in the beauty
business for twenty years I got involved
with my family business empire Beauty
Supply which was founded here in San
Diego in 1945 I'm very passionate about
this business I love it as a retailer
and a wholesaler I'm always looking for
new innovation and new opportunity so
one day I'm walking through one of my
beautiful salons and I recognize cords
everywhere they're hanging out drawers
they're on top of the salon stations I
also recognize the same problem at home
and then at dawn why not make a cordless
hairdryer
I'm Jonathan it's been so much fun
working with Ryan as a co-founder of
bola beauty
he knows the industry I'm an engineer I
studied engineering at Cornell and I
have a business degree from Kellogg so
really my focus has been can we get this
thing made and could we build a business
around it
we've traveled the world and worked with
some really talented engineers and found
that we can do it and we're now able to
draw a full head of hair with the
world's best cordless hairdryer this
thing's amazing we've benchmarked a Volo
hairdryer against a professional quality
salon hairdryer beyond the obvious
benefits of a cordless hairdryer the
ability to move around the ability to
take it with you on the go the ability
to use different angles when styling
your hair we found that our heating
element the quartz it for a bulb which
consumes much less power has other
benefits it dries the hair at a lower
temperature less damaging and it leaves
it feeling silky smooth we know you're
busy you're active you have jobs you
have kids and you have friends at Volo
Beauty we want to give you the freedom
the freedom to do you we're solving a
problem that you've forgotten that you
even have you're tethered to that wall
you're knocking things over you're
unable to move around your head in a way
that gives you the best styling possible
the Volo dryer is going to give you
flexibility it's going to give you time
it's going to give you freedom to dry
your hair when and how you want it these
are our spices and they suck they're not
exactly easy to use they were pretty
expensive and some of them are old like
really old but do spices even go bad
yes and it turns out all of mine are so
how do you keep them fresh
okay keep them away from oxygen moisture
light and heat but how meet OCO a fresh
take on flavor
hey I'm Lisa and this is my partner
Connie we wanted to make a product that
lets you use the exact amount of fresh
spice you need when you need it while
keeping the rest fresh for later
ocoa uses modified atmosphere technology
to seal in freshness at the molecular
level this removes the sources of
oxidation decay and flavor loss in a
series of blind taste tests people
preferred food made with fresh spice 94
percent more than the same food made
with Old Spice this is like what I made
for myself in my apartment on like a sad
Tuesday this is my mom makes Coco is
stocked with organic ethically sourced
spices and I should know I traveled the
world to find the freshest spices
harvested within the past year but
that's a story for another day
you know you're in Indonesia in August
when your finger is dripping sweat Coco
is easier to use easier to store and
makes it easier to find it exactly the
spice you're looking for oh and did I
mention that OCO is made with aluminum
aluminum is the most recycled and
recyclable material on the planet with
75% of the aluminum ever produced still
in use today we're ready to do this we
just need a bit of your help to order
spice and tool packing machines Oh Coco
makes it simple to elevate the flavor in
your food reduce plastic waste and make
room in the pantry for other stuff
it's time for a fresh take on flavor
because Old Spice is for armpits not
food get OCO today</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
