temps a day I have to put my mobile
devices on charge and what is the most
inconvenient about it either the battery

one who get bothered by this problem I'm
pretty sure that every one of you got
into this situation when one of your
gadgets ran out of battery the moment
you needed it the most you should not
worry about this anymore because I got
in that solution the solution is in hand
energy this is your device of unlimited
energy its unlimited because you can
generate it to yourself and you can
generate this energy as much as you need
canned energy preserves energy inside of
itself that's why you can use it anytime
you need it and of course you can charge
your device during the rotation of
intelligent as well canned energy is
very easy to use
first you need to rotate the ring and
let it go then just give the patient
good it may be a surprise but the author
wishes inside the kenta energy device
rotates with the average speed of 5000
tons per minute that's why your
smartphone will be charged by pent
energy with the same speed as you charge
it from the clock
take the hint energy device with you of
the time and your energy will be safe no
matter where you are and what you do and
energy is indispensable for the people
living in the areas with limited access
to electrical grid thanks to Kant energy
your energy is in your hands it's one of
the most effective energy generators and
what is more it looks nice you may
choose the hand energy device according
to taste or style developing the
container G device we have performed a
huge amount of experiments created a
huge amount of prototypes and now and
energy is finally done and ready for
production and we need your help
you
by the way gente energy divides
synchronizes with an F wave and observe
your statistic and also achieve
particular goals win competitions and
get prizes before the get starter
campaign we've made a tour around Europe
to support an energy we've shown the
device to people let them take a close
look at it and use it to see what it's
like you may learn about the impression
regarding this experience by yourself
you can get more information about and
energy about the tour about our plans on
Kickstarter page on our website or
following the hashtag can energy we need
your support
you
Heike bowl the multifunction virtual
laser projection keyboard increase your
productivity anytime anywhere
you
hi Kickstarter on site I'd like to
introduce you to a pair of completely
different wireless headphones that
integrate music calls and information so
naturally into your senses you're hardly
notice they're there you never have to
take them off because they don't affect
your natural hearing when they're not
switched on giving you the ability to
listen to music make calls and much more
with on-demand voice commands and unlike
other hero balls the battery life is
measured not in hours but days this is
what we think wireless headphones should
be this is high
you
we think the biggest problems with
headphones are that they block your
natural hearing and you have to carry
them with you putting them on and taking
them off when all you really want is
just to be able to make a call or listen
to music we solve this problem with a
completely new type of virtually
invisible earbud which combines high
quality speakers for sparkling travels
and vibrating elements for rich deep
bass this means you get amazing sound
that augments your natural hear but when
high isn't playing anything you don't
even notice it's there plus the fact
that we've put all the supporting
electronics behind your ear means that
we've managed to cram in five times the
battery power of other leading hero
balls so you can listen day after day
before recharging all day where means
that you can check the weather monitor
your well being set reminders or search
the web with voice commands and most
importantly expand your ability to enjoy
music and conversation with anyone
anytime without ever having to take your
phone out of your pocket plus we're
working on loads more features by being
able to record and share your audio
experiences or listen to music together
wirelessly we think I will change the
way you think about personal audio we've
partnered with award-winning product
development consultancy PDT you bring
world-renowned design and manufacturing
experience on crowd funded projects to
global brands to help us bring this
revolutionary product to you please back
this project so we can complete the
final factory ready design and start
making and shipping hi to you so you can
experience what wireless headphones can
really be thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
