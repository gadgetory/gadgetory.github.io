years ago when thousands of you
supported our vision to build the
world's most affordable laptop with your
help we built a groundbreaking device
the first of its kind that turns
smartphones and micro computers into
fully functional laptops we successfully
shipped over 3,000 products to our
backers in 60 countries all around the
world we're thrilled to see these
backers out there using and enjoying
their next Alex today meanwhile we've
been listening to your feedback and
feature requests and we've been hard at
work making the next doc even better and
now we're excited to announce the next
generation of next up
the new next octave features a sleek
aluminum body beautiful HD display edge
to edge keyboard and USB C input just
plug in your smartphone and you have a
beautiful powerful fully functional
laptop with a full-size keyboard and
screen you can experience real
productivity with your smart phone send
emails create spreadsheets and play
games with a keyboard and touch map
watch movies and TV shows and check your
social media on a bigger screen the new
next dock is specifically designed for
Samsung and Huawei smartphones with the
desktop mode feature we believe that
this feature will be included on many
upcoming Android smartphones that means
you can change phones and still use your
next dock but it's even better because
the computing power is coming from your
phone your next dock becomes a new
better computer every time you get a new
phone
next up works off of your smartphones
existing data Bluetooth and Wi-Fi
connections so you don't need an extra
data plan and with a long battery life
next doc can also charge your phone
but next doc it doesn't only work with
smart phones with the full size HDMI in
port the new next dock still supports
many PCs and raspberry PI's creating
fully functional computers at a
revolutionarily low cost thanks to the
new USB type-c port we can also develop
better integrated PC sticks so that you
can use next dock with the processor and
operating system of your choice imagine
an enduring sustainable computer that
you can simply upgrade and customize as
the years go by by separating processor
and operating system from the physical
interface we hope to start a paradigm
shift and consumer electronics where
computers can be adapted rather than
becoming obsolete generating less
electronic waste for the environment
today smartphones are the computers that
we used most of the time with desktop
mode becoming available on more and more
smart phones it's clear where the future
is headed towards a world where we only
carry our smart phones which connect to
any screen in the world to turn them
into laptops and PCs at next dock we're
standing at the forefront of this
movement pledge now and help us take the
next big step in turning that vision
into a reality

it really was these seem to have a much
higher resolution the resolution was
really nice colors were very vivid and
very realistic I felt like I was
actually in the movie we are koala tree
and we make eco-minded products from
sustainably sourced materials our latest
product recycles something you may not
expect it's been brewing introducing the
evolution hoody made with recycled
coffee grounds the evolution hoody is
the most versatile functional and
comfortable hoody out there design with
versatility in mind the evolution hoody
is loaded with features like reinforced
seams at stress points some holes for
extra warmth no lose pull strings
and the zipper pouch helps keep your
items organized and secure perfect for
travel
the evolution hoody stuffs into its own
pocket and makes a great pillow or
cushion at only one pound it's
lightweight and easy to take with you
anywhere besides the eco-friendly use of
recycled materials this new fabric
offers many benefits over traditional
fabric microscopic pores in the coffee
increased surface area and allow the
material to breathe and dry up to twice
as fast when compared to traditional
fabrics the fabric is also durable and
stain resistant so any mess washes away
with ease coffee naturally absorbs and
traps odor releasing it only when it's
washed and because the coffee is
embedded in the fabric this feature is
permanent and never washes away the
technology behind this revolutionary
fabric also traps and blocks UV rays
turning the evolution hoody into a
chemical free sun shield using a newly
developed process used coffee is ground
into microscopic particles and combined
with the plastic from recycled bottles
to produce a whole new type of super
soft fleece fabric
lack of sleep is a big problem these
days it's even been declaring a public
health epidemic about a third of the
country can't sleep and it's happening
in every age group underlying the
problem is stress our lives are
stressing us out we've got to figure out
ways to relax restore bodies and minds
and get some sleep so imagine for a
minute there was a device that played
music that could take you to a quiet
restful place where within minutes your
nervous system was relaxed imagine if
felt is good and was as easy as laying
your head on your pillow and imagined
you were the only person who could hear
the music even someone lying say two
feet away on the same bed couldn't hear
a thing well the device exists we call
it the dream pad let me tell you how it
works it's a completely different
experience than listening to music
through a sound machine or traditional
speaker instead of sound waves traveling
through the air it sends out a sound
signal that you're able to feel through
your body so once your head is relaxed
on the dream pad music moves internally
and in the process of signaling your
nervous systems relaxation response it's
soothing it's great for both distressing
and sleeping in 2016 we launched the
original dream pad on Kickstarter the
response blew our expectations out of
the water we raised over $200,000 we got
an inventory ordered and we were able to
ship on time most amazing I think the
most moving part of the whole experience
were your personal stories the people
whose lives were changed from using the
dream package most with light sleep
issues to insomnia to even war veterans
with PTSD media reviews and user
feedback were great
you're even invited to go on Shark Tank
but what really helped us the most was
your feedback on ways
and the feedback was twofold first
design it so I can use it with my
existing pillow second make it wireless
with Bluetooth so we went back to the
drawing board and created the dream pad
you asked for the new dream pad uses the
same technology has the same calming
effect and the same quality of sound but
it's wireless and it works with any kind
of pillow anywhere so here's how it
works
pair your device with a Bluetooth
receiver and slip it in the pocket of
the dream pad download the dream pad
music app you'll want to put your phone
on airplane mode so calls won't disturb
you then slide the tree pad inside your
pillowcase underneath and Phillip lie
down and enjoy the covers washable just
toss it in the wash and dry it on low
heat above all else we hope the dream
pad helps use to de-stress we hope you
get a great night's sleep and have a
better day and we thank you so much for
supporting us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
