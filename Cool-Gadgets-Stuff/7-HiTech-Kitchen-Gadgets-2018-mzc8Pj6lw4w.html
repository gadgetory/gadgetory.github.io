it's very mild but it's also refreshing
at the same time saffron turmeric golden
milk ok I'm actually surprised that I
like the taste it tastes good I don't
know what restaurant I'm mad at I'm
having this but I've not at home like
I'm somewhere else it makes me feel like
I'm back home
I like that fun session IPA possible
delicious well I'm a hophead that's got
great pop of flavor that's smooth that's
good
this is Tupperware the airtight plastic
containers would keep good form and this
is smarter with a better way to keep

on the go

the phones you already have so there
will be less of this and more of this
and this and this
introducing smarter we're by Ovie I love
having my friends over for drinks
especially my signature cocktails my
secret to perfect taste texture and
chillin every glass is nugget ice unlike
regular ice nugget ice is chewable fast
chilling and flavor absorbing and now I
can make it at home with the opal nugget
ice maker it sits right on my counter so
now I can get that craveable taste
texture and chill anytime I don't have
to deal with bags of ice anymore and no
more driving to get nugget ice Bowl is
very user friendly the container
conveniently slides out allowing you to
easily refill the water reservoir the
indicator light conveys the status of
the ice maker while the lights inside
show you how much ice you have opal is
compact yet efficient it makes ice much
faster than your standard refrigerator
it's truly a one-of-a-kind appliance
that pairs affordability with
convenience and with a stainless steel
design it looks great in my kitchen so
we asked ourselves why do we have to buy
bottled water that comes from halfway
around the world why can't there be a
sustainable easy way to make water at
home everyone already has virtually
unlimited water delivered directly to
your home through your tab and that's
why we teamed up with Lee to create the
ocean one
it's an all-in-one smart device that
filters flavors and carbonates your
water straight from the tap seamlessly
integrating with your home saving you
time and money
whether you like your water fizzy peach
pear flavored and hence with
electrolytes or just fresh and clean
you'll be able to customize every glass
to your preference our patent-pending
flavor pods are dishwasher safe so no
more plastic waste just tons of
convenience our sub micron carbon block
filter is environmentally friendly and
filters out over 75 contaminants that's
fifteen times more effective than those
pitcher based water filters the Roshan
one is compatible with any cup or bottle
and it can be controlled from the device
or an app as well as through Google home
or Amazon Alexa hey Google make flavored
water flavored water coming right up and
because it's smart filters pods and co2
replacement tanks can be automatically
delivered to your door before you ever
enough on a good day we want to bring
you a smarter way to water but on our
most ambitious days we want to help set
something much bigger into motion a
chain reaction that starts with you for
us for our oceans and for our world
thirty years from now
