sensor that pops up with a small tap
delivering 360 degrees spatial awareness
poverty's new suite of AI algorithms

is four times more powerful than its
predecessor 3d mapping in advanced
visual positioning allow hover to two
planets flight path and bypass obstacles
in real-time

a tank full of dirty water is bad news

making your home and ideal environment
for everyone the air around you directly
impacts her health and wellness after
all you're swimming in it just imagine
what the right environment can do for
your well-being
growing up we were always being told to
sit up straight don't slouch and watch
your posture
unfortunately regular chairs make this
impossible for any length of time the
way we set is simply wrong our bodies
have been ingeniously designed to carry
our weight in a particular way and not
sit in a typically designed chair for up
to 12 hours a day as a result our bodies
wear out rapidly our posture
deteriorates pain headaches and a myriad
of other health issues start seriously
detract from that quality of life how do
I know my name is David France on the
chiropractor and I have been for 20
years dealing with the consequences this
sits the very first day of practice my
days are filled with patients presenting
with predictable signs and symptoms of
this degeneration I observe the symptoms
and see the x-ray evidence all day every
day the design of regular chairs is
simply wrong it's time to change the way
they sent I'm here to show you I've
created a solution it changes the way is
sick for good and it all came simply
from riding a horse my mission to change
the way the world sets started 25 years
ago when I was riding out it's very
racing stable to pay my way through
university from writing and my
anatomical studies I realized our body
isn't designed to be sitting in a
regular chair that forces it to be at a
90 degree angle between our back and our
thighs
I understood that when our body sits in
a saddle we're able to maintain the
ideal spinal position the head sits
perfectly balanced over our pelvis the
spine maintains its three spinal curves
as it's designed allowing it to absorb
our weight with minimal strain the work
horse saddle chair is all about
maintaining your body in a position that
is evolved to be and wants to be this
position also means you have much better
control of your hands improving your
performance at work or play and you
don't get that weariness and ain't
normally associated with sitting in
chairs for long periods we decided to
develop a range of workhorse chairs for
work and home uses
the workhorse Pro is our
top-of-the-range chair with its patented
rotating backrest
with the work horse plus chair the
backrest is manually interchangeable or
can be taken off altogether the
workhorse original without a backrest is
ideal for people who don't spend all day
sitting the workers go with a foldable
stable base is designed to fold up and
take with you we developed the stool
initially since it was requested by
almost every recipient of the early
prototypes finally we developed the base
this allows you to cheaply and easily
experience the workhorse by placing it
on a regular chair</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
