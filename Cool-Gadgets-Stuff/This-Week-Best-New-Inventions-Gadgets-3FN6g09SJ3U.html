smart deadbolt I got one spare room to
catch of the day three fried rice one
hamachi on the fly being a chef I'm on
my feet 14 hours a day seven days a week
my feet hurt and I've been through so
many pairs of shoes either this shoe has
great utility and is really really ugly
or the shoe has really cool aesthetic
but doesn't have any function that helps
you feel better while you're working and
so I thought to myself there's got to be
something better I knew that I wanted to
create a shoe though looked
aesthetically pleasing had lots of
features but ultimately were good for
you and I don't have those medical
expertise so when I found dr. snippy
that's exactly what he knows he's on his
feet all day in the operating room and
he studies this exact subject so he was
the perfect partner now as a practicing
orthopedic surgeon I've been thinking
about she where my entire career about
how it affects people's function how it
affects my life standing in the
operating room sometimes twelve hours a
day so Daniel called me one day and said
I have an idea about a shoe a shoe that
would be for doctors and medical
professionals and anyone that stands for
a very very long time that call inspired
me that call was the call I was almost
waiting for for somebody to kind of push
me into the realm of shoe wear to make
the perfect comfortable shoe we spent
over three and a half years and 35
revisions of just the shoe another 15 of
just the insole to get the final product
that we have to do every aspect of this
shoe has been personally designed by
myself and Daniel
nothing likes nibs on the market the
shoe is custom-built every little piece
of it is built for function and utility
and then it's wrapped up with a nice
looking shell the cushioning of the heel
the space that it gives you and your
forefoot or the area where your toes are
it allows for your foot to swell a
little bit most shoe companies will
combine molds so that they can save on
costs we did not cut one corner we even
have a dual mold for the insole we had
to create custom molds for both men and
women and for half sizes and full sizes
and then when you go to the next step is
it how does it interact with your
environment it doesn't slip it's a
waterproof upper that's also so easy to
clean the other thing it has very nice
plastic pieces on either side on the
inside and outside where the laces
attach which allow you to tension your
shoe appropriately to capture your foot
no matter what size your foot is it's
got a midsole so that it stays durable
and offers you lots of support most
people in the medical profession or any
profession that stand for a long time
use running shoes and most running shoes
the resilience of that cushioning wears
out after a few months this you will not
this shoe really has a lot of resilience
in the midsole a lot of shoes that are
designed out there in the medical
profession are designed for you to stand
in one place for a very long period of
time but the minute you want to walk
somewhere it's uncomfortable to walk
even short distances what we've achieved
with this shoe is a shoe that not only
is comfortable to stand hours on end but
it's extremely comfortable when you want
to walk it's kind of crazy to say that
that that there really is an issue that
exists like that but there is it's the
way the shoe makes you feel whether
you're on your feet for 16 hours a day
seven days a week you're putting them
through hell this shoe will clean up
well and keep you comfortable the whole
time we really have perfected the design
to really be resilient not just keep
your feet comfortable for an hour two
hours but for 10-12 hours and no matter
what your profession is no matter what
you do in your life if you're standing
for long hours if you're walking long
distances this is the shoe that allows
you to do that in your job in your
fashioned to allow you to stand for long
hours that have comfortable hi I'm st.

from all of us at Adventure Cheers
when cyclists want to be seen and secure
their bikes they typically need several
items including lights headlamps and
locks to ensure riders could be safe
during low visibility while also having
a way to better secure your bike right
lock was created bright lock started as
part of the product innovation lab at NC
State Bryan and I were actually on a
team together and our team was tasked
with actually going out and solving a
novel problem with a technical solution
bright lock is cool to me because as we
were designing it we were you know
really trying to incorporate unique
solutions along with superior safety and
lighting options for cyclists bright
lock is an all-in-one safety and
security solution for any kind of
cyclist it's modern design elevates the
ultra-secure u-lock by combining it with
wide set front and rear lights that
attach to the bike providing 360 degree
visibility bright lock is fully modular
you can take the lights with you or
leave them attached to your bike or even
keep them secured on the you lock while
you take care of business you know we
really wanted to combine those into one
product having very bright visible
lights to help guide you along the way
as well as you know show motorists
you're there on the street and then also
having very durable lock incorporated
into the same design where you can lock
up your bike and lock up those same
accessories without having a bunch of
different items that you have on your
bike so the thing that I'm really
confident about with this particular
project is our ability to get it to the
finish line you know it's one thing to
see a group of entrepreneurs young
students coming out of the university
you know with a start-up like this it's
really exciting but if you add up the
community the startup community that's
around them the industrial design
support the manufacturing support the
marketing support they've got all the
partners they need to get this thing to
the finish
the 360 degree lighting feature provides
you with the best safety and visibility
for nighttime and low visibility rides
the unit is lightweight durable and
compact but works for almost any locking
scenario we're really excited about this
opportunity to launch bright lock we
have a lot of support and help from the
community we're using you know help from
an industrial design firm Trigg in the
area as well as you know consultants
contractors helping with electrical
design marketing and innovation
entrepreneurs a lot of different people
coming together to help get this product
off the ground and you know we're just
really pumped we're lit outdoors we are
proud to present to you the tam ik the
world's first hammock tent system that
allows you to hammock wherever you go
we love hammocks and sharing the outdoor
adventure with friends and family so
much we created a way to hammock
anywhere hammocks are great but they're
limited to where you can use them you
need to find somewhere with trees and
the perfect tree spacing we wanted to
create a new way to use hammocks
anywhere while providing comfort gear
storage and protection from the elements
so we created the tam ik designed with
versatility in mind the Tama cos
completely freestanding
it doesn't require Stakes or anchors
causing less damage to our precious
landscapes
the frame is sturdy easy to use and sets
up in seconds
ripstop nylon makes the Tanic durable
it's designed to provide plenty of
storage space to keep your gear or a
furry companion safe and dry with
pockets above and beside you your items
are easy to access while you relax it
fits in an easy to carry bag making it
perfect for car trips events or your
