it with you this is the peak design
travel tripod and it comes with me
everywhere for decades tripods have been
mostly negative space wouldn't it be
great if you could fit a full-featured
tripod into half that volume we sure
thought so we spent the last four years
redesigning the tripod from the ground
up creating a totally unique
architecture that removes dead volume
and maximizes portability with legs
column hug and head that fit together
perfectly
we created the tool we believed a tripod
should be
a tool designed for use in the field
with robust easy to use cams rapidly
deploying legs an instant secure camera
connection the result is a tripod that
deploys faster than any other in its
category intuitive and low-profile touch
points no guessing which knob to turn or
how far to turn in just one precision
engineered ring for simple and smooth
articulation exceptional strength even
with heavy ProGear but this is a tripod
for all cameras even the one in your
pocket with a universal phone note that
Stow's away magically shoot confidently
in any environment on any terrain
getting any point of view with the gear
you already own or argue use it with
peak design bags straps and clips
a beautiful and unmistakable silhouette
available in anodized aluminum alloy or
ultralight carbon-fiber imagine being
able to snap your fingers and become
fluent in 20 languages I know it sounds
impossible but at Waverley Labs we've
been working on that for years to make
it a reality we've started our journey
in 2014 a team of engineers developers
experts in language technology working
together to create the pilot smart
earbuds the earbuds were the first in
history to offer live language
translation and sold nearly 40,000 units
across the globe since then we've been
hard at work re-engineering every detail
of the device for the freshman users
meet ambassador ambassador works by
uploading the user speech into the cloud
or neural network generates a new
recording in the language of your choice
how did last night assignment go a
further haveta manically al-mahdi etsy
Kenna Gaiden can I make I'm just gonna
watch learners of the Episode IV it was
alright but there was one problem I
didn't get can I take a look during our
research you studied the tools used by
professional interpreters by taking
inspiration and going one step further
we gave ambassador the capability to
deliver natural professional-grade
translation when do you think the
materials will arrive on site you can't
wait to see it I'll ship but she pulled
out a cinch I should say oh sure there's
also wood it seems that the earliest is
the end of May I'll have to push back
launch then accurate translation starts
with high fidelity speech recognition
that's why we equipped ambassador with
an advanced microphone array and signal
processing algorithms so it's able to
record the user speech with an
incredible level 30
see kid okay to be single to tote onion
oh yes I believe I have that one wrong
as well another thing we learned from
our customers was that ambassador needed
to be effortless to share so we
engineered specific Bluetooth protocols
that allow you to sync multiple devices
to one smartphone it's an innovation
that makes sharing the device a truly
smooth experience and by shifting from
an earbud to an over-the-air design
we've made that process not only easy
but also extremely hygienic our
translation engine currently supports
the dozens of languages and dialects
allowing for professional-grade
translation all over the world and
that's what ambassador is a world
without language barriers
meet flick to the perfect button so what
do you do when you wake up turn on the
lights put on some energizing music
listen to a podcast or the news but
awesome coffee maybe
what if pushing a button could do all of
that for you I could have done all that
with my phone or by using my voice but
instead of pulling up my phone and going
through different apps or waiting for my
voice assistant to wake up it's just so
much easier to push a button we love
buttons neat flick to the perfect button
you see we all have routines we have
different routines but we all have them
let me explain if we can reduce your
everyday routines into a simple push of
a button for example a leading home
button coffee is ready button in your
office or just a more conveniently
placed light switch in your home but
it's not just about the routines our
first generation flick has been helping
people get creative all over the world
with everything from a simple doorbell a
button to notify who's got mail a
push-to-talk button and a medication
tracker that also shares it with your
loved ones in case they need to remind
you once in a while but due to the
limitations of our current platform all
these amazing features have been
isolated from the rest of the community
so we've taken all of our learnings from
the past five years with over 40 million
button pushes and redesigned everything
from the ground up to create the perfect
smart button and here's what's new first
off say hello to the open flip platform
where you're no longer limited to the
features that we build but where any
feature built by anyone will be made
available to the entire community it's
got a better range better battery it's
more durable it's got a great clip
offers better feedback at a lower price
and thanks to the new open platform
we're also able to introduce
multi app support meaning you can snooze
your morning alarm app while turning on
the music in another we've got some
great apps lined up that will integrate
Flake throughout the year we're also
launching a new flick hub with improved
performance and Bluetooth long range and
it's got no microphones I'm in did you
tell them about home kit I'm getting
there so we can finally confirm that
apple homekit support will be coming out
to the flick hub later this year we've
been around for a while we've
successfully launched and delivered on
two campaigns before we shipped flicks
to every corner of the world partnered
with some of the largest companies out
there so we know what we're doing but we
are not a big tech company and that's
why we need your support we go to great
lengths to protect our staff but is it
enough four times we are unsure there's
a minute gap it goes here here here or
even here minute code detects movement
since is anything that opens and tracks
anything that moves with up to a three
month battery life recharge ready with
alarms alerts and warning lights
follow its location in real time
anywhere in the world
use the Aptus at exact alarms and
triggers or to scan the object and area
that said skills quickly automatically
go from taillight to alarm then alarm
the taillight hey if you care about your
stuff go Mimico we want one of the
biggest startup competition in Europe
then we got our first investment and
fast-forward we sold 14,000 units regard
to feedbacks of our customers and we
improve the product and we added
Internet connectivity and sophisticated
software we develop Mimico with months
of intense research and development we
work with product testers and improve
its capabilities our team behind this
success have a passion to bring personal
security with highest
