price fire started in early 2015 with
the idea of making cyclists safer on the
road and more noticeable
basically the bikes bugs who removable
handlebar grips have lights and
indicators on the eureka moment came one
night when I was sitting with a friend
having dinner and I think that day I
think drive-ins working nearly had a
collision with a cyclist who jumper
light and I was just like why didn't he
indicate from saying why didn't indicate
I said why don't we have indicators on
his bicycle and from there it all lid on
why don't have it depends on his bicycle
at night you can't even see them
why does he have two lights on his bike
why are they either five milic until the
little bicycle and gradually I knew I
was on to something
so two years down the line here we are
we've had a lot of prototypes a lot of
designing but we've got what we finally
won right spark has many useful elements
first one being the colobus on the end
of the grip it looks on your bike phase
they're quite simply it's there so that
when you park up your bike can remove
the bright sparks
stick it in your bag and it's secure
no-one's going to steal it when your
bikes plug we also have the indicator
which is operated with your thumb it's a
button that you simply hold down power
half a second your indicators will shine
front and back as well as the laser
indicating onto the ground so that
people 360 degrees around you will see
that you're indicating rather than just
the people directly
while you're indicating your handlebar
will vibrate will remind you that the
indicated on there's nothing worse than
a five bit cycling down a straight road
indicating when they're not actually
turning anywhere where the sizes index
finger is is a button for the light it
has four settings which is 75 loom in
150 300 and 300 strobe and it's a simple
push to go through the cycle at the back
of the bike spot there's a bun and
inside there's a microUSB port which is
suspense of charging up most thing then
the battery life if you use it on the
high it will last about find out
so the summarized using provide spark
could only be a good thing to have
indicators day and night where you don't
have to take your hands off the
handlebars if you don't want to you can
keep them on there and certainly at
night wind like it's the hardest using
having two headlights will always be a
benefit having one and obsolete in
roller create more harmony on the road

VTEC unicorn is a climbers vision a
sculptors dream the future of cycling in
a lightweight job
smart yes and like every unicorn one of
a kind I used to love biking as a kid
but as a kid you have lots of energy
you're eating a lot of sugar as you get
older people tend to ride their bikes
less and less often one of the reasons
being that they have to go to work they
have to do things where they don't want
to be arriving to their destination
sweaty with electric bikes you not only
have the advantage of being able to
arrive to your destination in a more
composed manner but you're also able to
extend the range of where you want to
travel so instead of maybe having to
take your vehicle somewhere now you can
easily take your electric bike there my
name is Oscar stark I'm an engineer and
I've been working with in the renewable
energy field for the last several years
once the inception of electric bikes
came around I got really interested in
having electric bike myself one of the
things that was holding me back from
owning one was the fact that they were
so expensive so I started investigating
why do they cost thousands of dollars
and we actually couldn't find anything
that made electric bikes really
expensive except for the battery packs
that were available at the time this is
why we came upon to build an electric
bike for the masses that was affordable
and with my team we were able to find a
factory that was willing to produce
these electric bikes for us I had a
price that was almost unbelievable one
of the things that I've noticed in the
electric bike market is these bikes look
really electric they have these big ugly
batteries attached to them we wanted to
make it look like a normal bicycle plus
we wanted to have an electric bike where
you are able to secure it in such a way
that it would be impossible for someone
to steal your electric bike what we've
done here with the electric bike is you
have your options you can either go with
the throttle meaning that you don't have
to pedal whatsoever and you can get to
your destination without having to worry
about being sweaty or being warm but if
you're looking to exercise you can
adjust the assist mode that comes with
so the lowest one providing you very
little assist but you can still get a
bit of a workout and would be highest
one you're almost making no effort as
long as you're pedaling another thing
that we discovered is by the time that
you do get an electric bike to your door
that electric bike has actually gone
through several different middlemen so
something that you know might have costs
twenty or thirty dollars for example
ends up costing you 200 or 300 dollars
when it gets to your doors our goal with
this campaign is to really launch
electric bikes into the mainstream so
that anyone that was interested in
getting electric bike really the cost
should no longer be a factor for them
it's the same thing with the cell phone
revolutions anyone with a flip phone
nowadays they would have that more as a
retro fashion accessory everyone else
has a smartphone and if you don't have a
smartphone the question is why this is
the same kind of thing that we're
looking to achieve with our Stark Drive
electric bikes everyone should have an
electric bike and if you don't have an
electric bike that's fine you want to be
retro and you want to live in the past
that's really cool but ultimately you're
probably going to have that retro bike
for the weekends and then when you're
out going to work you're going to be
using an electric bike
