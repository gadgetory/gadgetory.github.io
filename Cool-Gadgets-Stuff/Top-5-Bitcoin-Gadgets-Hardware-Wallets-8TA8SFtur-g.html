is problematic because it's hard to
secure it there's private key that's in
your wallet if someone gets that key
they can get all of your bitcoins if you
lose that key you lose access so that
key is the key to everything in in the
Bitcoin world what that means is that
you have to you have to make sure that
your computer is secure I know some
people that go so far as to storing
their wallet on a computer of it never
goes online right because every time you
go online you run the risk of getting a
virus or getting a key logger where you
know somebody's gonna be able to record
your keystrokes
the alternative then is to store your
bitcoins with a service or on an
exchange or an online wallet but keeping
your bitcoins with a third party is also
problematic because you have to be able
to trust them the best way to keep your
key safe is to limit its exposure to the
internet keep key makes that simple the
private key is on the device and it
never leaves the device it's very hard
to do the wrong thing when you're using
a device like this you plug it into your
computer when you need it when you don't
need it you take it and you put it in
the safe you put it somewhere secure
nobody has access to your private key
the private key never leaves the device
when you get your key key it's really
easy to set up you have to install a
Chrome extension on your Chrome browser
and that's the software that allows you
to initialize and send transactions with
your Q key plug the device into your
computer and it will prompt you for a
name for the device and that's so that
you can distinguish between multiple
devices if you have more than one and
then it's going to ask you for a pin for
the device and that's the pin that
you'll need to enter when you want to do
a transaction and then the device is
going to one-time-only tell you what
your private key is so that you can
write it down and store that away as
let's say I want to buy a safe on
overstock.com so I go to their website I
find a safe that I want and I put it
into my shopping cart and go through the
checkout process and one of the options
there is to use bitcoins and so when I
click on that button the keep key
software pops up on your browser and it
automatically populates the details of
the transaction the address that it's
going to and the amount your kikyo is
going to ask for your PIN because it
wants to make sure that it's really you
and so then you confirm the transaction
on the device and it automatically sends
the signed transaction back to the
Chrome extension which automatically
broadcast the transaction to the Bitcoin
network and a week later you're safe
shows
hi I'm Chad Rick I've been investing in
cryptocurrency for the last five years
the recent Bitcoin exchange hacks
reminds me it's no longer safe to store
my bitcoins and other people's platforms
so I started to try using Bitcoin
wallets to secure my digital assets
I have tried both hot and cool wallets
on the market and this is what I found
most of the cryptocurrency wallets were
designed way back when digital currency
was invented which means they are either
out-of-date user unfriendly or lacked
basic functionality many do not even
support iOS and most importantly they
are not as secure as they claim so
that's why I invented who flew the
world's most secure cryptocurrency
hardware while gufu includes a
waterproof cryptocurrency smart hardware
wallet that secures your private keys
and a mother box that charges your
wallet wirelessly while storing your
signature in case your hardware wallet
gets lost or stolen as cryptocurrency
owners know your private keys are unique
and must be secured at all times for
that theft of your currency no matter
how unprotected your computer or
internet connection is as long as your
private key is safe your digital assets
are safe existing wallets can't totally
isolate the signing step from the
Bitcoin network even USB connection
hardware wallets can be hacked if your
computer is connected to the Internet
during the transaction khufu on the
other hand signs your transaction
completely offline to achieve that hoop
who sends the encrypted transaction data
via Bluetooth 4.0 which makes the
transaction virtually
the entire signing process only takes
about two seconds each wallet remembers
the unique Bluetooth MAC address that
only belongs to your cellphone when you
first created your wallet with hufo so
your wallet can never be paired with any
other phones most wallets are still
using the old generation chips which has
been hacked many times
fufu uses a unique highly encrypted
security X chip to provide another level
of security to protect your transaction
ditch the complicated password Wallis
gufu lets you access your wallet using
your highly secure yet simple and fast
fingerprint and face recognition
meanwhile the two factor authentication
ensures only you can use the access and
in wallet app now let me show you how
whoo food works step 1 turn on your
Bluetooth setting pair your phone with
your wallet step 2 login with your
fingerprint step 3 put in the address of
the person receiving your coins and the
amount you would like to send then press
send step 4
now the wallet signs the transaction in
an isolated environment and then sends
the transaction data back to blockchain
step 5
after the transaction being approved by
blockchain Hoopa will tell you your
transaction has successfully gone
through as soon as the transaction
completes the wallops Bluetooth
connection automatically terminates to
keep everything safe and the best thing
is your private keys are never held or
known by who foo or any other third
party
fufu is transparent backdoor free and
very easy to use it is a digital
currency wallet that supports multi
currency multiple crypto currencies
bitcoin ethereum and litecoin with who
Fu's real-time crypto currency price
monitor you can invest more wisely khufu
keeps your private key in the hardware
wallet and never exposes it the mother
box lets you recover your backup private
key even if your wallet is lost or
stolen the multiple levels of security
make it impossible for someone to steal
your digital currency
now you don't need to worry about your
digital currency disappear with hoof ooh
your digital assets are totally safe
hoopha the world's most secure wallet
for crypto currencies
