hi my name is Daniel and I'm the father
of thunder bling
I built countless prototypes to get
where we are today back when I was a
teenager I used to skate everywhere in
the city and wanted to go fast now a
user a given but I wanted more speed to
go anywhere water that was when I first
thought about voter ID inline skates but
at that time the technology didn't exist
yet a few years ago I searched for
electric skates but no one had made them
yet so I decided to build them myself
Thunder blade is a frame system it's
compatible with ufs and 165 millimeter
mounts Thunder blade has swappable
battery but if you want to just skate
like you would on normal inline skates
our partners come on fibers builds our
carbon frames with state-of-the-art
construction technology our electronics
it's also our partner so we will have
high quality and atronics for Thunder
blade how do you have come a long way to
develop our prototypes we need your help
to kick-start our production and bring
Thunder blade to reality please back us
to make this dream come true and join us
for the ride and let's storm the streets
this is linked it connects two or more
people together so they can find each
other

just pair two or more devices
and then follow the arrow and distance
right to your people

phones maps connectivity or
subscriptions have you ever been lost or
separated from your group been unsure at
a fork in the road anxiously waited for
