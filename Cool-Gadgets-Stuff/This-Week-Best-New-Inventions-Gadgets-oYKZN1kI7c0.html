didn't get the computer all day really
takes its toll on my back
yeah uh-huh
no I'm good it's super annoying I just
wish there was a later there is a way
you can fix your back pain the plexus
will plus the back the plexus will plus
is our brand-new patented wheel designed
to give you a full away spinal stretch
so you want to give the plexus wheel
plus a spin
that feels great
I don't felt this good in years I'd say
it's 10 out of 10 pain is gone what a
neat products if you COO coworkers are
like me you tried using other tools
exercise balls foam rollers problem with
those tools is they aren't designed to
fit between your shoulder blades
unlike the plexus wheel Plus which fits
easily allowing for an upper neck to
lower back stretch and plexus where we
are serious about spines our over 50,000
customers have been rolling out their
stress on the original plexus wheel for
over a year now during that time we
listen to their feedback the plexus
wheel plus has all the goodness of the
original but with added upgrades why am
i sitting shirtless next to this grand
fireplace on this faux bearskin rug
I don't know but I'm excited to see what
happens next this is Sarah we think
she's gonna help you focus while I talk
about the grotesque problems facing our
All American backs you see
20% of jobs in America are manual labor
and all that manual action can put a lot
of stress on your back but see the real
reason that our backs are hurting is the
nearly 80% of American jobs that require
mostly sitting at our office chairs we
sit all day at work causing our backs to
slowly contract into this position all
this lack of activity can cause
compressed nerves sore muscles and
sciatica yep
your back feels gross for the plexus
wheel plus we engineered our thickest
ever super comfy compression mat the mat
design features a spinal canal so it's
more comfortable on your back and
because your spine presses deeper into
the mat the muscles lining your
vertebrae are stretched horizontally as
well as vertically allowing for an
insanely relaxing four-way stretch
it's easy enough for everyone to use
preggers big boy even grande grande the
plexus will plus comes in three sizes
gentle medium and deep tissue hey feel
like you don't need all that plus the
original might suit you just fine
and our happy back guarantee means if
you don't like it send the dang thing
back for a full refund so if you have a
back the plexus wheel plus is for you
get yours today we are grow five a
company committed to the relentless
pursuit of better and we made a growing
shoe for growing feet to try to solve a
problem that's been around for as long
as people have been wearing shoes hi my
name is Kenton Lee I'm a long-haired
pastor from Idaho who had no business
creating this kind of a shoe but ten
years ago I was living at an orphanage
in Kenya and I had this idea for an
adjustable shoe after seeing kids that
were outgrowing shoes and had no access
for more so then I got home I grabbed my
lifelong friend Andrew and it took us
six years of rejection and obstacles and
persistence to work on this design but
we finally did it we made a growing shoe
called the shoe that grows and we
started a non-profit to try to get them
to kids around the world after
accidentally going viral
in 2015 it was crazy we have now
distributed over a hundred and seventy
five thousand pairs two kids in over a
hundred countries but we always had
people asking can i buy these for my
kids well this was never really our
intention we are focused on our mission
first but we started to see the value of
our shoes for every family and how a
commercial version could actually help
us achieve our mission even more so we
spent the last year refining our design
to make the shoes as functional and
durable as possible and more stylish and
comfortable than ever
and now for the first time anyone and
everyone can purchase the first
commercial style of our growing shoes we
call them expand Dalls an expanding
sandal that can grow five sizes and last
for years this sandal is perfect for
kids who constantly outgrow their shoes
the innovative design allows the sandal
to expand in three places
a simple toe piece lengthens the front
and then velcro straps on the sides
provide the ideal fit and the adjustable
heel piece brings it all together a
simple design and tough durability keep
the shoe lasting for years there's no
other footwear quite like expanding and
we want to invite you in to the mission
of our community here at Gro five shoes
that can grow and last are better for
families a design that does more with
less and lasts longer is better for our
planet and with each purchase of
expanding you help get more pairs of the
shoe that grows to kids in poverty
around the world you can be on the
ground floor of a new kind of footwear a
pair of shoes that grow with your
support for our Kickstarter campaign
with your purchase for your kids or for
a gift for someone else or even a pair
for you we can make the first batch and
use something really simple to start
something really special when we were
first getting started they said it
wasn't a good idea and it would never
work but we didn't settle for the status
quo because we believe that kids around
the world kids in your family and the
planet that we love deserves a better
pair of sandals and we'd be honored if
you would join us thank you
you
everyone deserves great art this is why
we created ken via a smart digital
display designs to make choosing showing
and enjoying art as simple as opening an
app sometimes the galleries in art world
can seem stuffy and intimidating the
cost of buying art or even just framing
prints can be very high and even if you
do find art that you like and is of good
value it might not match with your rooms
decor and over time your tastes might
change which wouldn't leave it feeling
out of place solving these problems was
a key inspiration for Canada which uses
cutting-edge hardware and proprietary
image processing technology to present
any artwork as a high quality print and
conserve original artwork details such
as color texture contrast and even
individual brushstrokes to make the
display look as realistic as possible
whatever the environment we realize we
needed ken via to capture ambient light
reflections just like a print we
therefore developed art sense technology
which actively responds to surrounding
lighting conditions and dynamically
adjusts the display accordingly with
cambia scene is believing
oh wow
looks like a real painting
it almost seems like I can see the
brushstrokes coming off the page and you
can tell that this is an oil ad because
it's got the textures that actually
popped out on the painting itself the
colors are Silver's like vivid too
bright
Wow
this one right here what they're
waterfowl are you kidding me it looks
like a real painting you buy an
intuitive app users can select art from
a massive online library organized into
curated playlists of artists IRA's media
and even for specific moods and
occasions our recommendation engine also
suggests works based on a user's
selections and current decor along with
the classics of art history we're also
working with contemporary artists
through our partnership program to
foster a community of creators it's
important to us that artists are
compensated for their time and talent
and so exhibiting partners will receive
a share of our revenues users can also
create personal playlist or upload their
own images by an online portal USB micro
SD or the app additional options to
display information about works and even
zoom into images to highlight key
artistic details enables users to become
their own curators with cambia enjoying
great art in their home office and other
living spaces has never been simpler
can be a experience are invoke curiosity
Auggie bathroom mirrors make it
difficult to get ready in the morning
and wiping them doesn't help because
after a few moments they're fogged up
again a fc film is a better way to keep
mirrors and other glass surfaces fog
free and to improve visibility in wet
conditions AFC film is the easiest way
to prevent foggy mirrors and windows and
can increase your visibility use AFC
film on your swimming goggles for a fog
free swim or on your next motorcycle
ride when the weather isn't as friendly
as you'd like it to be
anti-fog sprays and wipes break down
quickly leaving large patches of
unprotected surfaces that can fog up
making reapplication a necessity but AFC
film is designed to last for up to two
years apply once and enjoy fog free
visibility that lasts a special super
hydrophilic coating on AFC film makes
water droplets flatten out so they can
slide off instead of beating up this
coating lets the water form a thin layer
that acts more like the glass surface
allowing for increased and undistorted
visibility it takes just a few seconds
to apply AFC film to any mirrored or
glass surface premium cut AFC film to
match any shape you need or enlarger
sheets for multi-purpose application it
comes in specific sizes for different
goggle types AFC film can be applied to
both flat and curved surfaces AFC film
when visibility counts</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
