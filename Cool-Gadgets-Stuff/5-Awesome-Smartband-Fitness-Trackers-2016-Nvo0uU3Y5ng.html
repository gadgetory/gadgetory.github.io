the wristwatch simple elegant designed
to be glanced at in passing we design
the Nabu not to replace your watch or
phone but to work in conjunction with
them allows you to quickly glance at
your notifications and Fitness data etc
and decide whether or not you need to
stop what you're doing and invest the
time into pulling out your phone that's
why the NA Blues private message screen
is on the underside it only turns on
when activated by a turn of your wrist
which also saves battery no one likes
being around the guy who stares into his
phone the whole time they're out anyway
oh here you go
I'm example the dad will gives me a
subtle vibration instead of putting on a
loud flashing rave to notify me and with
the turn of my wrist I can see that
Travis is calling of course we're not
going to answer so we shake it off easy
discreet also pretty satisfied the Nabu
tracks your steps walk distance traveled
calories burnt hours slept and more and
interface through the companion Apple on
your phone but it's not all just about
you we want to be different we want you
to interact with other people that's why
we designed the novel with fandom and
communication abilities kind of like a
Nintendo 3ds to StreetPass functionality
it will reach out to other nabu heirs so
you can be a part of a greater social
network out in the real world the
potential for this is huge multiplayer
games on the streets social discovery
the possibilities are only limited by
your imagination
Inaba is open platform the sdk is
already available and developers are
already working on all sorts of
applications for iOS and Android maybe
your idea could be the next big thing
