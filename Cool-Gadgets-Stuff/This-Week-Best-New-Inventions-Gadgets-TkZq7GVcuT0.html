not need another car Eli is a new breed
of automaker and we want to challenge
the idea what a car can be we started
with a few simple goals to empower short
trips to have a design that makes sense
for modern cities to have a minimal
impact on environment and most
importantly to be affordable by everyone
well I was studying architecture in New
York I realized the biggest disruption
to urban design was the elevator by
empowering vertical movement elevators
transformed cities that's when I
realized a simple vehicle has the power
to reshape or communities I'm proud to
say we have accomplished that and so
much more we reinvented any V category
and created the most compact intuitive
and energy-efficient vehicle we like to
think of Eli there--oh
as the iPad if conventional cars were
laptops it provides a radically
simplified and superior experience for
local trips and the best part is Eli's
era only cost a third of a normal phone
manufacturing was my family's
from lawn mowers to golf carts so I know
it's a rare opportunity to be able to
create something that can have a
profound impact in people's everyday
life whether you're going to the gym
grabbing some food or going to the
market
Eli Xero makes it easy to get from A to
B
I have to say the expand' quick-release
system is a brilliant design it easily
snaps in place and lies flat against
your shoes it's reversible so it stays
hidden if you're wearing slacks or pants
and won't come undone or loosen up even
on your kiddos shoes and when you're
ready to release simply pull the tab and
flip up you can also just slip your
shoes on and leave it unlocked for a
comfortable casual fit we quickly
realize this product is quite useful for
many different applications outside of
just shoes and our one-piece design is
bulletproof in comparison to other
products that require two separate
pieces and a spring in order to function
not only was our design simpler it was
much more effective when it came to the
holding power our design held over 30
pounds of pressure before any slippage
occurred this means our single clip
holds as much pressure as four of these
other Clips combined and installation is
extremely simple lace your shoes up
slide the lock down snap in place
install the pull tab and you're good to
go each pack will include everything you
need to complete one pair of shoes we
also wanted to make sure you get a
perfect match so we're offering over 40
colors to choose from if you think that
expand quickly system is a good fit for
yourself your kids your parents your
grandparents or anyone else in your
family I would love to have you onboard
as a backer so we can place a huge
initial purchase order with our
manufacturers and get the system in your
hands by mid summer when you think of
home security
what comes to mind the peephole
the chain lock may be the classic stark
warning but you were probably thinking a
bit more high-tech introducing yuffie
ever cam the first of its kind home
security system that gives you
everything you want with none of the
hassles no need for wires and no need to
deal with frequent battery changes 365
days of battery life we partnered with
anchor and put their most advanced
battery technology inside the ever camp
and by using a low frequency
transmission signal to stay connected on
standby mode saving energy by up to 70%
ever cam will keep on working for up to
a year without needing to be recharged
with the adjustable ball shape mount
ever cam can be positioned and
repositioned use either the single screw
mounting base or skip the mounting
hardware the magnetic 1080p HD camera
will just stick to all kinds of metal
surfaces BAM ever cam with stands
temperature changes and moisture so you
really can put it just about anywhere
motion triggered and Wi-Fi connected
ever cam sends you a notification when
someone's at the door or someone's on
the sofa even when someone is raiding
the fridge the artificial intelligence
uses a three-phase system to ensure you
see what you want to see and ignore what
you don't step 1 it's able to screen out
movement that doesn't have a heat
signature using an infrared sensor step
2 it detects human body shapes in
various positions and step 3 facial
recognition technology allows ever cam
to recognize faces of people you want to
give clearance to or keep a closer eye
on so just set your preferences to send
an alert when it matters and ignore it
when it doesn't oh yeah and it has
two-way audio Brian step away from the
peace
we are the first to put an SD card into
a Homebase securely storing 60 days of
footage locally no need to go to the
cloud no up charges or monthly contracts
we have a great team of top engineers
software developers AI experts and we
are working with industry leading
manufacturers to make all this happen
we've built an amazing system that's
ready to go right out-of-the-box easy to
set up yourself without compromising
security but we need your help to take
what we have and get it to market no one
else is offering a wireless camera with
a year of battery life and ever cam just
keeps getting better by the day there
are a ton of other great features so
make sure you check out all the stuff on
our campaign page we have suppliers in
place the prototype is done all we need
is your support
the single-use plastic straws yeah just
right there don't you know that plastic
straws are bad for the environment what
is this
if you're gonna suck suck on this this
is final straw the world's first
collapsible reusable totally badass draw
straws are supposed to be convenient
right so we decided to do something
about it this is final straw final straw
folds up to the size of a car key and
fits in this sexy case final straw is
small enough to fit in your purse or
pocket but if you don't have pockets you
can just uh-oh where'd it go if you can
remember your keys when you leave the
house you'll remember your straw it fits
on your keychain so there's no way
you're gonna leave it in your car and
there's no need to worry about keeping
it clean included in each straw is a
specially-designed squeegee simply pull
it through the straw to make sure it's
squeaky clean
final straw is BPA free dishwasher safe
and with our patented design the ends
are soft so it's safe for human children
and their adults there you go little
buddy
this straw may seem small but because of
its size it's actually very harmful to
the environment
straws can't be recycled so they're
often left here in the ocean where they
hurt and kill my friends in the sea
thank oh go be free since you've hit
play on this video we've discarded this
many straws in the US alone pretty bad
right included in each straw are some of
these little cards next time you're at a
restaurant leave one with the bill and
let them know to only serve straws upon
request there's a movement happening and
you can be at the front of it together
we can make a really big impact and save
our oceans one straw at a time this is
final straw suck responsibly
play music
of our air is influenced by the places
we live in breathing healthy air and
staining contact with nature makes us
feel better happier more productive and
live better but unfortunately we spend
almost 90% of our time indoors and even
if we don't realize that indoor air can
be really polluted the World Health
Organization has in fact stated that
indoor air can be up to five times more
polluted than outdoor air but how can we
improve the quality of the air and the
better with not a day
Clary's new product it's been created to
bring healthy fresh air and be the most
beautiful design object you will ever
have on the market right now there are
only ugly and traditional air purifiers
their work with expensive filters that
have to be replaced often so the
intuition was his nature some plants in
fact have a special ability to eliminate
the most common toxic agents in the air
thanks to microorganisms that live in
their roots
nough today thanks to a technology unit
amplifies these properties we created
the most amazing natural air purifier on
the market and thanks to your support it
was an incredible success more than
2,000 bakers from other 52 countries in
the world believed in us and are now
loving the product we won several awards
and most of all our team grew from only
three of us to almost 20 people so we
really grew up and also clear up and
here we are ready to launch the new
Clery let's start with design ena today
is extremely up-to-date elegant and
beautiful obviously we made it
eco-friendly and recyclable with an
astonished
new biomaterial R&amp;amp;D goes on we are
working with the best laboratories and
universities in Europe we also added a
new incredible filtration process
photocatalysis Nutella is now able to
eliminate VOCs bacteria virus fine
particulate and others and remember
there are no filters to change and if
the early product that creates fresh new
air its falsi we worked a lot with fluid
dynamics experts and this improved the
purification performance range a lot and
also the capacity of the self watering
system has increased nutella's
technology unit is now more powerful and
silent we also redesign and edit more
sensors you will have the best ones to
measure your air quality
and now with the new LED interface you
just have to take a look at nap today
to know about the air quality in your
space the app is great check the air
quality in real time for the analytics
and much more
thanks to Wi-Fi and now so bluetooth nap
today can be connected to really
everything it will be always with you
and monitor the situation for you
what hasn't changed the importance of
plants and nature of course and our
mission to find new solutions to bring
fresh air technology and beautiful
design for years</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
