rooms and is better for the environment

result you can carry eight cards plus
cash and an ultra-thin and minimalistic
wallet it's just better engineering we

glasses in the market are too conceptual
expensive and have an overall bad user
experience we hope to create smart
glasses that are simple convenient
affordable and suitable for daily life
we created music lens smart glasses the
smart glasses that can listen to music
answer calls and listen to FM radio
music lens are easy to carry and look
just like normal glasses so other people
are totally unaware that you are
listening to music on them your ears
remain free but you can still hear
high-quality audio through music lens
while other people can't hear what
you're listening to music lens is
suitable for activities that are
convenient with headphones such as
driving cycling having meetings and
studying in class with music lens you
can answer your calls with high sound
quality and annoys the environment
music lens picks up local FM radio
signals directly so you can easily
listen to the radio music lens also has
touch controls and smart facial
recognition which automatically pauses
the audio when you take the glasses off
music lens does not transmit sound
through your eardrums so wearing them
for a long time won't hurt your ears in
addition to protecting hearing music
lens also helps people with ruptured
eardrums or hearing loss to hear sounds
compared to other music glasses music
lens is much more advanced and
substantially ahead of the curve in
terms of sound quality sound leak
reduction and appearance
we believe that wearable smart devices
will not only make people's lives more
convenient but also perfectly combine
technology with current fashion trends
we hope that music lens will be your
first pair of smart glasses bringing you
a more convenient life and a more
elegant and cooler lifestyle
music lens audio glasses wear music lens
and start your trendy music life

to change color in response to a certain
stimulus our new technology allows the
