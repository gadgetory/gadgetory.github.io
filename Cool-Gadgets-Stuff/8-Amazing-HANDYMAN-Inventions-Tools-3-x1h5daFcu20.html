this here the bricky main pimply key
features four stainless steel spring
clogs porpoise beam when you lay it on
the course they keep the tool simpler
than players we learn the closed end up
here at the end of a wall to begin get
on water into the cutaway section press
a tome into a scrape it across just like
so
no coolant here gives the perfect square
pair to begin who will know swing the
tool around and as you see the back and
hero to open its bridge so as we
reposition it on the wall slide the tool
along as we go pressing our mortar dome
into the cutaway section and scraping it
across we come to the corner now look at
this the log underneath hits a corner
brick we finish perfect we come round
again to look at the back here ensures
we join on to perfection and away we go
again all design for speed and ease so
when we come to putting on a brick we
just gently press the dome into that
with the perfect template now again to
settle at the end of a brick pointed in
remove the excess remove the guide the
perfect perfect joint knows well to put
on our next brick again just gently
pressing that home to give you that toy
secure 10 millimeter joint note all
around your brick no we need to come to
the far end of a wall set off the end as
well
to pull a string line so we get perfect
straight lines I bring you the message
me it's my second invention again pure
simplicity here a set of metal brackets
the keeping the lip here on the top
which ensures when you settle on the
corner of your brick you're lying
cannot slip we can no place on the
bricks within the course
we just bring the top edge of our brick
know the meter spring line here you have
it with uniform clean joint with perfect
straight lines
we just need to point upper joints so my
final invention the pro pointer what's
unique about this it's multi-dimensional
you were 12
King II and 6 millimeter pointing
surface one of them will always get in
and strike up your joint and give you
that perfectly pointed finish just get
out there and build something beautiful
because remember you can build
giant ladders here to show you one of
our newest ladders called the velocity
starts off just a little over four foot
seven inches tall but if you need a five
foot six foot or a seven foot high
stepladder it's as simple as rotating it
straight open like this now if you want
to work on ground that's not level
whether that's ramps sloping ground or
staircases you literally can take this
ladder right up the stairs with you as
you go now the one I use the most around
my home when you want to get close to a
window or wall normal ladders the higher
you go up the further from the wall or
window you get but watch this we're
going to drop this down to a 90 degree
angle get right next to that tight
corner it's much easier to work in those
tight spots now when you need to get up
a little bit higher just rotate this
straight open and now you have what's
equivalent to a 17 foot we need two
extension ladder now that's 15 feet tip
to tip but you can reach 17 when you're
working on it it has the wide flares at
the top and at the bottom plus we use
rubber feet instead of plastic
remember rubber grips plastic slips
bring it back down
you're gonna store this again just a
little over 4 feet 7 inches tall but one
of the great things about the velocity
you'll notice at the bottom it has
wheels so you'll never have to carry a
ladder again just wheel it from place to
place that right there is the easiest
you'll ever carry a 17 foot ladder
inside of a house without knocking paint
off the walls we do make the velocity in
a 13 foot which is three foot seven the
model 17 which is a four foot seven and
one foot taller the model 22 velocity
great ladder great addition to your home
and all the tools you use around it
