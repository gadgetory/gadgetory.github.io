budget and your planet maybe you bike as
much as possible or maybe you've been
meaning to get into it but the reality
on the street often makes your ride
challenging we wanted to give riders
total confidence on the road by making
them visible from every direction that's
why we designed monkey lights
we've been making monkey lights since
2007 our lights are known for being
incredibly bright durable and fun
in 2013 we kick-started the first video
bike wheel the monkey light Pro since
then we've talked to thousands of monkey
light users around the world they keep
telling us just how confident they feel
when they ride monkey lights were
originally designed to be fun and
visible now we're ready to take the next
step with sleek new designs that are
ridiculously easy to use with our third
generation of monkey lights you just
ride your bike and they work their magic
all the lights feature our new fully
automatic technology they reliably turn
on when you need them and they securely
lock into your spokes this way you won't
lose your lights and you'll never forget
to turn them on these third-generation
lights also feature our new hub mounted
rechargeable battery the battery lasts
for months of normal usage and it pops
out easily to charge from any USB port
our lights are great for every kind of
bike in any type of rider and now we're
able to make them more affordable than
ever
so why monkey lights well take a look at
this this is how a bike looks with
traditional front and rear lights now
look at it
with monkey lights all of our monkey
lights are clearly visible from every
direction by illuminating the wheels the
moving light greatly increases
visibility even on a crowded street the
speed and direction of the rider can be
seen as well
monkey lights light up the road and make
every ride more safe and more fun
hi I'm Paul Gallagher the inventor Beck
shifter the patent-pending universal
wireless gear shifting system this is
how we've been shifting gears on bikes
for decades and this is the ex shifter
Wireless shifting is smart shifting it's
fast and it's precise so why do you need
smart shifting that's the sound of the
chain rubbing it's annoying and it wears
out your drivetrain it's a sound that
drives every cyclist crazy next shift
your smart phone to eliminate that by
automatically synchronizing your front
and your rear derailleurs recreational
professional riders can all benefit from
smart shifting let's check it out
Multi shift press and hold and jump two
or three gears
hold a bit longer and you shift the
entire range you can configure the press
time to your liking intuitive and fast
with the semi-auto function you only
need to press up and down and the ex
shifter will automatically shift your
front and rear derailleurs to the
optimum gear ratio think of it as the
automatic transmission and a car take
your mind off shifting so you can enjoy
your ride
manual mode
the remote has four configurable buttons
each button can be assigned a function
for example if you are left-handed you
can easily invert the standard settings
for a one by system you could have the
right side on manual shift and left side
for a dropper post
Hector is universal it connects to your
existing derailleur it fits any bike any
frame any brand of derailleurs and it
works with a precision of plus or minus
ten microns hex shifter can be used on
road bikes mountain bikes tandems
recumbents hand cycles and even dropper
poles
anyone can enjoy the advantages of ex
shifter I used to love biking as a kid
but as a kid you have lots of energy
you're eating a lot of sugar as you get
older people tend to ride their bikes
less and less often one of the reasons
being that they have to go to work they
have to do things where they don't want
to be arriving to their destination
sweaty with electric bikes you not only
have the advantage of being able to
arrive to your destination in a more
composed manner but you're also able to
extend the range of where you want to
travel so instead of maybe having to
take your vehicle somewhere now you can
easily take your electric bike there
my name is Oscar stark I'm an engineer
and I've been working with in the
renewable energy field for the last
several years
once the inception of electric bikes
came around I got really interested in
having electric bike myself one of the
things that was holding me back from
owning one was the fact that they were
so expensive so I started investigating
why do they cost thousands of dollars
and we actually couldn't find anything
that made electric bikes really
expensive except for the battery packs
that were available at the time this is
why we came upon to build an electric
bike for the masses that was affordable
and with my team we were able to find a
factory that was willing to produce
these electric bikes for us at a price
that was almost unbelievable
one of the things that I've noticed in
the electric bike market is these bikes
look really electric they have these big
ugly batteries attached to them we
wanted to make it look like a normal
bicycle plus we wanted to have an
electric bike where you are able to
secure it in such a way that it would be
impossible for someone to steal your
electric
like what we've done here with the
electric bike is you have your options
you can either go with the throttle
meaning that you don't have to pedal
whatsoever and you can get to your
destination without having to worry
about being sweaty or being warm but if
you're looking to exercise you can
adjust the assist mode that comes with
the bicycle so the lowest one providing
you very little assist that you can
still get a bit of a workout and would
be highest one you're almost making no
effort as long as you're pedaling
another thing that we discovered is by
the time that you do get an electric
bike to your door that electric bike has
actually gone through several different
middlemen so something that you know
might have costs twenty or thirty
dollars for example ends up costing you
200 or 300 dollars when it gets to your
door our goal with this campaign is to
really launch electric bikes into the
mainstream so that anyone that was
interested in getting electric bike
really the cost should no longer be a
factor for them it's the same thing with
the cell phone revolution anyone with a
flip phone nowadays they would have that
more as a retro fashion accessory
everyone else has a smartphone and if
you don't have a smartphone the question
is why this is the same kind of thing
that we're looking to achieve with our
Stark Drive electric bikes everyone
should have an electric bike and if you
don't have an electric bike that's fine
you want to be retro and you want to
live in the past that's really cool but
ultimately you're probably going to have
that retro bike for the weekends and
then when you're out going to work
you're going to be using an electric
bike
hi I'm Daniel at scowl ski let me
introduce you a skunk lock we all know
that gut-wrenching feeling of coming
back and your bike's gone that won't
happen
with a skunk lock skunk lock is a
bicycle lock that was designed with a
built-in deterrent it can actually stop
a thief from stealing your bike lock
manufacturers won't tell you the fact
that any you lock can be compromised
with the right tools the truth is any
lock can be cut in a minute or less and
that's why 1.5 million bikes are stolen
each year let's not worry about
electronics which can fail or a crook
with an angle grinder let's pressurize a
unique chemical compound into the lock
but first if the lock is compromised
skunk lock is manufactured with the
highest quality materials we can find
we've extensively tested our prototypes
for your safety and convenience it
doesn't look like any other you lock on
the market and unlike any other you lock
a thief will get a noxious surprise if
they try to steal your bike when it
comes to the challenge of delivering a
skunk lock to your door we're ahead of
the crowdfunding curve we have
manufacturing in place and they're ready
to build upon receiving our first order
and skunk lock comes with easy key
replacement how would it feel if you
never have to worry about your bike
being stolen again join the revolution
and grab a skunk lock it could be the
last lock you ever buy
what if all cars had a single light in
the center strange then why do we only
have one light in front of our bicycle
introducing luma a 360 degree light
system that shows your true width while
cycling it combines all the lights
needed on your bike front lights rear
lights and side lights all integrated
into the bicycles grips three different
lights at each end of your handlebar
never worry again about leaving your
lights home or having them stolen the
grips feature a solid core for easy
installation and lock-on rings for
secure fastening luma meets all the
legal requirements even in countries
with strict regulations such as Denmark
or Norway
though it makes you visible luma itself
is almost invisible it has a compact
elegant design that does not interfere
with the looks of your bike the body is
made of aircraft-grade aluminum the same
alloy used for helicopters and airplanes
it's tough almost indestructible we've
paid special attention to the surface
finish anodized ultra sonic cleaned and
hand brushed for a premium look finally
each set comes with built-in lithium
batteries that are easily charged
through a standard microUSB port
we love bicycles and we love to cycle we
want to have a product that is not just
good but one that advances the frontiers
of visibility and traffic safety help us
spread the word and save the world
get a luma for someone you care for
it's not just the light it's all you
need to see and be seen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
