by a true rotary compressor it is the
world's most revolutionary portable air
conditioner it is the zero breeze mark
ii in 2014 we can see the idea of making
a true battery powered portable air
conditioner the technical challenges
were massive and it was considered
almost impossible but in 2016 we turned
that into reality with the help of more
than 4,000 supporters around the world
we managed to raise over 1.6 million
dollars for the original zero breeze it
set our ambitious journey since then now
after three years of intense Rd we're
back with a more powerful completely
redesigned zero breeze mark - to change
the game again the mark 2 has major
upgrades applied inside and out
with our more powerful patented 24 volt
sine wave frequency controlled rotary
compressor the cooling power gets a 200%
boost the outlet temperature may now
drop up to 30 degrees Fahrenheit within
10 minutes the mark 2 is also attired
with an all new dual hose design with
the newly equipped centrifugal fan both
the front and rear outlet have received
a significant efficiency lift the
isolation circulatory system between
indoor and outdoor air cools twice as
fast
but 40% more efficient
zero breeze mark 2 has also expanded its
features with the newly added sleep mode
it keeps monitoring the surrounding
temperature and it keeps you in a
comfortable temperature all the time on
a hot and humid summer day out d
humidifying is as important as cooling
we've added a dedicated dehumidifier
mode this time with the combination of
both you can always stay cool and dry
we've also redesigned the battery it can
be attached to the main unit in seconds
with a whopping 630 watt hour capacity
it may keep the zero breeze mark 2 going
for 3 to 5 hours or the entire night of
sleep mode is activated the battery is
now equipped with two USB type-a a
12-volt DC and a new type c at the front
your phone laptop and other devices are
all covered
love digging through Dopp kits sorting
through slimy zip blocks and
interrupting make-out sessions between
hygiene products neither do we
this is the Tashtego travel game the
best way to keep all your travel

why are there so many closed doors in
life wouldn't the world open doors be
better the answer is yes but how can you
achieve
the beginning we started with some tests
and we've done some experiments just to
get into it
with brand-new technology to get the
most out of the product
but at some point we knew we need a
revolution
our first prototype was born and we
tested it under the toughest conditions
we would have done all of that if it
makes sense but it does obviously not
our product is simple and that's just
how it works
we are ID design and we develop the best
thoughts upon the world spring always
works it's easy to install and it has a
perfectly consistent functionality each
time we used our door service sticks
everywhere except sand the press and you
know what it's really easy to remove to
bring our vision to reality we need your
help now please support us for a world
with open doors
sneakers made from coffee yeah yeah it's
crazy we know but first hold on a little
back story at Rennes we spent the last
two years searching for the perfect
sneaker material and after endless
testing and prototyping we finally found
we love pop but we also know that it
comes at a cost
stay with me the world drinks two
billion cups every day and generates
money fun of waste that's why we chose
to take those grounds and mix with
recycled plastic bottles to make our
showstopper but what's it do for the
shoes coffee makes for a sneaker
material that fights odor is
antibacterial keeping your shoes fresh
all day long but it doesn't stop there
there's super light like walking on air
light and wet shoes are the worst so
that's why we made Ren's waterproof so
no puddles storm or stream can stop it
and waterproof usually means hot and
sweaty not rents our ultra thin liner
pitch the shoe breathable oh and comfort
we got comfort covered to give you the
support for the long regardless of the
terrain we know that great experience
can happen at any place or at any time
we want you to be ready for it also you
never have to miss your moment
we believe that by combining sustainable
materials with technology and style we
can create the world's best sneaker
without wasting precious resources from
our planet with your help we can change
what a shoe can be and give you the
perfect everyday shoe made from coffee
step into Ren's
and let nothing get in your way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
