day you can help 2.3 billion people who
don't have access to one of these just
one crap a day just one crap a day one

day so easy
who gives a crap toilet paper donate 50
percent of their profits to help build
toilets for those in need and it's
recycled just one clever day just one

Christmas ah listen just just give me a
second okay and I'll wrap this right up

cookies okay every year destroys me well

on the naughty list
oh yeah then I can put your Instagram
hashtag
You Know Who I am you have any idea put
it in the cloud with it thank you
thought you can't blackmail Santa look
Kringle
you never should have pinched off a hot
slice of fruitcake without using poo
curry poopourri
peppery the gift that stops thinking
since we're exchanging gifts here's one
for you next time it's Prince the ball
before you go and no one else will ever
know so you can keep sneaking without
reaching and your dingleberries will
smell like jingle berries everyone else
yeah Santa hurry up I really need to
take us
this is where your ice cream comes from
all creamy poop of a mystic unicorn
totally clean
totally cool and soft-serve straight
from a finger mm-hmm they're good at
pooping but you know such a pooping you
do this is when you sit on a porcelain
throne it's muscle to kink in the hose
and stop some Ben and Jerry's from
sliding out smoothly is that a problem
I don't know I hemorrhoids a problem
sitting at this angle can cause
hemorrhoids bloating constipation and a
bunch of other crap seriously you know
clone hemorrhoids the glitter hits
everywhere what what happens when you go
from sit to squat well arm is muscle
relaxant at kinko's away faster than
Pegasus neighing sweet sherbet Dookie
now your curl in Zeeland and ready for
battle that's because our bodies were
made to poop in a squat and now there's
a product that you squat in your own
home introducing the squadron's Holly no
squatty potty is not a joke and yes it
will give you the best cup of your life
guaranteed I don't just mean you bloated
Laden hemorrhoidal ladies I mean
everyone King Kong King pink honking
it's simple science really can't get the
last scoop out of the carton with a
squatty potty you get complete
elimination spend too much time on the
chamber plus the squatty potty makes you
go twice as fast so your money very cool
I scream you scream and clock club baby
maybe you're sore from squeezing out
solid globs of rocky road the squatty
potty business smooth stream of bro yo
that glides like a vergence wad plus
when you're done it tucks neatly out of
sight thanks to its innovative patented
design
truly a foot stool fit for a constipated
King so order your squatty potty today
I'm not saying it will make your poop as
soft as this cookies and cream but I'm
not saying it won't squatty potty the
stool for better stool pooping will
never be the same and neither will I
scream I want to yield
how does it taste is that delicious said
the best thing you've ever had in your
life there you are
they say this is good luck but good luck
or not it's still a mess and a mess like
this can't be clean with just paper you
need water to get the job done right
whether you're cleaning your car or your
hands so why when it comes to that do we
use just toilet paper bathroom goers
meet your new best friend
clap oh sorry Pete not you buddy
bathroom goers meet your new best friend
the swash 1400s it's a new seat for the
toilet you already have that will give
your butt the royal treatment it
deserves with a heated seat dual
positionable stainless steel nozzles
adjustable warm water spray at the touch
of a button and a warm air dryer your
butt will think you've died and gone
you get it so what's so great about bran
Del's new swash bidet seat
it's simple wash don't wipe it uses
water to clean the messes that can't be
clean with just paper he's always doing
stuff like that and with bran Del's
bidet Ct can because it has a citable
lid you think that'd be standard issue
at the day toilet seats right wrong
unlike most bidet seat lids rondelle
supports a person's weight meaning Pete
can use it however he wants
another great feature stainless steel
nozzles they're positionable because
they got to hit you in just the right
spot and there's self-sterilizing I mean
they're washing my butt they're washing
Pete's butt move you got to make sure
those things are clean man what's up
Pete
oh yeah that's another feature of
rondelle's new seat it has a nightlight
did I mention Braun bells nice wash the
day seat has customizable memory
settings that means I press one button
and get the seat temperature nozzle
position and water temperature I want I
don't have to remember anything because
my swash does it for me
are you kidding me
I think it's pretty clear now to
everyone that when it comes to this
stuff wash don't wipe
I dropped the brake in the toilet
yesterday my girlfriend was watching I
got super kitchen toilet
I dropped a brake never toilet in our
house
I dropped a brick this big it's crazy
I talked to bricks in the toilet but
then I took one out and put it in the
toilet upstairs it brick I dropped with
the same size as my dad you want to see
you I can see light in here
my brick was so big the toilet filled up
with less water
I saved water by dropping a brick in the
toilet if we all drop a brick in our
toilets will say a California 67 million
gallons of water a day in a state that's
facing its worst drought in history to
go into your bathroom muster up a brick
and plop it into the top tank feels
great
