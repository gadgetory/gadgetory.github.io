from a finger mm-hmm they're good at
pooping but you know such a pooping you
do this is when you sit on a porcelain
throne it's muscle to kink in the hose
and stop some Ben and Jerry's from
sliding out smoothly is that a problem
I don't know I hemorrhoids a problem
sitting at this angle can cause
hemorrhoids bloating constipation and a
bunch of other crap seriously you know
clone hemorrhoids the glitter hits
everywhere what what happens when you go
from sit to squat well arm is muscle
relaxant at kinko's away faster than
Pegasus neighing sweet sherbet Dookie

made to poop in a squat and now there's

last scoop out of the carton with a
squatty potty you get complete

sight thanks to its innovative patented
design

King so order your squatty potty today
I'm not saying it will make your poop as
soft as this cookies and cream but I'm
not saying it won't squatty potty the
stool for better stool pooping will
never be the same and neither will I
scream I want to yield
how does it taste is that delicious said
the best thing you've ever had in your
life there you are
they say this is good luck but good luck
or not it's still a mess and a mess like
this can't be clean with just paper you
need water to get the job done right
whether you're cleaning your car or your
hands so why when it comes to that do we
use just toilet paper bathroom goers
meet your new best friend
clap oh sorry Pete not you buddy
bathroom goers meet your new best friend
the swash 1400s it's a new seat for the
toilet you already have that will give
your butt the royal treatment it
deserves with a heated seat dual
positionable stainless steel nozzles
adjustable warm water spray at the touch
of a button and a warm air dryer your
butt will think you've died and gone
you get it so what's so great about bran
Del's new swash bidet seat
it's simple wash don't wipe it uses
water to clean the messes that can't be
clean with just paper he's always doing
stuff like that and with bran Del's
bidet Ct can because it has a citable
lid you think that'd be standard issue
at the day toilet seats right wrong
unlike most bidet seat lids rondelle
supports a person's weight meaning Pete
can use it however he wants
another great feature stainless steel
nozzles they're positionable because
they got to hit you in just the right
spot and there's self-sterilizing I mean
they're washing my butt they're washing
Pete's butt move you got to make sure
those things are clean man what's up
Pete
oh yeah that's another feature of
rondelle's new seat it has a nightlight
did I mention Braun bells nice wash the
day seat has customizable memory
settings that means I press one button
and get the seat temperature nozzle
position and water temperature I want I
don't have to remember anything because
my swash does it for me
are you kidding me
I think it's pretty clear now to
everyone that when it comes to this
stuff wash don't wipe
I dropped the brake in the toilet
yesterday my girlfriend was watching I
got super kitchen toilet
I dropped a brake never toilet in our
house
I dropped a brick this big it's crazy
I talked to bricks in the toilet but
then I took one out and put it in the
toilet upstairs it brick I dropped with
the same size as my dad you want to see
you I can see light in here
my brick was so big the toilet filled up
with less water
I saved water by dropping a brick in the
toilet if we all drop a brick in our
toilets will say a California 67 million
gallons of water a day in a state that's
facing its worst drought in history to
go into your bathroom muster up a brick
and plop it into the top tank feels
great
