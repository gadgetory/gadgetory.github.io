remote control for your air conditioner
well meet the touch AC all you need to
do is swipe this baby and the room is
automatically filled with cool
refreshing air let's look at this
imbecile doing the rain dance trying to
control the temperature bouncing like
that I'd probably sweat like a pig
anyway when I want to control the
temperature I use sensible it's based on
a simple idea really just make me feel
good hey Paul and Dan what's the
temperature in the room right now 20
degrees Fahrenheit is it hot or cold hot
you see nobody cares what the exact
temperature is it's just about being
comfortable sensible is a device that
turns any remote controlled air you see
into a connected super smart one so
smart factor that you choose full
automatic mode you'll never have to
think about your AC ever again
sensible turns up the heat for your wake
up in the winter it cools your house
down before you come home in the Sun
it's like your mom and dad just out
having to hear about its back problems
hi mom
I'd like to take a brief moment and
explain how sensible is installed
oh look here's a team behind sensible
engineers designers visionaries they've
invested years of their lives in this
product not only to make your life more
comfortable but also because of a green
agenda not that the other green
yes sensible reduces the energy your AC
uses by an average of 40 percent making
it good for the planet and for your
electricity bill personally I don't care
about earth but if it doesn't bother me
I don't mind letting it exist its app is
so beautiful and intuitive
you'll get things done in less than two
seconds and spend the extra twenty
seconds you just saved on staring at it
and admiration and there's an app for
pebble to live in a rented apartment
sensibo can be moved from AC to AC
here's how sensibo even works with your
20 year old remote-controlled AC coz an
old dog can learn new tricks fetch
I don't need your help but these guys do
if you back sensible they can begin the
manufacturing process and improve your
quality of life significantly but more
importantly they'll be able to pay me
for being in this video thank you
sensible hi I'm Simon Griffiths
co-founder of who gives a crap we reckon
every trip to the bathroom should be a
feel-good experience so we've spent the
last two years developing the only
toilet paper delivers one every time who
gives a crap it's a breakthrough on so
many levels let me take you through them
it's better for the environment and
we've cut the nasties so it's better for
your body that feels good but unlike
other recycled toilet paper we're all
about comfort so it has a beautiful
fluffy texture and low pt-r
or poke your rate that feels good you
can choose to buy it off the shelf or
have it home delivered either way it
costs the same as other brands it comes
with twelve hundred percent more puns
that feels good but here's where we're
really on a roll fifty percent of our
profits go to sanitation projects in the
developing world you see while a trip to
the bathroom can be the ultimate
feel-good experience for some for many
it's not because 2.4 billion people
don't have access to a proper toilet the
bad stuff ends up in waterways causing
diseases that fill half the hospital
beds in the developing world that
doesn't feel very good and that's why
we're donating 50% of our profits to
water aid
we need toilet paper and like anyone
who's waiting for toilet paper we need
someone to help us out we're asking for
your support we need $50,000 to fill our
warehouse with the first bulk order of
who gives a crap I won't be leaving this
toilet until we've raised enough for our
first order I'm sitting down for what I
believe in and I'm not getting up until
I've got some toilet paper
$50,000 worth till then you can jump on
our website and see me sitting right
here on our live feed so please bit of
help
don't you just love getting your period
I know I do it's a great time to do
everything I said all the bed is
unbearable I used to worry that my
period with a bevy from doing my
favorite activities but now I get a box
oh this is painful what the hell am I to
feed right now this is the last place I
should be
I could take pills but they take a long
time to work and usually they don't
eliminate the pain just reduce it and
then in a few hours you just fine starts
or I can use Libya Libya is a drug-free
solution to menstrual pains how does it
work simple menstrual pains are results
of a connection between your brain and
your lady parts lower lady parts get
ready for some pain no brain no but then
Libya stops this connection with pulses
dented and antennae tada take that pain
signal wrong the result Libya
considerably reduces and could even
completely eliminate the pain unlike
pills Libya reduces your pain instantly
its effect lasts as long as you use it
and you
don't develop a tolerance to it all you
gotta do is take these two stickers
attach them to where it hurts
and turn Libya on there's even an
adjustable button to control the pulses
according to your pain and the whole
thing is totally discrete oh and it's
also very cute and colorful cuz we're
girls help us fund Libya and move from
this is painful uh to this
