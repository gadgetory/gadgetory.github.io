first open-source CNC farming machine
farm bot moves around in the XYZ space
day and night seven days a week
growing food for you just the way you
want it to be grown farm up precisely
sow seeds in any pattern and density you
want and then waters them efficiently
the exact amount that each plant needs
based on its type its age soil
conditions the local weather and you're
growing preferences farm bot can grow a
wide variety of crops all in the same
area at the same time while each plant
is cared for individually in an
optimized automated way by growing many
types of plants at once your garden will
benefit from the natural advantages of
poly cropping and crop rotation while
you and your family gain from a healthy
and varied diet using the onboard camera
and advanced computer vision software
Pharma diligently monitors your garden
detects weeds as soon as they emerge and
then buries them under the soil with the
soil sensor farm bot can show you how
your garden changes over time enabling
smarter more efficient farming with each
passing season with farm bot your garden
will flourish your plants will thrive
and you will gain access to fresh food
grown right in your backyard with the
practices that you believe in you
control and configure farm by using a
powerful web-based interface so no
coding is required to grow food with the
sequence builder and scheduler you
combine the most basic operations of
farm but into custom sequences for seed
injection watering and even whole
regimens for taking care of a plant
throughout its life the drag-and-drop
farm designer allows you to graphically
design the layout of your plants for a
game-like experience that
fun fast and easy you simply press the
synchronize button and farmbot does the
rest
farm BOTS hardware is designed for easy
assembly and modification with the
included tools you will assemble farmbot
to a size that suits your needs and
because everything is made from
corrosion resistant aluminum stainless
steel and 3d printed plastic your farm
bot will work for years out in the
elements farmbot score electronics
included the Raspberry Pi computer the
Arduino mega microcontroller and a ram
shield combined with powerful NEMA 17
stepper motors and rotary encoders tools
are reliably positioned within
millimeter accuracy and our flexible
hardware and software platform is ready
for you to modify and expand upon farm
bots abilities want to design your own
tools go right ahead
need farmbot to control lights that's
easy inspired to go off-grid with solar
power and collected rain it's already
been done and we can show you how to do
it and the most important feature of all
is that farm bot is 100% open-source all
of our software hardware plans 3d CAD
models and documentation is free for you
to download and improve upon we've
written step-by-step assembly
instructions documented past versions of
the hardware and even set up a community
wiki and forum for collaboration farmbot
genesis is 1.5 metres wide and 3 meters
in length it's perfect for getting
started in a small space the kit is
fully weatherproof and can be placed
outdoors in a greenhouse or even on a
rooftop
the maca culture to agriculture dank
yield is more than just a fertilizer
it's an opportunity to grow differently
to grow better to challenge the status
quo
for far too long we settled for the use
of heavy chemicals in our environment
giving little thought to the origin or
the safety of the products we are using
and ingesting we aren't reinventing the
wheel or going back to our roots
manufacture biological fertilizers using
natural nutrients that grow stronger
plants and produce higher yields our
products are made to capitalize on the
synergies of balanced nutrient uptake
and creation it's an organic fertilizer
you're not gonna find many of those
around second year we saw huge numbers
jump up and then third year was even
more unfortunate even jumped up even
more it's pretty amazing actually you
look at the numbers our yields that we
have gained over the past four years
since we started using his product we've
had nothing but good things happen quite
honest personal results have been
amazing I have three big window boxes in
the front of my home and I do impatience
and I used to DANC yovan it and they
literally just fall over this huge mound
they never did that in the past it's so
easy to use it's just a capper poll in
my container I would recommend Dan keel
to anyone number one it's a natural
product it's easy to use I think it's so
much better for the environment for
children to be around your pets cats and
dogs I strongly recommend it for those
reasons and then the results are like
double triple what I would ever get
using other fertilizers
Vinc yield is by far the best product on
the market it's just been amazing I get
double the yield I get things to flower
that would never flower whether you have
a small garden or a large farm
thank you fertilizers have consistently
proven to increase yields and improve
soil health together we can be better
stewards of our resources and ultimately
create healthier plants and healthier
people grow with us and grow your best
growing my own organic food and sharing
it with my loved ones for me this is the
essence of a good life yet for one of
our most important vegetables there is
no satisfying solution for home
production and that is the potato I love
potatoes and I want them to be fresh and
organic just like my other crops but
growing potatoes the traditional way
requires a lot of work and loads of
space and with pest problems harvesting
can easily turn into a very
disappointing experience as professional
designers of raised beds and smart
guarding solutions we thought it's
really time to change the way we grow
potatoes so we created Paul potato the
ready to plant potato tower
compared to traditional planting methods
it allows you to grow up to ten times
the amount of potatoes on the same space
this is the result of an intensive
two-year research in cooperation with
leading gardeners and the University of
Natural Resources in vienna paul potato
is easy to set up and offers various
ways to plant potatoes the modular tower
has a sophisticated water distribution
system a built involved protection and a
space-saving design that work together
to maximize efficiency and yield the
handling of paul potato is really simple
you just fill the compartments with
potting soil and put in the seedlings of
your choice after planting all you have
to do is water your potatoes once in a
while and watch them grow after 16 to 20
weeks it's time to enjoy the pleasures
of harvesting your very own potatoes
Paul potato is designed to make it
simple and easy for you to grow and
consume organic potatoes right from your
own backyard
we love our Gardens it's that special
place where we relax and unwind whether
you're into colorful flowers trees or
growing your own healthy food it takes
time and commitment wouldn't it be great
if you could have all the benefits of a
healthy garden without having to worry
about your plants when you're out
traveling or simply don't have the time
this is where cloud rain comes into play
using local weather data cloud rain
smart algorithm waters your plants
exactly to their needs it's so easy to
use you can set it up yourself in no
time
cloud rain needs no batteries or cable
connection as it is self maintaining
through a solar energy cloud rains
intelligent technology connects to your
home's Wi-Fi using information on wind
sunlight temperature and humidity cloud
rain effortlessly integrates with the
local weather data providing your garden
with the optimal watering plan finally a
solution that maintains your garden from
your pocket give your garden the
attention it deserves
feel more control about your garden no
matter where you are
cloud rain
home growing sounds simple right I mean
all you need are a few timers
temperature sensor a thermostat an
irrigation system a humidity sensor
security camera and some light now if
there was only something to connect and
control them all well now there is
Negro director the world's first home
growing controller for all your growing
needs to grow director connects to all
of your standard equipment and sensors
like lighting irrigation temperature
humidity and even your security cam
it has all-in-one timers and in
connections various preset plants for
different plants a seven-inch
touchscreen with a simple interface and
an automatic system for updates via
Wi-Fi you can even control everything
from work with our mobile app which
includes notifications that inform you
of the exact status of your plans this
is Jenny
he's the mastermind behind this device
it's okay if Jenny I'll take it from
here for years now if Jenny has been
growing plants and helping his friends
with their growing setups and it's
always become a mess with all the wires
adapters and timers but so so he looked
for a solution but couldn't find a
simple affordable controller that
connected to standard sensors
that's how grow director was born after
two years of research and development he
now has a working prototype that can
control everything in the grow room and
with your support it can revolutionize
the way people grow plants in their
homes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
