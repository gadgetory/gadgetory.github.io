to heat the cooking forces five times
faster than a traditional charcoal grill
it's super easy to use leaving you more
time to enjoy the day fuel free

cool to the touch you can also use it in
places like beaches national parks and
apartment buildings where fire cooking
isn't allowed treat yourself to fresh
outdoor cooking free of toxic smoke you
can grill with sole source in the
morning midday late afternoon when it's
cold when it's windy at the beach even
under passing clouds as long as the Sun
is still smiling down on you the solar
reflectors are engineered with the ideal
curvature for capturing the sun's ray
providing the equipment of about 600
watts of we're all cooking powers you
can cook from approximately one hour
after sunrise to one hour before sunset
on a bright beautiful sunny day for
example within five minutes the grill
will be at grilling temperatures within
10 it'll be hot enough to sear within 10
minutes charcoal is well it's getting
there even though it's reflecting all
that energy the surface is cool to the
touch as the heat is focused directly
onto the cooking surface and only the
cooking surface aligning the grill with
the Sun only requires you to look into
the blackout mirror and aim the beam
right at your pan the v-shape cut out
puts you in the captain's chair of the
soul source port because you deserve
this girl to work for you how are we
looking there okay
the grilling platform is a versatile pot
stand that allows you to use the
cookware you already own you can grill
pan fry saute steam boil

we've taken our original model and
redesigned it with the on the go griller
in mind the new sport assembles in less
than three minutes and packs down to a
lightweight two feet carrying case

this is a bag in it there's the ultimate
touring kayak you might think to
yourself wow that's a small bag you
probably mean the ultimate folding kayak
now we mean the ultimate touring kayak
and it's not just because it's a real
touring higher one that allows you to go
on tour towns and longer multi-day tours
but also tour the world
it's the ultimate touring kayak because
it's the best flowing kayak on water -
yup we're confident how do you go about
creating the ultimate touring kayak well
you talk to paddlers and ask them what
would make it the best luckily for us
with over ten years of experience in
building kayaks we also have quite a few
customers that here are the results of
the survey we gave thousands of paddlers
91.5% said that the quality of materials
is the most important aspect over 90%
demanded durability then there was
comfort performance piece of transport
versatility and pretty
don't worry one guy we made it pretty
pretty awesome our inspiration for the
track 2.0 was the original Inuit kayaks
only and we say this with the utmost
respect ours is greatly enhanced by
modern technology our skin is military
grade material engineered over a carbon
fiber and aircraft aluminum frame the
result is a kayak that can fit in this
bag while being more durable and impact
resistant than a hardshell Kyah it's
super tough out of tough enough to last
ten years in any condition didn't we
punch it enough let's punch it again so
there you have it quality and durability
our survey paddlers also really cared
about performance that's what makes it
great to retire well the track not only
performs incredibly well it is also the
only kayak that can change the shape to
accommodate condition and alter the
water line making it paddle like a
shorter or maneuverable kayak or a
longer faster cooling tire that makes
for many kayaks in one as we're set up
it only takes ten minutes
really and as for ease of transport you
already saw the bag it goes into and you
already agreed it's small enough to fit
in any car and light enough to carry on
a train and yes you can take it on a
plane we have
now for the extra think we took on the
track is customizable and super
comfortable its deck outfitting index
storage bags are modular yep it's all
around pretty odd to make all this a
reality we've been working with an
amazing team of engineers from some of
Canada in the world's best organizations
so yes this is a small bag and it holds
inside it the world's most incredible
touring tire one you can grab from your
room pack on your back take anywhere in
the world and paddle on any water with

though we occasionally scale mountains
and shred NARMS we're more likely to be
heading to the park with friends for
good times be prepared we found
ourselves bring our hammocks blanket
tarps coolers so many things you name it
which got us thinking how can we
simplify this there's gotta be a better
way
introducing the MC hammy it's a shelter
hammock and like it all in one we call
it the MC hammy and it's the first of
its how do we do this we cleverly
combined webbing fabric and carabiners
to create something innovative and new
the MC hammy is useful no matter what
you're into we wanted something that we
can take everywhere and for it to just
work waterproof crazy soft packable and
of course easy to clean what does this
mean we're ditching all the things</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
