gyms the bulky equipment and the cost of

anchor for other fitness gear

hello Kickstarter
we're Venus optics over the last four
years we've launched some very unique
glass to the market we're a team of
photography enthusiasts and industry
experts who aim to provide you with new
tools to enjoy photography and this time
is no different
introducing allow WA 24 millimeter probe
lens the weirdest but most creative in
revolutionary macro tool ever
traditional macro lenses in the market
tend to have a long focal length varying
from 60 to 100 millimetres or even
longer
the subject filled most of the frame and
is isolated from the surrounding
environment our new lava probe however
allows you to focus really close showing
a great amount of the details and
texture of your subject at the same time
you can enjoy a compelling wide angle of
view so that more of your background can
be included into your shots for the
first time ever you can easily create a
compelling and unique bug eye
perspective style and no other lenses
can compare to
the wide-angle design also means you get
much more depth of field than a
telephoto macro lens when focusing at
close distances you can start including
the habitat or environment of the
subject into your composition since more
of your shot will be in focus your image
can instantly become very informative
and appealing as macro photographers
ourselves we usually face a problem of
not being able to shoot smaller subjects
with our allow a probe you can now take
advantage of the two to one maximum
magnification to reveal details that
cannot be seen by the naked eye the
focus range covers all the way from to
toe and macro to infinity which has
extra convenience to video shooting
thanks to the 40 centimeter long barrel
you can now shoot really close to your
subject but keep yourself and your
camera away this allows you to reach
bugs hidden in bushes or capture lethal
animals with ease macro photography has
never been easier
the tiny two centimeter lens tip
unlocked endless shooting possibilities
you can now get close to areas nobody
ever has before and show you some epic
macro photos and video footage using
this is cool enough think again in order
to bring you an even more exciting
perspective we've made the front barrel
of the lava probe waterproof and
dustproof this removes your last
shooting barrier and you can literally
put it anywhere to shoot it's our job to
help remove the limitations of your
shooting and now it's your time to get
the creative juices flowing
okay you may wonder how can I get enough
light to focus in a burroughs or in a
cave that's already taken care of an LED
ring light is mounted at the tip of our
probe and you'll find it tremendously
useful and video shooting or for focus
assistance this is not just another lens
with a long tube this is actually a lens
with one of the most complicated optic
designs ever
it houses 27 elements spreading across
the entire barrel to deliver an
exceptional image performance this lawa
24 millimeter 14 probe lens is the
world's first consumer grade probe lens
that provides both professional
photographers and videographers with a
completely new perspective to unleash
the creativity this lens also redefines
macro photography for wildlife
photographers to capture natural wonders
