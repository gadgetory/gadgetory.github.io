this is hexa highly manoeuvrable
all-terrain robot that's built for the
real world
but its own operating system and an
intuitive SDK and simulator you can
program hexa to do whatever you like
it's a very easy to work with SDK so you
do things like move forward rather than
actually coding the movements it'll
handle the translation of all those
moods make it really I mean that can
cross through like pipe spaces that can
do anything you can pretty much set it
to do what you wanted to do and succeed
be more creative control robots are the
next big sample this is our generation's
mobile but more exciting with more
opportunities but today people are left
behind we are the creators people are
not developing inventing or exploring
and robotics
why because they don't have the access
or the truth to do so so I set out to
make a new kind of Java one that has a
high degree of maneuverability and
therefore versatility of action one that
integrates all the necessary sensors in
order to be a real robot at the same
time is accessible and easily
programmable now for the first time
people have a pathway into the body more
than any other robot hexa has impressive
agility and versatility of movement we
can handle a range of complex surfaces
and diverse environments hexa sensors
allow to interact with and learn from
the world around it sighs camera support
image and video
you see what ecstasy is allowing you to
explore places you wouldn't normally be
able to go
what makes tax are truly unit is mine
our operating systems with mind SDK you
don't need to be a roboticist to create
complex mobile functionality in just a
few lines of a code you are using the
SDK to create robotic skills and action
we've been fascinated by how people
react to hackers but the future is even
more exciting I believe we'll see robots
that can explore terrain where humans
cannot go in the coming years this
community of hack survivors will help
advance Ramadi
what will they create more problems will
they find what new capabilities for
about will they reveal they get to
determine the future
you
[Laughter]
Oh
these are Spectrum's rings that turn
color in the sound hi I'm Steven
inventor of spectrums Connect spectrums
- the app through Bluetooth and tap the
set sounds the colors this lets you play
music anywhere choose any sound or
create your own you can even use
spectrums to create a virtual drum set
with our open source code you can use
your rings for game development home
automation and gesture recognition we've
completed our small manufacturing run
and ship ring to our first happy beta
companies however we need your help to
fund a larger manufacturing run so that
we can lower the price of our rings and
give everyone the musical freedom they
deserve from all of us at spectrum hey
you we live in an age of on-demand
movies can now be watched anywhere
anytime on various devices such as
mobile phones tablets and laptops but
with that there's a problem none have
been able to capture the magic of a
cinema movies are losing their magic but
what if we could have the comfort of
watching films at home but with an
experience that would exceed that of a
movie theater
introducing Samara the world's first
fully immersive personal cinema a
headset that brings you an IMAX like
movie experience in the size of a book
while a normal cinema on average gives
you an angle of around 54 degrees the
scenario screen is considerably larger
and on par with a 70 degree angle of the
IMAX screen to guarantee the image
quality on a super wide screen Samara
uses groundbreaking dual 2.5 k displays
with a resolution three times that of a
cinema and eight times that of an iPhone
7 plus rising such high resolution is
beyond the capabilities of any existing
mobile processors on the market
unlike existing products which split a
single screen into two and only use the
central part of the screen saneras dual
screen architecture utilizes up to 95
percent of the screen area which
achieves four times the sharpness and
fully alleviates the screen door effect
sanera is also super easy to use it
works like any Android smartphone you
can install your favorite streaming apps
like Netflix or HBO or play from a
microSD card it also works like a TV by
simply connecting the headset to a
blu-ray player gaming console or a
computer with a simple click sanera
upgrades your conventional entertainment
to an immersive and cinematic experience
because of comfortable experience using
sanera has always been one of our top
priorities we designed an ergonomic
hands-free arm to take the weight off
the headset the burden free arm can be
easily adjusted 20 position and can be
attached to different surfaces it allows
for a new way of watching moving burden
free truly immersed in the movie without
discomfort
besides video the audio has been
fine-tuned so we create the acoustics
and sound effects of a movie theater
the Samara 3d mode is easy to turn on
and provides more vivid and brighter 3d
images than those in theaters without
the need for 3d glasses it is a much
better way to watch 3-d movies it's
under these good I've been even here
like you're really close your buddy Alan
oh that feels amazing right cool again
that's like the worst spot is on your
back usually it's up in the emergency
room three times bro give me the address
it really cool oh I can get you yeah
that does work yeah oh my god
now I do free that's really good that's
like this part to soubise 2019 for sure
hi I'm Rob and I live in sunny and hot
Houston Texas I lived all over the world
and mostly warm place such as la Okinawa
why Miami and now Hugh I love warm
weather but I don't like feeling
uncomfortable that's why I created flow
the leader and wearable cool tech
by combining airflow with aromatherapy
Lowe allowed essential oil users to
bring the health benefits of their
diffuser on the go t when it gets ahold
of you there's little to no relief so
let's do this
this is or even this is it us or does it
seem that the summers are getting a
thing hotter longer while our homes cars
and offices are set up safety what about
homer on the roof fortunately there is
really meet below the world's first
micro schooling device to use the
natural power of essential oil to cool
you off here's how it works
place your essential oil insert inside
add one drop of peppermint oil turn it
on into your seat if you want to wear it
on the front clip your shirt like this
for those of you is short here you want
to wear it on the back clip to your
shirt like this you also have the option
of clipping it on your pants with the
back foot we recommend tucking your
shirt into the front clip to keep the
air between your shirt and skate you
need to cool off during a variety of
activities such as running hiking biking
working out and anything else but we
didn't stop there
what also comes out in summer months
with ghido we blow as a personal
mosquito repellent by simply adding
lemongrass oil
