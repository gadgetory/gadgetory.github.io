I coach it's a new child little cross
bike but like nothing you've seen before
it's perky and novel are really fun to
ride you sit with your back straight on
your hands by your side
fail the front wheel and go to the back
wheel to keep the frame compact
I'm an engineer I design and build stuff
I
I like you
it's been a few years now tinkering with
and riding around your expected life I'm
finally happy enough with it it takes
about 20 to 30 minutes to learn to ride
and the reactions that gets in the
street are fantastic
the bike comes in a kit they bolt
together yourself this keeps the cost
lower and perfect for those of you like
me like building and seeing or
everything works
because it's a kid the bike is also
modular you can make their trike for
increased stability and heat easier
rides you can lengthen the frame and
their cargo bike the Bella cycle of the
bikes but it's also a starting point for
its creativity and engagement
engineering the custom parts of the bell
cycle are made of high-quality aluminum
6061 and 2024 all the bicycle parts are
standard and the design is fully open
source on our website and you should
consider the kit a jumping-off point for
further customization
the Bell cycle is designed and built
here in New York City it's not normal
it's not meant for the average person
and it's definitely not meant to replace
their bicycle but it's for the tinkerer
the weirdo the adventurer and the
engineer if that's you or someone you
know give it a shot and back us on
Kickstarter today finally a gaming mouse
that puts full control in the palm of
your hand
LexA is a mouse specifically designed
for gamers of all levels so whether you
play in professional gaming tournaments
or you're just a weekend gamer lexif is
designed to be a versatile Mouse for
gamers everywhere Oh awesome
the mouse is super smooth and this is
something a lot of companies can't get
Alexa plows easily allows you to perform
complex tasks at multiple dimensions
with increased precision usually you'd
have to stop in order to switch through
your items in your inventory but when
you're using the joystick you can just
simply just scroll through your items so
it does genuinely give you an advantage
when you're playing your game like
Minecraft lexif provides six degrees of
freedom via two joysticks and one laser
glide sensor it works by tilting forward
backward and side-to-side the mouse
moves with your hand and it goes with it
that's a very big plus this mouse but
actually here a competitive advantage in
gameplay the laser sensor lets the user
control the mechanical gliding at very
high speeds while maintaining the best
accuracy the tilting allows you to have
more three-dimensional movement all
within the mouse itself so you can
combine multiple movements into your
Mouse seamlessly it has a joystick on
the side so if I'm playing and I want to
zoom in to shoot someone it
automatically goes into the zoom mode I
don't have to like double-click on the
mouse I'm kind of shot are they gonna
give you
I doubt that lexif shape is designed in
a way that buttons are very accessible
while still providing a solid feeling
the sides are covered in the finest
rubber enabling a strong grip when
needed it's comfortable it's smooth I
wasn't ready for it
the lexif gaming mouse also provides a
separate model specifically designed for
left-handed gamers what truly sets the
Lexx it mouse apart from its competitors
is its conveniently positioned joystick
on the side of the mouse along with its
internal mechanical to axis joystick
which allows users to operate the mouse
to tilt or to use as a joystick offering
two options in one this mini joystick
features mechanical feedback forces that
only regular-sized joysticks used to
offer making this the first of its kind
the joystick allows me to go through the
entire map which is actually really cool
it's great it's gonna make a massive
difference in pig games well yeah you
can use the joystick over smaller here
Lexa's control panel allows you to
customize and configure the settings
specific to what you're comfortable with
providing you with various shortcuts and
once you configure the settings you
won't need to configure them again our
goal is to bring the lexa plows to
gamers everywhere but we need your help
please support our campaign so that you
too can take advantage of the innovative
features our gaming mouse will offer you
elevate your gameplay with LexA
one into will experience a burglary
during their lifetime so let's see what
people do in order to prevent burglaries
cameras well that's a perfect way to
ruin your dinner if this ever happens to
you remember to keep an eye on your wine
dogs sure dogs are great but they're
much too cute to leave behind the next
door neighbor you say because he always
does such a great job of looking after
your plants did time switch nowadays
refer to as the smart bulb well it's a
step into the right direction except
that burglars don't only break in when
it's dark outside come on is that
burglars are afraid of confrontation so
presence is key that's why we came up
with Karen the combination of light
effects and sound make it look like
someone's home household noises are the
most effective way to simulate the
presence of residents and deter burglars
especially during the day kevin has a
light intensity sensor and knows when to
switch on the lights and when to save
power the random simulation is based on
multiple factors such as region language
weather environment and more leaving
home in a rush
Kevin senses that you've left and
activates himself of course you can
control Kevin from anywhere and yes when
you're at home Karen is there for you
too I make sure the product works for
everyone you can use the app on the
phone or the grandma friendly buttons on
the device itself
Kevin is really easy to live with thanks
to our collaborations with experienced
industry
designers and electronic engineers we
are about to get ready for productions
at my teepee we envision a world where
the term burglary is only found in
history books join the journey and
support tuition you will receive a great
