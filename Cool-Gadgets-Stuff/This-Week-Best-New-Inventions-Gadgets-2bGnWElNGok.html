how great it feels you pull the levers
and sun-li are flying your own tiny
plane it's exciting
this is Mehta fly and flying it is
exciting on a completely different level
like on a scale of 1 to 10 it's level 11
excited maybe even 12 Mehta fly has
wings that enable it to fly just like
winged animals do so it can maneuver
just like winged animals do technically
it's not a drone
it's an ornithopter but really it's more
than that it's a meta fly meta fly flies
using a unique method called biomimetics
denoting synthetic methods that mimic
natural processes you know how a bird
flies into your house and can navigate
around everything without hitting
anything mehta fly can do that because
it mimics the natural movement of the
bird with its synthetic wings see what
we did there that's science explaining
awesomeness Mehta fly flies just like in
nature it can take turns fly slow or
fast and can maneuver around anything it
could also glide and be control to glide
left and right with those abilities
Mehta Phi is one of the few RC flying
objects that can actually fly in small
spaces here it is flying in an office
here it is flying in a house here it is
flying in an even smaller house outdoors
that a fly can enjoy its full speed by
changing the direction of its tail Mehta
fly can fly faster when its tails down
or more controllable when it's up due to
its two channel remote control that
allows for further range no interference
and maximum control you can fly metaphor
fast or slow stance trees and then
maneuver between them like only a
metaphor Canada now that's even level 13
exciting oh and don't worry about
crashing Mehta fly has elastic wings and
legs in addition to both front and back
bumpers to protect its body take that
tree Mehta flies the result of more than
40 years of research and development
edwin and aeronautical engineer and the
creator of mehta fly got into the field
after his grandfather this cool dude
created the first successful mechanic
bird together with edwin's father
much later edwin himself successfully
crowdfunded and delivered bionic bird
now he's diving even deeper into the
world of biomimetics to take flight
abilities even further so if you want to
fly just like animals in nature to get
mattify and get ready to immerse
yourself in an experience like no other
metaphor
refreshing
except for the germs because if you use
one of these you're basically drinking
from a toilet every day here's what
happens
straws have a dark moist inner wall the
perfect breeding ground for bacteria
heyyou now combine that with all the
saliva stale soda whatever chunky milk
smoothie residue that gets caught in
here and suddenly you've got a tiny
germy Jurassic Park the single straw
that's gone unwashed for more than 24
hours can Harbor just as much bacteria
as a public toilet seat
that's one yucky sucky saving the
environment is great and all but it
doesn't mean much if you die but here's
the problem
current reusable straws suck pun
intended
you can drink with them but you can't
clean them and that's just crappy
pun not intended dishwashers don't work
because they only clean surfaces they're
not designed to get the deep down
crevices inside your straws that's like
trying to clean the inside of your car
by taking it through a car wash the
yucky is still sticky you could use a
pipe cleaner if you're the kind of
person that has time to clean straws
with a pipe cleaner and owns a pipe
cleaner and carries it around with you
and has time to clean your pipe
basically if you're a plumber Plus since
you can't get a good look inside your
straw after you wash or scrub
you'll never know what's still lurking
inside that means you'll be flushing
your mouth with a blend of new and old
flavors for weeks to come hmm moldy
spinach : so how do you get the straw
without the toilet introducing the rain
straw
the revolutionary slide apart straw that
gives you complete inside access for
quick easy and thorough cleaning just
sip to drink and slide to clean that's
it I mean really you shouldn't have to
do more I mean we've invented robots to
clean our carpets this should be easy so
now you can clean your straw however you
want
dishwasher towel fingers that pipe
cleaner thinking again whatever but
there probably is so the point is now
you can clean it and see that it's clean
instead of just playing rotten food
Russian roulette
and because it's a hundred percent
bpa-free and dishwasher safe it won't
lead Chardon for chemicals like other
plastics can because nothing spoils a
drink more than chemical poisoning
am I right snow white but beautiful lady
if the straw slides apart won't the air
escape
not at all random citizen with the rain
straws patent-pending air lock design we
guarantee a no drip sip for the lifetime
of the straw which is about a million
years so make sure to put your straw in
your will no matter what you get the
same easy clean no drip or useable straw
every time let's see robots do that they
do that so because you care about your
health and basic hygiene click below and
drink clean today with rain strong
hello I'd seen on this p9 the world's
first auto transforming robot from
Robeson P 9 is made from aerospace grade
materials and equipped with 22 active
joints to achieve highly precise and
complex movements technology lovers and
DIY players all around the world gather
here to share the excellent works and
valuable programming tips and create
robots in different ways pioneered the
create hand programming making complex
programming language and easy to
understand the 3d graphics programming
supports hundreds of actions and sound
combinations greatly enriching to the
users creative space upload the action
content to Robeson hub and share your
imagination with the world meanwhile t9

mess I tried to buy it but it was such
poor quality or so damn expensive it was
hopeless I couldn't get the good stuff I
ended up becoming Lynn it's okay please

world's first smart automated cheese
maker for home use for over two years my
team and I have been working tirelessly
with top electrical and mechanical
engineers to create fromage e au fromage

cabinet full of messy home cheese making
equipment and turns it into a simple
easy to clean appliance that fits on
your kitchen countertop our goal here at
fromage EO is to bring the finest
artisanal quality natural cheese into
your home after living in France for

States and asked myself why don't we

first truly connected community of
cheese lovers in the app users can
choose from a number of default classic
cheeses such as mozzarella or feta which
they can then send to their fromage EO

original cheese created by other users
worldwide or create your own for example
I love the taste of kettle bell but I
also like the taste and consistency of
 by adding a little black pepper I
have now created a black pepper camel
 cheese from the app you can also
control the Machine track the cheese
making process order ingredients and
more the app in touchscreen LCD
