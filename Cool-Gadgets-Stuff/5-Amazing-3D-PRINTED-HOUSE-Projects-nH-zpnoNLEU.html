how thanks to modern technology happy
score 3d printing
the walls of this house were printed
entirely on-site this is the world's
first actually printed house
with the advent of APIs core technology
construction 3d printing opens a new
round of evolution thanks to the
innovative design of the printer APIs
core technology consists of a mobile
construction 3d printer and automatic
mix and supply units which combine to
make the construction printing process
as much automated as possible and almost
eliminate the human factor this
equipment is unique and has no analogues
in the world today a Peace Corps is
compact dimensions high printing speed
ease of transport and maximum automation
of the system commissioning on-site
takes no more than an hour with so many
advantages the 3d printing technology
easily accounted for competition with
traditional methods of construction the
testing was successful and the
technology is ready for mass use
time of printing amounted to 24 hours
sue using new materials such as
geopolymer concrete houses could be
printed in both summer and winter in the
printing process we used horizontal
fiberglass reinforcements for the walls
the quality of the printed wall surface
allows to perform final finishing
immediately which significantly reduces
the cost of finishing works the roof of
the printed house in accordance with the
architectural project is flat such a
roof can effectively withstand high snow
loads and durability requirements its
cost is comparable with steep roofs
which are common for our country a peace
corps construction 3d printing
technology adapted for different methods
of printed walls thermal insulation this
project used loose dry insulating
material on one part of the house and
polyurethane filler composition on the
other technology does not require
fixtures and fills all voids in the
space between the bearing wall and the
outer concrete structure avoids the
formation of cold bridges on the inside
the printed house is no different from a
regular concrete house it is also
comfortable and reliable the house
interior includes a hall a bathroom a
living room and a compact functional
kitchen with the most modern appliances
the house size is 38 square metres
construction costs amounted to 10,000
$134 which corresponds to approximately
$275 per square metre and this in view
of the shape complexity of the building
prices include all works and materials
for the construction of foundation roof
exterior and interior finishing works
installation of heat insulation of walls
windows floors and ceilings a regular
square house made using materials of an
average price category would cost about
two hundred twenty three dollars per
square metre the use of APIs core
construction 3d printer allows to save
up to 70% on erecting buildings boxes
compared to traditional material and
labor-intensive construction methods the
APIs core company and its partners are
confident that this house was the first
step which convinced the world that 3d
technology on the market today is a
reality
a world-leading robotics company with
unique patented technology for fully
automated into wind 3d printing
construction earth-based fast big
robotics is on an unwavering mission the
construction industry is an industry of
custom and convention but it's one
primed for change industrial 3d printing
is at a tipping point it's ready to
emerge from its niche status and become
a viable alternative to the
long-established processes in an
increasing number of applications
because the hadrian can print the
complete structure from one position
course-by-course using bricks and blocks
or mean that it will compete strongly
with the stand up panel and brick veneer
type buildings that are traditional used
in some areas the high output and short
return on investment of these machines
could see the hadrian X transitioning
into the global marketplace
the prototype hadrian 105 has
successfully proven that the technology
delivers what it promises to do
demonstrating it can safely and
accurately build a structure caused by
course by delivering bricks along a 30
meter boom they automated bricklaying
really involves bringing a lot of
different technologies together to solve
a lot of different problems the workflow
with the traditional bricklayer is he
turns up at a slab and sets out some
strings and then some uprights and
starts laying the bridge we might place
some door frames or window frames and
they build the house wall by wall we
actually print the house layer by layer
so we do an entire course internal walls
external wall
laying bricks is not really the problem
the problem is dealing with the layer
where all the walls go because we don't
need any physical constraints for setup
we don't bother placing doors or window
frames we place all of those afterwards
so the house prints up from the ground
merging layer by layer almost as if it's
growing out of the ground there are so
many features and benefits of the
hadrian X this machine will build render
ready structures using precision brick
and block products and modern and whose
use allowing for much faster and more
accurate brick assembly the 3d modeling
and construction allows for very fast
and low-cost buildings to be completed
providing builders with efficiencies not
seen in the industry before structures
built without traditional mortar
improves the thermal and acoustic
quality of the building and reduces the
cost of heating and cooling precision
blocks that are half a meter in length
and the equivalent of 15 standard house
bricks will allow full structures to be
built in only a couple of days the
accuracy of the completed structure
allows for finishing trades to move in
immediately with improved speed and
efficiency everything can be produced
off-site in parallel and simply fitted
what's remarkable is that there is no
limitation on how higher structure can
be built in a day because there's no
sagging or collapsing under weight and
no need for cavity insulation or brick
ties then glue application nozzles
simply squirt glue onto the brick
because we use gravity to get the glue
onto the brick we can use a wide range
of construction or diesels the walls are
completed with router channels for
wiring and plumbing and 3d modeling
allows for an accurate bill of materials
for estimating producing the lowest
possible waste and further reducing cost
to the consumer
