welcome to my Kickstarter project for

as much as I've searched I've never
found one that I'd liked so now I've
made my own it's a new concept for how
your great cheese you move the grater
over the cheese instead of the cheese
over the grater so now when you grate
the cheese you can see the cheese fall
in front of you and stop when you have
enough whether it's a salad a hot dog
pizza
a sandwich or a filled row or whatever
you're making and it's not just for
cheese you can grate carrot cucumber
potato you can grate anything you like
you can create chocolate shavings for
your cappuccino or if you like you can
create chocolate shavings for your
favorite dessert it's safer than a
traditional grater because you're
grating away from your hand it's nice
and easy to clean
there's no corners or areas for bacteria
to get stuck in I will be making two
versions one for right-handed people and
wonderful left-handed people it's ultra
hygienic because it's made from titanium
and it's built to last a lifetime

introducing Euclid a more accurate
measuring cup designed with thought and
purpose it is the first and only cup to
measure small amounts just as accurately
as large amounts improving your
measurements in helping your recipes
turn out right four years ago I was
baking in the kitchen and I started
wondering why does it seem better to
measure small amounts in small measuring
cups not in large ones as an engineer I
couldn't resist digging in it turns out
it's about accuracy those measurements
two lines in the bottom of a traditional
measuring cup just aren't going to be
very accurate I realized that the shape
of the cup is the problem and that
there's a math question around what
would be a better shape a math question
I got a little excited it took me about
4 months but I finally solved the math
and then another year to develop the
first prototype and two years to refine
it into a manufacturing friendly design
but it's finally ready
the secret to Euclid's shape is that the
ratio of surface area to volume is the
same at every measurement amount it
turns out that ratio is what determines
how hard it is to measure accurately and
hence how accurate you are Euclid helps
every measurement be accurate not just
the ones to the top of the measuring cup
which is exactly what you want since
recipes are about ratios whether you
love cooking or love cool technology
join us and let's make this happen
imagine a world in which every cup of
tea is tailored to your mood your
preference so you can experience all the
joys and benefits of Team hi chief
daughter
I'm urban co-founder and CEO of team OSA
for 34 years my family has been
producing and growing tea on our tea
plantation in Taiwan since the beginning
our mission has remained the same
deliver the most authentic and healthy
statists forints to our customers that's
why we created famosa
a temporary machine that combines the
modern science with the art of the
traditional tea making the brewing
process is very important to making the
perfect cup of tea brewing with water
temperature that's too hot can damage
the natural antioxidants in the teas
steeping tea leaves for too long can
also create a bitter flavor that's why
many people add the artificial flavors
and sweeteners tea mosa is an automatic
team master which learned your taste
preferences we utilize a special
extraction method ultrasonic extraction
which rapidly takes flavors out of tea
and enhances the antioxidants and aroma
naturally you can use the team OSA paper
capsule or you can use your own loose
tea leaves once you insert the paper
capsule team OSA
scans the capsule and sets the optimal
brewing temperature and steeping time
alternatively if you use your own loose
tea leaves which allows you to customize
the brewing process and enjoy the tea
exactly how you like it the demos a
companion app gives you the option of
customizing the brewing temperature
strength and cup size through your
device remotely you can join the team
OSA community to explore the tea recipes
and craft process
