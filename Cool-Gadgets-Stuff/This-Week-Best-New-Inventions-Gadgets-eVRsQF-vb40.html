together or a big idea design last year
we launched a pocket-friendly
screwdriver that we called the bib bar
it was our first attempt at transforming
a traditional full-size screwdriver into
a pocket friendly tool designed for
everyday carry today we're back with the
new pocket tool that we call the TI EDC
wrench
we found a full-sized antique Swedish
adjustable wrench and instantly knew we
wanted to create a pocket friendly
version that would be more practical
comfortable and convenient to carry
every day despite its smaller size this
still maintains a popper full size scrip
for tougher tasks it's made from solid
grade 5 titanium and has the sturdy deep
carry titanium pocket clip so it has a
similar pocket profile as a pocket knife
adjusting the tool to fit on bolts is
very intuitive and utilizes a
time-tested design ensuring you always
have a firm grip on the bolt this pocket
wrench works well in various on the go
situations and is built to last a
lifetime

looking forward to have you on this
journey to bring this new tool to life
