hi I'm Stephen the founder of - wallets
in 2012 a puppy named - ate my wallet so
I needed a new one I couldn't find a
good replacement that fit my needs so I
designed and launched one on Kickstarter
it was featured on a number of websites
and blogs and fortunately it was funded
fast forward seven successful projects
and a quarter million happy customers
later here we are with our best
minimalist cash Walt introducing Vanda
for real ballers who still carry cash
fans racks and stacks made with
eco-friendly leather canvas it's strong
light durable and even water-resistant
it's pretty much the same type of canvas
Louis Vuitton use so you know it's
baller but without the baller price
tag it only costs the duck because the
wallet shouldn't cost more and then
what's carried inside of it that's just
silly
this wallet has everything you need two
slots for your favorite cards extra
storage with an easy pull tab a secret
compartment for keys or memory cards and
room for bills lots of bills all while
being incredibly Swift fits in shirt
pockets back pockets and even front
pockets because the wallet in your
pocket is old and needs enough
this is our eighth project and once
again we're ready for production we just
need your help Kickstarter's</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
