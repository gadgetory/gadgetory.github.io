95% of survival situations are resolved
in first 72 hours but what you do those
first 72 hours can mean the difference
in life and death for you
you
you
so here's the problem we're always on
the move we want to be prepared for the
unexpected and that's not always easy so
we came up with a solution a way to
always be ready we call it the cash belt
buy wazoo and it's designed to be the
ultimate adventure accessory it's a
money belt a travel tool a utility belt
a survival kit whatever you make it our
mindset is this and you're prepared for
the unexpected you can have the
confidence to step into the unknown and
you open up your life to any path you
choose so we designed the belt with two
goals in mind one it has to fit with all
aspects of our lives we made a belt
milspec webbing rated at 1,500 pounds
perfect fit cam and adjustable buckle
and we're making it in America because
we want to but also and this is the best
part we needed something highly
functional so the cash belt was designed
with a velcro enclosure that's over 2
feet long for carrying the essentials
and it's fully customizable we've come
up with a lot of ways to use it but
first you're probably wondering yeah are
we we're Wazzu survival gear for
engineers travelers designers all around
adventures we've been designing wearable
survival kits for over 5 years like
bracelets with dozens of different tools
and hats with secret pockets our goal is
that maximum functionality to everyday
items so when you buy a cash belt the
hang tag doubles as a coaster and our
business cards a burnable double has
fire starters we consider the cash belt
the culmination of our experience and
the next step in our evolution starting
with the concept of EDC everyday carry
you probably don't leave the houses out
of belt and with the cash belt you can
leave fully prepared without feeling
encumbered by extra items we've beta
tested this beast in our own lives
taking it all around the world and it
passed the test so we're proud to offer
2 in 3 different options the first is
the minimalist belt that you customize
we find it works great as an easy to
access money belt making it the perfect
travel accessory and great for when you
need access to mony and other items on
the go plus it looks good so it's a
great alternative to the goofy-looking
money belts currently on the market when
we travel we use it for a copy of our
passport and other travel docs cash in
multiple currencies Airbnb key and
memory cards the second option is a cash
belt stock
the essentials kit it's a TSA friendly
everyday carry kit that provides you
strong foundation to unexpected
situations while still living room for
you to customize it with your own items
the third option is a cash belt stock
with the adventure kit we think the best
survival kit is the one you have with
you so we used all our experience
designing survival gear build our most
extensive kit yet it includes you get
ready for this paracord gear loops a
wire saw zip ties
Kevlar cord ceramic knife and striker a
flashlight a Ferro rod trail markers
first aid tinder a whistle safety pins
and a fishing kit with fishing line that
doubles as sewing thread with a needle
plus brass wire duct tape Ranger pans a
compass signaling mirror bandages a
water pre-filter and water bag plus
purification tablets or you can just
boil the water in the bag for real plus
aluminium foil and it's all in the belt
about we wear everyday because in the
end we don't know what we're gonna get
into that's what makes this game so
exciting it's an adventure you are ready
we'll see you out there oh and every
version comes with a bottle opener hi my
name is Glenn clacker this is my son
Nathan hi I've been a engineer and
designer and inventor for about 14 years
now and I've designed a lot of knives
and multi tools that you might be
familiar with kolaks
is more than an axe the clacks is a
multi-tool built into the head of an axe
it has a lot of useful features
carabiner thumb jimping this is the
bottle opener the axe blade
the scraper lanyard hole the hammer with
a built-in ruler five wrench sizes and a
hex bit driver the clacks has a lot of
useful features like wrenches hammer
head and scraper along with our
innovative new clamping system that
allows you to take the axe to the field
and be able to break it down for easy
transport blacks is useful for people
who are involved in hiking climbing
camping survival experts people who do
bushcraft all sorts of things including
emergency preparedness this is a clacks
lumberjack it's our most popular model
because it includes all of the features
this is the clacks woodsman the clacks
woodsman has the clamping system
carabiner hammer the axe blade but the
more rustic version that we've created
is called the clacks feller the clacks
feller attaches using the paracord
bracelet by pulling the paracord out and
wrapping it around the handle like you
would a tomahawk this is the tie clacks
the tie clacks is a titanium version of
the clocks lumberjack it is our top of
the line model and it includes all of
the features plus it has blue anodized
highlights and it comes weighing in at
half of the weight of the feller that's
why the tie clacks is our top of the
line model thanks for watching we
appreciate your support
