and so if you make if you make plywood
out of bamboo you have a pretty heavy
product it's strong but it's but it's
heavy the structure of our our bamboo
skateboard is to use multiple layers of
woven mats of bamboo which is really I'm
not aware of anybody else trying to do
that I think what helped me transition
into skateboards merely is just the
shape of a skateboard has a kind of a
bowl like concave shape and as I learn
different ways to work bamboo more like
using basket making techniques instead
of woodworking techniques you could get
any kind of shape you want so I you know
I was at some how the skateboard shape
just seemed to to invited the material
if the bamboo bike product has been
successful as it has that means that
there's people here building bikes and
then if you can feed new products into
it say the skateboard or furniture or
just you know other things that we can
that we can follow up that just be more
jobs for for the area and that's what I
think Greensboro and Hale County need
the most of missed more jobs the socio
economic climate in Hill County has been
pretty consistent for the last 20 or 30
years about 25 percent of the population
lives below poverty and about 30 percent
of seniors live below poverty
I think the catfish industry has
probably been the biggest employer and
is that kind of dwindled away people
that are on disability are still able to
work or people that are out of work
could work so instead of leaving to go
to jobs as we're creating jobs people
can stay in their community where they
were born and raised and work I think
local bamboo skateboards can be really
exciting we have a skateboard park here
there are a lot of kids that
skateboarding and I think anytime you
can make a local product using local
craft skills pretty exciting to keep
jobs like that in the new
you
you
while skating home one night feeling
like king of the road a crack sight on
city left me epicly later it's time I
thought to take my first love one step
beyond and make functional headlights
for skateboards and now my team of
misled you can put a fully flared
product that allows you to jump off a
building go wild in the streets and
basically just skate more hi my name is
drew page i'm the founder of shred
lights I've been skateboarding for 15
years and I hit my fair share of cracks
while skating home one night I hit a
particularly vicious crack took a brutal
slam and stole my 12 pack of textbooks
all over the pavement once I regained
consciousness I was skating home and a
car came from behind me and headlights
illuminated my pack right then I saw the
light and I realized the need for
headlights on skateboards
you
my name is Eric brookmire and I'm a
co-founder and CTO at red lights without
a car my skateboard is my transportation
I looked into other solutions but
nothing actually lit up the area in
front of me or allowed me to maintain
the functionality my skateboard
my name is Sam Gordon and I'm the CMO of
shred lights our patent-pending design
allows for easy installation and it is
removable so you only have the lights on
your board when you need them
before show lights I was only able to
pack this one but now I can't pick
feedback on the first version is given a
subjective change and now shrug lights
are second to none
this is capable not the other guys have
you ever heard someone say that under
goal is pretty sweet yeah right so let's
do this let's prevent this tragedy leave
no man down we can now rise and shine
suffer the joy get tricks or die trying
kids in America jump on there hi I'm
Kyle Miller I'm the lead engineer here
at red lights with the design finalized
and the manufacturer on hold all we need
is your help to bring red lights to
skateboarders everywhere now let's stop
this is a nice day or I'm the first
customer red lights I was just blown
away by the idea of skating at night
because I don't even get the time
together I'm here today anymore I'm
constantly working and busy doing other
stuff so just the great thing
you tread lights
you
hi I'm Stefan and this is my son I'm
your nose and we both love hot spots we
want to present you now our
revolutionising invention we succeeded
to transfer the movements and writing
characteristics of our board sports into
a completely new developed skateboard
truck but before we show you our product
we would like to explain how a
conventional skateboard truck works the
in stable and aggressive principle of
skateboard trucks hasn't changed much
since more than half a century robbers
on Springs prevent that the deck flips
to left on the right side and as a screw
and the kingpin to adjust the new
ability or the weight of the driver at
all board sports like surfing or
snowboarding the board is on the deepest
position when driving straight ahead and
in the curve the center of the board is
lifted in a curve the curve core tech is
now lifted and gravity replaces the
rubber source prints as a restoring
force the curve boat rocker
self-regulating without adjusting a
kingpin now you can drive how you want
to drive fast downhill or make radical
turns its full control over your board
at any time this unique invention
includes another incredible innovation
without any changes this truck is a
swivel axis which allows you to use it
as a carving or surf skate truck for
pumping without any pushing
the idea to make skateboards came to us
when we couldn't find a board the met
our standards we wanted an eco-friendly
skateboard those high-performance
handcrafted locally in California and
classically designed in a way that
highlighted the natural beauty of the
wood faced with the challenge of being
unable to find a board we liked our
solution was to make our own our first
board was a fun project but the end
result left us unsatisfied after
countless hours working in the shop we
believe we have created a skateboard
that meets our standards our boards are
individually handcrafted in California
to ensure quality and craftsmanship we
strive to create a skateboard that is
both sustainable in high performance so
material selection is key our materials
include bamboo tri-axial fiberglass
reclaimed antique oak from salvaged
barns hard rock maple and an epoxy
derived from tree sap
