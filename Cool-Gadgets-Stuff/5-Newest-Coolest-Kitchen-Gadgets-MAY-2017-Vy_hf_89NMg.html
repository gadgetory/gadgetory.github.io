unlike anything you've ever seen or
tasted watch over about the cook center
uses advanced electronics and software
control inspired by satellites so what
you're seeing here is not a standard
grill of standard heating coils syndra
adjusts hundreds of times a second to
control your foods temperature to within
one degree
syndra is more precise than your
thermometer temperature precision is
required to perfectly cook your steak
chicken and salmon edge to edge without
guesswork when you pan fry at home it's
difficult to nail the temperature that's
precisely a difference if says five
degrees makes or breaks your food this
is even difficult for restaurants to do
but with cinder you nail it every time
what I'm showing you here is exactly
what your safe will look like all I did
was set cinder to my desired doneness
place the steak inside and wait 30
minutes for cinder to beep it knows when
a food is reached temperature at the
final step I cranked Center up to 450
degrees for a quick sear to caramelize
the exterior that makes it look and
tastes exactly like this in some sense
it's just a regular frying pan except
with precise temperature control but wow
that precise temperature control makes
all the difference we make salmon that
melts in the mouth and you know thick
porkchop cause I can never cook before
because it dried out while we put it in
the center and it's perfect
sakes perfect it gives you the precision
of so big but with the convenience of
microwave cooking anything you can put
into a normal grill you can put into
cinder and not only cinder is easy to
use as a normal grill it also makes it
impossible to overcook your food because
senders grill plates constantly hold
your food at target temperature
sender touches technology up with modern
food science this changes everything
you
you
hi there my name is max and I've always
loved to cook one day I started thinking
about cast-iron cookware that my
grandparents used to prepare their meals
with and today I am proud to present our
only 21st century urban grill pan it all
started a couple of years ago at a rainy
4th of July party I thought what if I
could bring friends indoors and offer
grill food that tastes and look even
better what if I could also iron stamp
it with ornaments instead of regular
grill marks
I shared my deal with others and
eventually put together a great team our
goal was to reimagine a classic
cast-iron skillet to invent a grill pan
that will turn every meal into something
special
a grill pan that will make the food as
healthy and flavorful as well prepared
on an open fire grill in the beginning
it looked impossible healthy and tasty
are not easily combined we needed to
re-engineer the geometry of the pan to
completely drink fat and moisture from
under the food to create a campfire
style dry see in general a cast-iron pan
is not rocket science but ours comes as
close to as you can imagine the handles
are scientifically shaved for perfectly
balancing surface angles and metal
thickness are different all around and a
thermal stabilized and bottom is
one-of-a-kind we thought of a lot of
details including easy handling oil
splatter and auto prevention or
providing ideal temperature distribution
on any stove for the first batch we
chose an Old Glory and Colorado inspired
Mountain Springs iron stamp ornaments it
took us nearly two years of tests
improvements redesigns
and more tests at last with the help of
an iron work plant with cast and crane
to our vision and cast iron we've cooked
anything and everything in our grill and
now we can guarantee you the results you
love the Flex shift grill pan is
definitely a unique cookware there
should be in every kitchen to bring
better food for
buddy any day great years like liquid
