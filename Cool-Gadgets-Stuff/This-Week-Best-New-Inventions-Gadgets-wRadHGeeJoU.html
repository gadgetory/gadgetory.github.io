if you're looking for the world's most
packable and versatile adventure jacket
that'll actually keep you warm you'll
want to hear this
we're outdoor vitals and we help
Adventures live ultralight by design
premium ultralight products that provide
more enjoyable outdoor experiences we
know of making premium products can get
expensive so we sell directly to our
consumers this lowers unnecessary costs
and allows us to produce quality designs
on everything from our sleeping bags to
our backpacks without breaking your bank
account we ask our followers what should
be mixed and the vote was unanimous an
ultralight packable jacket we didn't
want to create the same old jacket as
everyone else so for the last four years
we've been obsessed with developing the
world's best minimalist adventure jacket
the biggest problem with other jackets
was the insulation so we started their
down jackets are extremely light and
packable but don't stand well with
moisture or sweat synthetic jackets work
great with moisture but are super bulky
and not as warm as down we wanted a
jacket that was light and packable but
could still handle broad temperature
ranges and extreme weather something
that could take on anything and
everything we tested every insulation we
could find but nothing hit our criteria
so we partnered with a new innovative
company to create our own insulation and
we didn't stop iterating until we're
100% satisfied the result is a new
unique insulation called loft tech and
it changes everything
loft ik is the world's most advanced
synthetic down imitation you get the
ultra light warmth and pack ability of
Down and the versatility and moisture
advantages of synthetic unlike down life
tech uses siliconized fibers that dry
quickly and always stay lofted for
optimal warmth even when wet the loose
fill nature of the fibers mimics downs
extreme warmth to weight ratios and pack
ability if you've ever hiked in a down
jacket you'll know it's easy to sweat
because of the fabric coatings loft tech
insulation does not requires many
coatings
this makes the jacket extremely
breathable and prevents overheating we
created a unique baffle design that
reduces sewing lines while still keeping
the insulation stabilized in order to
retain the most T possible loft a gives
you better versatility than any down
insulation and better warmth than any
other synthetic insulation the best part
is that birds are loving it
adventures range from summiting Peaks to
exploring cities so our Jackass features
floor at all cut the jacket athletically
and drop the back for optimal comfort
and appearance the high net collar and
adjustable hem stop cold air from
sneaking in while elastic cuffs and
thumb holes hold the sleeves in place
and seal to the elements and insulated
to a adjustable hood keeps your head
warm and never hinders visibility or
movement insulated pockets keep your
hands toasty or you can use the zip
to sealing valuables when you start
hiking let heat escape quickly through
the zippered armpit vents best of all
the jacket easily stuffs into its own
pocket for travel or uses a pillow
unlike down no special washes are
required for a jacket and it's quick
drying abilities make it easy to clean
even when not at home
we used an ultralight 28 any ripstop
nylon for the outer shell to keep the
jacket extremely light and durable vital
dry durable water repellent see coats
the fabric so the rain rolls right off
the jacket and even lighter 10 denier
ripstop is used to line the inside of
the jacket where there's less
probability of abrasion cutting the
jacket down to a mere 12 ounces I know
some of you are thinking that a
synthetic jacket can never be as good as
a down jacket I get it I thought the
same thing that's why I test the jacket
myself in extreme situations just
assassinate I was backpacking at 11,000
feet at this elevation I knew it could
get cold fast and there's always a
chance of unexpected letter instead of
taking a rain jacket and a down jacket I
took the lighter and smaller option my
prototype loft up jacket sure enough
halfway to the peak the sunny skies
changed to a blizzard rather than are
treating to lower elevations and setting
up shelter or having to use an
unbreathable rain and down jacket combo
I threw on my lava thick jacket and kept
going
I stayed warm and watched mother nature
run of course when the storm broke I was
at the top of the peak watching the Sun
Shine on fresh beautiful stuff without
the loft tech jacket I would have turned
around before reaching the top and
missed what I came for
don't let weather or gear keep you from
enjoying the best parts of your
adventures enjoy the warmth wait and
packability of an expensive down jacket
as well as the moisture and temperature
control of a premium synthetic jacket

jacket like this between two and three
hundred dollars but thanks to our

your ears we feel the music echoing
inside our head which is the reason for
the dizziness and discomfort it took
