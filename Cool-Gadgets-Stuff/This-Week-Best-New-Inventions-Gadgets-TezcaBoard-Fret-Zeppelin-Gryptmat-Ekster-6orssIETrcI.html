ultimate all-terrain electric board it
can manage different types of terrain
like pavement grass rough ground and
even more we've designed this type of
board because we want to offer a new
experience in mobility and recreation
many of the conventional electric boards
that exist in the market are really for
the urban model but what about if you
don't live in just the city and you live
in this other type of place where the
road conditions make it impossible to
use the conventional electric boards or
what about if you want to have escape to
the mountains or to the lake or to any
other place like this where you really
can't use that type of board
here is where the teske board comes in
to ensure this we have changed the
conventional belt drive system to our
gearbox system so we can have a bigger
traction in the different types of roads
the teske board has a top speed of 30
km/h an optimal autonomy of 15 kilometer
range and also we have designed a
flexible and new modular interchangeable
battery system if you carry another
package of battery you can just change
it and continue your way as it's an
all-terrain board we include our new
suspension system so you can manage all
this irregular terrains offering you
efficient handling and performance it's
really perfect for the mountains but
also for the streets it can climb hills
and slopes up to 30 degrees and you
don't have to worry again about cracks
holes and loose gravel that sometimes we
found in the streets that make us lose
the control
the test keyboard is really easy to use
for beginners and pros it really takes
you like five minutes to master it and
have a great ride
believe me once you get on the board you
won't want to get off again
be part of this project and help us
reach our goal
this is Frette Zeppelin fret Zeppelin is
a state-of-the-art led addition to your
guitar it fits just above the frets and
shows you exactly where to put your
fingers to play anything you can imagine
let's take a look at how learning to
play guitar usually turns out you head
to your local music store and pick out a
guitar it's beautiful you love it and
you couldn't be more excited to get
started you get home and immediately try
to play something you're prepared you
have your books tablature online videos
websites everything or so it seems after
hours of dedicated attention the
frustration sets in you've done
everything right what's wrong the
problem is simple human nature you
naturally want to be shown exactly what
to do so that's what we did
add a fret settle into your guitar and
it shows you exactly where to put your
fingers so all you have to do is strum
or pick it cannot be any simpler use the
smartphone app to select what you'd like
to play and you're instantly ready to
rock you can display chords notes scales
and any key and of course any light show
you can imagine for those fun times or
use AI mode to have the next finger
location displayed automatically after
you've strum LED technology has only
recently progressed enough to make fret
Zeppelin possible fret Zeppelin is only
half the height of your guitars frets
that means there will be absolutely no
interference with the strings or your
hand as you play fret Zeppelin was
engineered with musicians in mind you
pick the playing style and fret Zeppelin
teaches you the connections between each
fret are on the top side of the guitar
where your hand doesn't slide but even
if you get into some advanced playing
techniques the sleek coating seamlessly
aligns with your guitar neck so it isn't
noticed
Frette Zeppelin lets you learn guitar
fast and intuitively whether you're a
first-time player or experienced fret
Zeppelin works for anyone with any
guitar what's next is up to you
we are the tool masters the tinkers the
mechanics and the craftsman we are the
people who work with our hands
fixing building and creating we know
that detail matters every second
productivity counts revolutionize the
way you work with a grit map streamline
your workflow and get the job done
hey Kickstarter I'm Tom I'm an f16
mechanic in the Air Force and I was
tired of my tools sliding off the
aircraft so I set out to create a
product that would keep everything you
need to do your job at your fingertips
so after two and a half years of
prototyping in my basement I came up
with the grip man a flexible non-slip
tool tray with the ability to hold tools
at extreme angles for variety of work
surfaces we launched the product four
months ago at the world's largest air
show and sold out of the original grip
mat within the first week because we're
not only loved the product that they
reinforce our decision is they going
into other markets and expanding our
product
so I got to work and designed three new
grip mats a large medium and small we
are excited to launch these three
products to the Kickstarter community
never chase a runaway screw again the
small grip mat is comprised of six
compartments that will keep your
hardware organized and within arm's
reach the medium is designed to help
keep your hand tools together in close
proximity such as under the hood or on
top of the ladder the large is designed
for more involved jobs where a handful
of tools just won't cut it a grip ssin
industries we believe that simplicity is
key our grip mats are comprised of our
unique formula specially designed to
provide high end friction and chemical
resistance thank you for watching our
video and please help us make this a
reality
by supporting our campaign and sharing
our story
