mountains of Metropolis on the
revolutionary surf wheel su an electric
skateboard with technology fit for a
superhero top engineers at kufi
development spent over two years
researching and developing a unique
patent-pending tire tread along with
assisted stabilization technology that
allows you to step out your front door
and feel the rush of flying down away
we're soaring down a mountain with
advanced gyroscopic sensors that keep
the deck perfectly level under the
riders feet the surf wheel intuitively
senses weight shifts mimicking the
experience of surfing on land the surf
wheel su is equipped with a
full-spectrum LED light enabling you to
enter night mode and show off your every
move ride for over 15 kilometers on a
single charge and extend your ride even
further with the support of a
replaceable battery the surf wheel gives
you the ability to explore your city
exercise and enjoy yourself in
superhuman ways so please give yourself
the gift of flight and supporting the
international team of engineers at goofy
development to continue to make
transportation more fun and exciting
with the surf wheel su
we can measure a lot with breath
specifically we can measure the amount
of carbon dioxide you breathe out and
the amount of oxygen you breathe in if
we take a ratio of those two numbers so
you get what's called our ER and our er
can give us basically how much
carbohydrates versus fat you're burning
you can see when we run a test in the
lab persons exercising longer and longer
they're going to be very more
carbohydrates
the duration of exercise at a certain
intensity dramatically changes their
body's metabolism for 24 hours with the
band on your wrist you use breath for
five minutes once a month while you take
a walk after five minutes of analysis
the app shows you how you burn fat in
those five minutes how much you could
burn in 24 hours and your capacity to
lose weight this month other fitness
trackers based on heart rate zone
training and create you to workout at
low intensity for a prolonged period of
time and make assumptions for your fat
or sugar bird instead path precisely
measures how you burn fat to your breath
and knows when you stall for the fall
over time pat learns how your exercise
changes of fat and sugar run throughout
the day and starts recommending the
minimum minutes of exercise you need
every day to achieve your goal the
challenge is how do you determine
someone's 24 hours metabolism with only
2 minutes of great analysis so we
collected personal break data of almost
300 individuals in the lab not just
during the exercise but also after they
eat and why this team it months of
testing and use this data to frame and
paste on machine algorithms which now
can predict your metabolism with 90 to
95% exit path measures our oxygen and
co2 levels during each stage to measure
your metabolism to the minute
which is equivalent to a we owe to sub
max sense according to several research
studies half of the fitness tracker
users end up abandoning their devices
but ours is different it's the most
personal and the pure support we could
help everybody reach its true potential
Thank You Kickstarter
well I just hang with the crowd you can
escape the crowd for city or campus
commuting X gave the exceptional folding
electric scooter is the first choice for
the last mile XK plus you travel
effortlessly and silently for a range of
about 25 miles it folds up in one second
literally and can be pulled like a
carry-on suitcase at just over 40 pounds
it can be easily lifted onto a train or
bus and when you park it its footprint
is just over one square foot xscape
comes with its own bluetooth app that
you can download to your smart phone the
app gives you GPS information lets you
adjust the speed setting the 6:10 for 15
miles per hour and even serves as a
virtual tea to turn an X game on off
made of aircraft-grade aluminum xkf can
handle over 300 pounds and completely
fit sliders up the six and a half feet
tall tech escapes exclusive independent
dual rear wheel suspension makes for an
exceptionally stable ride even one
corner and cross fuel rear disc brakes
keep you saved in South X capes ul
approved lithium-ion battery delivers
impressive climbing power and fully
recharges in six aliments xscape even
has a USB dock to charge your smart
phone an xscape really lights it up with
decorative light as well as a smart
driving lamp and a safety tail lamp
xscape is in a word exceptional so why
hang with the crowd you can escape the
crowd
starting a business nowadays is easy
everyone has great ideas but sometimes
it takes a lot of repetitive work to
realize them this is where do bot m1
gets in do bot m1 is an industrial level
robotic arm production platform it's
precise fast and extendable and also
affordable it can be your 3d printer
laser engraver soldering machine or
whatever else you build upon it yes you
can build one do bot m1 has 0.02
millimeters repeatability and 1.5
kilogram payload with these standardized
easy to change heads you can easily turn
this power into productivity like 3d
printing it can print your product with
fluency and details to colors no problem
or use laser to engrave your unfading
masterpiece or do sophisticated
soldering customizing your PCB circuit
board better than a pro besides being
multifunctional do bottom one is also
easy to master and develop doo-bot m1
supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connection
you can connect to multiple arms at once
and control them via our app on PC or
smartphone with a force sensitive 3d
mouse you can control do bot m1 as
precisely as you want no more trying and
guessing on a confusing software with
its hand whole teaching feature you can
input coordinates in the fastest and
most intuitive way
do bottom one is programmable via the
integrated api's you can use official or
self built developing environment or use
this visualized programming interface
making things a lot easier but we don't
stop here do bot m1 is highly extendable
there are no limits to your imagination
on it the maximum reach of do bottom one
is 400 millimeters which is enough for
most of the situations but why don't we
think bigger
when it can actually go further or use a
camera for visual with it's fast and
accurate image recognizing algorithm it
can distinguish colors without making
one mistake do bottom one loves
companions they can work seamlessly
together processing paperwork way faster
than humans could ultimately do bottom
one is built to replace manpower in
production line working day and night
non-stop the built-in mapping and path
planning system provides this excellent
mobility providing inventory management
service in your warehouse to be able to
create so much value to bottom one has
been built with extraordinary
performance the perfect calibration of
the high performance DC servomotor
harmonic reducer and kinematic algorithm
has brought out the best of both
strength and speed repeatability of 0.02
millimeters maximum payload of up to 1.5
kilograms angular speed of up to 200
degrees per second it's also a steady
player never slips up
everyone loves creating things and
having a robotic arm is awesome with do
bottom one it's no longer a giant
business's privilege to use professional
robotic arms everyone can now benefit
from a cost-effective user-friendly
robotic arm technology so when a new
idea hits you do bot m1 will be ready
all you have to do is say yes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
