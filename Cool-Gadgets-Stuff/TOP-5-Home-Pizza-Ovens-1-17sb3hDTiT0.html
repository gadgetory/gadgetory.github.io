oven is fully assembled your only
minutes from fresh hot pizza this oven
preheats in approximately 10 minutes and
cook the pizza and about 6 it also
reaches temperatures of up to 600
degrees Fahrenheit let's go over the
basics of operating me up first make
sure your pizzeria pronto is securely
centered over the burn
then set the burner to high then preheat
the oven with the door on the pizza rear
pronto requires the use of a pizza peel
to put your pizza in the oven when you
make your pizza I suggest sprinkling the
peel with plenty of flour that way it's
less likely to stick the pizza oven can
accommodate up to a 12 inch pizza today
I've prepared a pizza with tomato sauce
mozzarella and we're going to finish
with a little bit of basil we're going
to start by giving it a little back and
forth shape once everything's moving
we're going to open the door insert the
peel into the oven and give it a
back-and-forth shake to get it to go in
once your pizza is safely inside the
oven close the door and let the oven do
the work after about 2 or 3 minutes the
pizza is ready to be rotated simply open
the door
retrieve the pizza give it a rotation
and put it back in close the door and
finish cooking after another three
minutes my pizza fully cooked and ready
to slice and serve your pizzeria pronto
stovetop oven is immediately ready to
cook another pizza after the first one
comes out that's what makes it so great
this oven can cook up to six pizzas in
the time it takes your conventional oven
cook just one and there you have it
so pizzeria pronto stovetop pizza oven
is a pizza party right on your own stove
we hope you have fun and enjoy making
pizzas
let me tell you a secret
this piece of wasn't made in a
wood-fired brick oven it wasn't made in
an oven at all I made it in my kitchen
stove in just three minutes
Pizza is the original fast food and I
really love to share it with my friends
but making pizza at home is very time
consuming and the results are never the
same it's in my favorite pizza plate
nothing kills to move concerts than
hungry guests so why are we still making
Pisa at home an oven which takes forever
to preheat that's not bad food and the
party will be over before you even make
one goodbye when I went on a mission to
make the best possible pizza in the
shortest amount of time
Eyre Nate was born irony is designed to
skip an oven all together so you can
make your pizzas straight on your
kitchen stove or range in under 10
minutes ironing can heat up to 800
degrees Fahrenheit just like commercial
pizza oven no more waiting 30 plus
minutes for your oven to preheat heating
up your apartment and wasting all that
energy the cover is designed to quickly
soak up the energy from your stove and
radiate intense heat into the crust and
hopping to ensure evenly cooked beef
that in just three minutes the bottom
end of irony is made out of special feel
that can hold it much energy as for
Govan and it conducts heat way better so
you get those perfect charge spots on
the bottom of your pizza
you can turn even a frozen supermarket
pizza into a star of your party with
irony irony it handmade in Europe it's
made out of heavy-duty steel which
prevents wrapping and is virtually
indestructible its all-natural code is
only with vegetable oil to prevent it
from rushing and provides a nonstick
surface it's made to last a lifetime
we tested iron eight with all common
heat sources it works great on electric
glass induction or
so you can even use it on your grill or
campfire have you ever made a gourmet
pizza while camping now you can and it's
not intended just for pizza either high
carbon steel is superior to stainless
steel aluminum or even cast-iron it can
hold more energy and gradiate more heat
so that sous vide State will get a
perfectly seared finish the cover can be
used as a baking shield for those rare
occasions you'll still want to make your
pizza in an oven providing a sports and
hot surface that emulates a wood-fired
brick oven discover the presto pizzazz
plus rotating pizza up it's the fast and
easy way to bake fresh or frozen pizza
then or rising crust plus it prepares
convenience foods like frozen chicken
length jalapeno poppers fish fillets egg
rolls and more the pizzazz plus features
a rotating tray that turns continuously
for even bacon while ordinary ovens are
heating you're eating no need to preheat
simply set the timer and it begins to
bake the top and bottom heating elements
bake food from both sides quickly and
evenly and they're separately controlled
select the top bottom or both elements
for perfect results every time use the
bottom element to make a crispier crust
or the top element for a bubblier topic
and with the open oven design it's easy
to see when the pizza is done just away
like the timer signals when cooking time
is complete and automatically turns the
heating element off with a non-stick
baking pan removed cleaning and storage
is easy the pizzazz plus doesn't heat up
your kitchen and can save as much of 60%
in energy compared to a conventional
oven chicken nuggets quesadillas grilled
sandwiches even cookies and cinnamon
rolls and of course pizza delicious the
pizzazz plus rotating pizza oven from
custom
hi I'm Kim do you like pizza and do you
think it's even tastier and more fun to
make them with your friends and family
then the pizza read classic suits you
perfectly it works really simple after
you prepare the dough circles and the
ingredients you can put together your
own mini pizza lets you shove it in the
oven with the included spatula the pizza
oven is heated from underneath as well
as from above for a perfect result the
terracotta dome absorbs moisture so your
pizzas get a really crunchy and after
seven minutes they are ready to enjoy it
love it and this way they learn to
combine by themselves besides it's
healthy and the pizza oven doesn't
produce any unpleasant smells like with
fondue or raclette for the little one
there are metal spatulas available which
can be placed inside the office also
ideal for making a big pizza when you
don't have a normal office so we
recommend the pisa red plastic one up a
seat ciao
hi I'm deaf the chef and welcome to get
cooking with gourmet pizza is a family
favorite in my home and now we can have
fresh baked pie anytime we want oven hot
and exactly how we like it
xep like olive Russian kind fo no this
clever rotating piece and maker ensures
that each 12-inch pizza is baked evenly
all around you can even control the top
and bottom heating elements separately
for a crispier crust or a browner top
what makes core Mia's pizza maker stand
out is the imported precooked stone they
comes with the unit the stone makes her
a thin crisp crust while gently melting
cheese you just can't get the same pizza
with a metal pan here's another little
secret we used to keep the makers for
frozen pieces to do it makes this
horrible frozen pies actually taste good
and they take less time to get to the
table so in my house no more waiting for
a delivery that comes with warm and soft
the cornea piece and me a pizza maker is
like having a piece surreal right in
your home
