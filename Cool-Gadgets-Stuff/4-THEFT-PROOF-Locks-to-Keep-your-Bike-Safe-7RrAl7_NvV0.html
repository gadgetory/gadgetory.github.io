introduce you a skunk lock we all know
that gut-wrenching feeling of coming
back and your bike's gone
that won't happen with a skunk lock
skunk lock is a bicycle lock that was
designed with a built-in deterrent
it can actually stop a thief from
stealing your bike lock manufacturers
won't tell you the fact that any you
lock can be compromised with the right
tools the truth is any lock can be cut
in a minute or less and that's why 1.5
million bikes are stolen each year let's
not worry about electronics which can
fail or crooks with an angle grinder
let's pressurize a unique chemical
compound into the lock that's first if
the loss is compromised skull clock is
manufactured with the highest quality
materials we can find
we've expensively tested our prototypes
for your safety and convenience it
doesn't look like any other you lock on
the market and unlike any other you lock
a thief will get a noxious surprise if
they try to steal their bike when it
comes to the challenge of delivering a
thunk lock to your door we're ahead of
the crowdfunding curve we have
manufacturing in place and they're ready
to build upon receiving our first order
and skunk lock comes with easy key
replacement how would it feel if you
never have to worry about your Viking
stone again join the revolution and grab
a skunk lock it could be the last lock
you ever buy
bikes are stolen like a lot - every
minute over a million every year and
that's just what's reported that's why
we're so excited to bring you linka the
world's first Auto unlocking smart bike
lock linka can do a lot of cool things
but at its core it's a powerful lock
that's hard mounted to your frame so
you're always ready when you're ready to
lock up just tap the button and a
hardened steel ring slides into place
making it impossible to ride away so now
that your bikes locked
if someone tribe's picking it up linka
has a built-in accelerometer that
automatically triggers a silent stopping
the thief in their truck while
simultaneously sending a tamper alert
directly to your phone so you know
what's up now what makes linka a smart
lock is its ability to recognize who you
are and automatically unlock as you
approach of course you can always unlock
it with your smart phone or for phone
with access you can press your four
digit faster so if you want to lock your
bike to something add on a link a chain
and just lock up to an existing bike
rack if you already have a chain or you
lock then you're all set
inside linka is a really powerful
battery you can get up to one whole year
before your next charge and the link app
notifies you when your batteries load so
you never really have to think about it
so about the app not only does it auto
unlock linka sent amber alerts and track
battery usage we're really excited to
introduce our best indicator map the app
tracks reported stolen bikes in your
area and warns you of dangerous
locations we'll even recommend a safer
place department so we pack linka with a
bunch of awesome features but equally as
important to us was creating a design
and form factor that you'd be excited to
put on your bike so why are we doing
this the more I kept riding my bike the
more I realized how difficult it was to
keep it safe after doing some research I
found that I wasn't the only one having
and that's when lingo was born

tax lock light beautiful secure
and no key we thought the lock industry
could use a little shaking up so we
created the no keypad lock the world's
first smart padlock no key is won
numerous awards has been recognized with
a game-changing innovation however some
people need an extra level of protection
so we created the no PU lock
incorporating all the cutting-edge
technology used in the original no key
into a practically indestructible
hardened steel body the milkey you lock
will protect your bicycle or motorbike
in the toughest environment while also
giving you easy access using only your
smartphone available with an app for iOS
Android and Windows phones the Nokia
lock uses wireless Bluetooth technology
when clicked it automatically looks for
a phone with a compatible key and
unlocks you don't even need to remove
your phone from your pocket or purse
just click and go no more worrying about
lost keys or forgotten combination
sharing your bike with others diseases
with just a couple taps you can quickly
and securely share your bike with your
friends even better you can revoke
access automatically without needing to
track down key the note do you lock
incorporate the long-life rechargeable
battery that will last several years
between charges but we wanted to know to
ulong's to do even more so we added an
alarm after locking no key hold down the
button to arm the alarm function if
someone tampers with your no key for
more than three seconds a loud alarm
will freak for 30 seconds drawing
attention and likely scaring off you
increasing the alarm function resets
every time you open no key the history
function in the app shows you who when
and where no key was used what if your
phone dies or is live not a problem just
key in your custom quick click code this
ensures that you'll never be left
stranded
in the unlikely event that you ignore
the warning in the app and let your
battery die you can always give Nokia
jump start with an external battery
finally maybe you don't have a
smartphone or prefer to bike without it
we've got you covered just add the
optional key fob to your ordering you'll
be able to access no key with or without
your smartphone no key no problem</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
