the fresh
this is a tent this is a rival a tent is
a good solution to sleep in nature rhino
wolf is an all-around incredible
solution that's just incredible yeah we
repeated the word incredible can attend
to this no it can't
oh and when you laid down to sleep in a
tent you need a sleeping bag and a
mattress you know what Rhino wolf has to
say about that
hahaha stupid tent line all over the
modular attachable uh what do I call it
not a tent because it's so much better
than a tent it's a modular attachable
right wall because there's nothing like
it
Rhino wolf is amazingly built that we've
seen is precisely the fabric is as
strongest possible with extra thought to
the weight with all those right
materials and a built in sleeping bag
and mattress rhino wolf weighs only five
pounds that's at least two pounds less
than carrying a sleeping bag mattress
and tent separately and you also don't
look like a snail when carrying it ha
look at that snail man snail man Rhino
wolf also weighs less than other
all-in-one tent but it's also better
than them because it's not a tent
it's a writable Rhino wolf has a main
arch that gives the entire structure its
solid strength and allows for straight
sides which enables great airflow and a
fit for the human body you're human
right he I you are lino wolf can
withstand very low temperatures and
feels very cool and warm one
of course it's windproof rainproof and
bug food it's a rhino it's strong and
yes it also comes in pink and rhino will
can pull out any colour the setup Rhino
will you just use one pole yeah one
that's less than any other number just
push the pole through the sleeve and
you're done now thanks to the Rhino of
course you can easily attach your
incredible Rhino to other incredible
right walls and create up Capac O'Brien
Award get it
a rhino wolf pack take a look at the
rhino wolf sleeping bag that weighs less
but keeps you warmer we took some
filling from the bottom added it to the
top and put an insulating air mattress
instead so you sleep like in a bed not
like you're stuck in a cube like some
two feeds or something you're not
toothpaste you're a human and you
deserve comfort rhino wolf comfort when
you attach another Rhino wolf you can
also attach the blankets to create a
double bed for you know things you do in
a double bed need some privacy just
close your own rhino wolf and you've got
your own room
yup a double bed with privacy it's that
better than your home probably not
that's a stupid comparison he we have a
vision
no more tents no more carrying extra
sleeping equipment just Rhine wolves
everywhere because a tent that's okay
rhino wolf is incredible get one and be
happy it's simple Rhino Oh what does a
rhino wolf do
natural disasters are occurring all the
time and I've noticed one common thing
throughout all of them people need light
they need power and they need a heat
source to cook so what we've done is
combined all three of those basic
survival needs into one compact unit
Pyrus Pyro's combines those three
functions very well but it is capable of
so much more
you
we haven't intimated that signal
you
Oh
I've developed products in the outdoor
industry for over 20 years and I
continue to be baffled as to why the
mummy bag is still considered an
acceptable sleeping solution it's light
and it's warm but it severely restricts
your natural movement it was never
designed to let us sleep the way that
we've naturally sleep I wanted to create
a sleeping bag that combines the warmth
and the weight of a mummy bag the
ability to just sleep magic like you do
in your bed at home it shouldn't matter
if your side or stomach or a back
sleeper in it it shouldn't matter
whether you want to sleep in a tent or
hammock earth on a couch in the back of
your car or whether it's going to be
warm or cold out that night sleeping
bags ought to do all those things
introducing is any living bed the
world's first freestyle backcountry
sleeping bag that lets you sleep in
whatever position you want to wherever
you want to the Zen bivy bed combines a
backpacking goal with a fitted sheet of
wood that zips into place on top of the
globe rather than on the edges bring you
to spread out or rafts from the around
you without paying you to the mattress
by thinking outside the box and using
the warmth of your pad and eliminating
the weight of insulation underneath you
and rethinking zippers we've been able
to reallocate the same weight into the
places that you really need it for
comfort because you can sleep with
equipment or unzips or anywhere in
between the Zen baby bed lets you sleep
comfortably in the backcountry
regardless of whether it's spring summer
or fall
if it's cold outside curl up with the
clothes comfortably sit into the
building wrap snugly around you for one
creating a draft free night sleep when
it's warm or hot outside sleep with the
globe partially or fully unzipped
letting it easily regulate your
temperature to sleep more comfortable
arms and arms out legs and legs down
just like you would in your bed at home
it's perfect for the backcountry because
you get the portability and the warmth
of a mummy bag but you free yourself
from the compromises why be in tune in
among them when you can sleep
freestyling in any position any
temperature rule anywhere for everyone
who loves the great outdoors quality
time spent exploring mother nature with
friends and family is an amazing
especially when you relax and appreciate
great food together
the only problem like in size and
protected areas may be an issue and
carrying heavy barbecues can be very
uncomfortable that's why we created the
world's first backpackers grill
introducing gizeh weighing in at only
three point seven kilograms it provides
a cooking area big enough to easily
grill eight burgers plus it's perfect
for cooking all foods including meats
vegetables and even pizza
the gives out fits easily into a
backpack living rooms are plenty of food
fuel and accessories and quickly sets up
dominica no more discomfort or worry
about cooking delicious food outdoors

desserts create long lasting magical
moments and memories we get the food
lovers and anyone with a real taste for
adventure to help us bring get out to
the market we need your support
