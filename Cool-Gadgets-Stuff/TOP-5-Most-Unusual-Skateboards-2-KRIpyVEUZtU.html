Oh
the idea came from just wanting to
maximize the amount of riding living in
Michigan here we have short seasons surf
seasons and just the thought was - how
can I extend that season and so I got
into logging boarding and this idea here
kind of came from surfing because we
wanted to get a feel that kind of had a
fluid-filled below like liquid below a
surfboard and so that's where the spring
comes from and so when you're riding and
carving all your motion comes from your
spring instead of the deck so it's a
different feel for different ride and
it's got more of a surfing feel
you
what do you think it it's pretty wild
it's like I'm it's super light
you
Oh
you
you

hi everybody I'm Brian from Beaubourg
and I'm here to tell you about a product
that you just saw for the first time
ever after seven years in development
we're so excited to bring this to you on
Kickstarter our product doesn't require
a battery or any charging no gas powered
motors no gasoline no fumes best of all
I can get rid of these things and this
too no longer am I trying to achieve the
things that my kids want to ride with
three different products when I can use
one the Beaufort it's fun it's fast it
can curve and cruise and you go 10 to 15
miles an hour with it watch the rest of
the video and see how much fun it is
hi so I'm back again I'd like to take a
minute and show you a few the features
what you just saw was the Handy break
brings us to a great stop and my riding
style was bow boarding a lot of fun
great for cruising some of the other
features are the adjustable handlebar up
and down for different height riders we
also have the collapsible handle bar for
easy transport
also great for commuters kids getting
around campus the best of all our
technology the rider puts one foot or
two feet here and as your body weight
pushes down on the bow it drives the
spiral drive now for the other riding
style
it's called kick and go great for starts
getting up the fast beats
so that's a wrap that's a full day of
bow boarding when you're done you just
fold down the handle it's only 18 pounds
puts it up put it away great for
anywhere you want to go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
