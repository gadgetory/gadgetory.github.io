physical version of pong one of the
first video games ever created early on
we realized the magnitude of the
challenge and that's how the table pong
project was born as the project evolved
we wanted it to be more than a table
with a game we started adding functions
like charging your cell phone listening
to music through bluetooth then
displaying the time when you're using it
as a table for the past three years
we've been perfecting the design
we tried magnets different surfaces
motors etc to build the prototype we
have today some months ago we decided to
share the project on social media to see
what people thought about it and it had
a wonderful reception this motivated us
to continue developing this project
which is where we're at right now the
simplicity of pong is what makes it
possible to play with kids and adults
it's fun for all ages
I believe that the table can be in homes
but also could be in offices in bars
after all of these events we're very
committed to move forward and we want to
bring the table pong project to every
part of the world and for that we need
your support
beer games rely on sight and sound alone
to engage the user never before has
hardware it existed to let you feel the
virtual world until now immerse yourself
in the sensation of touch and experience
virtual reality gaming I can never look
for this is the hard light suit hi my
name is Morgan stinko I am the CEO and
founder of prophase VR and these are my
co pham I'm Jordan Brooks he had a
product unleashing Copeland at Amarna
the hardline suit is a haptic feedback
with designed specifically for VR game
it uses vibration pads and sensors to
transform in-game actions into
real-world solutions tactics are your
sense of touch haptic pass allows to
reproduce those same sensations the hard
light suit features 16 individually
activated haptic path enabling extremely
precise touch feedback feel sword clash
against real experience the virtual
rainstorm or even blocks with your
friends all possible the hard light
super the hard lights uses inertial
sensors to mere physical movements in
game raise your arms reflect both for
your back to dodge Arabs or punch a
zombie in the face the hard by tracking
system also lets you see your entire
abattoir not just a pair of floating
hands and ahead we designed the hard
light suit to be adjustable and
breathable so people of all body types
can gain comfortably
adjustable straps on the abdomen arms
and shoulders allow users to custom fit
the suit to their body great games of
the key to great VR we're launching with
10 awesome hard like compatible games
but that's just the start our easy to
use API makes it simple for developers
to add hardlight compatibility to
existing games and our hardware
development kit is already in the hands
of developers across the art platform
we've also created a huge library of
immersive haptic effects so that
developers can quickly add realistic
sensations to their games we've also
developed an audio only mode which
enables simplified audio-based tactics
in all the games book what you try
really really good have to be back you
will notice what it's like to not have
it you get dialed into with more senses
than ever your experience able to
perform at a level that you are never
able to perform at before our visions
the null-space vr is to bridge the
virtual and real world by making haptic
feedback available to everyone to that
end we've spent years designing and
prototyping the hard light soup into the
finished game already product it is
today now all we need is the support the
VR enthusiasts like you the bag our
Kickstarter and be the first to
experience the next generation of vr
gaming the size of music analyzes change
kind of a weird scaling to think about
music you could take up space a long
chase
the players are big is Lebanon your
library trunk and display it in your
living room music is still a huge part
of our lives but it's not as easy to see
in there until now introducing the
original cassette tape computation
modern design with a retro feel remember
your old 77th floor with the in dash or
the mixtapes I got to your first kiss
how about planning out your whole day
just so you could record Rick Dees
weekly top 40 things like this that
inspired us to say David hang with the
help of my brother five years ago we
started hand building cuffs and cassette
tape tables out of my parents barn in
South Dakota today our table has been
featured in commercials red carpet
events TV shows numerous blogs and on
concert stages we filled table to
customers in 10 different countries
across for Khan and you can pick one up
today off of our website for only
seventeen hundred dollars hold on all
right ok so our 17 hundred dollar tables
are worth everybody but the one piece of
feedback that we've gotten over and over
is that we need to make a more
affordable model which is why we're
flipping the tape over
we went back to the drawing board and
figured out a way to make a more
affordable table we build relationships
with top furniture manufacturers and we
lined up suppliers and logistics all
with the goal of being able to provide
everybody that gives the tables an
opportunity to buy one at an affordable
price
with the nod to Jeff Koons our designs
and oversized replica of a classic
mixtape it features a wooden body with
extreme attention to detail everything
is made to scale all the way down to the
tabs on the side stainless steel cup
holders give the table gets the 9 inch
deep hidden shelf is perfect for books
for most magazines or a bluetooth
speaker steel hairpin legs complement
the retro look and a dry erase top gives
you the opportunity for unlimited mixes
so our new designs finalized and we've
lined up all the detail but be able to
offer this new low price we need to
order a large quantities in this is
where we need your help help us raise
the capital for our first run of page by
backing our kickstarter campaign you're
going to get a really cool piece of
furniture at the lowest price that we've
ever offered that you're preserving a
little piece of history actually it's
like an oversized piece of history yeah
no responses so makes the cassette tape
coffee table your next coffee table and
help us to get it into as many homes and
offices and studios and dorm rooms as
many of the tapes intel's cassettes are
safe in the memories of humanity's
forever save the day
I'm Jason thought director of em to see
innovation with inventors of the hugely
successful content brand but has taken
the camping world by storm over the last
few years pod changed the face of
camping by allowing tends to be
connected together and we are now ready
for launch of quick pitch modular
camping version who's cube cube offers
quick pitching times of less than two
minutes straight out the bag and fully
pitch unlike other quick pitching tents
in fact like many other tents in the
camping world you can stand up in all of
our variation of the two men right
through to the former the cube isn't
easy to pack away as it is to set up and
it means you won't need to be an expert
in our Radames to try and get it back
into the bag when you're ready to come
home one of the major issues with
standard sense of being woken up by the
Sun so with the q10 we've added a black
line into our material and this blocks
out the Sun light our extensive
information system means that a cool
environment inside our tents the
material is to yukos's andreas to our
hydrostatic head ratings of for
thousands meaning you'll be nice and dry
even under heavy rain conditions a
heavy-duty 300d nylon material means
this tent is built to last for many
years to come the key to the cube is
that like easy to erect and they offer
you a great space inside in addition we
have a few extras that we think will
make it 10 in a classless own unlike
other 10 you can connect them together
the universal tunnel system means you
can build your own bespoke setup club
interconnect depend on every cue you can
connect to every corner means the
possibilities to join are absolutely
endless just imagine the fun of roots of
makes it has connecting together these
at a festival in
securing your very own party area as
part of this campaign we are offering a
two-man three-man and poor man versions
of the tents in blue red and orange
color options we are also adding some
add-ons offering you a solar panel that
can be sitting inside the window of the
cube to store power and a 13,000
milliamp battery pack this practice has
a huge capacity why not use it to use
one of our ultra cool LED lighting strip

white or if you want too expensive
either party tent then you can use the
color-changing version</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
