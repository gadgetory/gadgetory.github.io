day one because getting outside helps
you reconnect to what matters whether
it's who you with or where you are a
sense of adventure or just relaxation
we're here to help you get there we're
so low stove and fire is what we do best
wherever whenever
compact efficient durable and all you
need is wood that's right no gas just
wood less smoke less hassle way less
hassle and a flame so clean you'd never
guess you were using wood we've made
products for the backcountry the car
camper and the backyard but when it came
to our largest fire pit we noticed one
size did not fit all you asked us for a
bigger flame and that
introducing the solo stove Yukon the
biggest fire pit we've made yet same
amazing flames same efficient design
just wait
but a lot of you asked for something
smaller for travellers in city dwellers
so we size down the original fire pit to
fit with you wherever you go
introducing the solo stove ranger same
powerful flame smaller footprint perfect
for life on the road and life in the
city this is Kickstarter number three in
2014 we funded our first production of
the campfire and in 2016 we were the
ones who brought the bonfire to life we
make things we want to use and we get
our inspiration from you our backers we
want to keep making products that help
you get outside and reconnect to what
matters whatever that is for you so
thank you for giving them
the opportunity keep doing what we love
and whatever you do make sure to get
outside
if you're looking for the world's most
packable and versatile adventure jacket
that'll actually keep you warm you'll
want to hear this
we're outdoor vitals and we help
Adventures live ultralight by design
premium ultralight products that provide
more enjoyable outdoor experiences we
know of making premium products can get
expensive so we sell directly to our
consumers this lowers unnecessary costs
and allows us to produce quality designs
on everything from our sleeping bags to
our backpacks without breaking your bank
account we ask our followers what should
be next and the vote was unanimous an
ultralight packable jacket we didn't
want to create the same old jacket as
everyone else so for the last 4 years
we've been obsessed with developing the
world's best minimalist adventure jacket
the biggest problem with other jackets
was the insulation so we started their
down jackets are extremely light and
packable but don't stand well with
moisture or sweat synthetic jackets work
great with moisture but are super bulky
and not as warm as down we wanted a
jacket that was light and packable but
could still handle broad temperature
ranges and extreme weather something
that could take on anything and
everything we tested every insulation we
could find but nothing hit our criteria
so we partnered with a new innovative
company to create our own insulation and
we didn't stop iterating until we're
100% satisfied the result is a new
unique insulation called loft tech and
it changes everything
loft ik is the world's most advanced
synthetic down invitation you get the
ultralight warmth and pack ability of
down and the versatility and moisture
advantages of synthetic unlike down life
tech uses siliconized fibers that dry
quickly and always stay lofted for
optimal warmth even when wet the loose
fill nature of the fibers mimics downs
extreme warmth to weight ratios and pack
ability if you've ever hiked in a down
jacket you'll know it's easy to sweat
because of the fabric coatings loft tech
insulation does not requires many
coatings
this makes the jacket extremely
breathable and prevents overheating we
created a unique baffle design that
reduces sewing lines while still keeping
the insulation stabilized in order to
retain the most tee possible
loft a gives you better versatility than
any down insulation and better warmth
than any other synthetic insulation the
best part is that birds are loving it
adventures range from summiting Peaks to
exploring cities so are Jackass features
for a tall
we cut the jacket athletically and drop
the back for optimal comfort and
appearance the high net collar and
adjustable hem stop cold air from
sneaking it while elastic cuffs and
thumb holes hold the sleeves in place
and seal to the elements and insulated
to a adjustable hood keeps your head
warm and never hinder the visibility
movement insulated pockets keep your
hands toasty or you can use the zippers
to seal in valuables when you start
hiking let heat escape quickly through
the zippered armpit vents best of all
the jacket easily stuffs into its own
pocket for travel or uses a pillow
unlike down no special washes are
required for a jacket and it's quick
drying abilities make it easy to clean
even when not at home we use an ultra
light 22 nd ripstop nylon for the outer
shell to keep the jacket extremely light
and durable vital dry durable water
repellent see coats the fabric so the
rain rolls right off the jacket and even
lighter 10 denier ripstop is used to
line the inside of the jacket where
there's less probability of abrasion
cutting the jacket down to a mere 12
ounces I know some of you are thinking
that a synthetic jacket can never be as
good as a down jacket I get it I thought
the same thing that's why I test the
jacket myself in extreme situations just
this last May I was backpacking at
11,000 feet at this elevation I knew I
could get cold fast and there's always a
chance of unexpected weather instead of
taking a rain jacket and a down jacket I
took a lighter and smaller option my
prototype locked-up jacket sure enough
halfway to the peak the sunny skies
changed to a blizzard rather than are
treating to lower elevations and setting
up shelter or having to use an
unbreathable rain and down jacket combo
I threw on my lava thick jacket and kept
going
I stayed warm and watched mother nature
run a course when the storm broke I was
at the top of the peak watching the Sun
Shine on fresh beautiful snow without
the loft tech jacket I would have turned
around before reaching the top and
missed what I came for
don't let weather or gear keep you from
enjoying the best parts of your
adventures enjoy the warmth wait and
packability of an expensive down jacket
as well as the moisture and temperature
control of a premium synthetic jacket
all in one amazing ultralight adventure
jacket retail companies would price a
jacket like this between two and three
hundred dollars but thanks for our
direct-to-consumer business model direct
partnership with snowing manufacturers
and material providers we're able to
give you a feature-rich product with the
highest end materials and our innovative
loft deck installation at a remarkably
competitive price we are so confident in
our quality that we guarantee every
jacket with a lifetime warranty on
manufacturing and craftsmanship don't
pack a heavy or cold jacket with you any
longer
start living ultralight and adventuring
on your terms by grabbing your adventure
jacket now
all other heated gloves on the market
are bulky unyielding and hard to
maneuver which kind of defeats the
purpose having hands right people
walking their dogs in the winter taking
selfies at bonfires tailgating football
games they needed something better
something more versatile
for the last four years our mission has
been to give the people back control
over their climate to optimize their
time spent in the cold outdoors and to
have fun in the colder months again we
call these gloves three and one because
you can wear the inner fleece liner for
a more casual look the outer liner for
more extreme environments or both pieces
together for the ultimate heated glove
experience
combined with the soft inner lining you
can do any winter related activities
without your fingers going up thanks to
the reinforced outer shell
with three adjustable heat settings you
can choose the perfect level of warmth
for your hands
hi my name is Greg and this is my
brother Chris being raised here high in
the Rocky Mountains we become familiar
with the feeling of being cold all too
well there are only a few basic needs as
fundamentals keeping warm when we're
cold
we're always layering up one major
challenge is how to keep warm but also
how to not overheat or sweat with extra
layers when resting or starting an
activity you're cold but when active you
can overheat we thought what if there
was an adaptable clothing that could
change to your body's needs as an
engineer I got to work after many
prototypes design iterations performance
tests and late nights we're super
excited to share with you the smart
shirt that warms you like a mobile
thermostat for your body we've also
built in a ton of other cool features
introducing the world's smartest shirt
the Flair it's equal parts dapper and
technical let's start with the
technology of the player that makes it
so unique there are heating elements in
the shirt that use a patented carbon
fiber technology that quickly heats up
using minimal power there are three
different warmth modes to cycle through
to find perfect temperature click the
button to low for the longest lasting
heat setting perfect for when you need a
little extra warmth in a drafty movie
theater on an airplane or at work click
the button to medium for an extra warmth
boost great for those early mornings
with that crisp autumn air or when the
temperature quickly drops those chilly
sporting events that go into double
overtime oh baby it's cold outside the
high heat setting is for when you really
need steady furnace like heat keep
toasty warm while on the ski slopes or
heat up on a cold day how does the flare
feel like putting on a shirt right out
of the dryer
the shirts fabric is a premium soft
moisture wicking and insulating blend to
keep you warm and dry the flare can be
worn by itself or under your favorite
jacket for optimal oven-like performance
the shirt side pocket fits the included
power bank with room to spare the back
pocket can be used for items like your
phone car keys or granola bar
the power bank is lightweight and packs
a punch provides constant heat for hours
and can also be used to charge your
device to wash it just remove the
battery pack and throw it in the washer
