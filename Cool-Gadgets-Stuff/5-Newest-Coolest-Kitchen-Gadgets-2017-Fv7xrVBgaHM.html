iron deficiency is a massive global
problem and the lucky iron fish is a
simple solution that adds natural iron
to your diet well we're finding that the
individuals who are buying the lucky
iron fish want a simple easy and natural
way of adding iron to their diet it's
like a little iron fish and it's shaped
like a fish because that's a sign of
black in Cambodia having an iron rich
diet and something simple is like an
iron fish in your cooking every day just
make sure that I'm always able to give
back to the community by donating blood
every 56 days well we've been able to
work with like iron fish to help develop
some menu items in our restaurants from
food items to making a beer we've
created a great vegetarian item
sometimes it's hard to get the proper
amount of iron I found especially for
myself with not eating a lot of meat so
it's nice to be able to just drink water
like any other day and be able to have a
good amount of iron in my system it sits
near this near where I'm cooking so it's
really easy to remember and throw in and
clean up afterwards so that's probably a
big key to meat using it I would say
like I boil a bunch of it and put it in
the fridge and then just fill my water
bottle and take it around yes this water
is a little bit lemony but I don't
recognize the taste of the Aisne fish my
wife Kristen being pregnant and having
issues with with iron deficiency it's
it's worked out really well it's simple
to use we cook at home it creates great
time with the family when somebody comes
into the store and buys one they get one
for themselves obviously but also means
that one is donated to somebody in need
to somebody who can't afford a fish
which is great you take something so
simple that you can use in everyday life
and how it can affect millions of people
across world in a positive way hey
Kickstarter my name is a cheetah and I'm
ranches and we are the creators of a
nerve react a nerve react is the world's
first intelligent stove safety device
that attaches directly to your existing

turn your stove off before it's too late
how many of you have ever left food
cooking on the stove for too long and
ended up with smoke everywhere or even a
fire or left your house then just
wondered whether you left the stove on

it's where so much of life happens
spending time with loved ones preparing
food and sharing meals with so much
happening it's easy to forget something
as simple as turning off your stove if
we're not careful something terrible can
happen I know because it happened to me
in the United States alone there are
over 350 7,000 house fires each year
that's one house fire every 85 seconds
these house fires caused almost 13,000
injuries per year and seven deaths every
day and cooking equipment is the most
common cause how many of these can be
prevented with a nerve react a nerve
react uses a combination of sensors and
electronics within these units to turn
your stove off when a hazardous
situation detected over for one even
arises attach your existing knobs to the
device or use them as your new knobs and
place a sensor unit on a ceiling above
this unit is the brains of the device
and houses a gas sensor and smoke
detector which when activated signal the
knob unit to turn off the burner this
unit also contains a motion sensor
that's linked to a timer in the knob
unit you select the time interval you
want using the touch sensor or you can
use a default setting if no motion is
detected in the vicinity of your stove
during that time interval the knob will
activate and turn your stove off inner
reacts novel design allows it to work on
any gas or electric stove and attach two
knobs of all shapes and sizes and if
you're away from home the smartphone app
allows you to check whether your stove
is on and turn it off if needed you can
even adjust the temperature of your

overcook so please back us and help us
