designer solar panel made for people who
want to be sustainable but don't know
where to start here's how it works you
hang it in a sunny window and the
sunlight charges up the battery built
into the frame then plug your phone
directly into the Chargers USB port when
the solar panel is fully charged
your phone will charge at the same rate
as if it was plugged into the wall I
started group-hug because I was really
frustrated by how hard it was to adopt
solar energy in your everyday life when
I started researching solar panels I
realized that the fundamental design of
a solar panel hasn't actually changed in
over sixty years it's basically a
rectangle slapped on a roof a pole a
backpack you name it there are
definitely personal solar devices on the
market but they're designed for people
who like camping fishing hiking boating
and I hate all of those things
I studied industrial design at Georgia
Tech and I really loved making and
building things with my hands for over
six years
I loved the product design team at
little bits a consumer electronics
company in New York I learned everything
there is to know about product
development using renewable energy
doesn't have to be hard this is just the
beginning for group hug by supporting us
we can create a lifestyle where it's
effortless to take your devices off the
grid without sacrificing design

the corner
this year though it comes with a warning
and one we've talked about before -
beware of the metal bristles that are on
many BBQ brushes bristle from a grill
cleaning brush stuck in his throat
heading to the emergency room stuck in
the wall in the heart could be deadly

wire bristles that get stuck in your
food not only that our grill brush
cleans itself in the dishwasher don't

been building up for months because
you're too lazy to clean your grill your
wife is tired of tasting the tilapia you

other grill brush our brush actually
cleans your grill a big concern is that
this grill cleaner removes the flavor
from your previous grilling session if
you want to keep the flavor and
salmonella poisoning grill rescue is not

ganar candle or our state of the art

you notice how much water we consume
every single day it's clear that having
fresh clean nutrient-rich water is an
absolute necessity
you can spend hundreds of dollars on
water bottles but that gets expensive
and it's terrible for the environment so
you try a water filter but the more
research you do the more you realize
that most water filters are either
expensive or ineffective that's why we
created aqua tella the most powerful and
affordable countertop water filtration
device ever aqua tella is a four stage
countertop or under the sink water
filter that removes over 99% of
unhealthy and dangerous contaminants and
toxins from our tap water so what makes
aqua tell'em so much better first is our
four stage filter Stage one uses a micro
high quality sediment filter that
removes small particles such as
just dirt rust and other particles that
are 15 times smaller than a grain of
sand stage 2 is an activated carbon
filter that removes pesticides
formaldehyde chlorine heavy metals and
odors in stage 3 our nano membrane
filter removes a wide range of
waterborne contaminants including
bacteria macromolecules colloids and
micro sediment and lastly our carbon
finishing filter enhances the fresh
taste of water by removing dissolved
gases residual chlorine pesticides heavy
metals organic pollutants and odors
through a high-quality granular
activated bituminous filter additionally
we've included an optional fluoride
filter that upgrades your stage 2 filter
to remove 95% of fluorides so you can
enjoy your water fluoride free unlike
traditional water filters aqua tella
lasts aqua tella was built to handle the
nastiest tap water and can filter up to
8,000 gallons before needing to be
replaced that's 200 times more than a
Brita filter aqua tella is easy to
install and can also be mounted under
your sink using a separate spout so you
can have fresh clean water without
losing precious counter space and the
final thing that makes aqua tell a truly
