have been busy lately in between of
running a business and becoming your
father have been visited 1200 profiles a
possession occurs and I forgot a little
tiny thing taking care of myself like
most of you I thought that eating
healthy it's too complicated time
consuming and too difficult
blending seemed to be a resolution but I
simply didn't have time and it was way
too noisy one morning I was watching my
daughter playing with the music box and
then it caught me this is the way how
blender could work like it would be
silent easy to clean and smart
I personally drink four smoothies a day
so I took Milla as an opportunity to
design a perfect blender we spend half a
year
refining design it was not enough to
make it only look good
it had to be designed with user in mind
and to fix impressive amount of
electronics to make it all work
it's
hi we are a team that successfully
funded the kiss Tirico project the
world's first all-in-one kit fear making
jar now thousands of people use kiss
difficulty you can prepare healthy
probiotic drinks at home at the moment
we are looking for your support to fund
a new project get their goat cheese
maker a kitchen tool that will simplify
the home preparation of probiotic cheese
cultured dairy doesn't need heating
rennet or additives to make cheese it
only needs slow straining to separate
the solids from the way the surgical
mesh basket is specifically designed to
do just that the top lid prevents small
pieces and slides from falling into the
cheese and absorbing smells from other
food in the fridge wait rich with
proteins is a byproduct when we make
cheese from milk it strains into a glass
jar where you can preserve it to keep it
fresh
the rink has more volume to pour the
kiss here into the mesh back when the
kefir strength the amount of kiss your
cheese dips under the lower level of the
rape the result is a fresh and healthy
homemade probiotic key
had some flavors to spice things up and
give it a taste you prefer again your
day with kids beer Cochise maker for
delicious and healthy breakfast with
your family
or use your imagination and prepare a
variety of tasty cheese dishes for a
colorful dinner with friends for leading
a perfect end to the day
you
a kata planta is a traditional
Portuguese dish and it is also the name
of the pan that is cooked in like the
pressure cooker the form of the kata
planet ensures that the steam from
cooking the food is retained in the
utensil generating an increase in
pressure and permitting cooking
temperatures above 100 degrees Celsius
its concave shape together with the
excellent thermal conductivity of copper
means that the heat is distributed more
uniformly in its interior thereby
ensuring more even cooking of the food
on a low heat for example this heat
distribution makes the utensil more
energy efficient beautifully crafted in
copper and lined with tin a catalana
is a must for any kitchen it has been
described as anything from a flying
saucer to a pillow but the cada Plata
that strangely unique Algarve culinary
device makes a work file addition to
your kitchen almost anything can be
cooked in a cada planner
seafood chicken meat fish and vegetables
as well as rice and pasta all of which
can be seasoned with herbs to give a
memorable meal the history of the kata
Plata in Portugal is deeply rooted in
tradition in old times a utensil made of
zinc or wrought iron it was gradually
adopted by the copper Smith's in the
Algarve region who today make it only in
comprable it has become a symbol of the
Algarve region rivaling even the other
traditional symbols such as the almond
trees in blossom or the typical chimneys
its manufacture has always been handmade
so our master coppersmiths continued
this tradition with the same passion and
dedication of olden times
at kata planas leads bet on the
qualities detail and a pampering of 100%
handmade manufacturer kata planning the
thickness of copper is superior and give
more consistency and maximize the
characteristics of copper while in the
interior who use Tim it's this pride of
a craftsmanship family that makes this
an incredibly exciting and rewarding
project for us when I was a young boy my
parents used to take me and my sister to
this local pizza bar it was a classic
Italian pizzeria lots of little
paintings on the wall red and white
gloves tablecloths and a huge good fire
pizza oven in the middle of this tiny
restaurant for me this place was like
paradise and the pizza Baker he was God
while he was preparing our dinner I
would spend right by his working place
and watch how he would stretch the dough
slapping it from hand to hand throwing
it up in the air and how it would gently
spread out tomato sauce it was a
wonderful thing to see and when that
pizza came out of the oven it would have
that beautiful wood-fired smoky taste
hi my name is Peter Staedtler I am a
maker also I'm the founder and proud
owner of Staedtler made for the last few
years I've been experimenting and
teaching myself how to make that
beautiful stretchy pizza dough only I
didn't have the money or the space for
one of those big Italian pizza ovens so
that's when I knew I had to make my own
wood-fired oven
I started welding song and grinding I
made lots of different ovens always
learning something new finally I took
all that experience to create Staedtler
make outdoor oven this oven is built
entirely out of court and steel sheets
and the design is so simple that anyone
can put it together you just slide all
the parts into each other and your oven
is ready it was never easier and make
those amazing good fire pizzas yourself
with the Staedtler made oven everybody
can become an outdoor cook like every
traditional pizza oven it is fired with
wood and when a piece of food is burning
it will release all its beautiful aromas
making sure that whatever you cook will
get that magical smoky flavor
you start by placing some small kindling
into the oven you light them up and once
you've got the fire going
you can add bigger pieces of wood inside
the top part of the oven there are two
stone baking boards these stones will
absorb all the heat from the flames and
then pass it back into the food this way
when you bake a pizza you will always
have that perfect light crispy base
my ultimate goal is not just to make
great oven it is for you to experience
the joy of working with food and fire
and knowing what it is be a maker</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
