challenges in the kitchen no matter what
age or gender many people can find it
difficult to unscrew the lid of a jar we
present the solution it's called the
köppen er opening jars has never been
easier now anyone can do it choose any
jar a new one or one that's already been
open but has gotten stuck take the
köppen er place it on the jar and push
the handles with very little effort the
jar opens the köppen er works with any
shape of jar and lid and due to the
adjustable configuration it can handle a
wide range of jar sizes whether you are
young or old male or female whether you
are fit or not the coop owner makes
opening jars very easy no one will ever
have to ask for help again we know you
love enjoying ice cream with your loved
ones everyone does but let's face it
getting the ice cream out of the tub is
a struggle you've tried all the
approaches you find yourself doing crazy
things just to get to experience your
ice cream but you either get chunks of
hard ice cream or soupy watery ice cream
aren't you tired of going through all
this introducing slinky the world's
first electrically heated ice cream
scoop
with just a press of a button swanky
helps you serve the perfect round scoop
of ice cream right into your bowl it
goes through the hardest of ice creams
like a hot knife through butter so you
can serve the roundest scoop of ice
cream
swanky comes with built-in rechargeable
batteries that heat up the scooper to
perfect temperature
swanky is safe for everyone in the
family who wants to enjoy an ice cream
swanky maintains constant temperature
for up to 30 minutes on a single charge
swanky comes in three different colors
to perfectly match the design and theme
of your home with swanky we've
redesigned the ice cream experience so
you could go back to enjoying ice cream
with your loved ones introducing zip-top
containers the world's first 100%
platinum silicone reusable he double
dishwasher balls if Abul containers are
they perfect no but yes they are perfect
with five patents pending the zip top
was designed with the environment in
mind one zip top can replace over five
thousand plastic baggies which could say
that who knows how many fish it also
might save some sharks too but for a
container that doesn't need a lid it is
worth the risk
and unlike baggies the zip top
containers are tough heat cold cars even
kids can't destroy and they will try
they will always try but you'll rest
easy knowing that the zip top can take
whatever you throw at or in it need to
store scalding hot soup this laughs
thisis this makes soup feel bad about
itself look at it stand upright your
liquids are secure now see if you're
worrying for the sharks plus it's easy
to get excess air out of zip top
containers which will keep your food
fresher longer tip top is freezer safe
microwave-safe and even oven safe if it
were any safer we'd be calling it mr.
Rogers neighborhood and when you're done
just toss them in the dishwasher
the zip tops are fine easy and because
it's 100% platinum silicone it won't
lead to harmful chemicals like plastics
can but maybe you're saying hey I like
leached chemicals in my food this
product is not for you
also please see a doctor and if storing
your food perfectly wasn't enough zip
tops are great for taking meals or
snacks on the go with eight different
shapes and sizes zip top containers can
be used anywhere even your car's cup
holder they're great for more than just
holding food to get weird with it we
won't judge we love you need proof
exhibit a thanks honey that's my
sandwich last of the butter less it's
time to leave the outdated options
behind save the planet and save yourself
with zip top containers get yours today
we started messin with a simple belief
that people deserve access to quality
kitchen tools at fair prices because it
doesn't matter if you're a professional
chef or just trying to get a quick meal
ready at home good tools will help you
cook better now we're thrilled to be
back on Kickstarter launching our most
requested product to date introducing
the essentials nonstick pan no gimmicks
no crazy marketing claims no BS just
incredible durability and long-lasting
performance at a price that's fair and
honest before we dive into the nice and
damp let's take a look at what's wrong
with other nonstick pans chances are
that many of you have a nonstick pan
that looks like this and performs like
this because the truth is that even the
most expensive nonstick cookware will
stop being effective once the coating
wears off which it will so for ages
people have had two options
buy cheap non-stick pans that wear away
in weeks or months or expensive ones
that may last a bit longer
but will still need to be replaced no
matter what both options seem pretty bad
to us so we decided to make something
better
our goal was simple create an insanely
long lasting and durable nonstick pan
and sell it for a price that's fair
affordable and won't make you upset when
you eventually have to replace it years
later we nailed it
a great nonstick pan should do three
things well one stay nonstick for a
really long time to distribute heat
evenly for better cooked food and three
feel comfortable when you're holding it
here's how we did all three now the nice
and nonstick system is actually made of
two key parts first we use the highest
quality pfoa-free nonstick coating
available today for unparalleled
durability
and scratch resistance second in order
to make our pants even more durable we
added an innovative plasma primer layer
beneath the pans top coating infused
with titanium the plasma layer is two
and a half times more effective than the
traditional primers other pans use
working together our nonstick coating
and plasma primer form a nonstick system
that is absurdly durable and provides
long-lasting performance for the base of
our pan we chose a four point two
millimeter commercial grade aluminum
construction this thick base ensures a
flat even cooking surface for the life
of your pan and provides amazing heat
distribution and retention for better
cooked foods on the bottom of our pan we
bonded a stainless steel plate so that
it's compatible with any heat source gas
electric induction they all work it's
important your pan feels comfortable and
balanced when you're using it the
me--some pan has a cast stainless steel
handle riveted to the base for a strong
reliable bond that will last the pan
also features a removable silicone grip
with a textured bottom for incredible
comfort and control the silicone grip
also ensures that the handle stays cool
even as the pan heats up so how is it
that we can make a nonstick pan that
performs better than expensive ones that
cost well over a hundred bucks and sell
it for a fraction of the price simple by
cutting out traditional retail middlemen
and selling directly to you we're able
to offer incredible quality and a
wholesale pricing these avocados will
stay fresh for about a day
but these avocados will stay fresh for a
lot longer
that's because they're stored in silo
anyway to keep your food fresh for
longer why is it so important because
for most of us buying food feels like
this I just got fed up with how much
food I was throwing away I knew there
had to be a better way to keep it so I
started looking into vacuum storage I
wanted something fast and easy because I
hate wasting time in the kitchen but
even the best vacuum settles out there
were just too cumbersome to use every
day and then I had an idea silo is a
completely new approach to household
food storage just put your food in one
of our bpa-free containers and press it
down on the base after a few seconds the
container is perfectly sealed keeping
air away from your food sea is great for
people but not so great for food
oxidation and aerobic microorganisms are
the main reasons your food begins to
spoil taking the air out slows all of
that down with silo your food is vacuum
sealed until you're ready to eat listen
to this that's air rushing back in
that's the sound of freshness even your
dog will enjoy fresh food for longer and
is quick and easy to use even when your
hands are full when you're finished so
who gets out of your way until the next
time you need it freeing up valuable
counter space but that's just the
beginning
silo is so much more than extending
freshness it's about keeping track of
your food silo comes with a lexer built
in so you can manage your food using
voice commands I detective new contents
in the container please state the food
inside strawberries strawberries have
been added to your inventory they should
be fresh for at least a week silo keeps
track of when your food was stored and
if it's still good ok the chickens
should be good for at least 5 more days
since silo automatically weighs your
food it always knows how much you have
left and will let you know when it's
time to pick up more Alexa how much
coffee is left you have 2 ounces of
coffee that should last you for a week
with silo your food last longer so
you'll waste less and enjoy it more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
