innovation and advancement in longboard
technology now this board gives you
three main things great stability great
power control and responsiveness to the
writer the lean board really leans into
its turns I wanted a board which is that
coffee for cruising and carving and I
noticed before how big was on it I can
go or any cracks is it smooth
that put big wheels on my regular board
and if you really work that well it was
like race of the central gravity will
just go high up the ground so being a
passionate skateboarder and as well as
an engineer I thought like why can't
make something my own some quality
because the way the means telecoil
design and the individual axle for each
viewer these wheels are perfect for all
terrain because you want to be able to
glide over those obstacles like small
rocks or large cracks that can make you
break suddenly or just throw you off
your groove the lean longboard is
spring-loaded and this gives you a
constant force and if you prefer more
carve ability you can actually loosen
the springs and if you prefer higher
speed what's cool is you can actually
tighten the springs some different you
know like and for that I had a black
disc cruising up and down here real
quick you know like it I could actually
think of a few friends would be
interested in something that's more
their style the shape of the lean board
is actually symmetrical so it can move
in either direction and it's perfect for
free length it crows up which
gives you pockets holding and locking
your feet in giving you more control and
more of a sense of confidence when
making those shots what we want to do is
add a little kick on to this side of the
board and pretty much what that does is
it gives you an extra grip for your feet
so when you're sliding down the hill you
know you have something somewhere to
place your feet so you feel safe and you
feel secure and you just you get a whole
different experience riding it's almost
like falling in love for the wrist area
hi everyone my name's Benjamin I'm the
designer of the brake board trucks now
the brake board trucks are a braking
system for skateboards then you might
think a brake on a skateboard
how does semi flying this is not the
case we spend a very long time to refine
a brake that could control your speed
downhill with these really good skaters
can do power slides and high speed foot
braking but the general rider like us
can't do this we just want to be able to
commute down the hill with ease and
control and the brake board trucks allow
this
this is a break board now break board is
actually all contained within the rear
truck you can set this truck up onto
your own deck now how it works is is a
pedal on top a pair of disc brakes well
technically they call coin clutches you
can use any deck or any wheels of your
choice and quite simply just apply
pressure on here and it requires body
weight so that it won't bite or skid
suddenly you won't flat spot your wheels
you'll be able to control your speed
with power down hill past 12 months
we've been setting out for manufacturing
and we landed our first few sets the
beginning of this year now we use these
sets to trial them out in the public and
get your feedback the feedback was
awesome you'd love the brakes but you
had a few great ideas which we want to
now develop the main idea that we loved
was a quick-release brake pedal one that
you can just flip off when you want to
ride without a break say you're doing
freestyle tricks or whatever and it
gives clicker back on whenever you need
it
another thing that people suggest were
just a range of different brake sizes
we've had some guys who are doing high
speed downhill speeds up to 50 miles per
hour plus and I lovin the brake but they
want a break with a little bit more
power and what they suggested is carbs
and ceramics these carbon ceramic
components would be retrofittable to
your existing brake and your support
will help us develop that faster
you
yeah
yeah
you
hey Kickstarter fellow longboarders i'm
brian femme I am wrongish and I'm
currently a student finishing up my
studies and finance over at Florida A&amp;amp;M
University and I am a mechanical design
engineer with over 30 years of
experience under my belt and together we
make a pie pattern we specialize in
manufacturing fully carbon fiber long
boards we can't wait to get them into
your hands first off what is carbon
fiber carbon fiber is a unique material
used in aerospace motorsports civil
engineering and along with several other
competition sports it's made up of
thousands of very thin strings of carbon
and when living together and applied
with epoxy it gains enormous strength
characteristics his properties are worth
making favor of ultimately with its low
weight high stiffness in high tensile
strength carbon fiber is ideal for long
boarding purposes
I thought her longboards offer something
no other brand man we're a board company
we're willing to give the writer yobics
feared for the old medallion and working
on it with top quality cover fire
integrity Amex our port are not only
lighter but many times stronger than the
traditional world longboard this
attributes offer several key benefits
such as maneuverability I respond and
durability in giving mention our price
point we want underwriter to experience
a high quality high performance long
board at our modest price range or two
mega dollars the price of Technology guy
between wooden and carbon fiber long
boards will soon be brewed it started
with applying a single layer of carbon
fiber to each side of a woodland board
we were trying to figure out how to make
a longboard stronger because a common
problem with wood decks is that they
eventually break while adding two layers
of carbon fiber did make it stronger it
also added weight which isn't really
ideal so when it came to choosing the
lesser of two evils we chose neither we
decided to give making a fully carbon
fiber composite deck a shot and ever
since our design and manufacturing
process has only been improving
real shields a longboarding accessory
that upgrades your ride with six
powerful features here's why you need
wheels
picketing soaps with mom boarding to
class their work typically your wheels
will fling dirty rain and slug all over
your clothes
we know shields acts similar to a mud
flap on a bike keeping you dry in a
riding fresh well down hill now you
won't lock wheels with other riders
their wheels will lock against yours but
your wheels will keep rotating because
they are protected by wheel shields
giving you the confidence to see tighter
lines around opposition sick of the same
old tricks real shields allow riders to
stand directly on top of their wheels
opening up all sorts of new trick
possibilities you can invent brand new
coleman's slides manuals and dances with
wheel shapes by focusing on load based
right during development we managed to
engineer an incredibly robust and
durable longboard upgrade real shields
were designed by professional prop
developers and are a modern marvel of
material science and what FDA testing
clean cheap real white guy you down by
creating a physical barrier around each
wheel wheel shields eliminate wheel bite
and allow us to rotate food instead of
your board hitting the wheel it is
stopped by the dealership sick of
replacing your bearings every few weeks
noodle shields fits snugly against the
outer bearing of each wheel without
creating additional friction this keeps
water from entering the bed protecting
it from rust and increasing a usable
life paint shoe bite will no longer
accidentally step on your wheels which
can happen when you do the new tricks
are taking selling no more shoe bite
makes wheel shields excellent for
community plus you'll also stay drive
wheel shields are made from aircraft
aluminum
a set of 4-wheel shields adds just one
pound to your loan board
installation is easy real shields come
with the free skate tool speed rings and
the custom nuts needed for installation
real shields work for almost all wheels
75 millimeters and under the only reels
that will not fit are those with more
than one inch between the bearing and
outer lip which is very ring wheel
shields even work on uber wide wheels
