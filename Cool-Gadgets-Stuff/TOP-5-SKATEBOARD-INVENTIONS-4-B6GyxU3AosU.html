you need to find something to do with
these blanks it's a waste of materials
oh hey there Kickstarter I'm rich CEO of
hydro flex technology for small board
sport manufacturers that has developed a
patented process for making surfboards
what makes our board special is the
three-dimensional bonding process which
has been multiple awarded we manufacture
high-end surfboards that are loved and
served by a lot of the top pros
we found that surfboard manufacturing
process leaves lots of scrap materials
we wanted to take advantage of this
extra material and begin using it to
build skate boards for ourselves
due to the great feedback we got on the
prototypes we wanted to give people the
chance to ride our boards on the streets
we took a lot of nature Swedish designs
and use it as a bonding structure to
increase the shear strength to improve
flex characters our skateboards are
produced with the same process using
foam fiberglass and resin in combination
with our 3d bonding construction it
connects both sides of the decks giving
them superior features this makes our
board strong waterproof pitching look
superior response and keeps the puck
there's always been a direct correlation
between skateboarding and vandalism and
there's certainly no denying that we are
destructive to property when we do skate
it being a skateboarder myself I wanted
to create a product that not only
allowed us to skate those spots but also
protected spots that we skated my name
is dani johnson and i created insta
Ledge insta ledge is a coping system
that comes in four foot sections that's
designed to create a smooth grinding
surface in seconds the Laois skaters to
skate spots that they normally couldn't
brick ledges or stone ledges even on
waxed ones and some skate stoppers and
it easily fits in the trunk of your car
with insta ledges high tolerance
construction i've been able to create a
smooth grinding surface between each
section in addition to that I've also
added rubber to the bottom of each ledge
to give it friction and to actually
stick on the ledge when it's being
skated and don't worry if there aren't
any ledges around because literally you
can put this outside your house on the
sidewalk curb or with a few cinder
blocks you can build one in your
driveway
we love skateboards especially the good
old fashioned but here's the thing
they're faulty just at the very basic
level the way they're designed they warp
bends crack delaminate and the process
of making these highly temporary
consumables doesn't really sit with our
Nordic view of clean green sustainable
products so we wanted to create
something something different and don't
mind me saying something better we
wanted to take what we learned from our
previous board means leave it and do it
all over again
this is the witho by a COMSAT skateboard
it might not look that different at the
surface but it's what's inside that
counts the board is made of a material
called Carolee natural fiber composite
which consists of wood fibers and
polypropylene which is a byproduct of
the oil refinery process and this
combination makes the board both
responsive and
the strength of the board comes largely
from its wood fiber density which is
greater than that finding actual trees
themselves and not only are they tough
but our boards and rear water and
moisture
unlike traditional boards and they're
fully recyclable the trees are
responsibly sourced from nordic areas
where tree growth outweighs the rate of
forestry these trees are then processed
in a closed cycle facility with zero
waste meaning that all the material used
is reusable and this factory is part one
hundred percent buy green reusable
energy no glue or any other toxic
substance for that matter is used in
billing on boards and caroling itself is
so pure than it's even used to make
dishware like this Madre we're really
excited to be bringing this board to you
and we hope that you love it as much as
we do
all right now for all you boppers out
there in the big city all you street
people with an ear for the action can
you dig it
you
hi I'm Ross I'm Cody and I'm rod and we
started a project called concrete native
and we've created a backpack
specifically designed to carry long
boards so four years ago my brother and
I were cruising around our local campus
got to the bomb of bombing a hill
walking back up like man it's great to
have a longboard backpack drop back home
search the web couldn't find anything so
we decided why not let's make our own
with this bag idea in place we went home
and we cut two backs completely apart
and put it back together
we knew that one works over the past
three years we've worked with companies
in California and in Oregon and we
finally found a prototyping bag that
we're comfortable with all the features
so to go over some of the key features
in the bag first and foremost is the
strap system we created a strap system
specifically designed to carry a
longboard once we did this we actually
realized it holds a regular skateboard
and a snowboard better than any other
valuing market on top of that we've
added two straps at the base of the bag
that hook around your bottom trucks any
longboard longer than four inches this
is going to help stabilize your board on
the bag all the straps in this bag are
hideaway so if you're not carrying a
board you can hide them and your bag
just looks like a typical backpack we
also added an abrasion resistant
material to the front of the bag so you
grip tape doesn't scratch your bag up on
top of that this bag has every key
feature you'd expect from a quality
backpack
we have pockets to mold your phone iPod
skate tool and anything else has a
fleece line sunglass pocket water bottle
pocket we've added a laptop sleeve a
padded back ergonomic back straps and we
have a sternum strap so what we need
from you guys is your support all the
one you give us is going straight to the
manufacturer to backpack donate get some
cool stuff and let's get this product to
the people that works did you do that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
