accelerating consumption and rampant
materialism products are designed to
become obsolete when discarded for the
next big thing but the pleating on
natural resources at astonishing rates
or public pollutants and trash into the
environment developments and
sustainability are promising but they're
not happening fast enough and the
solutions are still too expensive and
inaccessible what if we can make a
machines last longer run more
efficiently and self-improve instead of
supporting the high turnover consumerism
that we see today what if we had
solution here and now that's our mission
at try boat X we're tackling the problem
of waste by creating the first of its
kind nanoparticles that actually repair
machines while increasing performance
and efficiency harnessing the power of
nanotechnology we came off a small
solution to this big problem private X
nanoparticles have two faces one that
lines are one less slides a sticky side
reinforces and strengthens while the
slippery side reduces friction just like
carbon telling to diamond in a mantle of
the earth TurboTax sulfa lies through a
diamond like lattice structure under the
heat and pressure of the engine unlike
other protective coatings this process
actually reverses engine where particle
by particle restores it to a better than
new condition or initial focus was to
make lubricants safer among many
nanomaterials we worked on one unique
outlier reduced friction dramatically
down to super lubricity level with the
help of national labs and research
agencies we understood the mechanism and
developed proprietary production
products after years of research and
rigorous testing were proud to introduce
car boss a safe and green additive for
your car by improves gas mileage boosts
host power and extends the life of your
engine car boss comes in a small
recyclable applicator that you inject
into the oil fill of your car
as you drive turbo text nanoparticles
are forged into a diamond like armor
around engine components rejuvenating a
daily driver to become more efficient
than when it was new a third of the gas
that you put in your car is wasted on
engine friction with 612 million cars on
the road that waste adds up running on
car boss will use less fuel reduce
pollution and leave a smaller carbon
footprint we're ready to go to market
and we need your help back our
Kickstarter and be the first to adopt a
revolutionary technology that will make
our world more efficient more powerful
and more sustainable car boss by tribo
tax for the last year our team at hayao
has been developing a new technology
that once only existed in science
fiction today we invited our friends to
experience the magic behind using kayo
for the first time all right well let's
talk about what we're doing here today
what if I told you guys that you could
control your home and bring to life the
space around you with no screens no
physical remotes and no yelling across
the room just this
whoa meet pea it transforms the space
and objects around you into a set of
magical remote controls with just a
simple movement of your hand
hey-ohh allows you to control lights
music television temperature and much
more setup is quite simple place heyo in
the space of your choice connected to
your Wi-Fi and then heyo will
automatically 3d scan your space once
scanning is complete
using hyo's augmented reality app you
can create a virtual button on an object
or even in thin air to control any of
your favorite devices and that's it
wherever you live heyyo connects the
space around you with you whenever you
want for whatever you need
how would you feel about some music
right now
seeing people discover somatic being
here is an incredible feeling but this
is just a beginning we are integrating
new features another time halo will grow
smarter we need your help to go through
the manufacturing process we want to
improve here and we want to bring it to
your home
please join us thanks this is Luxa for
an LED indicator that lets you control
your workday how it shows you
notifications at the speed of light
helps you productively plan your day and
let your co-workers know when you're
free to chat and when you're busy our
goal is to make your work environment
better by eliminating the common
problems of today's modern workplaces
you know like those moments when you're
on a roll with a project and suddenly
everybody needs to talk to you or at the
end of a hectic day when you realize do
you miss some important emails or just
being distracted and unable to focus
these are all things we struggle with at
grey nut and we can't be the only ones
so we created Luksa for a simple tool to
make workdays more productive Luksa 4 is
available in three different models
Luksa for mini Luksa for flag and Luksa
for Bluetooth Luksa for mini works as
your personal assistant it notifies you
about incoming emails and other
notifications so you never miss any
urgent information and it's integrated
Pomodoro timer keeps your productivity
in check
Luksa for flag not only notifies you
about incoming emails but it also
signals your availability to everyone at
the office a red light shows that you're
busy and can't talk and a green light
shows that you're open for conversation
Plus with the built-in RGB LEDs you can
experiment with a huge array of colors
to code any information you'd like Luksa
for Bluetooth displays alerts
notifications and information remotely
wherever you place it you can use it to
indicate if a meeting room is free or
occupied place it outside of your office
to show whether you're available or put
it in any room to see if you received
any new emails messages or other
notifications with Luksa for
productivity is the name of the game we
identified the main reasons for drops in
productivity and fitted all the
solutions within this tiny personal
assistant Luksa 4 is a gadget that's
designed to help you reach your goals
without interruptions without missing
anything important and without all the
little distractions that may come up hi
Kickstarter I'm John an industrial
designer with over 20 years experience
designing and developing products for
industrial clients fabricating models
and prototypes is a huge part of what I
do but I'm using a laser cutter a CNC
router or a 3d printer or all of them
together but of all the methods and
tools that I use just one I've relied on
heavily over the years and that's vacuum
forming it's my so-called secret sauce
when it comes to making
three-dimensional plastic parts
the problem is stove that conformers
aren't exactly accessible their massive
factory great equipment a constant
nominal lake and there aren't really any
proper desktop versions of them either
until this is vacuform the world's first
digital desktop of a conformer now
everyone can shape in for plastic like a
seasoned pro with vacuform smart
efficient and easy to use features such
as the exclusively design high
performance hybrid vacuum system that
delivers extremely detailed shapes and
parts a computer-controlled heater and
thermal probe the monitors of plastics
temperature in real-time
in a built-in library of heating
profiles for virus materials so you're
sure to get perfect results part after
part after part just select a correct
Pro helper on the menu press start and
wait for the vacuum to switch on once
it's on all you have to do is slower the
handle bar and begin vacuforming with a
vacuform you get a compact
professional-grade vacuum former without
a hefty price tag allowing you to
finally get that bull rolling on that
business idea of yours or simply make
things for your own personal enjoyment
whatever those things might be whether
it's one of designer toys custom
packaging for bespoke gadgets
or one-of-a-kind art pieces by backing
my project I'll be able to produce the
first batch of packet forms and put them
in the hands of makers everywhere
helping them bring their awesome ideas
to life I'll also be able to do further
research on new raw materials and
develop vacuform software even more
continuously expanding its library of
heating profiles so vacuform actually
gets better with time now that sounds
like a pretty good investment don't you
think
for more details feel free to look
around my Kickstarter profile and make
sure to visit vacuform sufficient and
Facebook page thanks now let's get ready
to back it form
hey can you navigate me to home sure it
will take us 40 minutes you have a
message for mom are you gonna make it to
dinner tonight can you text her back and
tell her I'll be there at 7:00
damn you're swerving oh sorry
that was close remember that time we had
cars without seatbelts yeah that was
stupid
well how about just yesterday when you
were texting while swerving all over the
road that was pretty stupid too wasn't
it
hey we're no different even though we
have the technology to make our cars
safer and smarter
you still drive very primitive thought
introducing drive the all-in-one driving
companion that will transform your
driving experience dry it is so much
more than a dashcam starter it makes
your ride completely hands-free
navigation texting there's no longer a
reason to take your eyes off the road
eat eat installing Drive it's simple
just stick it on your windshield and
plug it in worried about safety don't
worry
bride's got your back with real-time
forward collision and lane departure
alerts your chances of an accident are
greatly reduced dried non stop HD
videorecording
can help prove when you're not at fault
as well as help the driving community
report reckless drivers
above all these amazing features dryed
has created an open community allowing
developers to work together and make the
vehicle apps of the future built on the
Raspberry Pi dried as a familiar
platform for any in-car app you can
dream up have an idea now is your chance
to make it a reality
create an app to prevent babies being
left in cars create an action notified
you of cool events happening around you
the options are endless now it's your
turn to make Drive as intelligent as you
are it's time to get out of the Stone
Age of driving DRI it's gonna get us
there we need you make it happen what do
you say are you gonna drive or are you
gonna drop</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
