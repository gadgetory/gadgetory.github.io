years ago it was about developing the
best product for your daily commute it
started with a passion for electric
mobility and now we've founded a company
and we've developed an entire vehicle
thermal turbo is a small light and
foldable electric vehicle it is self
balancing very easy to steer and it's
the perfect solution for your last mile
in your city self balancing vehicles
totally make sense they are very easy to
learn
you just stand on and most people just
need 2 to 5 minutes to learn how to ride
it and if you suddenly find yourself in
front of some stairs simply pick it up
and carry it and since it's so compact
you can take it on a train nowadays with
the trend of urbanization traffic in
cities gets worse and worse first part
of your journey into the city with your
car is rather quickly but when you enter
the city it comes almost to a complete
stop this is where mo comes into play
you can take mo in the car with you you
will arrive at your destination much
faster and of course happier
when you enter your company in the
morning you can use mo to skip all these
long hallways and just drive from the
entrance to your desk in a few moments
with one lift and within two seconds the
Irmo transforms from fully functional
electric vehicle to just briefcase size
so how did we achieve the low weight
well one part of the story is to use
advanced materials such as carbon fiber
and aircraft grade aluminum another part
is we developed all our electronics in
the last two and a half years from
scratch so we developed our own main
boards our own battery modules and so on
at the end of the day Emma's not only a
clever vehicle it's also fun to drive
drive with Elmo wherever you want on the
street on curb or cobblestone mo goes up
to 15 kilometers per hour and is created
for your hands to be free
if you feel uncomfortable with the
balance there's always the possibility
to add an additional handlebar and still
have your hands-free for the coffee to
go
when you come home after a long day just
plug a memo into any power outlet and
after 2 hours it will be ready for your
commute the next day
memories are fragile
what if you could perfectly preserve
your childhood memories
what if you could capture every detail
of your creations
or keep with you every important book
you've ever read

fast a scanner that was able to create
the most optimal digitization

scanner that fits seamlessly into your
work and life
a scanner so smart and intuitive that it
enables you to retain your knowledge
memories and creations in precise and
beautiful detail

from the makers of Nana bad comes not a
bag 2.0 and nano packing each year an
estimated 500 billion to 1 trillion
plastic bags are consumed worldwide our
mission is to reduce plastic waste by
making the ultimate reusable bags but
not about 2.0 we've upgraded the comfort
design size seed pouch and stitching
it's made with ultra high performance
reinforced ripstop fabric the supersoft
fabric easily folds on itself so it will
comfortably fit in your pocket or in the
pouch which we've integrated into the
bag this time the handles now go along
the length of the bag which increases
comfort this way the weight is
distributed evenly when you carry it on
your shoulder or in your hand
we've also reinforced the handles with
an extra layer of fabric so extra
comfort not in fact 2.0 volts around 18
litres which is the same volume at the
last mattah bag XL but we've made the
bottom wider to utilize the space better
it weighs only 22 grams and the fabric
measures only 1 0 0 2 inches thick
that's half the width of the human hair
we've reinforced the stitching this time
around and the bag is sewn with a heavy
duty nylon thread so strong that you
could load it with 55 pounds the fabric
has a water resistant coating for extra
protection and it can still fit into the
watch pocket of your jeans based on the
feedback from the community we've also
decided to create the nano pack a
drawstring backpack from the same unique
material
to maximize comfort we've created straps
from our fabric that distribute the way
to over a wide surface the nano pack
weighs 23 grams takes 14 liters and
comes with a pouch like last time we'll
plant trees with worldview international
to offset any carbon emitted from the
production of the bag pack us today and
help us make the Nana bag 2.0 in the
Nano pack a reality pay Kickstarter we
