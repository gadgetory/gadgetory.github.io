campfire with the camp stove - part of
the bio light energy ecosystem what
you're seeing is a man fighting a teddy
bear in the snow this man is not crazy
he is the presenter of apricot the most
innovative durable feature-packed
goddamn terrific and ventricle and it
won't burn hole in your pocket how come
because while big grant companies spend
their money on ads and stores we spent
our budget on research development and
materials to make a better coat even
this video is the cheapest video we
could possibly make one cameraman one
presenter and one incredible adventure
coat apricot was made by real
adventurers who went through every
possible challenge to find what a real
adventure coat means
every aspect of the coat was rethought
from the ground up
it all starts with climate child an
innovative insulation system that keeps
you warm in cold conditions and cool in
warm ones and is super breathable and
super lightly hey God you hope you light
I mean it is the coat light cool with
apricot
we also rethought the way pockets are
built into jackets each of apricots many
many pockets was designed individually
to fit any essentials you need to carry
all the pockets are stitch welded to be
waterproof but the pockets are only half
the story we invented a design method
called DWD the differential weight
distribution which ensures the coat
feels empty even if you pack it full of
gear in other words carry all that stuff
and feel like you're carrying no stuff
pretty genius what else oh yeah the safe
factor thanks reasonably-priced
presenter never got stranded at the
bottom of a mountain and needed to be
pulled up apricot people did then they
came up with say family a built in
life-saving harness that can carry up to
400 pounds if you're strong enough to
pull of course apricot is waterproof and
windproof it's meant for real
adventurers not a kiddie playground tool
when you were a real adventurer
sometimes you get lost that's why we
partnered a good spot the world's leader
in GPS trackers just press this button
and your location is sent to a
helicopter or your mom yeah
and the GPS never runs out because
apricot also has a built-in solar
battery yeah they thought of everything
while you wait for rescue enjoy apricots
built-in inflatable pillow
mmm that's good and apon okay now our
presenters in a city man this coat looks
great everywhere and on anyone oh and
the beer to demonstrate how strong our
materials are we wanted this man to find
a beer but apparently a real beer costs
a lot and we wanted to invest more in
the coast we even only spent a hundred
bucks on our logo it was run by this guy
thanks Nathan
look out for the bear ha ha good style
so now you're excited you're thinking
this coat looks amazing but I don't know
you guys how can I trust you so I guess
you and the branded coat managers are
regular golf buddies no you're not and
we don't play golf it's boring we just
really care for this coat we spent a lot
of our time and money to make it a
reality because we tried many other
coats and just weren't happy now a pea
coat is finally here so a few love
adventures and want a coat you can trust
that comes with an honest price tag get
apricot
we live in the digital age so whether
you're backpacking through Europe or
exploring the great outdoors it's
important to stay connected and charged
with that said we believe we've designed
the most technologically advanced hiking
backpack ever created introducing the
NRG camper by ghost tech the NRG camper
is a fully featured camping and hiking
bag that integrates charging technology
throughout the design while maintaining
all the great features you would expect
from the quality pack the bag has a
custom 16,000 milliamp battery which
locks right into the interior frame for
comfort and security with the included
cables you can charge multiple devices
like your smartphone or tablet all at
the same time going to explore nature
for more than a few days and worried
about running out of power the NRG
camper includes a fully functional solar
panel that comfortably fits right onto
the front this charges the internal
battery using the natural power of the
Sun meaning you can stay off the grid as
long as you want without losing any
power we know for a hiking and camping
bag that comfort is crucial the energy
camper features a custom height
adjustment system which is marked on the
back so you can adjust it to make sure
it's optimized for maximum comfort also
the bag is specifically designed to
implement a hydration bladder so you can
make sure you're drinking enough water
throughout your adventure in addition to
overall comfort the bag is highly
capable for even the longest of trips as
it features numerous pockets and storage
spaces the main compartment is large
enough to fit everything you've been for
a long journey the sides are filled with
pockets drawstrings
and straps to attach various other items
that you can easily access not only that
but the right waist strap has an
exterior USB charging outlet that
connects directly inside to the battery
so you don't have to fiddle
in your bag if you want your electronic
devices charging but still handy
plus on the other side there is an
external power switch so you can turn
the battery off without even having to
open the entire bag now obviously
designed with electronic devices in mind
you want to make sure that they will
stay protected there's a specially
crafted moisture zip pocket so your
gadgets will stay protected from the
elements and even though the pack is
tough-as-nails against various weather
situations if the rain is just too heavy
there's a built-in rain cover so you can
put your mind at ease knowing that
everything inside is protected also if

integrated right into the chest strap so
