best ways to experience a happier and
healthier life introducing the hitch
hotel when inventor Jeff Patterson
originally designed a cargo box for his
son's need to safely secure and store
his mountain bike while traveling he
realized he could do a lot more
it was then the world's first expandable
Wheeless trailer was born we spent over
three years designing and testing the
hitch hotel to make sure it was light
strong and weather resistant easy to set
up it becomes a traveling hotel for
everyone who loves an adventure and a
good night's sleep
ready to go whenever and wherever
the hitch hotel is built tough with
lightweight aircraft aluminum and
hand-laid fiberglass the hitch hotel is
designed to store and transport your
valuable equipment completely self
supportive requiring no heavy lifting
the hitch hotel can be set up in just
minutes once you reach your destination
it's truly an organic extension of your
vehicle when expanded it becomes a large
sleeping area of over 135 cubic feet it
will keep you and your belongings safe
and secure in any environment
enjoy your adventurous life a lot more
while relaxing and sleeping comfortably
with the hitch hotel
we're after you're going
whenever you get there your room is
ready
I'm mark and I'm tom this is beeline
moto feelin moto is a beautifully
intuitive navigation device change the
way you write
nearly three years ago weekend
Kickstarter last trip back navigation
device prices we've shipped that to over
3,000 people it's been sold around the
world ever since we don't just ride push
bikes now we're about to be like motor
we've taken everything that people love
so much about the first product what it
into finding the ultimate navigation
devices makes like this it's high-tech
it's tougher but at its core is that
same concepts have kick start to my
storm in 2010 a beeline moto attaches to
any bike in moments with the twist lock
mechanism and a variety of different
modes setting up routes just takes a few
taps on the smartphone app but you can
even upload GPX routes and once you're
set up you don't need a data connection
it's very useful to have it when we
arrive in with a group and you don't
always have to rise in a pack you can
have your own ride and get a destination
you just have to follow one direction
it's very easy we've cut the interface
intentionally really simple there are
two modes for navigation as route mode
which guides you along a specific route
and takes you through every single turn
and then those compass mode which simply
points you at a final destination and
gives you the freedom to choose the
route some of the best parts are being
on a bike isn't
my profit is nothing that life be like
is may not freedom to move through
traffic and nowhere and going but also
create my own truth
I love the simplicity and just being
able to get the information quickly is
amazing it's waterproof and shockproof
and has a really sturdy mounted
mechanism battery lasts for 30 hours of
use and is been charged by USB the
display works great in direct sunlight
but also has a backlight for nighttime
lighting and the app will track all of
your rights so you can go back and see
where you've been I think I love most
about the eyes it only gives you the
information that you actually need or as
I have a phone up there's just so much
going on that you actually track of
what's happening it really brings back
the sort of purity of riding a bike
again you just put it on and it's good
to go
everything started three years ago with
this the smallest keyring cable ever
seen in a world where smartphones have
become such an important part of our day
battery life remains the toughest
challenge this is the problem we set to
solve when we first came up with in
charge in charge is a compact cable
meant to be kept in your keys at all
times we all hate having our phone die
when we most need it
luckily nowadays USB ports are
everywhere so all we need is the right
cable to top off our battery after
gathering feedback from thousands of
backers during our first two campaigns
and working hard to find new aesthetic
and technical solutions we are now
excited to finally present you our next
product in charge dual thanks to a brand
new multi-directional connector that
unifies iPhone and micro USB plugs you
can now have a unique product that
charges both Apple and Android
smartphones as well as Bluetooth
speakers headphones power banks ecigs
air pods and much more we have developed
new materials for the cable such as
premium eco leather which look great and
increase the durability and it's also
weatherproof but we didn't stop there
since most smartphones are now moving to
USB see we designed an adapter that fits
perfectly with in charge dual keeping
the same sleek design while expanding
its functionality introducing in charge
all-in-one the effortless solution for
having all the cables you need in one
single product that fits under keychain
after spending the past months
prototyping and finding the right
components we are now ready for mass
production
