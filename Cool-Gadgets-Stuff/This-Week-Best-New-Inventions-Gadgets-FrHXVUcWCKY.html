opened a portal into our living rooms
with the Atari 2600 now we're ready to
reopen that portal and introduce a brand
new Atari product inspired by the past
but created designed and engineered for
today introducing the Atari VCS the 2600
was just this meteor from another planet
it crashed here and kicked off the
evolution of all gaming life as we know
it not only was this sort of a video
game console but it was turning
television into a more social activity
it was like we were transported into the
future something magical happening on
the TV for the first time it is pretty
exciting to see Atari kind of come back
and take what they did well and
reimagine that for this new generation
that are playing games differently
consuming media differently having
different social experiences around this
type of media taking everything we loved
about that first sort of simple retro
Atari experience the first time we used
it and bringing it into a modern context
which is a bit more complex one of the
unique things about the Atari VCS is its
PC architecture and Linux operating
system you can play hundreds of classic
Atari games on it but there's more to it
than that
modern games will be there too along
with social media streaming video music
and so much more hey Atari let's play
tempest 4000 our mission was to create
an iconic and authentic Atari product
one that's beautiful and evokes emotion
not just another box to shove into your
TV
the 2600 offers this amazing palette of
iconic details you've got toggle
switches and woodgrain fins and angles
we looked at taking each of those core
components and evolving it for a next
generation it was something that feels
like it felt and not trying to look how
it looked then so with the 2600 it was a
box with ribbing on a surface and we
were looking at that detail and started
talking about well what if the box was
entirely ribs it's not a box with
applied ribs it's actually constructed
from India
fins and layers we found a way to inlay
a real natural wood product and it's a
beautiful finish but it also becomes a
really interactive part of the product
the interface shines through that
material we feel strongly that a product
like this deserves a little more thought
a little more effort a little more heart
by solving for design intent
manufacturability thermals designed for
assembly all at the same time one of the
things that was exciting me the most
about it was the controller to see sort
of a reimagine yet more versatile
version of the same thing that I grew up
with in my hand was instantly the one
thing that I was super happy with we
wanted to do something really special
for our biggest atari thing we've
created a special launch edition of the
VCS only available on indiegogo Atari is
kind of transcended beyond even those
who had a chance to play it everything
that I personally done in gaming past
that point all trails back to those
original roots it's a refreshing breath
of air to have the Atari brand come back
to gaming
what's the most famous pistol in your
mind my answer will always be the m1911
a pistol that most Americans have agreed
with for the past century it was
designed by mr. John Moses Browning and
served as the standard issue sidearm for
the United States Armed Forces since
1911 it's not only a pistol but also
represents the honor and pride of
Americans
the m1911 age is a card holder that pays
tribute to the m1911 it's a two-piece
card holder that simulates its reloading
action when you press the release button
the inner magazine will be released from
the outside case so that you can take
your cards out from it with one hand
after you've finished you can simply
push the magazine back until you hear
that famous flick sound the m1911 H is
made from an aluminium magnesium alloy
so it's not too heavy and it keeps the
weight as it was in the original design
a lot of effort has been put into
replicating the original Double Diamond
pattern found on the m1911 script it's
made from real walnut wood and a
handmade process is used to replicate
the original walnut grid
the release button is on the side so
that both right and left-handed users
can easily use it it's not only a
stylish everyday carry item but also
very fashionable
since the magazine is detachable you can
choose which one to carry every day
whether it be for credit cards business
cards or cigarettes please support us so
we can make this classic work of art
come to life
the idea for sense reax was a long-term
dream to interact with the virtual world
in a natural way use your hands your
feet your whole body and a couple of
years ago I came across Roth's thesis
that's when we decided to come together
and found a company the system works by
combining multiple sensor types by
actually taking the best features of
each sensors and combine them fuse them
in a certain way that we actually have a
very precise system and which allows you
to fully immerse in the inverter content
the most important feature that we
wanted our system to have is the very
precise tracking of the hand not only
position but also finger movements we
think that our technology will
revolutionize virtual reality because it
really makes interaction natural so you
don't have to learn the buttons of
control but you really can use your
hands to interact with virtual reality
our system actually is the only one
right now that is mobile that allows you
to use your hands the hand might not
always be in the line of sight so it
might manipulate something which is out
of of you real basically we wanted to
have the possibility to incorporate
different movements as well so even
footsteps to actually move in the
virtual reality immersion is
particularly important because it
connects the user to the virtual reality
so you're not just playing you avatar
you really become data
augmented reality will certainly enrich
our lives by adding information in your
surrounding you're actually not changed
to any location or computer you can take
it everywhere and let virtual
information pop up you can then interact
with this information
my ambition for sensor X is that we get
this the system out in the in the field
and actually let people use it to
immerse into virtual reality the dream
for motion capture I think has been out
there for a long time and now finally
with the Ascension of head mounted
devices different types of sensors and
experts like Nikko and roll I think we
have reached a level where you can
actually implement it it is really a
paradigm change it can really change way
we interact with electronics and and
computers
no matter what you need to create or
which computing device you use and
wherever you may happen to be you
deserve one tool that does everything no
compromises that's why we created pro
point
hi I'm grant hi I'm Mike we've been
releasing products that push the
boundaries of ergonomic Mouse design and
function for over a decade and thanks to
our incredible supporters raised nearly
a million dollars and pledges to bring
our products to life last year we
launched the Z gaming mouse and it was
voted the gaming innovation of the Year
by CES and before that we launched our
economically designed pen grip mouse
this four point GT which went on to
become computer peripheral of the year
so we've gone back to the drawing board
on the sub-point GT taking everything
our customers loved improving what it
already does and adding even more
innovative features to make one device
that really does fulfill your every need
no matter we are heaven to be
we created the ultimate economic mouths
for designers power users and people on
the go it's also a presenter device and
you can even use it on your iPad the pro
point was designed from the ground up
for productivity and ergonomics
conventional mice use a clog grip that
orientate your hand and rest in an
unnatural position that over time causes
pain associated with carpal tunnel and
tendonitis Pro points innovative pen
grip design aligns your hand and wrist
in a more neutral position providing
comfort and precision at your fingertips
your health is first and foremost so we
also include award-winning
economic software that is used by
millions of people worldwide introducing
dr. Kevin Taylor I've been involved in
the office ergonomics fail for about 20
years or more now and I became
interested in the field because I got
RSI myself many years ago when you look
at the research we're not really
designed to sit in front of a computer
and sit still all day that's behind a
lot of the health problems today and
there's some relatively straightforward
things that you need to do but they're
not very easy for people to remember so
that's why we've come up with software
which is designed to help people do that
you know it's about your work area
setting it up right using the right
equipment and believe it or not the
analysis of causing most of these issues
it's that fixed posture grabbing hold of
the mouse and trying to do that fine
movement that really takes a strain onto
your arm and shoulder one of the great
things that we're really excited about
the swift point is allows use your
fingers to do that fine motor control
that frees up your hand when I first saw
it and first try the device I thought
this is one of the best most
well-designed products I've seen in the
ergonomics space for years
not only is Pro point the most
comfortable Mouse in the world but with
our gyro technology it's also a
presenter meaning it's actually two
devices at one stand tall with pro
pointed hand and flick the switch to
transform it into the best presenter
device in the world lead your audience
through your story with a virtual laser
pointer and draw on the screen to
highlight what matters most Pro Point
supports a wireless receiver or
Bluetooth which means it can be used on
almost any device even an iPad your iPad
is great for reading and browsing but
for creating content with a touchscreen
and a fat finger it can be difficult so
we partner with the best remote desktop
app developers in the world so you can
remote into a Windows machine with full
mouse control of your desktop apps like
Word or Excel
no desk no problem if you're sitting on
a sofa with your laptop and a cafe on a
plane or in a train or bus this is where
Pro Point shines you can use it right on
your laptop palm rest the USB receiver
also charges the mouse a 30-second rapid
charge gives one hour use so you never
get caught short
Pro point not only gives you the full
functionality of a three-button mouse
and scroll wheel but with gyroscope
technology it opens up a new world of
tilt gestures for panning and zooming
unlike other mice they use the scroll
wheel for middle mouse clicks Pro Point
has a dedicated third mouse button
that's easy to click you can assign
separate functions to all three buttons
when the device is tilted so there's
actually six button actions right at
your fingertips and office programs like
Word and Excel use tilt gestures to
effortlessly flick up down or even
left/right in Photoshop or illustrator
flick to the area you need to work on
without even pressing a button for 3d
modeling use tilt gestures to
effortlessly rotate zoom and pan assign
shortcuts to the tilt gestures like app
switching and the actions you use the
most Pro point is the ultimate tool for
designers and power users in the office
or on the go our goal was to develop one
tool that does everything you need on
any device with no compromises we just
can't wait to get pro point into your
hands
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
