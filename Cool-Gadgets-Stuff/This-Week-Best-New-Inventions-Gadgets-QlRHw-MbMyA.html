biogas that means banana pancakes
a 2015 we launched the first IndieGoGo
campaign showing the world how to turn
this into this
an idea from a back yard applies returns
organic food scraps into cooking gas was
first of its kind we were so excited to
see all these people from all over the
world enjoying the system
the first campaign enabled us to get
home bogus to the heart of remote
communities they need people who have
been cooking over fire would suddenly
had clean free energy it was a huge step
in fulfilling our vision the amazing
support inspired us to think forward
what if we could take the humble gas
appliance make it even better and reduce
its overall cost it took us over a year
home bogus 2.0 is an advanced appliance
that produces green renewable energy
installation is now simpler just fill
the digester with water
mount the gas container using the
supplied sandbags and you're ready to go
the 2.0 version is 50 percent more
productive easier to maintain and super
durable we've also added a home ba gas
stove to give you the perfect solution
an average family produces about two
liters of waste a day
why should organic waste go into giant
polluting landfills when it can go back
into nature home bogus 2.0 can now
produce up to three hours of cooking gas
per day more than enough for an average
family plus a top quality completely
organic fertilizer that goes back into
the soil you own backyard eCos icon once
food waste goes in the bacteria digests
the organic material and released by gas
and fertilizer no electricity is
required it is completely safe to use
order less and can digest anything from
fruits and veggies to meat and dairy
more and more people are beginning to
reduce reuse and recycle as a way of
life Nature has given us so much now
it's time to give back
flutter scoring today's EPA report
public confidence in water quality has
been shaken in light of recent problems
in Flint Michigan
but sadly Flint was far from alone
serious under reporting of violations
and weaknesses in the EPA's drinking
water standards have caused many
consumers to seek alternative sources of
drinking water aging municipal water
systems industrial wastes cancer-causing
heavy metals fertilizers even our own
residential plumbing all of these can
place our water at risk we want to keep
our families healthy
we've always counted on our tap water to
be safe but how can we be sure by
knowing what's in our water that's why
we created the water shield an
affordable highly effective water
monitoring solution water quality and
composition varies widely from state to
state and region to region municipal
systems are often old the deteriorated
not able to cope with the increased
volume required for business and
population growth but it's not just
municipal systems that can put your
water at risk your home's plumbing can
also be a factor in substandard or
unsafe water quality after water leaves
the main pipe all of your plumbing is
your responsibility with an easy
do-it-yourself installation the water
shield is an affordable effective way to
know what's in your water what you can
do to address any issues and monitor
your water periodically to make sure
it's safe not just once but throughout
the year it's small economical and works
with any standalone or whole house water
filter system here's how it works
when water leaves the public water
system it enters your pipes and flows
into your home's plumbing traveling up
to your sink water flows into the water
shield and passes across the patented
sensors system which detects the
presence of lead cadmium arsenic acidity
and other harmful contaminants the
sensors send this data to the serene
application the app lets you control run
schedule and monitor your water
from home or away and displays a report
on water quality if problems are
detected it makes remedial
recommendations such as the types of
water treatment needed or to contact
your utility about a problem with the
water shield you won't have to guess
about your water you'll know and exactly
how to make sure it stays safe and
healthy for you and your family
hi I'm Adrienne passionate storyteller
and creator of victory tripod because
I'm always on the go I've been looking
for an ultra portable and
multifunctional tripod that works with
my smartphone DSLR camera and GoPro and
that's ready to use wherever I travel
victory stands apart from the pack
because of its compact size unique
design and extendable legs fast to set
and easy to use
victory will help you capture the moment
like never before
forget flimsy selfie sticks that have
limited angle versatility and often end
up visible in your pictures
no more improvisations and no more
compromise other tripods on the market
are heavy bulky and inconvenient to
transport to location and haul to the
site victory is sleep light and
comfortable to carry you can now be part
of the picture part of priceless
memories have perfect control over your
images and get the best angle without
interrupting the moment don't ever miss
out on a great photo opportunity no
matter where you are
are you suffering from back pain would
love to have a good posture do you want
to be in shape have a strong core and
build muscles would you like to
challenge yourself it is proven that
doing planks is the best and most
effective workout to build a strong core
align the spine and activate many
important muscles in the neck arms
shoulders chest abdominals back glutes
and legs as the focus is on the core
region planking prevents lower back
injuries and reduces back pain
significantly it is amazing the aim of a
plank workout is to hold the static
plank position as long as possible
the longer you hold the plank the better
you perform the faster you reach your
target but the difficulty is when you
start blinking you count every single
second so instead of shaking your body
while counting seconds you can hold the
plank we have created a solution that
distracts you from this and is way more
fun the plank pad the plaint pad
combines a fitness device with a game on
your smartphone or tablet by playing a
game your focus is more into the game
than on counting every second this makes
you plank much longer reaching your
goals faster while the time flies by
having fun the plank pad itself is made
of a fine long lasting and high-quality
wood with a walnut finishing to make it
look outstanding the top is covered with
a special foam to assure a comfortable
planking it comes with a special mat so
you don't slip don't make any noise or
damage your floor we also added a nice
handle to carry the plank pad to start
an exercise you just need to download
the app place it on the straight aligned
plank pad to synchronize and choose a
game or a workout
the app also teaches you to do the
perfect plank to play the game you have
to balance the plank pad left and right
the app and the gyroscope of your mobile
device are in perfect sync with the
plank pad
there is a game for everyone like candy
monster circles asteroids Waverider and
snow cruisin and in the future there
will be even more the games will
challenge you to collect more and more
points and you will forget about the
time so your workout will last much
longer
besides the games there is a workout
section the plank pad has to stay
straight while you are following the
plank exercises we tried plank pad at
more than 100 friends and also many
people at the gym and we figured out
that no matter what age and if you are
well-trained or not the person could
hold the plank position almost 50
percent longer than before since the
plank pad can also be used as a balance
board to train the motor coordination
improve reaction time and to prevent
injuries we created two games specially
for balancing the balance board turns
into a surf or snowboard and you play
fun games while working your lower
muscles out and increasing your body
balance and stability
now the game is up to you strengthen
your core build muscles eliminate back
pain and get a six-pack in no time
thanks to the plank pad
intruders are unfortunate fact in our
lives and we do our best to secure and
protect the homes from some dickheads
breaking in now people have a lot of
possibilities when it comes to
protecting their homes you can buy home
alarm systems for a few hundred bucks or
even lease one for small fee every month
the company you lease it from might even
install it for you for little or no cost
and then you can also get yourself
wireless systems and to save some money
you can even install it yourself all you
need is pretty much a drill and some
guidelines introducing for no D the most
cost effective home personal and
neighborhood security solution on the
market when I say cost-effective
I mean it's cheaper than anything else
on the market with no hidden extra fees
and compared to this guy it's only a
fraction of the costs and the size for
that matter and you won't need any
drills or guidelines just put the
batteries in
download the fan Oriya and finish the
installation takes no more than 30
seconds and this guy he could go back to
doing what he does best which is winning
strongman competitions and of course
best known for
now let's take a quick look how it works
I live in a small flat and therefore 1/4
note is enough for me but if you live in
a big flat or a house then no worries
just buy more for notice and place them
around the house then connect them all
together through the app the fenoli is
made to be simple therefore there are no
physical buttons on it everything is
built into the app so when I come home I
get a reminder to turn the alarm off the
system is even so smart that it allows
me to schedule the time of day it should
automatically be turned on or off now if
there would be an intruder coming in and
not me this is what would happen I told
you before that fenoli was the most cost
effective home personal and neighborhood
security solution on the market and when
I say neighborhood I mean the whole
neighborhood can help each other out
dealing with unwanted intruders the
amazing Icelandic summer you can easily
connect with your neighbors via the app
so they get notified if some is
breaking into your house why because if
you're chilling in the summer house far
away from home and you for nobody goes
blasting your neighbor can check your
home for you because your neighbor is
much faster reaching your house than any
security company or the police now let
me tell you how for nobody can help you
with your personal security you might
get into the circumstances where you
need immediate assistance you know that
kind of circumstance is what you
normally scream for help
but what if nobody can hear you or
you're not able to scream at all just
whip out your phone open up the phone or
the app and press panic and the people
in your network closest to your location
get notified that you need help and you
can rest assure that somebody will come
to the rescue</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
