empower you to experience the wild in
comfort and protection let me know if
this sounds like you you're out for a
weekend of adventure in the first night
you wake up shivering cold at 2:00 a.m.
we all love sleeping outside but there's
nothing worse than being cold I guess
you could use the tiny chemical packs
but they don't really last that long and
well they're tiny
since you won't be going back to sleep
anytime soon you could do jumping jacks
and push-ups look there are a lot of
tricks of this trade but let's face it
they don't solve the problem and none of
them get you back to sleep anytime soon
well about six months ago we decided to
change all of that
and we created the hot pocket the
patent-pending hot pocket is the first
of its kind as an insulated stuff sack
with twin battery-powered radiant heat
panels and it can be fully opened and
provide instant warmth anywhere we
wanted to create a modern way to stay
warm in the wild no more boiling water
and plastic bottles no more getting out
of your sleeping bag just push a button
and instantly feel its warmth so you can
get right back to peaceful slumber the
hot pocket is simple when you're headed
out for a camping trip stuff your
sleeping bag into it you can compress it
the hot pocket reduces your insulation
size by over 50% giving you a lot more
space when you get to your campsite you
can even pre-heat your sleeping bag so
when you get in it it's warm when you're
ready to go to sleep open it and place
it inside your sleeping bag and whenever
you need a little extra warmth just
press the button in the hot pocket will
instantly warm you so you can drift
right back to sleep the hot pocket uses
a rechargeable battery and to conserve
its power we added an auto shutoff
feature so you don't have to worry about
getting too warm
you'll have hours of extra warmth
whenever you need it the hot pocket even
charges your devices and it's solar
compatible so it's multifunctional and
it will keep you warm on your entire
adventure it comes in three sizes small
medium and large the small is perfect
for a 30-degree down sleeping bag the
medium is great for a zero Degree down
sleeping bag or a 30-degree top quilt
and under quilt set the large is great
for a zero Degree synthetic sleeping bag
or a zero Degree down top quilt and
under quilt set the hot pocket is
constructed out of incredibly soft and
breathable fabric so it's smooth as
butter and is really nice to hold
against your skin but it's also durable
and weather resistant so you can put it
through its paces in the wild the hot
pocket can be fully recharged in 90
minutes and will provide you a weekend
of adventure with high-energy heat and
if you want you can even plug it in to
your car or your home so you always have
access to its magical warmth thanks to
its lightweight multifunctional design
you can use the hot pocket anywhere at a
soccer game while you're hunting or even
on those cross-country road trips no
matter how tough you are being cold is
miserable and it can even leave you
feeling downright helpless
not to mention ruin your adventure why
be miserable just replace your old stuff
sack with the hot pocket it only adds a
few extra ounces but it will give you
peace of mind knowing that you can warm
up anytime anywhere with just the press
of a button

dramatically at any moment at all these
different venues that's why the duran is
perfect for me it's made out of durable
material

about the duran is that it's sweat proof

look good when she goes out and works
out so the nice thing about the Duran is
that I can also wear as a top layer it's
stylish and perfect for everyday use

the rest of my laundry no hassle no need
