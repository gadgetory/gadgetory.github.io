helps people have their bike comfortably
fit in their lifestyle
it's a detachable handlebar system to
install it you just simply push it in
and twist and to remove it you move the
color back rotate and remove it by
removing the handlebars you actually
save over 14 inches the idea of Billy
bars was to take that bike that you
loved and just make it a little bit
better but I be able to make it fit and
where you live we're starting off with
three main handlebars we have the
straights that the bullhorn we have the
drop down we do have a fourth style
which would be up on the cruiser bikes
along with your handlebars you have the
stem so this will be easily mounted to
your bike all the handlebars are
completely interchangeable with this
stem and then we also have a wall mount
which will allow you to convert your
handlebars into a mount to hold your
bicycle the real goal with Billy bars is
to help people love bikes more I think a
lot of good can come from more biking
when I see somebody biking it a little
bit more hope for Humanity
one of my favorite things to do is to
get out and ride my bike but the
combination of rough roads and stiff
bike frames means riding can be really
tough on your body in 2016
we launched the shock stop suspension
step to add cushioning to the front end
of the bike the stem changed the way
people thought about suspension but the
front of the bike is only half the
equation that's why we're so excited to
introduce the shock stop seat post a
revolutionary short travel suspension
seatpost that will completely change
your riding experience no matter what
kind of bike you ride
maybe you're out for an epic gravel
adventure or just dealing with potholes
on your daily commute you're gonna find
rough roads wherever you ride modern
bikes are designed for speed and
efficiency not for comfort
this means bumps and impacts pass
straight into your body which leads to
fatigue pain or even injury
we designed the shock stop seat post to
suspend your body and isolate you from
the shocks and vibrations of the road we
optimize the travel and suspension
kinematics to provide a super plush
bottomless suspension feel we designed
the seat post to integrate seamlessly
with the styling of modern bikes you can
change the spring rate and preload to
match your specific riding style and
it's compatible with all types of
writing gravel knee bike commuter Road
and mountain
studies show fatigue reduces riding
efficiency by up to 20%
typically adding comfort to bike meant
sacrificing performance the shock stop
seat post lets you ride faster and more
efficiently because instead of bracing
yourself against impacts you can stay
seated and keep pedaling over rough
surfaces it reduces the accumulated
effects of bumps and vibrations allowing
you to ride further faster and more
comfortably
the shock stop seatpost is the rare
product that increases comfort and
performance riding the shocks Topsy post
is truly transformative
after months of testing and riding with
finally ready to release the grand
tourer to Kickstarter an all-terrain
bike shoe for the back country whether
you're touring gravel riding or cross
country mountain biking if you're not
riding up and over Hills you're hiking
the bike up and over gates Fords and
unridable tracks heading off-road makes
great demands of your Footwear
whatever the changing environment throws
at you combining plush comfort with
well-thought-out design details like a
gusseted tongue no so upper the
quadrantal shoe is our response to the
challenges of off-road riding the
different starts at the sole where we
created a proprietary rubber compound
the balances long-term durability with
underfoot grip and a carbon composite
midsole that blends pedal stiffness with
walking comfort when hiker biking and
spending time off the body thanks to the
grand tourers gusseted tongue and no so
weatherproof upper which is fully
waterproof from soul to the black scene
border your feet will remain dry and
comfy no matter how much flashback and
shallow forward crossing look closer and
you'll notice laser micro pores that
mimic the breathability and working of
the skin to better balance our foot
temple
for us lace ups are preferable over
click-clack closure system dual ride
long the grand tourer ships with our
patent approved double lock lace system
which enables you to tie in different
sections of the shoe to your liking
creating a supportive custom fit for the
day ahead as simple as loop knot and
bull
available in a number of classic and
less traditional colors grand tourer
will also ship in two blends of our own
specially formatted camouflage as an
exclusive bonus gift to Kickstarter
backers we have designed a pair of camo
inspired deeply comfortable merino wool
socks to complement the Grand Tour
experience if we meet our funding goal
we will start producing the grand tourer
right away menteng delivery in July in
perfect time for a summer of adventure
welcome to our video we are proud to
introduce you to our new innovative
material flexi carbon waxy carbon
belongs to the group of carbon fiber
reinforced plastics abbreviated as c of
RP which are very lightweight and
durable materials but unlike
conventional C of our piece flexi carbon
is also highly flexible and cannot break
we use flexi carbon to make bike fenders
the material is perfect for this
application it is lightweight durable
and safe thanks to its flexible
properties the flexi carbon fenders can
absorb shocks and don't break which
improves the riding experience and also
the safety of the cyclist because the
fenders don't splinter in case of an
accident
unfortunately flat tires happen the
current flat repair options aren't
always the most reliable or easy to use
hand pumps take a lot of energy and a
long time to inflate a tire co2
inflators are unreliable if you make a
mistake and the lease all the gas you're
stuck having nightmares with flats out
on the trails and in backcountry we set
out to make the fastest high-volume
lightweight mobile inflation device
possible introducing the Stompa the
first truly portable foot pump for
repairing any tire the stop pumping
gauges your largest muscles your legs
you can inflate a tire three times
faster and infinitely easier than a
typical hand pump it keeps your
hands-free to do other things it's also
easy to stow and put into use hands down
the best pump ever made the stop pump is
the first pump that we know of to
incorporate an integrated air filter
this keeps the incoming air clean from
dirt and debris that you damage the
internals and keeps your stall pump
working smoothly for years to come
the creators of stop pump had been the
brains behind bringing hundreds of
products to market over the last 30
years through a prolific career in
BattleBots
we've created some of the most extreme
air systems in robotic combat stomp up
was designed to be light strong and
efficient just like our championship
robots we've left no stone unturned in
our design and development process we
truly started from scratch when creating
the stomp up it's not just a pump design
that's been converted to a foot pump
every component has been purpose-built
for the demands of the foot pump the
stop pump will be made in-house here in
Marin County California of the highest
quality materials to exacting standards
by our expert crew
