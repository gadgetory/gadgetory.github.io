hi I'm indirect I'm a hiker and as it
appears also an inventor this is my
hammock let's call it trim homonka it's
likely one of the most comfortable flat
clay hammocks you can ever find it feels
almost like a bed its innovative for
connection point construction makes it
very stable and impossible to flip over
but still you can enjoy a little swing
if you like it is double layered so you
can put any sleeping pad inside and
always stay warm it has a unique
single-handedly usable pocket system for
easy access of your phone headlamp drink
or anything you want to have Within
Reach
I have developed and tested it over two
years and for now every detail has
become perfect
it is lightweight but tough and durable
because it's made of ultra high
molecular weight polyethylene and
ripstop nylon
after three years of product design that
engineering we've perfected the most
versatile traveling power station ever
the power 27 was designed for the modern
traveler with a 120 volt outlet to USB C
and 2 USB a fast charging outlets you
can go anywhere and still charge
anything up to five devices at the same
time and when we say go anywhere we mean
go anywhere it's 1,000 feet drop proof
rated and 4,000 pounds crush proof rated
plus it's the first-ever ip67
submersible AC power bank on the market
the power 27 is compact and light enough
that it easily fits in any carry-on and
we've made it completely element proof
so that unlike the other guys you won't
have to coddle our battery if you're on
a shoot in the wild and need to charge
your camera batteries or drone or if
you're just looking to take your office
with you on the go our integrated solar
panel means even longer battery life
extension we've also incorporated an LED
torch and strobe to help you find your
way or be found in the dark your life is
mobile free yourself from the level
go anywhere and charge anything remember
no matter what you're up against the
power 27 was made for that you no longer
need to sacrifice quality for mobility
feel free to roam and wheels go with you
vagabond home a good night's sleep
anywhere on the road

pop-up tent or a reimagined camping
brick it'll change the way you travel
and open up new adventures whether you
love extreme sports road tripping

having the freedom to go where you want
when you want
vagabond home is for you we created
vagabond home rooftop tent from anyone
who loves the outdoors and being on the
road with vagabond home your only task
is to find a great place open it up and
get a good night's sleep what makes us
different
it opens fast and easy due to high
quality gas Springs it's aerodynamic
shape reduces fuel consumption it
comfortably fits two adults and one
child our two layers of fabric provide
excellent insulation ventilation and the
ability to handle all kinds of weather
we've got four dimmable lights and a
12-volt DC adapter there's no metal
parts or mechanisms inside the tent the
combination of elements from both types
of hardshell rooftop tents maximize
internal space there's a special
mechanism that allows you to lock the
springs wherever you choose
making the closing as easy as possible a
resin infusion process makes it the
lightest fiberglass rooftop tent of its
size and also provides exceptional
thermal insulation and an anti-theft
lock protects your tent and your
belonging

through research conceptual and
engineering design prototyping and
testing
