constantly getting replaced their time

around this idea but we feel it's time
to change

friends a long time we dress the same
and we own a bike store together over

time with your friends and family doing

get on board with this flat free
solution and let's go right
you
Motion France has invented a new concept
for mountain bike front suspension that
provides a solution to many of the
downsides of the standard suspension
forks when breaking with a standard
telescopic fork the fork is
automatically compressed and up to 80%
of the shock absorbing capacity can be
lost the motion france fork has been
specifically designed to remain
uncompressed when breaking meaning that
100% of the travel is retained for shock
absorption under all circumstances
comfort traction and safety are all
improved for the rider having come up
with the concept motion decided to go
even further and make its first
suspension fork a truly unique object
patented composite blades chosen to
correspond with the weight of the rider
provide exceptional sensitivity while
also dealing with the biggest shocks an
internal hydraulic cartridge provides a
lockout mechanism allowing the rider to
activate or disable the suspension while
on the bike
incredibly precise handling is possible
thanks to the biaxial design the motion
chassis contains no part subject to wear
and tear and requires no maintenance
it's compatible with any mountain bike
frame the interchangeable blades can be
replaced to modify the travel anywhere
between 110 millimeters and 160
millimeters depending on the rider's
activities and preferences
this is great on the apples I'll have to
see that
so see
why am i white
Oh
imagine if vertical bike parking would
suddenly become simple a bike parking
solution that would lift your bike for
you wouldn't require physical strength
and would save floor space it's all
possible banned it is here it's parkus
how it works
drive in the front wheel when the wheel
is fixed hold the saddle to lead the way
and let parkus do its job to remove the
bike just grab the saddle and pull
firmly towards yourself hi my name is
egg and I am one of the creators of the
park many bike enthusiasts face a
problem a lack of storage space all the
available by parking devices and that
solves this issue require great physical
effort so we decided to develop a
solution the idea was born two years ago
we were developing kits from 2015 and
now we have fully functional product
parks is a solution that can be used by
everyone from teenagers to the elder
it also saves up to 40% of floor space
and it looks stylish dear backers your
support in spreading the news about
parks will be very much appreciated it
would be great if you decide to
encourage us by being the first to buy
and try out the parks we believe that
parks will become a must have for many
bike enthusiasts parkus it's easy fun
and simple
