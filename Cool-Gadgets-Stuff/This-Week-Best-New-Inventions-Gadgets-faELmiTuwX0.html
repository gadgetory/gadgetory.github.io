complete rethinking of the folding
pocket knife
it's a response to some very important
questions
how can you deploy a pocket knife blade
while your fingers are securely wrapped
around the handle
do your fingers have to cross the
rotational path of a blade
how do you discreetly secure a combat
style pocket lift without the
inconveniences of a traditional pocket
clip
the morphine Karamat has just five
principal parts plus fasteners
it's compact and rugged with
unprecedented functionality in its
category
so what a quick way to measure stuff
what if you could measure anything just
by walking this is Moser one it can
measure as far as a 1,000 foot tape
measure measure through walls and
obstacles as if they weren't there
measure winding cable lines or tracks
measure angles and curves calculate the
area of a room volume for storage or a
shipping package get the right game
Klein for your decade or stairwell
photos find the right horizontal level
and distance for your poster frames
measure circular objects cylinders even
irregular shapes all with one hand just
need to move it from one point to the
other pin you're done other measuring
tools fail when there's too much light
wrong surface or if the space prevents
them because it doesn't use lasers or a
camera Moser one isn't restricted by
light or space use it anywhere anytime
no matter the circumstance Moser one is
waterproof dustproof and shockproof your
recordings are immediately saved in the
app which is already being sold in the
App Store the app also turns your phone
into a rudimentary Moser device and
already has 70,000 downloads and a solid
4 star rating from users so how does it
work
Moser one uses an advanced technology
called motion
motion measuring is the same technology
used in rocket guidance systems to
accurately track the movement and
locations of rockets in 3d space using
gyros accelerometers and magnetometers
Moser one plots its three-dimensional
position in any space to measure
distance angle level and much more Moser
is the first motion measured device ever
made for consumer use it puts the same
technology found in rockets in the palm
of your hand so what are you waiting for
back our campaign now and step into the
future of measuring with Moser one
you
yeah
microwatts scent is a smart sensor for
smart moving microwatts sense is capable
of measuring temperature humidity co2
levels light intensity air pressure and
noise level it can also detect movements
and vibrations so it knows whether it's
moving or not it runs on batteries and
wirelessly connects your smartphone is
exactly with you anywhere you go and
check your atmosphere what they are
you can get notified according to the
conditions you serve in the app for
example when the temperature drops below
a certain point sets will send your
message or when there's something
suspicious it allows you send also has a
smaller tip really picture when you're
driving or in the middle it will
automatically want you to get some
pressure the co2 gets too high if the
air is too dry it tells you that the
spin brush is very likely smart
notification gets better as you use it
more five more sense gets better by its
community you can share your data with
others and see what others shared in
real time the real weathers that
actually matter of course you can hop
from sharing at any time integration
with other products is very important
and makes sense even more useful and
usable Excel asked Mac robot to check
garden garden sense indicates that the
temperature is seventy five point two
degrees and because it's so tiny you
might be anxious about losing your sense
it has attractive Fischer so when you
lose it you know where to find it
sense offers various modes to can
quickly activate predefined conditions
for example the washtub mode would make
the device along loudly and notify your
smartphone if someone tries to lift the
device there are seven sensors both into
a small device running on batteries when
you carry it with you it operates up to
one month without recharging when you
install it in a room with an extended
battery pack it will last up to two
years
our first confident product was micro
pop push the robot button pusher
backwards and any dumb products into a
smart gadget service is our second
product so we know what to do what to
expect exactly so please join us to make
sense together
