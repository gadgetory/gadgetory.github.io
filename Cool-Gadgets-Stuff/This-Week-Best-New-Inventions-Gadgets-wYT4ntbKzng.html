experience it actually makes it more
immersive and I think that's what I want
when I am gaming is to be able to feel
like I'm there I am a part of the story
it kind of something you're in a movie
theater almost or like a like a ride and
then you spin part where you feel like
you're really immersed in the experience
I would notice a sound whether it was
like a step on a branch or whatever I
was like oh something behind me so I
would move and the headphones really
focused in on that tiny tiny sound you
know when the narrator was whispering I
felt like they were actually whispering
in the back of my ear versus kind of the
ambient noises of nature felt much more
like they were surrounding me completely
it was very cool like there was no lag
time it was I turn my head there's the
sound I was looking for there Ricky
comfortable even like the padding on the
top which I feel you don't really see
takes off a lot of pressure on the ears
there's tons of room telling you I binge
shows so I could be there for 10 hours
and I think these are a lot more
comfortable to wear than any of the
other headphones that I've worn I went
ahead said that's not just for gaming
that I can you I travel a lot you know
something I can take on a flight with me
and be able to either game on the flight
with my phone or listen to a movie
whenever I'm watching a movie on the
flight I think it's incredible that they
have so many different ways to connect
the m√∂bius to whatever device you're
using because it makes them
just really accessible for whatever use
you may have
it's so sharp and so clear there's no
overlap like a footstep is a footstep at
the same time you're hanging a machine
gun over here and a tank driving behind
you over here and then the airplane up
here and they're all completely separate
there's no overlap between them with
these you are actually in the experience
you can't separate your body from what's
actually happening to the character in
the game as much as before it felt like
it's over here and it's above you and
it's behind you and that you're kind of
in the middle I've never had that
experience with a pair of headphones
before it felt like you were actually
they're like the the 3d system for
hearing it is just I have no words for
it it's really cool
it was the most immersive intense
experience I've ever had playing a video
game I felt completely invested
completely immersed in the world it's
gonna put you into the game it's gonna
put you into whatever you're watching so
if you want to feel like a superhero
these are the only headphones that are
gonna let you do that
I mean gaming is all about being
immersed in an experience right so these
headphones do that like with the visuals
that of the game that are incredible it
just complements and it makes it feel
like through actually in the situation
this sound just take it to the next
level
what if you can have access to more more
bold colors more beautiful finishes more
casual options always handcrafted
Italian statement shoes for less than
$200 that would be extraordinary it
sounds crazy but it's the evolution of
vase marks a vase marks were driven by
the belief that luxury is for everybody
we combine colors and materials to make
wearable works of art each pair is
packed with features unlike anything on
the market today an ultra luxury $600
Italian statement shoe for less than 200
dollars over the last two years more
than 6000 backers have helped us make
Kickstarter history by becoming the
world's most funded for project not once
but twice my dream of accessible Italian
luxury shoes became a reality and now
it's evolving
introducing an all new collection of
luxury sneakers statement shoes and the
debut of our tramonto patina inspired by
the sunsets majestic transition from
light to dark
each tramonto patina requires hours of
skillful craftsmanship and as a
culmination of months of development
with our family of artisans that work
exclusively with Italy's top luxury
brands and ace marks this is our story
my name is Paul I grew up in the
mountains of Italy watching artisans
pour their heart and souls into their
shoes for most these finely crafted
shoes have always been way out of reach
so we spent three years traveling
through Italy sourcing the finest
leathers and master craftsmen to bring
our project to life what we found is a
family of fourth-generation artisans
that share our passion for immaculate
craftsmanship and bold style our
artisans are one of the few entrusted by
Italy's top luxury brands to make their
shoes and they are one of the last
craftsmen that still hand dye and hand
burnish each pair in-house making each
shoe a unique piece of art together we
created a light and flexible dress shoe
with a full grain calfskin leather upper
on a black flex instruction that can be
resold and the
comfortable from the first where you
don't have to break them in we specially
constructed a proprietary ace last to
reduce common pressure points the
calfskin leather lining and cushioned
insole mold steer foot and feels like an
extension of you now you can choose
between our finally finished rubber
outsole or original flexible leather
outsole that features a notch steel a
rubber insert for traction and a closed
stitched channel that prevents moisture
from getting in and increases the life
of the shoe our sneakers are handcrafted
and dyed by our fourth generation
Italian artisans and packed with
exterior and interior luxury features
the upper and lining are made with full
grain
calfskin leather the out soles are
stitched for extended life we considered
every inch of our sneakers from the
waxed shoelaces to the pillow soft
padded collar and tongue featuring
rolled leather details for superior
comfort the insole is calfskin lined
removable breathable and shock absorbing
for all-day wear the soft embrace of a
luxury sneaker never felt this good but
our mission goes beyond making luxury
shoes at a fair price when you our
Kickstarter supporters are ready for a
new pair of dress shoes we will buy your
old ones back for $60 and donate them to
help men in need enter the workforce
provide for their families and get back
on their feet
hi I'm Lucas Switzerland but this is not
about cheese
in sports you want to leave as little as
possible to chance you want to optimize
the way you train the way you will
regenerate the way you eat the way you
drink and drinking has a massive effect
on your performance so why do we settle
for water that tastes paths contaminated
by a plastic bottle now a metal bottle
or a glass bottle might give you a
better taste but it's too heavy it's too
much of a distraction when you have to
unscrew it it slows you down you want to
keep your pace right keep your focus
also you see I'm a team player and in
every good team you share your bottle
but then it's very important you can
have contact less drinking for hygienic
reasons so you want to squeeze the
bottle to push the water out Alvarez is
amazing equipment everything's high-tech
but then we drink from the cheap plastic
bottles our water deserves better we
deserve better many told me it's not
possible but I kept going looking for
the right technology looking for the
right people and here we are the world's
first squeezable metal bottle Kegel poor
in Switzerland
designed in Vienna produced in Denmark
and that's where the magic happens a
groundbreaking layering process makes it
possible to create a titanium that's
superlight extremely durable and most of
all flexible
by the way the company mastering this
process is also renowned for producing
accelerator parts for CERN now all we
need to keep going is your support to
buy the tools and the materials for our
first production run help us bring EAGL
to life help us build the first
squeezable metal puddle

fine-tuning the S v2 is primed and ready
to launch the circling adventure
experience to the next level
traditional snorkel gear is outdated
awkward uncomfortable and often
unsanitary from leaking and fogging to
gagging and soreness for tubes held in
your mouth the experience can distract
from seeing marine life the CV 180s v2
improves and simplifies snorkelling on
every level it all starts with our
unique patent-pending
flow tech system which allows for 100%
completely natural breathing through

airflow design eliminates breathing
constriction and helps to reduce fogging
in the mask the newly enhanced EB 180
full face design provides a much larger
viewing area giving you a completely
immersive underwater viewing experience
our patent-pending tube design creates
more clearance against waves and helps
prevent unwanted airflow stoppage the
smoke will has a dry top seal to help
keep water from entering the tube if any
water does happen to make it into the
mask simply raise your head out of the
water and the integrated mouthpiece
drains automatically the mask is secured
by a dual comfort strap system for a
customized fit that doesn't pinch or
pull on your hair and scalp we've
designed an action camera mount so that
