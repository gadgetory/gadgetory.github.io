that comes from mattress companies in
the last 30 years is their marketing you
see their focus is not to come up with a
better way for you to sleep but a better
way to get you to buy the same thing

particular use this brilliant marketing
tactic that allows them to do this by
simply flipping around the order of the
foam that was used in their previous
mattress and since the base layer of
these mattresses rarely get changed or
affected you're essentially just
shopping for different top layers at an
outrageous markup it's time you stop
paying sky-high prices for new and
innovative mattresses
