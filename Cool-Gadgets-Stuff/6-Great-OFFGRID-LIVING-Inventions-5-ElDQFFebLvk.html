hi I'm Kent you know and I'm here today
to introduce the latest product from
Couture it's our latest pedal generator
our current product the power box has
been very successful we sold over 6,000
and the number one comment we get from
customers is can you please make a
bigger one and so we've been working the
last two years
and now it's ready to go so let me get
right to it and there you go it's all
set up now what's different about this
unit on them well one thing you notice
right away is it's got a standard 12
volt outlet and that means all these
devices and I've got a bunch of them
here on the table that have 12 volt
connectors on it are going to work what
we've included in the unit is this one
right here
so you can just plug in and you can
attach this to your 12 volt battery
which is pedal and it charges it up to
make it easier for customers we also
have a number of accessories we're in a
kit area on our store one of them is
this two-for-one so you can plug in for
your 12 volt connector and now you have
two connections all right another that
we will carry on our store
is this has a 12-volt connector to two
USBs and they can go up to 3.1 amps and
it also has on it a display and that
display will give you a voltage and amps
with to show you here charging rate and
you can use it to just check the voltage
and make sure that's good we're also
going to carry on our store two
inverters this one right here plugs
right in and we also have a this is a
150 watt and this is a 300 watt and we
actually recommend the 300 watt one I
mean both will work and you know when
you're in a car obviously you don't have
these concerns but when you're using
human power energy efficiency is
important and the 300 watt is a better
unit it's more efficient so you'll get
more power out or the same power with
less effort so we do recommend the 300
watt unit but both will work so this is
the unit that basically answers the
question and that everybody's given us
we love it please give us a bigger one
this is the bigger one it's got an
oversized greater than 50 watt generator
it's regulated on the standard model to
14 volts and 3 amps so that you can
charge up to 3 amps directly on a deep
cycle 12 volt battery and you know as we
said a full range of devices that are
made to plug into automotive socket will
work and we can do custom units as well
Legion Solar is a plug-and-play
do-it-yourself solar system that
installs in minutes requires no utility
company permission delivers instant
results scales any time and pays for
itself three times faster than
traditional contractor installed systems
two years ago we introduced Legion solar
one we designed a micro inverter to
convert sunlight energy into grid energy
we created high efficiency lightweight
solar panels and plug and play wiring
for fast and easy installation for the
first time users could produce their own
clean energy and slowed down their
electricity consumption from their
energy provider as a result customers
experienced lowered electric bills and
lower energy prices last year we
introduced Legion solar - we created
do-it-yourself racking solutions for
composite shingle tile and metal roofs
our composite shingles patented design
no longer requires you to locate a
rafters and we cracked the code for tile
roofs with our top towel mount
eliminating the need for expensive
specialists to perform an installation
we created detailed step-by-step how-to
videos to coach you through the entire
process we deployed an online ROI
calculator and system configurator where
orders ship directly to your door we
introduced our game-changing technology
called solar regulator a device that
allows you to contain the energy
produced behind your meter where the
utility company doesn't own the utility
company only sees less usage from you
and not a grid type conventional solar
system we fine-tuned our app enabling
you to see energy production consumption
health historical data and much more
Legion solar - allowed users to offset
their daytime consumption and supplement
the daytime appliances without
restriction resulting in three times
faster return on and
men Legion solar 3 introduces two new
components battery commander and
off-grid controller battery commander
connects in between the micro inverter
and the solar panel during daylight
solar energy is used to supplement usage
and charge the batteries at night
batteries supplement your usage enabling
l√©gion solar to completely offset all of
your daytime and nighttime consumption
making you entirely self-sufficient for
all of your energy needs
off-grid controller automatically
detects when your grid power goes down
and turns on a backup inverter so that
you can continue to run all of your
basic necessities from your batteries
it's peace of mind for your family
during any emergency we're all set for
manufacturing and we need your help to
continue to drive innovation forward
towards a carbon-free world join the
fight for clean energy and become a
legion today</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
