your complimentary drawstring bag last
year we launched public goods with one
mission make healthy high quality
products affordable to all we simplify
the supply chain by cutting out the
middleman and selling goods directly to
our customers this allowed us to deliver
healthy premium products at a fraction
of the price of traditional retail
within the first month over ten thousand
people join we delivered our products on
time and made our new customers very
happy and when we asked them what they
wanted to see next overwhelmingly we got
one ants healthy tasty food the average
American spends six thousand dollars a
year on food and if you want to eat
healthy that number only goes up but it
doesn't need to be that way our idea is
simple like it's always been cut out the
middlemen and get the products from the
producers to your home for what it costs
us to get it to you we just charge a
small membership fee which allows you to
save thousands on healthy products we're
developing a wide variety of culinary
delights organic and healthy delivered
to your door and a fair price
but of course to launch this there
upfront costs which is why during this
Kickstarter we're offering a variety of
perks to join our community
there's no reason healthy food shouldn't
be affordable and accessible to all it's
too important to be an economic decision
okay this is delicious who cooked this
join public goods and save thousands of
dollars every year
keeping produce fresh can be a challenge
Americans waste 24 billion dollars in
produce each year usually because the
produce is kept in the original store
packaging this packaging doesn't allow
for the correct airflow which leads to
faster spoiling rubbermaid fresh works
produce savor offers a revolutionary
storage option to keep your produce
fresh up to 80 percent longer plus the
fresh mint technology will last a
lifetime of the container the fresh
works containers can safely go into the
dishwasher and are 100% bpa free
rubbermaid fresh works containers are
available in seven sizes small great for
blueberries and green beans medium
perfect for strawberries and asparagus
large ideal for lettuce tomatoes and
more plus fresh works extra large and
rectangular sizes are great for keeping
bulkier produce fresh as well experience
fresher produce all year round with
fresh works Legion fuller is a
plug-and-play do-it-yourself solar
system that installs in minutes requires
no utility company permission delivers
instant results scales any time and pays
for itself three times faster than
traditional contractor installed systems
two years ago we introduced Legion solar
one we designed a micro inverter to
convert sunlight energy into grid energy
we created high efficiency lightweight
solar panels and plug and play wiring
for fast and easy installation for the
first time users could produce their own
clean energy and slow down their
electricity consumption from their
energy provider as a result customers
experienced lowered electric bills and
lower energy prices last year we
introduced Legion solar to we created
do-it-yourself racking solutions for
composite shingle tile and metal roofs
our composite shingles patented design
no longer requires you to locate
Raptors and we cracked the code for tile
roofs with our top towel mount
eliminating the need for expensive
specialists to perform an installation
we created detailed step-by-step how-to
videos to coach you through the entire
process we deployed an online ROI
calculator and system configurator where
orders ship directly to your door we
introduced our game-changing technology
called solar regulator a device that
allows you to contain the energy
produced behind your meter where the
utility company doesn't own the utility
company only sees less usage from you
and not a grid type conventional solar
system we fine-tuned our app enabling
you to see energy production consumption
health historical data and much more
Legion Solar to allowed users to offset
their daytime consumption and supplement
the daytime appliances without
restriction resulting in three times
faster return on investment Legion solar
3 introduces two new components battery
commander and off-grid controller
battery commander connects in between
the micro inverter and the solar panel
during daylight solar energy is used to
supplement usage and charge the
batteries at night batteries supplement
your usage enabling légion solar to
completely offset all of your daytime
and nighttime consumption making you
entirely self-sufficient for all of your
energy needs
off-grid controller automatically
detects when your grid power goes down
and turns on a backup inverter so that
you can continue to run all of your
basic necessities from your batteries
it's peace of mind for your family
during any emergency we are all set for
manufacturing and we need your help to
continue to drive innovation forward
towards a carbon-free world join the
fight for clean energy and become
Allegiant today at ten a volts we
believe that battery needs to be more
efficient and better cater your needs
that is why we have created ten uh volts
the most advanced rechargeable lithium
battery tinna volts only takes two hours
to a full charge whereas nickel metal
hydride rechargeable batteries take
around ten hours on a single charge
tenna volts offers a stable performance
with more than 12 hours after 1000
charge cycles tin of all its usable
capacity still stands at 70% while other
brands fall below 50% after 500 cycles
the best part tin of volts is the
world's first rechargeable lithium
battery that offers a consistent power
output of 1.5 volts but words mean
nothing without proof right over the
course of our four years R&amp;amp;D we've
obtained six national and world patents
and passed many testings let the numbers
speak by themselves we're testing the 10
of volts with the inner loop Pro for a
car racing test you'll see within one
hour ten of volts reaches five hundred
and thirty cycles outnumbering eneloop
by 100 cycles when checking the lap
times ten of volts achieves as steady
times for each lap a significant
difference that shows tenha volts has a
better voltage consistency we did a
flashlight experiment to compare the tin
of bolts and eneloop row ten of bolts is
able to provide a constant brightness
with its 1.5 consistent output voltage
at 10 volts our mission is to bring the
best rechargeable lithium batteries to
our customers so give us a chance and
support us on IndieGoGo today let's make
dream a reality
