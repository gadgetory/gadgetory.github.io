best ways to experience a happier and
healthier life introducing the hitch
hotel when inventor Jeff Patterson
originally designed a cargo box for his
son's needed to safely secure and store
his mountain bike while traveling he
realized he could do a lot more
it was then the world's first expandable
realist trailer was born we spent over
three years designing and testing the
hitch hotel to make sure it was light
strong and weather resistant easy to set
up it becomes a traveling hotel for
everyone who loves an adventure and a
good night's sleep
ready to go whenever and wherever
the hitch hotel is built tough with
lightweight aircraft aluminum and
hand-laid fiberglass the hitch hotel is
designed to store and transport your
valuable equipment completely self
supportive requiring no heavy lifting
the hitch hotel can be set up in just
minutes once you reach your destination
it's truly an organic extension of your
vehicle when expanded it becomes a large
sleeping area of over 135 cubic feet it
will keep you and your belongings safe
and secure in any environment
enjoy your adventurous life a lot more
while relaxing and sleeping comfortably
with the hitch hotel
wherever you're going whenever you get
there your room is ready
hey guys we're out with the Kimberley
camper echo suite today talk about
off-grid mate the water is breaking
about 20 meters that way in fact there's
a little pot of dolphins just over there
today we're here to show you how easy it
is to set one of these suckers up I
promise you this is gonna be the
shortest video you've ever seen go watch
this it's as simple as leasing the
travel lock in the latch there make sure
it locks back up this is so easy you
drop a line in get your five-year-old to
do it then you flip up the lobster tail
it's a couple little catches in here one
over this side as well
that's down that's down so your lift
controls are under here no more fighting
with the Misses we have where to stay
and hold Nepal it's literally one button
I could do this on their stubby
look at that that'll give you a stop
point up here there we go
we go inside and push out the bed all
right stairs already out so we're in
here we're gonna push out the bed gentle
push beds out as you can see this is a
hard wall unit into canvas anywhere
pretty much leaving it in a cyclone
chairs up and your table out we're done
get your kitchen facilities also got
ourselves a hundred and thirty liter
fridge and freezer their induction
cooktop and your own personal ensuite
and shower now this thing here is a 100%
automatic waterless toilet system this
thing
once it's finished its cycle it's just
to go throw it on your veggie garden in
fact this thing here is entirely
removable as well you can set yourself
an ensuite up out the back whack it in
there even better go put it on the beach
watch the dolphins play while you do
your number twos and then if you are
inside you've also got a privacy screen
there you don't have to eyeball your
missus when you're sitting there oh look
at that
see this this is what the Kingsley camp
is all about I will just pull off of
that yeah so you're pretty much done
there you can relax or you set up your
outdoor kitchen which will show you how
to do now these catches go and up and
then pull out your barbecue and of
course the kitchen sink that's it nice
and easy so it's gonna be hot out here
about you but I'm gonna go and take
maybe I don't know catch the midday
movie in the air-conditioning let me add
myself a little bit of an afternoon nap
Oh time for me soaps there's nothing
like camping is there it's the ultimate
form of relaxation today we're taking
camping to a whole new level with one of
the most incredible inventions to hit
Ozzie campsites since the sleeping bag
this is a revolutionary err opus from
Purple Line what makes this so special
is the entire trailer just about sets
itself up the theme here is tough luxury
and you won't believe just how well it
lives up to its reputation this is what
makes the air ofus so special open up
the dual fold lid and then flick the
switch for the onboard air pump the 10
inflates itself using heavy-duty
internal air supports in places
traditional poles and there you have it
90 second set up and you won't even
break a sweat doing it
pack up just as easy - it's just a case
of undoing a couple of hours the tent is
the absolute latest ultra heavy-duty
triple layer air beam technology it's as
tough and able to hold air as the tires
on your vehicle
it'll only deflate when you release the
valves and pack up in the morning purple
light are definitely serious about
luxury inside the air opus features two
massive double beds with ultra
comfortable high-density foam mattresses
there's also this incredible lounge area
where you can eat and relax out of the
elements the lounge even transforms into
a third bed but it's not just luxurious
its proper tough luxury perfect for
heading off-road it features a full-size
chassis independent trailing arm
suspension with twin shock absorbers and
heaps of ground clearance for serious
approach and departure angles check this
kitchen out the four-burner stove slides
out in seconds and provides the perfect
workspace for bushmaster chef's you've
got huge amounts of storage throughout
from the box up front to the jerrycan
and spare tire holders and even twin 80
litres stainless steel water tanks plumb
through twin electric water pumps
delivering effortless water right to the
sink it really is nothing quite like the
air opus Purple Line invented the dual
fold
concept and I've made up more Aussie
than ever with the Erebus this thing
stylish incredibly comfortable tough as
nails and it's the easiest camper
trailer I've ever set up the air opus
defines the term top luxury</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
