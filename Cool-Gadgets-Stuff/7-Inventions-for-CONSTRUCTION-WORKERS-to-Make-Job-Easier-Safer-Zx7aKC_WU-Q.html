without pain for professionals who work
with heavy tools we wanted to take the
next step with something more mobile
made for smaller hand tools so we
created the EXO vest you put the vest on
like a backpack then strap in your arms
turn on the lift assist and you're ready
to go the extra vest uses Springs to
lift your arms with 5 to 15 pounds of
lift assistance per arm the kicker is
it's all mechanical no batteries no
cables and it weighs under 10 pounds so
you can wear it comfortably all day
the EXO vest is perfect for a variety of
overhead applications like manufacturing
overhead drilling laying pipe and
cutting and grinding EXO works is
sparking innovative change in the
industrial space providing power without
pain
we can't wait to see what you'll do with
it the rising cost of safety due to
on-the-job injuries is killing our
productivity and that's where the expo
works aerial system comes in with the
patented zero gravity arm the use of
heavy hand tools becomes almost
effortless by rendering them weightless
we decided to put the xo0g arm to the
test to see if it could save time and
money on the jobsite by getting the work
done faster and protecting the worker
from injury and strain we gave the
workers two identical drilling and
chipping tasks Duane will use
traditional methods while ed will be
assisted by the xo0g arm we will be
monitoring the heart rate time and
progress as both workers complete the
task
the results are impressive the xo0g
enabled worker finishes all the tasks
while the other worker becomes too
exhausted in the process with the
assistance of the 0g arm the worker
completes the task faster and with
significantly less effort and fatigue so
what if you could complete your heavy
hand tool tasks faster with better
accuracy and less injuries now you can
with the XO Works aerial mount system
we're always around heavy traffic and
heavy equipment so not being seen
there's a lot of stuff up here they can
get a guy hurt
90% of our work is to set it up to do it
safely so everybody can go home
we got traffic going by out here you
know we need to be visible to the
traffic and to other people
it's like being in a lit room
it's not like a guardian angel man
just because a job doesn't require a
hardhat doesn't mean head injury risks
don't exist
mechanics airline workers and in-home
service employees are often working in
tight quarters with nothing but a ball
cap or a few hair follicles between
their heads and potential bumps bruises
and seriously nasty cuts the new
scholars 89 45 universal bump cap insert
adds lightweight breathable head
protection to just about any cap or hat
just turn your cap over and place the
insert inside next fold back your cap
sweat band and tuck the insert behind it
until it's entirely behind the sweat
band then fold the sweat band back over
the insert and smooth out as needed you
can now put your trusty ball cap to work
protecting against on-the-job injuries
insert not fitting properly no problem
simply remove the insert from the cap
and starting at the rear slowly cut
along the recess line with a sharp
scissors then reinsert the shell and get
to work
for decades masons have created
impressive structures around the world
structures painstakingly erected with
meticulous and long-lasting foundations
from the company that brought you Sam
they are now revolutionising the way we
lift and place block materials
construction robotics introduces the
mule a new and innovative construction
tool designed specifically for the block
liang mason and the retaining wall
contractor the mule assists the
installer by eliminating the weight of
the block the mule does not self perform
it's an assisting not designed to
greatly reduce the stress factors
associated with the repetitive heavy
lifting while simultaneously increasing
productivity and finished quality
versatility is one of the mules key
factors it can be utilized from the
ground scaffold or mast climbing work
platforms with a 22 foot arm reach the
block can be pulled directly from the
shipping pallet to get rid of the pre
stock practice due to these benefits the
mule has proven to increase productivity
by over 400% all while removing the
fatigue and physical stressors
associated with the constant heavy
lifting here are some financial benefits
lower per block set costs equal lower
bid values equals more jobs one equals
more profits your savings on cost per
block set in many cases will allow for a
six-month or less return on investment
including the reduction of injuries and
workmen compensation claims the mule
allows more experienced block layers to
remain productive and healthy longer
into their careers
it enlists more interest in the younger
generation to enter the industry by
reducing the inherent fatigue while
utilizing the next evolution of
technology the mule is designed to bring
efficiency and comfort to a grueling
work environment the mule it does the
heavy lifting for you so you don't have
to
when your job requires frequent lifting
protection of your back is of utmost
importance

Triax technologies addresses
constructions unique safety challenges
with wearable sensors that collect and
transmit real-time workforce and safety
information on most job sites today
supervisors have no way of knowing when
or where a worker is injured or
experiences a safety incident spotter
the innovative wearable clip from Triax
detects slips trips and falls and sends
a real-time alert to site personnel
these automatic notifications tell you
who when where and what including
distance of fall resulting in faster
response to help reduce the risk of
compounding injuries what happens if a
worker has another type of injury or
identify as a hazard on site such as
loose scaffolding by triggering a push
button alert from their spot or clip
which acts as a direct lines of
supervisors workers can notify them when
and where there's a situation that needs
to be addressed and how do you
effectively and efficiently evacuate a
site in an emergency situation with
spotter supervisors can trigger an
evacuation alarm emitted by each workers
device and amplify that notification
with an audible and visual spotter
evac'd tag placed on each floor and near
each exit upon hearing and seeing the
alert workers are trained to evacuate to
the muster point and spotters dashboard
building view enables supervisors to
monitor evacuation progress and
real-time worker location
improved safety and more is possible
today with spotters connected jobsite
