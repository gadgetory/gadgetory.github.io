Kraft paper plastic bottles some
polyester in rubber and some steel but
what is inside the box
our bicycle
now let's a design innovation
engineering and ecology this is the
brainiest
bike in the world but is it real
yes it is introducing the new Goodman DC
one by green gold the most amazing
bicycle in the world mainly made of a
special super panel that we call GC
panel developed by wrinkled and made of
recycled paper the German user one is a
new kind of bike made of recycled and
reusable materials plus irons no more
the wheels are a special design using
our jist panel recycled plastic bottles
rubber and steel so they don't use earth
the vibration color and movement are
absorbed by all the components and these
make you feel as smooth right the vibe
is waterproof ingests also the painting
is ecological it is made of recycled
polyester and using the new urine jersey
one aside Julie experienced just think
it's the greenest and purest bike in the
world is not just a bike it's a German
GC one high kick started I'm bear
Baumgartner from B develop while working
on my bikes I realized that there's no
bike computer that meets my demands for
design and functionality this is why my
friends and I get down to work and
develop mosquito
mosquito is a precision watch for bike
lovers that combines best of all worlds
a classic design chronograph speedometer
and much more smart functions and all of
that packed into a beautiful watch Swiss
made of course
after three years of development and
planning the prototype of mosquito is
finally finished with a simple push of a
button you can switch from the time mode
which displays the current time to the
speed mode in the speed mode the second
hand indicates the current speed in real
time
the minute hand shows the total distance
covered in kilometers or miles the hour
hand maintains its function and displays
the current time and there's actually
one more nice thing in the speed mode
the small indicator that shows the date
in the time mode now displays the
average speed
apart from the time and speed mode the
mosquito watch has a third mode the
chrono mode like the other modes the
chrono mode can easily be activated by
the push of a button in the chrono mode
the hands of the watch indicate the
travel time in hours minutes and seconds
and that's not all the mosquito watch
also informs you about messages from
your smartphone you can choose if you
want to receive notifications for texts
emails calls whatsapp and Facebook
messages by simply selecting the
relevant options in the mosquito app the
young team at mosquito is a colorful mix
of designers engineers mechanics
computer scientists and graphic
designers all combined the passion for
cycling and the idea of mosquito
now we need you bring mosquito to life
plot your support and be one of the
first to on the most stylish speedometer
ever made
get your mosquito now
hi we want to use the next minutes to
show you our revolutionary and duro
mountain bike called skoura that's the
Latin word for joker just by the way we
are a team of bike enthusiasts and we
just love to think out of the box when
you take a look at our first experiments
and prototypes which we've started with
way back in 2009 you can see how the
scorer has developed from a homemade
baby hard tail to a wild teenage fully
finally reaching the state of a unique
food scale and dura mountain bike but
what makes the score so different from
other endures it is the idea of using an
entirely new front wheel suspension
which replaces the conventional
telescopic fork at its end of the
development potential we've invented
this revolutionary technology based on
the kinematics of a parallelogram and we
call it trail ever test results show
that the new system is up to 20% more
effective than the best Forks on the
market trail ever is so groundbreaking
that patents on it we're granted in the
USA China Japan and Europe when you look
into history you'll find out that old
rear suspension systems of motorcycles
were using telescopic forks just like
front suspensions of mountain bikes do
nowadays but as the technology
progressed Forks were replaced there
with more effective concepts like that
of a simple rear wheel swing arm by the
end of the 1950's this was then copied
for mountain bikes and reached the peak
of technological maturity in the two
most common rear suspension systems
based on the parallelogram technology
the four link suspension and the VPP so
with the scorer we now take the next
evolutionary step on the front wheel and
replace the telescopic fork with a much
more effective trail ever parallelogram
suspension and how does all that work
technically spoken the front wheel is
attached to the wheel carrier which is
fixated in three points by two lateral
levers and a swing arm
the levers are hinged with the two shaft
this design guarantees a way higher
stability a more precise guide way and
way less of mechanical load on the stem
because the shock forces are also
discharged over the swingarm by placing
the shocks head-to-head in the center of
the frame we achieve a maximum
instability and shock absorption while
lowering the structural load of the
frame the Skua also offers a variable
frame geometry where different setups
for a neutral uphill or downhill
position can be chosen in an easy way
last year we revolutionized bike pedal
technology by launching the Fort Knox
magnetic bike pedals now we have created
the vault pedals making your favorite
mag wok technology into a lighter
smaller less expensive sleek design it
is designed to be used in any
circumstance whether hitting jumps on
your favorite downhill trail or cruising
around town the included shoe clips are
compatible with standard bike shoes you
can customize how strong you want to be
connected by adding or removing magnets
the flat design of the mag lock pedals
allows them to be used with street shoes
for a leisurely cruise around town with
friends there is no awkward clip or
Tooting from the pedals this makes them
the only truly clipless pedals
these pedals are for all levels of
riders they are also for all styles of
bike commuting downhill bat bikes and
Giro bike packing and even mountain
unicycles the magnets are surprisingly
strong with 30 pounds of attractive
force to keep your bike firmly attached
to your feet when jumping for those who
are hesitant to be clipped into their
pedals worry no longer getting out is
easy by peeling or pushing your foot off
to the side it easily unclips if you
wreck your feet naturally come out it's
just as easy to clip back in just hover
the shoe clip over the pedal and the
magnets will draw it right in the Maglev
bike pedal is the only clipping pedal
that has an infinite float no matter how
far you twist your foot to the side it
won't
unclip everything in cycling is an
evolution an evolution of the body and
evolution of riding styles and an
evolution of the gear we've worked in
multiple facets of the cycling industry
for more than 20 years as racers and
recreational riders we've written
thousands of miles we've never found a
saddlebag line which we were satisfied
with many are too big for just the bare
essentials others are too small and
don't attach securely that frustration
is what motivated us to recreate the
saddle pack from the ground up building
upon the success and strengths of our
original game changing seats leave
compression pack speed sleep introduces
the next generation and what we believe
is the best solution for carrying
essentials on your bicycle
the speed sleeve ranger the speed sleeve
ranger is designed to keep your gear
organized and inventoried in a
completely enclosed water-resistant
package the speed sleeve Ranger will
comfortably hold two Road tubes one
cyclocross tube for one mountain bike
tube there's a spot for two 18 to 20
grams co2 cartridges two tyre levers and
a multi-tool that all fit into their own
compartments which completely eliminates
any rattling or movement and with a
narrow profile quick mount velcro straps
that easily attach around the saddle
rails the speed sleeve Ranger stays
securely in place out of the way and
clear of your efforts but always there
when you need it
mountain cross road without a doubt the
speed sleeve Ranger is the next level
riding essential that combines evolve
form and at the ready function to help
you be the most prepared for your next
adventure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
