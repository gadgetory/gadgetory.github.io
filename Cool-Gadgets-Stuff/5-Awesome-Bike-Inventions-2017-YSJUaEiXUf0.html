cat know how deep the startup is now
usually about 3/8 of an inch
next we need to drive the startup either
using a hammer and a soft punch so it
doesn't get damaged
now you need to measure how to keep the
start out it should be about 5 inches
install the STS
you're the shape to get both started
and result
allen wrench should be able to reach

things can be stored in MSDS here are a
few examples it's perfect for storing

bicycles have been around and in San
Francisco since turn-of-the-century
clock in 1890 and I think the the modern
story of bicycle design in cities is
just started it's tough to be a bicycle
in the city and it's tough to be a
commuter and here at mission bicycle
we're working to make clean and elegant
solutions so what we're doing now is
adding two new big features integrated
lighting and GPS tracking so the main
goal is to have this just seamlessly
integrate into the lives of the people
riding them so we are bin commuters we
ride our bikes in cities so they're
designed by urban commuters for years
we've been told by manufacturers and
engineers that some of these things
aren't possible and that's usually an
indicator that we're headed in the right
direction but we decided we're going to
do it we've put our minds to it and we
just don't give up you know when we take
something on like the electronics we do
it right and we do it in an integrated
way that doesn't you know doesn't have
extra flourishes or gimmicks or anything
like that it's there to serve a purpose
we've taken the best bicycle and we're
making it better
having GPS integrated into your bike to
me it's just peace of mind this device
has one function in mind let's say the
unthinkable happens I go to where I last
saw my bike and it's not there panic
sets in I pull out my phone I launch the
app and then a half a second I can see
exactly where my bike is so we've always
considered safety and security to be an
unsolved problem and exciting for us to
be the ones that finally integrate you
know lighting security into the best
commuter bike available LED lighting
that's low power and very bright and
looks amazing and can be integrated into
the frame of a bicycle and recharged
that's a new thing
the way that our four lights are
crossing each other they throw is spread
outwards and so you're visible from the
side and it gives you more of a presence
on the road mission bicycle our whole
philosophy is it has to be easy has to
work every time
you don't have to think about it so
OneTouch turns on all the lights front
and rear we've made a highly customized
battery that you don't have to think
about your commuting back and forth to
work you don't want to carry another
charger another thing to worry about
something to lose so we and it created a
charger means the battery itself so your
battery's low you just remove it from
the head tube charge it up using a USB
cable pop it back in
