remember the smart belt 1.0 from last
year when we broke all crowdfunding
records and became the most funded
fashion accessory in history we are back
with the smart belt 2.0 you might wonder
what on earth is there to innovate on a
belt or what the craze could be about
we've innovated not one but a couple of
things firstly we replace the five whole
system with an infinitely adjustable 32
step track system a perfectly
comfortable fit regardless of how your
waist changes during the day and it sure
does a regular belt has five holes one
inch apart our track system has 32 steps
1/5 of an inch apart that's 500 percent
more adjustability and twice the
adjustment range imagine having a big
meal and not having to feel tight by
just clicking your belt instead of going
one hole up and having to hold your
pants up in your hands ever on any time
make your jeans feel like Roxy
take some pressure off just how much you
need to during a long meeting or
whenever our backers say they never knew
their old belt was so uncomfortable
until they got to where the smartphone
one of the problem we solved is wear and
tear our staple innovation is adding a
Kevlar core to our leather belt cattle
are is renowned for being bulletproof it
makes our belt soft and light but
indestructible it makes it last in
download
it's not bulletproof just incredibly
resilient during stress tests we scored
five times higher than the second-best
our belt will outlast anything out there
we've also sourced the best leather we
use thick vegetable tanned leather
sourced from a small family-owned
tannery in Tuscany Italy completely
eco-friendly resilient and traditionally
ton it's the most exclusive leather
anywhere in the world not to mention
exquisite and elegant in any context it
will come with a serial number
certificate of authenticity and a new
scratch resistant coating we have also
eliminated sizes by letting you cut your
belt to your own exact size so no wrong
sizes or in-betweens
you can even give it as a present
without getting it wrong just measure
cut and attach meet Eva the world's
first stickable camera that fits on your
phone so you always have it when you
need it the back of the camera is made
with a micro suction tape which means
you can stick it and stick it and stick
it to just about anything Evo syncs with
your phone using an internal Wi-Fi chip
bring you to step out from behind the
lens and capture stunning 1080p video
from just about any angle at only six
millimeters then Evo slides seamlessly
into a custom-designed phone case which
means it goes into your pocket and onto
your next adventure without you even
thinking about it
say hello to the hands-free selfie and
with our fully integrated app you can
upload your memories with the click of a
button onto social media where your
friends and family can follow along but
if that's not fast enough you can go
straight to livestream in HD and if you
have more than one Evo you can even link
them together to score the perfect shot
from every perspective
how do you carry the small stuff
and what small things would you carry if
it was easier to carry them more
importantly what problems could you
solve if you were prepared with a few
key items
we're lever gear we designed tools that
are easy to carry multifunctional and
built to last so you can get stuff done
so when we set out to design a tool to
carry small things there was no way we
were settling for an ordinary pillbox
introducing the clip system a series of
tough versatile tools designed to clip
easily on your keychain and fit great in
your hand first up is the bit fault
a micro carry case that's far from
ordinary pockets and bags aren't
designed to carry small items they get
lost dirty or even destroyed existing
keychain pill boxes are almost always
cylinders we get it they're easy to make
and cheap to produce but they don't fit
well with your keys and they're either
too small to hold anything or too big to
carry around our first insight was to
flatten the canister so it messes on
your keychain but still has the internal
space to carry a wide range of small
objects the cat mounted tray helps you
access and organize your items dual
magnetic hex bit sockets transform the
bit vault into a small yet powerful
screwdriver just carry the bits you need
and you're always ready the custom
gasket seals the bit vault tight and
quick release clips lock the lid in
place the bit light maintains all of the
functionality of the pitfall but adds a
bright rechargeable flashlight it's
perfect for quick access to light when
you need it most
there are three brightness levels for
when you need a lot of light or just a
little it recharges with any USB source
so you never need to buy batteries as we
develop the clip system we quickly
realize that we didn't want it
permanently attached to our keychain so
we added a carabiner style clip for easy
attachment the screw on belt clip
provides quick access to your tools
and doubles as a key hook or a third
hand we design the container but you
make it the product you want whether
you're a cyclist and need a few bits for
a long bike ride or you're heading out
on a first date or maybe you just want
to be prepared for whatever the day may
throw at you carry what you need and
leave the rest at home just clip it and
you're ready for your next adventure

the reverence is a method of converting
your conventional bike into electric
bike without changing the aesthetics of
the bike you like having the reverence
is like having a tailwind
rather than having a headwind at all
times and it's just good fun people
always come back with a big smile on
their faces once they've given it a try
we believe a simple design is a good
design it's activated only by the pedals
there's nothing on the handlebars
Revels takes care of itself and helps
you when you need help and switch to
yourself off when you don't need is his
assistance if you're going down a hill
for instance or if you stop pedaling
then Reynolds just stops so it's really
easy to use so the way it works you say
have the main drive unit battery and a
sensor you have a roller that grips on
to the wheel and through that you could
transfer the power into the tire and
then into the road this system weighs
between 1 to 2 kilograms and it provides
20 50 watts and so essentially by adding
2 kilograms you double your output or
power reversal fits the majority bikes
will fit to double triangle
diamond-shaped
frames and work best with smooth tires
or just normal commuter tires you can
ride it cold with the hot weather dry
wet rain or snow the battery has a USB
charger so if you wish to charge your
phone you can do so we offer two
batteries one is for your everyday trips
and the second one for slightly longer
trips the smaller one is 100 watt hours
and a larger one is 209 waters</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
