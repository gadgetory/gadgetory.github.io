our versatile Allroad model
convinced a few dozen of tall people
last year and back with the 36-inch rows
and a 36 inch mountain bikers I wanted
to introduce these new versions for the
tool cyclists who want more speed on
asphalt or get rad on dirt the 36 bikes
brings better ergonomics and specific
geometry that allows us to land very
tall riders to enjoy perfectly stable
and balanced bike since regular bikes
are made for shorter and lighter riders
they use skinny tubing short crank arms
or wors regular rim brakes the road 36
version offers you the perfect fast bike
for rides on asshole light fast but
comfortable you will appreciate this
efficient but for our drawbars are
higher up than any other Road by
offering a more neutral and more upright
riding position resulting in less back
neck or wrist pain the mountain bike
version brings a strong frame with
specific trail geometry we developed a
super beefy inverted fork with MRP
Colorado that offers 100 millimeter of
travel the 36 or 36 inch wheels mountain
bike is the ultimate off-road machine
the 36 inch mountain bike and rode bikes
deserves to be enjoyed by the whole
