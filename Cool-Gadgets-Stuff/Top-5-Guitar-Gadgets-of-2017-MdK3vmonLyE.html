or stones acoustic or electric guitars
you know there are some things that just
won't fit or will they
imagine a digital guitar that is much
like your standard ax but due to the
expanding neck provides the sound range
of a full-size 6 stringer in a teeny
tiny body that's jammy
you'll take it anywhere your journey
takes you in the places your ordinary
guitar just won't ever squeeze
Jamie will get you into the zone
wherever you are
no smartphone or tablet needed you're
free to fiddle around discreetly using
your earphone port block Jami directly
into an amp and strum it out loud
now you're jamming band can follow you
in the glove compartment launch Jamie's
mobile app pick the jamming mode select
your genre and get an ass-kicking full
band backing to Jen along with
a range of notes you may improvise in is
shown on your phone and can also be
marked by the LED indicators on your
jammies fretboard just combine any given
notes from this set and you'll always
sound cool mind blowing but there is yet
another hot feature the songs mode is
like a modern age karaoke for guitarists
which helps you play your favorite songs
let's top it off with a fistful of
onboard guitar sounds
what would you rather do cramp your
backseat with a bunch of axes or have
them all in one jammie to save some
space who knows what you could use it
for down the road
hey my name is John Lange Berg creator
of guitar Joe the product that makes
your guitar sound like a banjo I live in
a small town in Massachusetts that
you've never heard of with my high
school sweetheart and now wife Katie and
I run a small website design and
branding firm but really my passion has
always been music so I started my very
first band in junior high all we played
was metal wood so banjo was completely
outside of my sphere of influence fast
forward to when Mumford &amp;amp; Sons first
came out that's really when banjo
started to grow on me
and in the fall of 2014 I was asked to
play guitar for the church band for a
music night they were having there's one
song in particular in the lineup that
had a Mumford II sound to it so I
thought this could use a banjo it had
the time or money to buy and learn how
to play a banjo so I thought maybe I
could make my guitar sound like one so I
tried searching for guitar pedals but I
couldn't find anything and then I tried
creating my own effects patches and I
soon found that I just couldn't get the
sound I wanted digitally so I learned
that applying a fabric to the strings
actually gave it a really 20 banjo sound
I drew up some plans I went to my
uncle's workshop and I created the very
first guitar Joe sophisticated right so
it worked well but I felt it needed
refinement the first step in the
refinement process was to make it look
better
so I tried out aluminum and that's about
the time where I met Mike Mike's fresh
perspective on guitar Joe really helped
us to propel the design and try out all
these different things with the
resources Mike had we were able to
really innovate I wanted to give more
control so we made a design that had
three individual dampening zones to give
it a lower profile we tried going under
the strings but due to the limited space
we weren't able to get the level of
control
so our final design was over the strings
lightweight and has individual control
for each string here's how guitar Joe
works you place it on the body of the
guitar line it up with the strings
adjust the dampening pads and then
you're ready to pluck away
this is fret zealot fret shallot is a
state-of-the-art led addition to your
guitar it fits just above the frets and
shows you exactly where to put your
fingers to play anything you can imagine
let's take a look at how learning to
play guitar usually turns out you head
to your local music store and pick out a
guitar it's beautiful you loved it and
you couldn't be more excited to get
started you get home and immediately try
to play something you're prepared you
have your books tablature online videos
websites everything or so it seems after
hours of dedicated attention the
frustration sets in you've done
everything right what's wrong the
problem is simple human nature you
naturally want to be shown exactly what
to do so that's what we did
add a fret sell it to your guitar and it
shows you exactly where to put your
fingers so all you have to do is strum
or pick it cannot be any simpler use the
smartphone app to select what you'd like
to play and you're instantly ready to
rock
you can display chords notes scales and
any key and of course any light show you
can imagine for those fun times or use
AI mode to have the next finger location
displayed automatically after you've
strung led technology has only recently
progressed enough to make frets l it
possible fret zealot is only half the
height of your guitars frets that means
there will be absolutely no interference
with the strings or your hand
you play fret zealot was engineered with
musicians in mind
you picked the playing style and fret
cell it teaches you the connections
between each fret are on the top side of
the guitar where your hand doesn't slide

playing techniques the sleek coding

I created the jam stack because I felt
like the process of playing the electric
guitar was holding me back there were
things I just couldn't do easily from
playing wherever I wanted to to getting
going with effects and recording right
when I felt inspired four years ago I
set out on a journey to create a more
compelling guitar playing experience
well our team has done it and now we're
ready to bring it to you meet the jam
stack the world's first attachable
guitar amp and also the first integrates
seamlessly with your smartphone our
priorities were to create the best
all-around guitar playing experience
possible prioritizing the absolute best
tone at practice volumes and complete
and total portability the jam stack
allows you to play the electric guitar
anywhere by leveraging the awesome power
of your smart phone and super
lightweight speaker technology in the
past acoustic instruments were the
ultimate and portability being the only
real option for travel or playing
outside the jam stacks 10 watts of power
easily outperforms acoustic guitars and
hand drops so you can be a unique part
to any outdoor jam session in fact your
guitar and your amplifier can fit easily
in the same case as well as being
uncompromising the portable it's also
the fastest way to play the electric
guitar with layered effects at any price
point James Tague snaps on to the back
of any standard electric guitar body
using the existing strap button unless
you have something like a Flying V the
jam stack can be attached with one hand
in under three seconds we design the jam
stack to work with all major smartphones
including iOS Android and Windows phones
as well as the iPod touch we have the
opportunity to free the electric guitar
and bring it out into the world in a way
that has never been possible before we
just need your help to make it a reality
let me tell you more about how the jam
stack works and why it'll be your new
favorite way to play the electric
the signal from your pickups travels
through the output jack on your guitar
and gets delivered to your phone through
the headphone jack or lightning adapter
for the iPhone 7 that signal gets
modified by your smartphone travels back
down that same cable and gets amplified
by the amp because of this signal
management system the jam stack really
excels at allowing you to play with
vacuum tracks or drum beats with no
fooling around with levels the
traditional guitar amplifiers aren't
designed to handle multiple frequencies
at once and the backing track will drop
out of the mix when you start to play
we've carefully selected our driver so
that when you play it sounds like you're
right inside the song playing alongside
your favorite musicians whether that's
your friends or your heroes with
fantastic applications like AmpliTube
and amp kit you can bring a song right
in off your smartphone or iPod touch
access practically any effect choose
from dozens of amp models and because
your phone is right there on your guitar
body setting up loops on the fly
performing with sequence samples
recording and sharing music feels
effortless and is also completely
portable the design team at Jam stack
went a step further with our phone mount
allowing you to relocate your phone in
seconds to a new position this allows
you to watch incredible lessons
delivered to you by use ition while
hearing a clean bypass tone coming from
your jam stack the potential for the jam
stack in the classroom is something
we're also very excited about the fact
is the easier it is to set up the more
you're gonna play the more you play the
better you're gonna get as simple as
that
play lot of guitar no problem
the James Tague can keep you going for
eight hours on a single charge all of
the contact surfaces on the jam stack
have been lined with a super soft
polymer at less than 900 grams it's less
than the weight difference between a
Fender Stratocaster and it Gibson Les
Paul so you probably won't even notice
it's there I created the jam stack
because being an electric guitar player
was part of who I was
now I'm thrilled I can carry that with
me anywhere</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
