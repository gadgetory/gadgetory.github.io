be one of the most sought-after
transportation innovations you've seen
them and the funny videos that go along
with them most folks have one and it
felt the pain of learning how to use it
the bruises proof hoverboards do not
come with a safe mode
well we solved that problem and made
hoverboards safe and usable for people
of all ages the patent-pending hover

associated with hoverboards hover bike

ten inch wheelbase can handle up to 220
pounds the hover bike is easy to store
built for fun convenient and essential
a couple of years ago I set out to
change the rate at the world beats back
to use science and technology to deliver
an endless hot water more quickly and
more efficient not only didn't save time
and money but also help conserve the
Earth's precious natural resources and
we did tell the heat works model work
today I'm going to show you the most
energy-efficient water efficient
reliable tankless electric one that's me
in 2014 presenting our prototype on
Kickstarter campaign was incredibly
successful and allowed us to bring our
revolutionary technology of the people
we've grown up over the last couple of
years so is our water heating technology
the help and support of our Kickstarter
backers and early customers learned some
very valuable lessons on what work what
we could make better in our products so
today we're introducing the new heat
works and our flagship product the model
3 water as we develop this product
started the grower company we decided to
focus on three areas really define why
we're good
purity precision and performance let's
talk about purity through traditional
water either use heating elements at
rest and cause mineral building just
think you and your family are bathing in
cooking with and washing your clothes in
this water the model 3 is different it
has no coils or traditional heating
elements eliminating all the sources of
corrosion and scaling seen in
traditional water instead our tankless
water heater is powered by a patented
ohmic array technology which means we
use a naturally occurring mineral found
in water to heat water instantly and
onto me now let's talk precision model
free offers exact temperature control
and it's 99% energy efficient so you'll
actually lower your energy costs but we
didn't stop there the model 3 is
internet connection provide lots of
useful data through our mobile app of
course we think data is cool we're nerds
at heart but it turns out that knowing
about your daily water and energy use
water heating costs and water quality
can have big impact on your daily
routine as you learn more about how you
and your family interact with hot water
you will start to see trends and can
make positive change which brings me to
perform we've taken the hot water engine
model 1 supercharged now it's pretty
good small enough to fit anywhere in
your home yet rugged of your life no
more waiting for hot water
no more morning showers kutsher the
model three requires no maintenance fact
we offer six year full unit exchange
warranty which is unheard of for the
image so you can see why we're so
excited
purity precision performance model three
truly offers the most superior way to
evil since kick started with so
instrumental in our initial launch we're
back here today to offer the he works
model three to you first so you can
truly know what it's like to love your
wedding
a smartphone says 50 in the palm of your
hand this is jelly the world's smallest
4G smartphone it's hard to imagine a
world without smartphones but with
performance also the sizes were
increasing and sometimes just wish to
have a smaller phone so we developed
jelly bringing you all the convenience
and performance of other smart phones
packed in a case as small and portable
as positive
jellyfish into any party without
compromising on features it is the
perfect phone for travel or outdoor
sports or simply great as a backup song
with a dual SIM card slots you can
easily manage work and personal cost by
taking advantage of the powerful Android
nougat system you can get the ultimate
user experience on takut Texas watching
videos tracking sport trails and using
your favorite apps jelly has few cameras
ready to capture any moment or even
taking perfect selfie the battery is
replaceable and fully charged lasts up
to three days working time or seven days
standby time our goal was to design a
great mini sized smartphone that is
smaller and lighter than anything on the
market but also supports 4G network we
focus on so many details for a maximum
performance while also going through
many design and testing stages just to
ensure that jelly is reliable and looks
awesome for everyone in order to get
jelly alive we need your support please
join us and let's make jelly become real
ready for the next revolution and 3d
storytelling
introducing Syd Syd delivers the most
stable 3d experience ever compared to
any other 3d video cameras today we have
researched and tested other 3d cameras
and most of them promise stability in
shooting but can't deliver Syd is
portable for photographers lightweight
for adventurers and convenient for
content creators that lack of stability
creates a lot of givingness and is no
fun for VR headsets
Syd promises stability making the
experience that more immersive whence it
is combined with a smartphone and a
gimbal users can see the real-time image
and control the camera through the app
on their phone making the experience
convenient much more stable and even
