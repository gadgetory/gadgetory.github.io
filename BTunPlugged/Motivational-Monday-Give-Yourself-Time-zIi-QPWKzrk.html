another motivational Monday today I'm
going to talk to you guys about giving
yourself some time for that dream that
goal your aspirations of skill whatever
it may be that you're trying to
accomplish now a lot of the times we say
okay we're time limited skill so within
two weeks three weeks a month two months
a year we should have it right we should
have it down and we should have it
everything just the way we want it but
we often fall short of that we beat
ourselves up and then we stopped the
skill or stop the activity but I learned
this cool technique this past week and I
really applied it to making these videos
almost and that is just tell yourself
look I'm going to give myself five years
to accomplish this to become great at
making videos the weight just felt like
it lifted off my shoulders it didn't
feel like I had to be great right now
just have to just continue to progress
and become better at my craft so with
you guys to give yourself some time you
know even back when I was in school I
would try to study to three weeks ahead
of time for test so after every week I
would go and I was review all the
material for the week and pretend like I
had a test so it's like giving myself
that time allowed me to be less stressed
to allow life to happen and to unfold
naturally instead of trying to make it
happen on my time now it's great to have
ambitious goals and the set high
standards for yourself that's great but
with those high standards also be
resource some time to accomplish them
you see how that works so try this out
this week try this technique and let me
know how it goes guys thank you guys for
watching and I will see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
