with another review today we have a
comparison between the v-moda crossfade
wireless and the beats solo 3 Wireless
now these are both in the same price
range they're both $2.99 so I figured I
give a shootout between the two because
people might be deciding between the two
headphones so without further ado let's
get into this review now you know me I
love to start with the comfort the
design because when there's a lot of
comfort you can listen to these for a
longer period of time which means more
enjoyment if you start fiddling around
with the placement and stuff like that
it just becomes annoying and thus not
worth it you don't want to listen to
them even if they do have good sound
right so that's my whole reasoning
behind that so with that being said I
will say that the V motors win in this
instance they are around the ear
headphone versus the on ear of the beats
solo threes now the beats solo 3s are
actually pretty comfortable I didn't
notice any discomfort after maybe 2
hours but after that I started to feel
it the pressure on my head so that if
you can deal with that pressure on your
head the B solo threes you won't have a
real problem but around the ear these do
create pressure around your ears but
it's really nice and they isolate really
well on the V motives that's something
to consider
on long distance flights might be
something to take into consideration
I did notice at the gym that both were
very comfortable these the V motives
were a little bit more comfortable for
me personally I tended to forget about
them more often than I did the beat so
low threes I had to reposition the knees
a lot so if you're trying to use these
for the gym I would go to the V motifs
one thing you want to take into
consideration when you look for a gym
headphone like over the air on your big
headphones is how closely stick to your
head are they gonna be sticking out so
when you put these on you see they're
very like close to my head
the band is closed everything's slim
profile
so when you're doing lifts or like
pull-ups or anything like that there's
not gonna be any of that discomfort
there's not gonna be you're not gonna be
able to knock it off your head so I've
had like sonyae's in the bows I've tried
them in the gym and I would knock them
around because it would stick out so far
now
with the pressure comes isolation and
these do put a lot of pressure in your
head not as much as other reviewers set
they were gonna be I was expecting to be
like clamps on my head this that wasn't
the case they were actually pretty
comfortable and the leather on these are
really nice they're just yet to be seen
how they hold up over time but they've
seemed very premium so let's talk about
the design more on these headphones now
these have a band that will not break so
as you can see it's like this watching
myself bidding these watch it snaps
while we're on camera that would be
pretty embarrassing Oh
anyways and so we have the beats which
I'm not gonna do that because they have
one plastic band so if you're somebody
that throws these into a gym bag or
seeing people bend down with these
around their neck at the airport look up
and they're broken so that's something
you want to take into consideration how
much are you able to baby these if these
are just for home listening you won't
have a problem with the design if these
are for something for travel you're
gonna be on the bow your rough with your
stuff you don't want these you want to
go with these because your investment
will last longer they have really nice
metal bands right here which really
really they just it feels like you have
a piece of metal right here if it feels
premium it feels heavy it feels nice it
feels good they're not super heavy but
it feels really nice the one thing that
the beats solo threes do better than the
V motifs is the button controls now they
have a little stealthy design that I
really like where you this these are the
buttons this is the UP button this is a
down and this is the press play pause
fast-forward backwards button so it's
really really nice it's it's you
wouldn't even tell like I had people ask
me after my last review like where is
the button on these because they're
there it's built into the headphone
it's really cool with these I felt I had
a lot of trouble trying to navigate the
up/down press PLAY because it's going
this way usually they when you have
headphones they're going up and down
some kind of way so it was really weird
to feel like okay I'm going back forward
back and then the middle button is the
press play so that was a little weird
and I didn't like the power button I
don't know why I just don't like this
power button it just feels weird and out
of place I like the feel of these they
feel very premium these feel cheap on
the other hand like I said in my review
of the beast solo 3 is the the ear cups
are the best part of these headphones
they kind of cut corners on everything
else what are you gonna do so in the
comfort and the design I have to go with
the B motifs next up let's talk about
the sound I'm gonna give you guys the
pros and cons of each headphone and tell
you guys which ones will go best with
what John Roos and which ones I prefer
now first let's start with the beats
solo threes these are of course are
gonna be bass heavy headphones we all
know that they do bass or really really
well in fact two well they're a little
over the top which kind of leads into a
lot of blanketing which is like the bass
takes over the rest of the sounds the
treble the mids all that good stuff so
with the beats solo threes they have
cleaned up their act the mids sound
really good the vocals I was very
impressed so these go great with genres
like pop rap EDM trade you listen to a
lot of vocals I would say these are
actually better than the V motifs in
that case but the base is very bloated
of such focus on the low-end there's not
much trouble there's not much highs so
things like Rock suffer on these I
didn't have a great experience with them
I could pass on them so these have a
warmer sound signature as well so they
sound very fun they sound very warm
that's the best way to say it it's like
drinking a cup of hot chocolate with
marshmallows it's just very brings out
emotion so let's move on to the B
motives and what they do really well
they do base better than the beads I
would say this is near-perfect base so
for all your base heads out there these
are the ones that you want to get they
have this Rumble to them that almost
like it impacts you powerfully that's
the best way to put it like I felt like
the thump was there and I felt very good
about it it just feels very satisfying
it's a satisfying bass but I did find
that the mids are kind of laid-back so
vocals let's say a song is like there's
a rapper you know and they cut the beat
and he's just rapping it's kind of
overwhelming and then when that bass
comes back and hits then you get that
very like emotional like impact with
these I felt the vocals were so
laid-back that when though those points
and songs were happening the breaks it
it just didn't make a big impact on me
but the song all the way throughout was
great it's a great listening experience
these have better highs so if you're
definitely in the rock these are the
ones that you want to get if not if you
listen to hip-hop EDM trance jazz these
are also great as well it's a great
listening experience and the bass is
very very rich and thumping so next
let's talk about the battery life now I
tested these and the battery is very
lackluster on the B motives I will tell
you guys that it's 12 hours of battery
life and I think I got a little less
than that maybe like 10 hours at full
volume so it's very borderline if you do
if you're going on a long trip I
wouldn't recommend the B motives but if
you're just for home listening or for
the jamming you don't mind charging them
you always have access to a charger then
B motors are gonna be fine you kind of
give up the battery life for the
listening experience with the beats of
course they have that new w1 chip and I
think boasts 40 hours of playback time
which is incredible actually got more
than that actually got about 42 hours of
playback with loud sound that is
incredible so in the battery department
beets has VMO
beat haha so next up let's talk about
the connectivity now I did notice in the
gym I lost connection with the V Motors
once now these have the same bluetooth
capabilities but the beats have of
course the W on chip and that
strengthens the connection with your
device and that I think is worth its
weight in gold so somebody at my comment
said that the w1 chip is Apple's version
of NFC and with better battery life and
I will say whether he was trolling or
not he's right that is exactly what this
is but with the w1 chip it strengthens
the connection a little bit more and it
gives you a more solid connection so if
you're in a crowded place or a crowded
area like a Starbucks if you're gonna be
studying there or if you're gonna be
doing work at Starbucks or in a public
place a public library that might be an
issue if you have the V motors and
that's where we're a polite get your
money is that in these situations where
you're gonna be out and about out in the
world showing off these pretty
headphones that that people are going to
be around you with Bluetooth as well
they're gonna have phones and things
like that and it's gonna get in the way
of your connection so the W one chip
kind of fixes that problem so with
connectivity of course with the W on
chip this round has to go to the beats
so all in all the winner I have to say
is V motaz and I will say this again
comfort and sound is king comfort and
sound is king it always has and it
always will be when it comes to
headphones you can have the best
connectivity you can have the best looks
but when it comes down to it you want
that sound the headphones are made for
sound and that's what comes first and
after sound you want to have that come
to listen to that amazing sound for a
longer period of time and the on ear
design especially coupled with this
plastic headband this will really give
you a lot of leeway for for comfort you
know and I feel like with for you guys
your money is gonna be more wisely
invested in the V motives because of the
build quality as well they're not gonna
break on you
you can throw these in your bag no
problem in two-story like I said with
the case storage from Apple like a
neoprene bag with no hardshell
protecting $300 worth of headphones is
not happening you could sit on them and
they're a goner with these they even
included a hardshell case so for value
the V motifs are just such a better
value the the the sound is better the
comfort is better the design is better
and you will not be disappointed so
thank you guys for spending your time
and watching this video I hope I've
answered a lot of questions and maybe
pointed some of you in the right
direction I know a lot of you guys were
asking about the V motives and the on
the beats 3 review so go buy these I'll
see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
