one sales going to post every day so day
number one the most common question I
get asked what protein do you tape what
do I buy buy this my protein all
the flavors tastes amazing it tastes
good and water and it tastes even better
in milk and no they're not paying me to
save this it doesn't make me feel
bloated it works I've seen a beginning
shredding on the shredding on this stuff
I take one scoop right when i get home
after my workout which i'm about to have
after i finish this video and then they
have one right before i go to bed and
this is just for recovery you guys
already know what it is you need this
help me get my daily protein requirement
i take water with this i have milk on
the weekends when I have one have a
cheat meal and just keep it simple this
stuff works it's really cheap too i got
this five and a half pound bag for about
$22 so i think on it's on sale right now
for nineteen dollars so go check it out
the stats on it are 90 calories two
grams of fat two grams of carbohydrates
and 15 grams of protein so i take about
a scoop of this twice I try not to
overdo it i know some people like to do
like two scoops of protein like at a
time but I feel like I get really
bloated when that happens and I feel
like you know your body can't isn't made
to be taken all just all the ones so I
like to spread it out have it I have two
scoops on the night one right when i get
home and then one later on so i don't
feel that below so check it out try it
out it's pretty bomb so it is what it
tastes let's get it day two tomorrow one
more thing before i go i have about four
of these right after our workout and for
right before my workout good clean fast
cars

cakes if you can't see that and yeah I
really like it tastes good it kills my
sweet tooth too and as each cake is
about 50 calories five grams of whole
wheat so check that out two keys right</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
