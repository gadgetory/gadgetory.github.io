I finished up my workout did legs feel
pretty good so recently I've been
feeling like really sick at the gym I
think it's because I've been doing carps
like me for so long and my body fat is
so low right now that I just need a
couple days of carbs which I'm doing I
had red beans and rice today and I think
I said that earlier and had a bunch of
candy so just trying to get myself back
to normal and feeling right again so I
can go back to carb cycling so you know
there's time to listen to your body
ain't that right Bella got listen to
your body huh you gotta listen to your
body see what feels right what feels
good for you and do you you know like if
the diet's not working or if you feel
like you don't feel good on a day i do
the diet you know find what feels good
you know and do that so with that being
said I'm going to cut the video today
