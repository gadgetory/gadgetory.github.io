with another motivational Q&amp;amp;A today I
want to talk to you guys about change
now this past we got I really felt like
you know I've had to change who I am and
I I I noticed certain things that I'm
changing on and I told my friend I was
like you know am i changing for the
worse
am I am I losing my character you know
that I've had for so long has this nice
guy that just accepts everything that
everybody does and in turn now I'm
realizing like look I have to kind of
have standards in my life for not only
myself people around me and there's no
offense to them but this is my life now
and I have to have new standards I have
to carry myself a certain way and I just
wonder like is that does that make me a
bad person it just brings me back to the
point of change is not bad change is a
good thing you are changing your
character becoming somebody new
sometimes you have to do things that you
don't normally do in order to get to
where you need to go doesn't mean you're
a bad person who kind of people out or
for you know choosing new friends or new
connections it has nothing to do with
that it just has everything to do with
who you're becoming and the more you
know
you want the less you'll put up with a
lot of the crap that you always put up
with over your whole life really look at
how you're changing do you still hold
the same values as your friends your
family even do you still hold those same
values maybe they're changing and maybe
it's time for you to just realize that
it's changing and doesn't make you're
bad person but maybe you're trying to
let go of the old and bring in the new
because that's the only way that your
life is going to change honestly you are
a composition under the five people
around you your closest five people so
if you're not where you are in lies get
around people that are doing what you
want to do that are succeeding a lot and
that hold those characteristics then you
want to have because that's how you're
going to get to where you need to go so
this week try it out take stock of who
you're actually hanging out with are
they doing the same things that you want
to be doing are they do they hold the
same characteristics that you admire or
are they just your friend because
frankly they're just been you start
taking stock of us and really think
about how this is affecting you maybe
what's holding you back is the people
around you the companies heat so take
this advice this week guys and really
run with it
and really take it to heart doesn't make
you a bad person just makes you more on
just put this in line
alright guys so thank you guys for
watching and I will see you guys the
next video
