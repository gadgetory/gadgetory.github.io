those weeks where I just don't feel like
going to the gym my motivation is down
you know I've been eating whatever I
want I think a main part of it is my
kitchen isn't done so I can't cook
anything I haven't add eggs and maybe
like a month and a half and you know
it's kind of getting in the way I'm
having to eat out a lot and I just don't
feel like what I'm doing at the gym is
correlating to is being supplemented by
the food that I meeting I feel like I'm
eating junk and I'm not it's like why
work out you know not the full thing
isn't there and it just got me thinking
like a lot of people probably go through
this and you know today I didn't feel
like getting dressed and going but I'm
going anyways because I realized you
have to just go you know you it's about
just going fuck it up fuck up your
workout fuck up you know you know just
fuck it up fuck up the work I have a
shitty work out if you're gonna have a
workout and you think you're gonna have
a workout shitty we're gonna have a
shitty work out you know and sometimes
more often times than not it's turned
out to be a good workout for me and just
the fact that I'm going right now is why
I like I have been successful and so
consistent and I just want to share that
with you guys so if you guys don't feel
like going to the gym and you feel like
I'm just gonna get a shitty work out why
