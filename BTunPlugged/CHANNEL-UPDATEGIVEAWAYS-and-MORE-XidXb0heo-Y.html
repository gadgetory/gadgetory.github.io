another motivational Monday but before
we get starting to have a couple updates
for you guys if you haven't seen already
the channel name has changed from my
name to be tea unplugged I just thought
it was a kind of a cool name because I
do a lot of wireless stuff so like I'm
plugging in the core and also to the
kinda reviews that I give it's very
north adoption I give you guys reviews
based on my opinions on unplug just
giving you guys all my thoughts on
products and not sugarcoating things
that's one thing I've always been honest
getting honest reviews so it's kind of
like me unplugged and also to the
motivational Monday just give me guys my
raw thoughts and opinions on things so i
thought i was kind of fitting number two
has an idea for a series for this
channel and that is going to be a series
for kind of like the lesser-known
headphones and getting companies in here
and getting reviews of lesser-known
companies so that way like i can help
them out and give them more exposure and
also to help them with their products by
giving them the honest reviews and
giving them feedback on what I think
because I've tried so many so it's a
win-win but I want to do something for
you guys as well and I know some of the
companies already are offering coupon
codes for you guys so that's another
plus that's awesome but also another
thing that I want to try to do I want to
see what the companies will work with me
and try to get at least one pair to give
away for each episode in the series that
way you guys benefit as well and I can
make good on my promise to get all my
viewers wireless headphones at some
point I mean it's a start right so I
think it will be a cool and interesting
series where not only the companies will
benefit but you guys the subscribers
will benefit
it and I will just be here reviewing so
and I'm okay with that so let me know
what you guys think of that idea and if
you guys would even be interested in
something like that so now let's start
off with the motivational Monday and
today I want to talk about being a
courageous person right we see like
people like to rock you know one of my
heroes saying like well actually him as
a very courageous person like wow and we
think and this guy even experienced fear
but think about it fear and courage go
together you can't have just one without
the other you can't just be courageous
right you have to have something to go
up against to be crazy so you're
battling fear that is what courage mean
we all have fears so that gives us a
chance to be courageous and beat these
fears so with each fear that you face
you know for me it's like okay am i
doing a good job at work and I do it a
good job on these videos are they good
enough and there's this video idea going
to work and sometimes it's just about
doing it for it to go away the more I do
a good job at work the less fear i'm
going to feel the more videos i put out
and the more courageous i am with
putting out videos and trying new things
the more courageous I'd become in the
less fear I feel so those hand in hand
and maths fear is always going to be
there whatever your fears telling you go
do that thing the best quotes that I've
ever heard is do the thing and you will
have the power not before it not after
don't try to talk yourself into doing
the fear go and do the fear whatever
your mind is telling you you can't do go
and do it go and do it let's see for
confidence doesn't raise its a lot of a
lot of times our confidence is just
being taken away from us because we have
this fear and then confidence means that
you're competent that you can do it
right so when you run away from the
sphere you're saying I'm not confident
I'm not confident over and over again
subconsciously not saying it but doing
it so when you finally come to that fear
and you go past it guess what that's
where the confidence is outside of your
comfort zone your mind will lie to you
to try to get you to stay in the same
place it is used any tactic you know
sound very relatable it will sound very
reasonable as I found the frightened
right we said oh of course you can't do
that right all right does it mean no
just to settle for this and it sounds
very believable we believe it but
sometimes it's going to use any tactic
anymore any kind of trickery to try to
give you the standards in place so when
you hear that know that you need to go
beyond that fear so thank you guys for
watching go out and try that this week
if you have even a small fear go out and
do that thing and have the power you'll
see wait it's not that that and then
you'll get a medic here and then you
destroy that one and again and again and
again you'll become this amazing amazing
person you guys are already made away I
want you guys to look at it is I'm
already amazing and I'm just on my
journey to become even more amazing and
this is one of the steps in doing that
so go out chase your dreams kill it this
week and I will see you guys in the next
video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
