logitech gaming setup I've been wanting
to make this video for a long time and
I've held off because I'm very
particular about my computer peripherals
like I'm obsessed so as some of you may
or may not know I just played an FPS
game called tribes to professionally I
was on the number one team in that game
I also played well for a while and the
number four guild for Hill in the US
before the expansion pack and I'm
currently masters in overwatch so I love
games I'm a nerd but I can give you guys
some insight when I play casually these
days now I have always used Logitech
products one of my favorite mouse is
being the mx518 so flash-forward 15
years and I'm still using Logitech
accessories so I'm going to go over why
I like and use some of their gaming
products today my keyboard of choice has
been the g8 ten a great keyboard in my
opinion the Romero G switches took a
little bit of getting used to coming
from the Corsair k70 Cherry MX Reds
comparing that keyboard to the g8 ten
the g8 10 is just quieter the keys just
feel more consistent even when I'm
gaming on it for hours or days or months
whatever it's stayed the same and the
volume and the media Keys on this
keyboard is great the RGB lighting is
great you can do one color you could do
a wave it's very customizable and I
really like the setup and the way it
looks on my desktop and another thing
that I like about the Logitech eco
system is that they give you one app and
that app controls your headphones your
mouse and your keyboard and a lot of
their other products which is really
cool
all right now the mouse that I use the G
403 and the wireless version there's no
latency there's no delay with Wireless
now and Logitech has made sure of that
so Thank You Logitech for putting in
rade wireless now features the top
sensor the three three six six it has a
very good clicks the very light crisp at
the same time there's rubber grips on
the side which I love and it just helps
you to just swipe around that Mouse a
lot now I see a lot of comments online
about the mouse having a big hump in the
back
hold the mouse a certain way and you
have to hold it very narrow and I feel
like when you do this it became a lot
better for me all my pain went away and
it became more like the mx518 so great
mouse logitech so last but not least we
have the G 933 wireless headset a great
headset coming in at about $130 which I
think can really rival the astro a 50s
at a fraction of the cost the Bluetooth
on these is a rock-solid these also
feature RGB which I don't feel is
necessary since you can't really see it
once you have it on but it looks nice to
be on your desk
and your setup and the software gives
you an option to either turn that off so
you can gain four more hours of battery
life which i think is worth it you can
also adjust the profiles and settings to
tailor your sound which is also nice it
also has a wireless USB adapter which
you connect to your computer and you can
also put it into the side of the
headphone which is really really cool so
you don't lose it
I do wish that the ear cuffs are a
little bit more comfortable after
extended use and taking them off they're
a little bit rough on your skin so
that's something they really need to
look into although they are really cool
at the same time not cool but they keep
your ears from being too hot over a long
period of time during the long gaming
session all i knowa logitech makes
quality products that last everything in
this video just feels rock-solid
and I like that it will last you a long
time unlike some other companies and
brands where it may give out on you
after a little bit right and then you
have to buy more more more
but Logitech these things last for years
so yes I am a logitech fanboy but I'm
not hiding that No
will I ever but they kind of earned it
over the last 15 years of my life I've
tried other brands but I always come
back to Logitech alright guys so that's
my time and I hope you guys have enjoyed
this video and I will see you guys in
the next video but before that don't
