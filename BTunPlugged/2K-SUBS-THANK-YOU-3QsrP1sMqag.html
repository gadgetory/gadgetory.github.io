another motivational Monday I just want
to say thank you guys for the 2002 I'm
glad to have all of you here and glad
you guys have been enjoying the content
because it's less about divide you guys
and getting out the information to you
guys and help me guys make purchases and
also to inspiring so it's crazy to me of
that back in November we just had a
giveaway for 1000 subs and now here we
are Edgar we're at 2,000 subs so that is
incredible and I just want to thank all
of you guys for the tremendous support
always putting down great comments down
in my comments section always
participating and I really appreciate
you guys I really appreciate that I
don't take that for granted because my
comment section could be the complete
opposite you know i'd say about 99% of
my comments are positive and that's
truly incredible where do you find that
at in the world anywhere so i just want
to say thank you guys to all the studs
out there that subs and aren't here and
are watching my content and support me
you know i support you guys right back
you know the love goes both ways so i
hope that me making these videos can
support you guys back and help your life
subway with that being said i wanted to
do a giveaway but what i think i'm going
to do is I'm going to wait till about
five or ten thousand subs and then from
there we will give away multiple
headphones it won't be just one it'll be
two three four we'll see what we can do
with that being said down on the
comments below write down maybe what
headphones are on your wish list just
out of curiosity just so I know in the
future okay when I do announce it what
are the headphones that people actually
want and maybe that might change I might
ask again and keep up with you guys just
to see like what what's current for you
what is the headphone that you were out
looking for saving for so I can help out
now with all that being said SARM a
little sick still but with all that
being said thank you guys let's get on
with this motivational Monday so I just
want to talk about the belief system now
we all have the least we all have these
negative beliefs about ourselves we're
not confident enough we're not
good-looking enough where did they come
from how did how do we how this come
about you know we see all this positive
thinking just you know repeating
affirmations okay i am confident i am
confident but does it ever work we have
to use the same belief system that is
going against us in our mind wherever it
came from wherever these ideas came from
parents friends family whatever they
came from somewhere and we just accepted
it we didn't say I'm a bad person i'm a
bad person i am this I am this we didn't
we never said that we just accepted it
so what we have to do is just accept
that we're great and how we do that is
use your imagination picture yourself
acting how you want if a situation went
badly picture yourself in that situation
how would you want it to go so they're
there for the positive reinforcements
will be in your mind in the next time
you will act in a way that you want to
act so if you want to be confident you
just picture yourself how you want to
act and then you say you know what I
don't need to say that I'm confident
every day I don't need to remind myself
that just sit it out it's going to
happen I am on my way to becoming
confident you say I'm picturing how I
want to act I want to wear this kind of
clothes whatever you want to do state
all the things that you need to state
and then let it go put it out into the
world and then believe that it will come
true the more you try to focus on
something the more it's going to escape
you I'm telling you guys we've all been
there where we try so hard and yet the
thing that we want slips away from us
so don't let it slip away from you don't
try so much to be something you are
already that thing just put it out just
let it go to say I am confident let it
go so just put it out there just picture
it say it is already done I'm not even
going to worry about it don't even put
your mind to it and just know that it's
going to come out out of you when I make
these videos I don't just say you know
what I want to make a good video I want
to make a good video the more I do that
the less videos I put out when I put out
more videos it's because I'm like you
know I want to make a great video about
b6 and I believe it's already going to
happen then I start coming up with ideas
it's crazy but when i try to sit there
and write down like i want to make a
beat sex review about XYZ it doesn't
come out as good so take this use it
this week let me know how it goes and
again thank you guys so much for
watching for all the support i
appreciate each and every one of you
guys this is BTW stay in peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
