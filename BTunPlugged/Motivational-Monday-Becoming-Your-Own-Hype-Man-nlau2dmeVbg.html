with another motivational Monday today I
want to talk to you guys about being
your own hype man a lot of times we keep
ourselves in a small contained cage of
what we think is possible so when new
opportunities arise with shy away from
them because we are just putting
ourselves down and we started singing
phrases like oh you can never do that or
people don't like you so what do we have
to do what we have to do is start
turning it around and start being our
own hype man and start repeating things
that make us feel good so we will start
the task that we need to complete the
hardest part of any task is just
starting and that's what being your own
hype man can help you do it's like
you're at the top of the hill and trying
to push the boulder down a hill that
initial push is the hardest but after
that ball gets rolling then it's going
to go all the way down the hill now if
you see people like DJ Khaled you always
see them snapping and hiking themselves
up trying to hide bus up and that's what
we have to do for ourselves I like that
I like that we have to continuously hype
ourselves up tell us how great they're
gonna do the thing that you're gonna do
right if you keep saying man I'm gonna
do this I'm gonna kill this this is
nothing to me it's it I guarantee you
it's gonna make even the most mundane
task better so go out there and try this
technique and let me know how it goes
guys let me know I really want to know
if this is helping you guys anyways guys
this has been your boy BTW and i will
see that</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
