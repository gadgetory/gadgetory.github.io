getting a lot of questions about how I
make my chicken my crock-pot chicken I
keep saying it in every video they keep
saying I'm going to show you guys how to
make it that keep not showing you guys
how to make it so here I go we are going
to the store and we're gonna make some
chicken I'm going to show you where
exactly everything is in the store and
then we're gonna come back and we're
gonna cook it together let's do this
here we are step 1 go to Safeway step 2
step 3
step four I'll let you guys get a little
creative you guys
I like Kinder's so I like the tequila
and the black game you guys can choose
any and then core mix or whoever it's
all good this is - even but just to get
a little bit more flavor on actual
chicken you're gonna have some spices in
there so this makes it a little bit more
flavorful so you know bring out the the
flavors in the chicken so check it
definitely check it out
step 5 just kidding let's go check out
to find a chicken because I have a ton
already at home but you guys can get it
here I like figured it from Costco cause
it's a little cheaper so yeah that's
what I do so that's why you didn't see
me I should get that actually shaken but
I like chicken breast
lots of protein low fat some people like
5 but you can really overcook it really
fast and they're not overcook it but it
has a lot more fat than chicken breast
so on the side note its Game of Thrones
days Sunday cannot wait although the
season is almost over so I'm pretty
pissed about that what are you gonna do
they only make it 10 episodes with shit
maybe every episode it's just amazing so
what are you gonna do love-hate
relationship let three more episodes
just gonna enjoy the hell out of them
just freaking take note of every little
thing
love it chicken that I use
now we defrost the chicken I could do it
in the microwave
taking is almost done defrosting now
we're gonna set this to high I'd like to
keep my chicken and whole I don't want
to cut it I thought this is T this is it
a little bit better so yes I have some
weber seasoning New Orleans Cajun
seasoning pick this one the chicken like
so remember this is just to give it a
little bit more flavor it kind of helps
keep the juice the salt keeps the juices
in the chicken so I like to just put
that on there you know chicken
you don't know flavorless chickens I
just make sure that I you know make sure
you got the seasoning on there just in
case the barbecue sauce doesn't stick
because it's gonna be cooking in those
juices so that's the reason why I do
that alright next step the chicken in
try to make this a little brighter today
it's a little dark in here okay put the
chicken in the crock-pot
so right now we're gonna put the
barbecue sauce about half all right so I
like to put enough to kind of cover the
chicken we should chickens in there so I
can you know cook in there and get the
full use of this the barbecue sauce pipe
so it's covered this is gonna kind of
reduce down its gonna become watery but
that's okay that's what we want a little
bit just to get there
so that's it okay now we're gonna just
set that in there for about six hours no
no no four hours after the four hours
we're gonna shred it and then we're
gonna put in the sauce is still yeah the
chicken sausage
remember these I'm gonna put that in and
fall for those in there cut them up and
it's gonna be here so we're gonna put it
into the containers for the week that's
it see you guys later
in four hours oh yeah that's better
look at that this is about two hours
into the cooking process it's slowly but
surely cooking it's a good thing means
the machines on okay next up we're going
to take two forks and shred the chicken
see how it just falls apart oh yeah
Hey all done
see that nice and shredded okay so now I
do this here turn this to low all right
and now I just let it sit for another
hour so before we do that and Assam
sausage I don't think I said it earlier
but this is the roasted pepper and a
saga Asiago it is the macros on these
okay this officer just cut here like so
yeah I'll let that cook for another hour
let the juices settle into the gym and
we're good to go do a little taste test
damn that's good
here's the final product yeah yeah it's
beautiful
no me I forgot my my meal prep
containers at work so should I put this
into a big pot or big storage thing and
then either throughout the week so I'll
be able to divvy it up but you see how
it looks
consistency you saw the whole process so
there's no reason why you shouldn't be
able to do this so go out and do it
see you guys later it is a very last
part of the prep the scale so we've got
a schedule here managed to find two
containers so I have Monday Tuesday the
restaurant work and I'll figure those
out once I get them back and clean them
so here we go I'm gonna do I'm gonna aim
for about 7 ounces of chicken it sausage
so
you know what this week seven and a half
out all right seven a half ounces for
that word then
do you can see after two things of
chicken I still have a lot of chicken in
sausage low left so this is gonna be
probably what two three this could be at
least another four or five meals right
here look at that that's amazing
and it tastes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
