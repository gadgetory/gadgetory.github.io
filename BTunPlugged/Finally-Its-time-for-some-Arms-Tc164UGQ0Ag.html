friends family everybody has just been
like well BTW that's cool that's cool
chest workout will let the fuck your arm
workout at so here it is here's my arm
workout finally was able to record one I
tried a couple times but you know people
at 24 be hating on a brother you know
I'm saying so without further ado first
here we have the sniffing body curls
their body drags I should say with these
you want to make sure you move your
elbows backwards and pull the bar up
along your body squeezing at the top and
make sure make sure you look at yourself
in the mirror that's the most important
part next up we have preacher curls my
favorite elbows tight as you can see and
never relax your biceps even at the
bottom you see my biceps and never
they're always tensed and that's how you
want to keep it throughout the whole
movement and this is good this is
probably one of my favorite workouts for
my biceps right now next we moved on to
the dumbbell curls on the preacher and
this is just to get a different range of
motion you know some people like barbell
some people like bar some people like
dumbbells you know this is just to make
sure that I get optimal contraction in
our biceps just doing something
different tricking the body you know all
that good stuff
next up we got the reverse grip cable
curls and these are good because they
work your forearms and the outer part of
your bicep so if you want to get that
nice peak while you're rested which is
what I've been trying to improve lately
that's a very good movement next on up
we have the one-armed cable and with
these I recommend trying to pull to the
top of your head don't try to pull
toward your shoulder just keep it in a
fixed position and and pull I mean
that's the best way to describe and
really squeeze the top you see you're
really like holding there for about two
seconds I just recently brought back
skull crushers and I absolutely love
them I got the tip to which I'm passing
on to you guys to work the long head
which is the outer tricep that'll go all
the way down to four your elbows with
these you see I'm bringing it all the
way over the top of my head and then
back up never locking out never lock
your elbows with this to keep positive
constant tension in your triceps and
then we super say that this with a close
grip bench and we bring this one below
into our sternum right below our chest
next up we have the reverse grip pull
downs this is a good way just to hit
that the lateral head and the back part
of your tricep and this just really feel
like this is one just puts a lot of meat
on the back of your arms and I really
like to fill these you know keeping the
elbows tight on all these movements you
see my elbows and every single women are
staying in the same place they never
flare out they never
you know loser locked position and
that's how you want to keep it and next
what you're seeing now is the overhead
press and these are getting good for the
long head which I'm trying to bring up
in my triceps and again most people have
good lateral but the long head isn't
good and this is one thing I want you
guys to take away from this video's work
out your long-headed more than your
other heads it kind of seems kind of
sexual but whatever anyways guys thanks
for watching my latest video I got more
to come and I'm going to try to do some
more vlogs soon peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
