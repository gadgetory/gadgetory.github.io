was trying hard because I was wearing a
hat indoors so you know what I have to
say to that you know what I have to say
all right all right happy now I try hard
enough now what do you think we think
guys I look good what is up guys its BT
back here again with another review
today I'm doing a review on the N pal
headphones a headphone that is highly
rated on Amazon and coming in at a price
point if only seventeen dollars so I
couldn't help but try to save you guys
some money so are these seventeen dollar
pairs of headphones can they compete
with the more expensive headphones of
today so one thing I'm going to add in
the end of my videos is a rating for the
headphone out of 10 I think this will
help people gauge whether where I raise
certain headphones and where they stand
in terms of other headphones the quality
and all of that but before we begin
don't forget to subscribe for more

so one trend that I'm seeing with
budget-friendly headphones is the
packaging is very plain Jane no frills
carpel boxes a couple of silicone tips
USB cords and the headphones this cuts
out a ton of cost and realistically
these headphones don't need to stand out
because they aren't on the shelf at Best
Buy so right off the bat you're saving a
ton of money compare it to
beats Bose Jabir's all those crazy
companies they have to sit next to each
other on a shelf and they need to grab
your attention these don't need any of
that so right off the bat you're gonna
be saving a ton of money just top of
that the materials feel a little bit
above average next material cord and the
hooks the buttons do feel a little bit
flimsy overall but not too bad I like
the low profile on the branding on the
side the mpow the silicone tips are
comfortable and they come in three
different sizes although I do wish they
had a tightener on the back of the cord
so to keep it off the back of your neck
kind of like the beads have so maybe
that's something they want to add
with these headphones so these are the
empower V for point ones and I was
pleasantly surprised of how they sound
the quality of these headphones is
actually tailored to my liking and that
is an emphasis on the MS and then the
base and then the highs the vocals are
very for creating a great experience for
most music I listen to rap rock sound
very good as a result of this now
they're not so good for some EDM they're
kind of average but for rock this will
sound very good because of the vocals
again they get play loud with some
distortion these things get loud without
any distortion so they that tells you
right there that they actually put in
some pretty good drivers into these
headphones now if I did have to be very
very nitpicky is there not the super
clearest high fidelity audio file
bluetooth headphones out there but they
are really good I would say they're
about above average and I really love
what this company did with these
headphones I think Bose beats Jaybirds
of the world they're willing to step
their game up because the budget
headphones are starting to sound a
little bit better guys let me be honest
with you the better life coming in at
about 6 hours it could be a little bit
better it's enough to get you through a
workout maybe 3 to 4 workouts during the
week but what can you really expect for
17 dollars you're not gonna get that 12
hours from like a power Beast threes but
these are 6 hours solid 6 hours and they
will do you just fine the rock solid
connection of the Bluetooth 4.1 does
great and crowded gym guys these things
do not falter like some of the other
cheaper headphones out there so I really
give credit to empower for these great
budget headphones the call quality is
great I'm very pleasantly surprised by
these headphones they're a great value
for anybody who doesn't have that
hundred dollars to spend on branding buy
beads and jaybird speaking of which
those companies have to really step
their game up if this is what budget
headphones are sounding like these days
a big problem with budget headphones
that's getting fixed is the loot
connection they used to be horrible I
could not listen to them in the gym
whatsoever but they sounded good pretty
good outside of the gym so as Bluetooth
technology gets cheaper the the bigger
companies they do need to WoW us for
that $80 more so what do I give these I
give these an eight out of ten good
comfort good sound great value alright
guys so thank you guys for your time
