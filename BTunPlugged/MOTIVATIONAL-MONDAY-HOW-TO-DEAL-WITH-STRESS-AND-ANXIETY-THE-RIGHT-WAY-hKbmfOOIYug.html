another motivational Monday video yeah
that's what I'm going to call it
nowadays motivational mondays we talk
about self-improvement life skills all
that good stuff today's topic is how to
turn stress into something that you can
use stress and anxiety into something
you can use to help you accomplish your
goals now when we think of stress our
relationship of stress is very bad we
think okay we hear in the news that
stress is bad stress causes this stress
causes that when in reality is that
really true or is it the fact that we
have all these preconceived notions that
stresses a bad thing and we think okay
I'm feeling stressed I'm not capable of
getting the job that I want to having
the friends that I want to be how the
body I want and because I feel the
stress anxiety about the situation I
don't go after it and this is completely
false and I want to give you guys a
different mindset a mindset change and I
got this from the book the upside of
stress Mike Kelly McGonigal now what she
says to do is is to think of how you're
you this stress Corliss to your values
if you're upset if you're feeling
anxious if you're feeling stressed out
about something that means that whatever
you're stressed or anxious about is
something that's important to you so
start there what are your your values
what do you deem important to you in
your life but that stress and anxiety
gives you energy to rise to the
challenge instead of thinking all this
is bad i can't handle it what do i do
this is
you know I'm not capable I'm not capable
start thinking this stress and anxiety
this feeling in my body that I don't
like is actually trying to help me
become more alert to your surroundings
more focused and you start seeing things
that you wouldn't normally have seen
before so your body is sending all these
signals to help you but we think oh no
we need to get rid of it why get rid of
it if think about it if you're in a
situation where you're going into an
interview you feel anxious right what do
you do you feel very alert you feel very
present you feel very in tune with your
surroundings as opposed to when you go
in there comfortable you may miss
questions you may forget things you may
come off as you don't care you may miss
certain subtleties in the interviewers
um the way they say things or asking you
questions and you could take all these
things out of context so it really helps
to again help you through those
situations but we don't think of it like
that so I want to challenge you guys to
make a mind shift from thinking that
stress and anxiety is a bad thing and
more of moreover too it's going to help
you achieve what's important to you and
it's giving you the necessary focus
skills intuitiveness to overcome your
challenges that are meaningful to you so
go out next time you feel that stress
think about how is this stress trying to
help me accomplish my goals and what
matters most to me mind-blowing right
it's really helped me a lot and I see
certain areas were before I would have
been like oh I can't do it I can't do my
dog I felt very getting a new dog I felt
very anxious about it like I can't do
this
it's a big commitment and I was very
anxious they want me to pick up the dog
right now I don't you have this isn't
this but then I got inches i said how
can this anxiety raised me to the level
where i can take care of my dog i can
think about all the dogs needs getting
all the proper stuff so I don't miss
anything and just be completely ready
for the dog and that's what happened and
it really made me realize that that
stress really it really helped me and
now every from day to day I think of
okay this is a challenge house is going
to help me how's the stress anxiety
going to help me get to what I want so
you guys go out and do the same thing
