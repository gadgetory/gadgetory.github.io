another review well this isn't quite a
review I'm doing something a little bit
different today I'm gonna be talking to
you guys about the jeepers
x3 hype now these are coming out soon
I've looked on Twitter I've looked
everywhere there's no real release date
except for quarter 2 and as you know
quarter 2 is about 2 has ended its ended
so they're not out yet
and we're kind of leaving other
consumers wondering why why aren't they
out yet they were promised to us we need
them but I think this is just this
marketing I mean they're the J brew
freedoms just came out so they're most
likely trying to time their their
releases so that people will either go
with the freedoms or whatever the case
may be
now with that being said I noticed the
jaybird x2 dropped in price so you can
get them I around a hundred if you if
you don't see them for around a hundred
wait a little bit they kind of go up and
down in price or they have been recently
so keep a lookout for that don't pay 150
for them at this point especially with
the j-bird x3 is coming out but what I
can do is I can say that the j-bert x2
are really good now I did a review on
them in the past and they were one of my
favorite wireless headphones ever and
going from I had the X's and then I had
the X tubes and going from the xx twos
there wasn't much of a different the
Bluetooth was a little bit better they
updated that the sound the size
everything was pretty much the same they
just did a little different coloring on
these so what I can say is I really like
the way these fit now I did a review on
the j-bird freedoms which I'll link
below and also did a comparison on the
Jaybirds freedoms versus
the Bo's the new Bose Wireless and what
I can say is is that I really thought
with it
oh that's tubes these are like like
plugs coming out of your ear I'll show
you right now
they're like plugs coming out of your
ear they stick out you know what that
comes maybe rubbing or bumping and that
was my main gripe sounds like a hot they
came to make them smaller they really do
they need to make these smaller so that
they're not so uncomfortable but when I
have the freedoms it was almost too much
they took too much it was like they
there were too small so that they would
fall out of your ear with these they're
a little bit on the bigger side as you
see they're a little bit on the bigger
side all right so this size helps keep
them into your ear and I kind of took
that for granted you know sometimes we
take things for granted and we can like
to complain about everything but the the
size of these actually host them in your
ear like it it was so weird and I came
back to these after the freedoms and I
was like why did he stay in versus the
smaller freedoms all the Simpsons are
smaller they would fit deeper into my
ear but that's not the case the the same
tips that they use on these I'm pretty
sure they fit on to the freedoms so the
canal this little canal part right here
this part right here it's pretty much
the same as the j-bird freedoms right so
that little part is going to ear but you
have that added size to kind of keep
them into your ear and what I found is I
I didn't know that my ear tips were the
large ones until I tried them with the
freedoms I went back and I put the
jaybird x2 large ones back on and these
are mind-blowing they stay in my ear the
isolate sound
this is perfect I never thought that my
ears or the large tips but they are if
you guys are having problems with the X
- try going up a size in the silicon and
see if that doesn't get a better fit for
you and I get a amazing seal I get so
much I sound out isolation with these
and it's really great so with the x3 is
I kind of want to tie these X tubes into
the X threes so with that being said I
do think they should decrease the size
just a little bit maybe you like on this
back end part from the part that's
sticking out of your ear so this part
but I really think they should keep this
part the same maybe like cut this off
maybe a little bit just to you know cut
down the size maybe rubbing or bumping
but otherwise I feel like the size is
perfect and looking at the box which I
will show right now
a concept or what the actual box will be
but it looks like they did cut down the
size a little bit so I'm hoping that
that's the case if they don't I mean it
won't wouldn't be the worst thing but
it's just the little things may be a
little increment this year on the J
Brand X threes all right now one thing I
do feel like they need to work on with
the J Brand X threes is the mic now the
mic on the X 2's it sounds very tinny
you can hear yourself talking back and
when I hear myself I sound like a robot
now they think with the jaybird x
freedom's they really fix this problem
and I really commend them on that people
couldn't tell that I was even on
headphones they thought I was like had
the phone up to my face so really good
great drop on that j-bird so bring that
over to the X threes for sure and of
course I love this wire this wire it
stayed I don't know what the material is
but it really like stays off the back of
your neck when I sweat and stuff it
doesn't get caught up like it would with
the powerbeats2 so that is one thing
that I really like now let's talk about
the battery life the battery life is
roughly around honestly they say eight
hours but when I have the volume like up
max trying to isolate out sounds at the
gym they last me for about four to six
hours I'm gonna be very bra for just six
hours depending on you know sometimes I
lower my music increase my music
depending on the song and what I'm
feeling at the time but when I'm in my
office these will last the whole 9:00 to
5:00 on a medium volume and that's all
you need in like a quieter place but you
know going to those higher volumes I
want to see a company really push the
envelope and really get that really like
solidify that eight hours and really
just surprise us and be like look
there's no questions this is eight hours
this is these have eight hours of sound
that's one thing that
I really want to see what the X threes
other than that I mean we talked about
the fit I think the fit on the X 2's is
great you know they're gonna keep the
wing design there the patented wing
design yeah so they made these wings a
little bit softer at the tip right here
so that makes things a lot better when
they're in the air and a lot more
comfortable so that's something that I
really commend them on so Jaber keep up
the great work I have never had the
David x2 s break on me I know a lot of
people that have been sweating have been
caught complaining about the bows so hey
j-bird this is your time to take back
the crown and from bows really the the
sound on these they're up there with the
freedoms they're up there with the buh
sound sport you know all day and with
that app I just feel like that it's
gonna take these X 2's to the next level
I just want to see like maybe like if
you can GB replace just a little bit
more changes to the maybe housing just
to keep them from sticking out so much
and just an upgraded mic and you're
gonna have a winner they're gonna be an
amazing headphones the x3 so this has
just been a revisit on the x2 saying
what I like because I know a lot of
people are like you know Brandon you
don't like in-ear headphones I love
in-ear headphones i i i i love them i I
honestly do they isolate so much better
than the ones that sit outside your ear
like the Bose you know and I prefer that
so with that being said the X 2's were
great in my opinion and I think the X 3s
if everything goes according to plan
like we think it should it they should
be the top dog on the market come on
j-bird I know you can do it this has
been a revisit on the X 2's I hope you
guys have enjoyed this and guys I hope
you guys are as hyped as I am for these
extras that are coming out I will see
