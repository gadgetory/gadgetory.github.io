latest and greatest from Fitbit the
Fitbit ionic and I'm here to report back
to you guys today with the results now
the watch is coming in at about $300
which is inching up on that Apple watch
so does the technology in this Fitbit
ionic match up with the price and if so
is technology everything today we're
gonna answer all those questions and
then some but before I begin don't
forget to hit that subscribe button
alright so let's get this thing started
in the box you're gonna find the manuals
the charging cord and the watch pretty
straightforward the setup was super
simple you just download the app plug in
your watch to charge it and it will take
you through all these steps to customize
the Fitbit eye on it and then you're
good to go it only takes about 20 to 30
minutes for this let's talk about the
aesthetics of this watch I got the blue
slate in grey version of this watch
which I think looks really nice it also
comes in black and also a burnt orange
which also looks very nice in my opinion
I love the new band on the Fitbit ionic
it's a massive upgrade in my opinion
over the charge HR 2 it's like a normal
watch where you thread one end through
the other and then you stick the metal
piece through to secure it then you take
the metal piece at the end of the band
and you press that through the other end
so that there are no pieces moving
around and sticking out before you'd get
like the Alta or the charge HR these
things will get caught on everything
doors weights handles getting dressed
and it was just a major pain I know
people that have just lost their Fitbit
because of the class part of their
Fitbit the ionic comes with many-faced
presets that you can change to your
liking I went with the stats face
because it has all the stats right there
the steps the calories the heart beats
per minute and you can also change the
code of theme which is also is just a
very nice touch swiping left you can
change the screen wake and the
notifications from your phone and you
can also see the battery life flipping
the watch over turns to watch on and I
find that it's pretty responsive but not
overly sensitive to waste your battery
on the side you're gonna find two
buttons on the
the top button brings up a quick pull up
of all your stats bottom button takes
you to the exercise menu but we'll get
more into that later on the other side
you're gonna find the home button which
takes you back from any screen
I do wish that they had a sliding from
the edge to edge kind of like the iPhone
and the Apple watch damn you Apple oh
well I want to come back to this thing
of this technology matter or does a
value matter and this is where I think
Fitbit has Apple beat let me give you
guys a analogy let's say you're driving
in a 30 mile per hour zone
there's a 20 mile per hour zone coming
up how likely are you gonna slow down to
exactly 20 miles per hour
you may slow down to 30 you may slow
down to even 25 but let's say that same
scenario happened but this time there's
a cop right there right next to that 20
mile per hour zone you're gonna do
exactly 20 miles per hour so that you
don't get that ticket and that's what I
equate a Fitbit to it's a little bit
less extreme but it's there to check
your miles per hour to keep you on track
throughout the day it gives you goals to
set for your steps your calories burned
reminders to get moving throughout the
day I work in a lab and I'm usually
seated most of the day and I love that
it reminds me to just get up win the
hour with 150 to 200 steps another thing
that I really love about this is the
relaxation app that allows you to follow
a circle with your breath to calm you
down I love doing this in the middle of
my workday just to kind of realign
myself and when I'm all over the place
scatter it kind of just brings me back
home now let's get into the music app
and this is where they failed because I
connected the saint's to the Wi-Fi I
connected through my computer through
the USB still nothing they need to make
this process easier I've put on the app
and the way I thought it was gonna work
is they're just gonna be able to drag
and drop onto the Fitbit program
creating this playlist but it's just not
there yet
hopefully they can fix this with Pandora
you need a premium membership and yeah
I'm not doing that so for now no music
on my Fitbit ionic and like most of you
out there are wishing for that Spotify
app I know hopefully we get it sooner
than later because I need music on this
thing this is one of the many reasons
why I bought the thing is so I didn't
have to bring my phone into the gym and
it shouldn't be this hard the battery
life is great I got about six days and
they advertised four to five and that's
what trekking exercise is doing the
relaxation half checking the weather
paying all the above and I think this is
where the ionic really has to Apple
watch it beat when I had the Apple watch
I found myself taking it off to charge
it then I would forget to put it back on
before I went to work I'm not gonna
drive back home just for the Apple watch
and the battery only lasted 16 hours so
I realized that it wasn't really an
integral part of my day
being able to track over multiple days
I think Trump's technology being able to
wear it whenever you need it to get
everything that you need we track
literally everything food and take
calories burned steps how active you are
having that in having charts and seeing
all that being very visual will help you
get to your goals more so than a pretty
screen on your wrist let me tell you
guys seeing all the charts makes me feel
like I need to wear it to stay
consistent in that is huge that is where
Fitbit is just winning the one tracking
aspect of the swatch that helps me more
than anything is a sleep app and I work
a nine-to-five job
plus I do these YouTube videos and they
can lead to me staying up later than I
should trying to finish these videos but
seeing it on the app is another story
this thing really makes me go to bed
early it's like a cop on your wrist now
where ever heard that before the new
heart rate sensor is more Agora than
ever
I used to elliptical and it calculated
roughly the same amount of calories
burned as my watch did they are
definitely doing something right with
this watch I use it to track my workouts
and it's just nice seeing that constant
updates on how many calories you've
burned and it gives you that added
motivation like hey I'm at 800 calories
let's do a few more workouts or reps or
whatever I need to do to burn the
thousands also waterproof it tracks your
swimming activity it tracks your
treadmill activity it even tracks when
you're running outdoors and you get the
added benefit of the GPS so it'll be
nice just to see like where you've gone
where you've run to another thing that
I'm really liking to know about these is
the guided workouts now these are in the
coach app just turn it on and it runs
you through a little circuit
one knee up towards your chest keeping
your toes lifted and hips down quickly
send that leg as you bring your other
knee for repeating for reps so you can
work out anywhere if you're on vacation
if you're just have a couple moments
it's only about ten minutes you can just
get it going get a crack in get your
workout in and continue on with your day
I like the Fitbit wallet it works
flawlessly you just take a picture of
the car and you're good to go now this
one thing that I was worried about it
was that it wasn't gonna work everywhere
but it actually works we're all
contactless payment is accepted really
nice so in conclusion is is worth three
hundred dollars he doesn't have the best
tech it doesn't have the best screen
screen is pretty by the way
I never talked about that very pretty
screen the value in this thing is that
they are pushing their technology the
screen apps and all that but they're
adding in the days that are needed to
show you your progress so that you can
progress in life so the value in this
thing far outweighs any technology in my
opinion you can get a pretty Apple watch
but honestly I have one and it's like a
paperweight now I don't need it I don't
use it what am I gonna track for 16
hours well I walked here there now I
have to charge it I'm worried about
charging it then I forget to charge it
now I don't care about it I really don't
you know we all spend a lot of money on
TVs computers headphones I'm guilty but
this piece of tech I think everybody
should have in their arsenal because it
helps you live a longer healthier life
you're gonna be able to experience more
life with your family your friends stuff
that we all want so I have to ask you
guys what's more important to you guys
top of the line screen for time with
your family friends and living a healthy
right and for me you know personally
that's what I want for you guys I want
you guys to live healthy life that's
deserve it we all deserve it
so go out guys get a Fitbit I on it it
doesn't even have to be the Fitbit guy
on it get the Fitbit charge HR get the
Fitbit Alta Oh work amazing so guys
please has my subs and go out and get
one of these things alright it's a small
price to pay for what it gives to your
life and I'm just gonna end it there all
right guys I will see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
