sharing with you guys a little secret on
how to make your beats products better
and it only costs $20 more and I know
some of you guys at half the Jaybirds or
have experience to Jaber next Tuesday
threes will be very familiar with
Kampai tips these are foam tips which
you can buy separately off Amazon or
from complie themselves and these foam
tips will upgrade your beats let me tell
you how so these things right here you
put on the tips instead of the silicone
tips and what it will do is it will give
you a lot of isolation what you do is
you roll it up then you stick it into
your ear canal and then it expands so a
lot of you guys that complain that
there's a lot of leaking you can hear a
lot of people talking this is for you if
you use these for gym I think that the
comply tips are a must-have or if you're
a commuter and you just don't want to
hear people talking around you or having
the subway rail destroy your music
experience now the foam that they use is
very soft it's very comfortable it's
more comfortable than the silicone tips
in my opinion now the beats X they're
very comfortable already but this just
takes it to a whole nother level and on
top of that they keep them in your ear a
lot better these things almost you kind
of have to pull them out to get them out
of your ear so a big difference now
these premium tips are made for sports
so it's not gonna soak up all that sweat
I know you guys are worried about the
beats X and not being sweat proof this
will protect them a little bit better
from that sweat as well so it's an
investment to protect your product as
well so there's a lot of benefits to
using this these also can be used on the
power beast threes these can be used on
the Bose just go on to Amazon search
Kampai tips and then enter your
headphone name and if they have once I
fit your headphones they will show up so
that's the little tip that I have for
you guys today to upgrade your beats X
your power beats twos threes all that
good stuff
let me know what you guys think down in
the comments below do you guys like foam
tips let me know I love them I have
always loved them let me know down in
the comments below what you guys think
