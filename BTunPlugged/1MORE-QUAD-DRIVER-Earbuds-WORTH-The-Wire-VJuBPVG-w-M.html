with another review today we're gonna be
looking at the one more quad driver
earbuds this past Black Friday I was
really in the market for some wired
earbuds as you guys know if you watch my
Black Friday video if you haven't I
forgive you
go and watch it now now I had never
heard of the one more company before or
even that they made earbuds or anything
this deal popped up I saw a lot of
people backing the company so I said hey
why not try them out because bt you're
in the market for a pair of wired
earbuds what do you know these things
usually run about two hundred dollars
but I got them on sale for about 140
which is steel in my opinion but we'll
get into the specifics of why that is
later so let's see you guys are these
worth the wire because you guys know I
love wireless so let's start off with
the comfort in design but before we
begin I know I just we just started I
just want to say one more if you're
watching this amazing job on the
packaging this packaging really spoke to
me and it's some of the best as I've
ever seen
I love the sketches of the earbuds on
the box on the inside of the box
I love the magnet that you fling open
the box with it just all feels like I
got a $200 pair of earbuds and I love
that they actually have the earbuds on
display in the case a lot of companies
that just cram them into the box you
don't know what's medium what's large
you just kind of have to guess sometimes
I've even put a large in the medium on
guys like it's ridiculous so I like that
they separated everything out and made
it easy for the user to just find what
they need in the box you're gonna find a
case a cord clip a 2.5 to 3.5 millimeter
jack an airplane adapter which is just
amazing for those of you who travel and
you're gonna find five sets of silicon
tips and three sets of foam tips all of
the accessories that they added in with
these ear buds just feel super premium
they feel like you got 200 bucks so one
more a great job the ear tips themselves
feel amazing whether it's silicone or
foam the foam feels like it's gonna last
forever like at least a decade but if
they don't they also sell Kampai tips
which replace these as well over time
the earbuds themselves are made out of
metal
and right off the bat you might be
saying these are gonna be too heavy
which is what I thought but guys these
things are super light weight these
things have four drivers in them or yet
they've managed to make them super light
even when they got snagged on something
like a cabinet door these did not come
out that's how solid these are so I just
want to stress that if you're worried
about comfort or anything like that
these still live so if I was able to
design my own earbuds wired earbuds this
is how I would want my court to be this
thing is lightweight it feels great in
the hand it's very solid it doesn't
create any noise like other cheap
headphones where the core will be
rubbing on your shirt and then you hear
that sound in your ear but yeah none of
that so your runners out there you can
run with these also surprisingly the
remote is really really nice it's a
metal but it doesn't yank the headphones
out of your ear it actually is very very
light yet it feels very solid in your
hand I love holding this mic I even just
mess around the volume just to kind of
hear that click enos or I pause or play
my songs yeah it's bad so everything
about these earbuds screams $200 from
the packaging to the metal on the
earbuds everything just feels a super
premium and it feels like you got your
money's worth which is what we all want
sometimes right because at the end of
the day nobody wants to buy a $200 pair
of plastic earbud so these things sound
amazing guys they have four drivers
three RBA's balanced armatures and one
is a dynamic drive now the balanced
armatures aren't as powerful as
something like a dynamic driver that you
find in the beats X or jaybird X 3s or
anything like that so keep in mind like
those kind of headphones they have one
driver these have four so with all that
technical stuff out of the way how do
they actually sound does it deliver with
those four drivers and I have to say yes
it gives a very layered feel to your
music whether that's feeling the highs
the mids the lows the vocals the bay it
feels like you're slicing your music
open like a cake taking a slice out and
then you see all the layers that's what
these earbuds allow you to do they allow
you to see every single layer of your
news
or here every single layer of your music
right now I'm really into Cascades
Christmas album because it's that time
of year and cascade is one of my
favorite art and these things do
something that no other earbud and my
collection can do these for drivers
combine to make an emotional charge in
your music I really enjoy using these
these are great for everything to be
honest with you these are gonna be
pleasing to everyone there hasn't been a
song where I've been like no I need to
change the next song next no not with
these it's not happening these things
can handle any song that you throw at it
keep in mind these don't have an EQ
which one more if you're watching this
you guys should look into making an app
that would make these things just
untouchable but I know these things take
time so I'll be here I'll be waiting
here for you anyways guys these things
whether that's classical jazz rap rock
EDM everything just sounds so good I
cannot stress that enough this is the
experience that I was looking for over
the wireless earbuds it goes straight
into my phone straight into my ears and
it just sounds so good you can even
bring the soundstage that these have
over cheered gaming I've actually used
these for gaming guys I've taken off my
huge Odyssey my huge logitech gaming
headsets and ever play some with these
earbuds so for the sound I cannot
complain at all
everything is just nailed with these
earbuds so let's talk about the call
quality with these earbuds they did not
spare any expense they have one of the
best sounding mics in these earbuds so
if calls are important to you you need
to get these because they sound a
crystal clear what I mean crystal clear
I mean crystal clear this time I'm in
the Apple earbuds or air pots or bows
nobody can touch the mic and
these earbuds period so yeah your family
and friends will thank you because
finally they can hear you they're tired
of hearing you try to communicate on
your j-bird X threes like this hello
hello can you hear me yeah and I speak
from experience because that happens to
me all the time with the tapered X
threes I love you j-bird but yeah your
mics not good so let's address the
elephant in the room are these gonna be
worth your time your money are these
gonna be worth adding that wire back
after we've been going Wireless for over
a year now shout-out to you guys by the
way for the support and for me to answer
that it starts with the cord this cord
is just pure quality they knew what they
were doing when they made this cord and
it shows this thing is pure quality it's
comfortable it doesn't sway around a lot
it doesn't get caught on things when it
does the ear buds are so comfortable and
so secure that they don't pop out the
remote on the thing it's just simply
amazing
top notch on everything I couldn't find
anything to really knock these on to be
honest with you guys I mean the only
thing I went knock on is make them
wireless but they have this amazing cord
which I understand and I'm getting the
extra sound quality so it cannot really
complain about that no I can't
so guys that's gonna do it I think that
just became beefy plugged</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
