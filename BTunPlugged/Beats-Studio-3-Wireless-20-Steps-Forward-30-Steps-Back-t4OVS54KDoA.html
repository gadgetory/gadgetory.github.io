what is up guys is BT back here again
with another review okay so can I ask a
favor from you guys before we start this
review I know the beats brand gets a lot
of hate but can we be subjective and
look at these headphones with a fresh
pair of eyes I know in the past the
beats brand has been very very suspect
with build quality and rightfully so
prior to the powerbeats2 is in the
studio Tuesday deserved it but until I
actually tried that Studio 2.0 for
myself I was on the beat hate train as
well but here we are is 2017 Apple has
ownership of the beats brand so can they
save its reputation with their infinite
resources so today we're gonna look at
the Beats Studio 3.0 and see how they
fare against some of the top brands like
the Bose QC 35 and the Sony WH 1000 XM
twos now if you guys have been following
me for a while you know that I loved the
studio 2.0 I loved loved loved them they
were the best for the gym they were
super low profile to get really loud
they block out a lot of noise in the gym
but I'm with you guys on this I want the
three point nose to be great so let's
see how they did today okay so in the
box you'll find a charging cord a case
3.5 millimeter jack cord and the
headphones the notable changes are the
case which has some new faux leather
around the edges of the zipper which is
a nice touch the hinges on the
headphones themselves also feel smoother
when snapping into place while they do
look like the older model I have
confidence in these more so than the
older ones I got the limited edition
shadow gray version I'm not usually for
the flashy gold coloring but I feel like
these strike that nice balance
I love the tannish color on the inside
of the headband as well they kept the
headband practically the same which I'm
okay with because I'm a fan of the low
profile they provide they do stick out a
little more than your head
pair to the twos but that's because
there is more cushioning on the ear cups
speaking of ear cups they are more plush
and have more padding this year compared
to the studio twos the faux leather does
feel a little bit less like leather this
year like they did on the solo threes
which I really like but instead they
feel more on the plasticky side which I
guess works for me since I'll be using
them for the gym and they'll hold up
over a long period of time over time
this headband will create a dent here
from stretching like the old version but
that's just a design flaw that some
headphones have on the ear cups you'll
find a play/pause phone call button on
the beats logo and on the ear cups you
have the power button and the power
display dots holding the power button
for two seconds will turn on or off the
active noise cancellation all in all
outside of the changes on the hinges and
the change on the ear cuffs these are
pretty much identical to the studio twos
which I'm okay with they're still
lightweight they keep a low profile and
they are great for the gym okay since my
old studio twos died I was really really
missing the high volumes and the
rattling bass that they provided for the
gym no other headphone gets me going in
the gym quite like the studio twos but
when I first put on the studio 3s I was
disappointed to say the least
they thinned out the bass and make them
more neutral I would say that the solo
threes actually have better sound than
these the solo threes give you that
emotional charge whereas a studio three
is leave you feeling quite empty inside
so if you were deciding between the two
sound wise yeah I'd go with the solo
threes I almost gave up on them but with
all that being said these do take a
while to burn in I'd say about 5 to 10
hours of play to really warm up the
drivers the lows in the myths are to
come forward more still not the best
quality but definitely better than right
out of the box so if you do decide to
get these don't be alarmed at first they
do get better there is a lack of sub
bass here that the old studio twos had
but now the studio 3s have a focus on
the upper base which leads to less thump
in your songs obviously they are going
to be great for a wrap
be EDM jazz and then the next genre the
next rankings would be rock and then
classical which I find least enjoyable
on these headphones I would say that
these headphones are slightly above
average and what I mean slightly I mean
barely when comparing the noise
cancellation to something like the Bose
it's just night and day when I put on
the Bose without music on they
immediately dampen out all the sound
when I put on the beats I can still hear
pretty much everything until I turn on
the music
I was really hoping with Apple acquiring
beats by dre that they can use the
resources to make some dope noise
cancellation tech I think we all did but
they really missed the mark here it acts
more like a passive noise cancellation
headphone like in the old studio tubes
as opposed to real noise cancellation
that Bose and Sony headphones are
providing currently Apple come on you
can do better I definitely don't
recommend these for travel you're better
off getting the Bose are the Sony's but
these will work for everyday life and I
think that's who they're really
marketing these for the w1 chip makes
connecting these easy you just turn on
the headphones and an icon pops up
allowing you to connect right away when
you use an iPhone no need to go through
the settings but this just doesn't work
on the Android but the connection is
just a solid I took these into a crowded
gym with no problems there's no hiccups
and it's just a great relief to have
some over ear headphones after dealing
with these true Riley's headphones for
so long they made me want to rip my hair
out with little I have okay so the call
quality is decent but not as good as
Bose just don't take them into a crowded
area because you get this weird feedback
loop where you can hear your
surroundings as well as yourself as
you're talking the battery life has been
raised from 15 hours to 22 hours which
is good you can also turn off the ANC
when you don't need it and get up to 40
hours which is then incredible I was
really hoping that they could have just
made it that much right out of the bat
with the ANC on but guess you can't have
everything in conclusion the studio 3 is
in my opinion feel like a step back if
my studio tubes were still working I
think I would still prefer those over
the 3 point nose right now you can get
the studio twos on sale for about 160
which in my opinion is a still for them
for me I just can't justify spending 350
be honest when there are much better
headphones out there like the Bose
kyushu 35 to Sony WH 1000x aim twos you
guys be the judge I mean they have the
beats logo you'll look cool I guess but
you're sacrificing so much for the logo
and before I think once these go on sale
and cease drop below 300 or about 250 I
think they will be much more worth it
but at 350
they just can't compete with Bose or
Sony alright guys so that is my review
on the Beats Studio 3.0 thank you for
watching
slap that like button if you enjoyed
this video sub if you loved and I will
see you guys in the next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
