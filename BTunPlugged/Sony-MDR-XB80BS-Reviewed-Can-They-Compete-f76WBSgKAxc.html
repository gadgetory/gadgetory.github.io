what guys SBT back here again with
another review today we have a much much
requested sony xba-1
now these have been recommended by you
the viewers the subscribers in my
comments hey BTW check them out what do
you think of them review them for us
please so here we are today with the
review before we begin don't forget to
hit that subscribe button for more
videos like these in the future now
without any further ado let's start the
review first let's start with a comfort
and design now if you have ever tried
some Sony headphones before you will not
find any differences here the ear tips
are exactly the same as the older ones
and that's not a bad thing that's a very
very good thing because they are very
contouring to hear they're not heavy
they're not harsh on your ear they're
not cheap feeling they feel very nice
thick enough to give you enough cushion
to where you don't feel like they're
gonna be irritating these are very
comfortable they block out a good amount
of sound and I'm very pleased with the
ear tip and now for the bad I hate to
say it
Sony has been on a roll with their
headphones and guys they messed up on
the design on these headphones they
tried to make a one size fit all sports
headphone that's not going to move in
your ear or move out of your ear while
you're working out but this is a problem
so you put these in
Oh
okay so let me explain the fatal design
flaw with these headphones and that is
that the silicone hooks on these
headphones are meant to flex and wobble
to create a fit where no matter what
size your ear is you know no matter what
size no matter what way you move these
will always be fitting at least that's
what the idea was but since you have
this big piece on the back and it's hard
they didn't put any cushion on it and
then put any kind of rubberized feel
it's a hard plastic something like you
would feel on a toy now they have this
back here now it's gonna when you move
around the silicone hook is gonna flex
right and it's going to move with you
that part is okay but this back part is
going to keep hitting the back of your
head and the back of your ear going back
and forth and that during my workouts
was the most annoying thing ever it was
annoying
now after a while like I used to it
because I had to and I forgot about it
cuz I was so into my workout but it was
still a problem and not only business
cost flex here but it also causes flex
with the earbud now that year but I
didn't feel like come out or move but
the next day when I woke up my ears were
so irritated I was literally waking up
rubbing my ears because they were so
irritated from the earbud being in my
ear and this part flexing it's not a
good design period maybe if they made
this part back here where the receiver
and the USB and the controls are they
made it some kind of soft rubber
material it would have been a lot better
or use the silicone here
that they used up here and at least
cover it that would have made these more
comfortable but I feel like they need a
design change on these for sure now
let's move on to the buttons the buttons
I feel were too small they put them on
here they have these big pieces on the
end of the silicon hooks work right why
not put bigger button so that when
you're feeling around and you're like oh
crap I need to change the song you can
find it
I had to fill around and feel it as
impressive not only that it just it
feels very weird it's a very weird
button I don't know how to explain it
they're too small they should have been
bigger now they have a press play
forward and back and the forward and
back double as a volume up and down one
thing I did like about these headphones
is the little slider in the back to
slide these up and down your neck it
feels really nice and I like this design
it's it stays in place and it keeps your
headphones nice and tidy on the back of
your neck it's a simple fix I really
like this now the effect I was trying to
give with the water and the penny effect
was that when you drop the bass in a
song into the water the water ripples
you get that initial bass and then you
get a ripple of sound afterwards that
resonance and that is what you get with
these headphones know that going into
these headphones that they're going to
be over-exaggerated on the base and it's
almost artificial but it's made to be
that way to be fun for the listener so
if you're extreme bass head these are
going to be for you they come they hit
and then it gives you kind of like a
rippling effect it stays that bass stays
the vocals are great
the highs suffer somewhat because of
this and the bass because that ripple
kind of takes over any other instruments
and sounds that may be coming on the
high
and but the vocal stay very clear to buy
these knowing that they're going to have
that extra bass keep in mind that these
are not going to be the most accurate
headphones so these are going to go
great with bass jazz whenever they hit a
guitar that guitar strum that bass drum
it just really resonates and it stays
the call quality was very very bad
now the mic because it doesn't have a
remote anywhere along the cord now the
mic is on the back of the earpiece so
think about it if you're going to be
projecting this way and the mic is going
to be back here what's going to happen
it's not going to really pick up
anything that's going forward it's going
to pick up everything behind you so it's
going to sound very covered it's going
to sound covered by your ear and if you
have a hat on it's going to be blocked
even more check out the top really
really loud with these headphones these
are not going to be the best for calls
so if that is something that is very
important to you
these are definitely a skip the battery
life is decent it's rated at 7 hours and
7 hours is about what you get now today
a lot of companies are pushing 8 you
know even Apple and beads are pushing it
12 so I feel like Sony with the next
generation of these headphones can work
on the battery life and getting it up to
that at least eight hours standard
that's kind of been around for a little
bit the connectivity was also great so
these have high quality Bluetooth LD AC
which helps transmit those high quality
songs from your phone to your ear phones
without any quality loss so I have I
know I get a lot of questions about
oh and Roe vs. iPhone these work great
with both I have a Galaxy s5 the user
work and I have iPhone 7 plus that I use
for personal so these work great with
both they sound the same on both you
guys will not be disappointed either way
so what do I think about these
headphones
I'd say guys skip over them get the
j-bird x3 or the bow sound sport
wireless headphones they get much better
quality for price and you get the remote
which I feel like it's necessary but I
am very thankful for these headphones
because they showed me that sports
headphones a wireless earbuds in general
they need a remote on the cord just for
call quality for just ease of use with
the going back and forth or volume or
pressing play or accepting calls it's
just a lot easier to have it right there
it's not going to be in your way it's
not going to be in your way
and you're going to be able to get
better call quality overall so thank you
