give up what is up guys and PC back here
again with another video a video
inspired by a subscriber who asked me
what am i listening to my music through
so that's what this video is going to be
about and hopefully this video can
inspire you guys to go out and create
your own audio setup so as of last week
I've been using my macbook pro 2016 as
my main audio source it actually sounds
really good compared to my desktop PC
which I was using before now Apple
probably put in a amazing audio chip
into this I couldn't find any
information on what they did or what
they put in it so since the MacBook Pro
is for pros and that a lot of DJ's are
going to be using this for music I would
assume that they put in a great audio
chip into this laptop I think I couldn't
find any information on it so we kind of
just have to go with it sounds good for
now
now I listen to a majority of my music
on Spotify I know a lot of people like
to listen to flat and all these high-end
music files but it's kind of a hassle to
kind of go and search for all the music
that I want to listen to when I want to
listen to it and on-demand so usually I
just go with Spotify and usually it it's
pretty good it's pretty good quality
occasionally there's going to be a
little older remastered songs that don't
sound as good
I also use programs like SoundCloud and
YouTube occasionally now from my MacBook
Pro there's four USB C port so I had to
get a who to which is an adapter that
has three USB 3.0 ports on it and I
connect my amp deck to the whoo - I
thought you were ready to give up so
this does let's talk about my aunt deck
the cord mojo now I got this thing three
weeks ago and it has blown my mind it is
exactly what I wanted it was warm it's
basically it's punchy all of the things
that you would want in a great-aunt deck
at least for me in my taste now I
connect my cord mojo to my max with via
a USB 3.0 and what this does is it's a
deck which stands for digital analog
converter so take those zeros and ones
from the MacBook and it turns it into an
analog form which then I can consume
through my ears to keep it short now
depending on what kind of app deck you
have it can give your headphones a whole
new life and that's what it did it made
my lcd twos come to life now it has to
 magna - and it was okay it's really
hollow sounding
tubular sounding as they say but when I
got the cord mojo it's a very full
sounding headphone and I've just been
falling in love with it and this thing
can power headphones up to 800 ohms
which is just insane so it's going to be
powering electrostatic headphones for
years to come for me I don't think I
need to be upgrading it's a great end
game at that so for five hundred dollars
this thing is a very extensive I know
for most people
is going to be a lot so what I'm going
to do is I'm going to put ants conduct
down in the description that are a
little bit more affordable and that can
get your guys's foot in the door if
you're just starting off with your audio
setup but for five hundred dollars
this thing's competes with ants and acts
three times worth its price so it's
worth its weight in gold it's also
affordable which is another plus since I
have the MacBook I could take it into my
living room I could take it to a
Starbucks and have great music on a
plane anywhere that I want to go it says
ten hours but I've been getting about
four hours so think it is what it is
next up let's talk about the LCD - now
these have been my daily drivers these
are what I listen to all of my music on
and what I compare all of my headphones
that I get in for review with now these
are going to be steep as well these are
running for about $1,000 I didn't pay a
thousand dollars for them I got a beef
stock version which is a used slightly
used version for five hundred dollars so
I'm going to chalk that up as a win as
much as I can for spending five hundred
dollars but they've been great I've
really enjoyed using them and comparing
other headphones to them I felt like I
needed a good reference headphones so
that I'm not just blindly reviewing
headphones I can kind of compare them to
these vice-versa and say you know these
are actually kind of close to a thousand
dollar pair of headphones or I can kind
of gauge or put them on a scale with
these headphones so that was one of the
main reasons why I bought these
headphones and also it features planar
technology which features less
distortion so if you're coming from
beats that are dynamic headphones those
have a lot of static at the high end
these not so much never that they're
great for movies they're so so for
gaming the sound stage isn't as wide as
I like sometimes my student has their
five nine eight are a little bit wider
but these are still great I get a lot of
soundstage a lot of separation a lot of
clarity the bass is accurate the mids
are accurate
the highs are accurate so all in all
this is a great headphone all-around for
any type of genre that you're listening
to although they do suffer sometimes
when I listen to EB M so I might have to
pick up another pair of headphones we'll
see now these are going to be an open
back design so they are going to leak
sound so they're not the best for
traveling or going to a Starbucks or a
library you might want to look into a
closed back pair of headphones which I
will have some alright guys so that is
my audio setup thank you guys for
watching alright so thank you guys for
watching dude what's up what
looks like we got to do addition to the
family</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
