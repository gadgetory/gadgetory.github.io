with another review now Sony has been
making killer products lately with their
over ear range and Nick been wireless
headphones so I was excited to see that
they would be making some truly wireless
earbuds coming in at $200 the WUF 1000
X's are a direct competitor to the air
pots the Bose fries and the j-bird runs
but they have the added bonus of having
noise cancellation added in
so can Sony take the throne as king of
truly wireless earbuds find out today
before we start off with this review I
just want to thank you guys we hit 4,000
subs this time last year I think I was
roughly around 900 subs so that's is
just amazing thank you guys for all the
support and I hope you see all the
effort that I'm putting in with these
videos now with that out of the way
let's start the review so let's start
off with a comfort and design in the box
you'll find the headphones three sets of
foam tips three sets of silicone tips
two pairs of wings a USB cable and the
charging case foam tips feel like a
hybrid between silicone and foam these
will last you longer than your no moan
foam tips and keep their shape longer
the wings are comfortable but I feel
like I needed a couple more sizes up as
when I have these earbuds in my ear the
wing makes no contact with inside of my
ear it acts more of like a safety net in
case they were to come loose speaking of
coming loose these things do not know
what that even means these are probably
the most secure ear buds out of all the
true wireless earbuds I've tried without
having to jam a big wing portion into
your ear a big part of this is the
weight of the earbuds they are super
lightweight and on the housing you'll
find power button which doubles as a
press play pause button on the left ear
but you can control the noise
cancellation features which we'll get to
later the charging case is a good size
as long it's slim with no protruding
parts for the hinge the hinge does feel
a little bit flimsy and I could see it
possibly breaking if you sit on it when
you press the earbuds into the case they
give a nice click and it's the little
things in life anyways the earbuds light
up to show how much they are charged I
would have liked them to add a couple of
charging dots in there so you can see
how far along the charging is all-in-all
I really enjoy using these earbuds and
they feel like they're just very
polished sound is where I'm a little bit
disappointed though these things are
flat with a slight bump a little baby
bump in the base the highs and mids are
super laid back which I'm not a fan of
definitely not what we've come to expect
from Sony in the past they sound like
your run-of-the-mill
earbuds with no real character to them
listening to these it's like eating a
burger without no sauce at all and just
who does that now one thing that makes
you stand out from other true wireless
earbuds is that they have noise
cancellation added in
it's a nice touch but it doesn't make a
huge difference but it does more than
not having it at all if that makes sense
to you guys
when I use a different ambient most
there really is no difference between
the three options in my opinion I took
these to a crowded cafe and I can still
hear my surroundings definitely not as
strong of noise cancellation as its Big
Brother the WH the 1000 X and twos so if
you're looking for noise cancellation
check out my 1000 X M to review
somewhere around here alright so let's
talk about the connection now as with
all true wireless earbuds lately there's
a lot of latency and delay when you're
starting your music or when watching
YouTube videos if I say oh I want to
skip back 30 seconds into a song it'll
lag even if your music is fully
downloading now I have a theory on why
all true wireless headphones and earbuds
are suffering from this and I'm going to
make a video on it very soon so stay
tuned for that now the battery life
these things feature nine hours of
battery life with a charging case and up
to three hours of playback on one charge
and when you charge them for 15 minutes
you get 75 minutes of listening kind of
week in my opinion and it will be
cutting it close if you are going into
your workout with less than a full
charge so the call quality is terrible
on these things only one earbud works
and provides sound while you're calling
somebody it's a really awkward and the
voice quality isn't that great as is so
how would just avoid these if you want
to use them for important calls alright
so for $200 they are very met in my
opinion nothing really stands out for me
with these earbuds the main things that
I love
about these earbuds are the lightness
and security and the slimness of the
case outside of that nothing really is
mind-blowing and with these I don't
think they will be knocking people's
socks off alright guys so thank you guys
for watching that's gonna be my review
in the WUF 1000 X's I hope you guys have
enjoyed this review hit that thumbs up
button if you haven't already and
subscribe if you haven't as well and I
will see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
