me off a train we get into a fight and
he falls off cops asking why I did this
thing like an L my the three hours I
tell them why don't believe me what's up
guys I'm gonna do two quick quick
motivational Monday what is up guys it's
BTW back again with another motivational
Monday today we're going to be talking
about just being you and that being okay
we're so set on becoming something that
we forget about what we're actually good
at follow what you're good at sometimes
we we take our strengths for granted the
things that we do really really well
that we take for granted you know I
didn't know for instance like you may
see on my channel I do a lot of refuse I
didn't know I was I mean uh I know I was
good at thinking about certain things
but I would didn't know I was good at
reviewing so playing to my strengths i'm
planning to my strengths by doing more
review play To Your Strengths guys
figure out write down on a piece of
paper what you're good at and go and do
those things sometimes it's not about
always bringing up your weaknesses sure
we can work on our weaknesses but at the
end of the day what's gonna make our
even stronger doing what we're great at
and when you do it time and time and
again and you try when you just beat
yourself down for not being XYZ you know
you get tired you get frustrated you're
like why am I not succeeding but you
could be succeeding in all these other
areas and then bring up the lecture
areas later because it and take that
energy that you get from those things
that you're good at bring that over to
your weaknesses and then you bring them
up to it's as easy as that guy so this
week focus on your strengths kill it and
I will see you guys next Monday so thank
you guys for tuning in from the bottom
of my heart I will see you guys at the
next video
