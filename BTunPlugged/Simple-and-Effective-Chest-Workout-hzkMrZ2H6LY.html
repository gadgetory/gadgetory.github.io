commentary as promised i know it's been
a while and i've had people ask me
where's next workout video so without
any further ado here we go first off you
know me I like to start off with the
incline press so we hit I'd like to go a
little bit heavier on this six to ten
reps really bringing the elbows in
together at the top instead of the
dumbbells in the hands almost pretending
like you're pushing through your elbows
and that'll help you fill it a lot more
in your chest next up since I'm trying
to focus on my upper chest always since
it's always going to be like a lacking
body part i guess for most people and
it's the hardest workout we did incline
flies i'm going to go a little bit
higher reps with these 10 to 12 reps
really bringing as you can see my elbows
are coming back almost behind a hit and
then up over my face so as you can see
i'm oh it's almost like you're opening
your chest it's a little weird at first
and a lot of people bring it down to
their size but you want to go back you
know almost like the angle of your chest
you know how your chest comes at an
angle off your body that's the angle you
want to press with and as you can see
I'm doing it here with the flat bitch as
well I'm kind of bringing it back and
then bringing it pushing it forward up
over my chest and then for good measure
I did some close grip bench press to end
it off only got about five reps but you
know at that point she's burning out the
chest next up we have the dips and with
these I was freaking done so as you can
see I'm kind of trying to hop up and try
and get all the move into my can't you
know and I don't advocate cheating on
any movements but sometimes it's
necessary during the end of the workout
your body part is done and you just want
to get those extra reps and burn it out
then go ahead next up we have F st7
cables and I did seven cable crossovers
and then seven presses
and then I moved on to an incline push
up using this little stool over here and
between each one of these rounds I did a
30 second rest and that pretty much I've
been using this to finish on my chest
every single week and it's been working
really well so give it a try let me know
in the comments how you guys feel about
the workout and I will see you next time
BTW out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
