welcome back to my Channel today I want
to kind of talk about what my channel is
about you know you see a lot of
different things on my channel fitness
vlogs daily vlogs text of things that
this things that I enjoy these are all
things that I enjoy motivation and what
I try to do is is just add some kind of
value to your guys's life the best way I
can whether that be through harsh
critiques of products that like other
people won't say you know motivating you
guys to do better in life just life
skills whatever things that I've learned
and that have helped me now today I have
a topic of wanting to talk to you about
how to feel more comfortable in social
situations would that be like at a club
party family gathering at work having a
meeting things like that and I'm
introverted so I'm always in my head I'm
always thinking of way things can be
improved on and how I can do better and
sometimes that gets in the way of giving
you that swag that confidence that comes
along with being present in the moment
so what I do is what I've done recently
is I've learned to feel my feet it's
really weird and it really sounds very
simple but it's really a groundbreaking
idea no pun intended so what I like to
do is when I'm walking let's see i'm
walking in a club or I'm walking at a
family gathering or meeting new people
for the first time I feel my feet as I'm
walking now this takes this does two
things it takes your head out of the
game and it keeps you present to the
moment and therefore more charismatic
with people more confidence you come off
as more confident more sure of yourself
and sometimes you try to will our way
try to think our way to call
try to be more confident but what does I
do that puts us in her head and the
people are like why is this guy not
talking why is does he seem like he's
off so he's not here and then people
don't want to talk to you they want to
talk to people that are present engaged
having fun conversations with them this
is a way to do it even when you're
standing there stand and fill your feet
on the ground while you're talking to
somebody I guarantee you'll notice a big
change when people will respond to you
better its work miracles for me I know
I'll do the same for you and also too
I've used this at work during meetings
during a boring meeting let's say my
mind must wander off or I'm doing a task
at work bored now I must wonder if I
plant my feet on the ground it's kind of
like you're staying grounded right
you're staying grounded you ever feet
planted firmly on the ground you feel on
the ground and you're more engaged with
the meetings you're more engaged with
the people your bosses will like you
more it's a lot of benefits try it out
see let me know in the comments below
like what you found that this technique
does for you this is just what has
worked for me and it's a simple way a
lot of people try to like make these
long videos about oh you need to be
doing this need to think this way you do
that and we it's just like one more
thing right and when you're out there in
the real world you like um what was that
thing that YouTube video said what is
that thing no just feel your feet on the
ground and I guarantee you you will be
more charismatic in no type I guarantee
it alright guys so that's going to do it
for this video very simple keep your
feet on the ground stay grounded it'll
bring you out of your your head and more
be more charismatic with people try this
simple technique and I will talk to you
guys in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
