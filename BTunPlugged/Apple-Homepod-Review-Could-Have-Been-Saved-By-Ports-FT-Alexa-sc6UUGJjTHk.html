with another review the Apple home pod
has been debated all over the internet
recently the current landscape around
this home pod the speaker this Apple
speaker is that it is dumb and while
that may be true
compared to other speakers and smart
home devices I do think that there is
some value here but Apple did miss the
mark on a lot of things this is a super
nice product this is even separating
Apple sheeps from Apple sheeps that's
how deep this device goes so I'm not
gonna waste any more of your guys's time
this is going to be for people that are
in the Apple ecosystem but not only that
you have to enjoy Siri and use it on a
daily basis so that you know what you're
getting into you have to be involved
with Apple music or you have to not ask
for device many questions just in
general and on a fifth point a fifth
point is if you like to control your
home with your device that's another key
point so if that is you then this device
could be for you if you're an Android
user if you want to plug this into a
speaker system or a TV or a laptop that
is not Apple you're out of luck which it
kind of sucks
you see Apple tried to make a good
speaker which they accomplished they
made a great speaker this thing sounds
amazing
the bass is great the mids are great the
seven tweeters are amazing hey Siri play
songs by the Foo Fighters sure here's a
personalized station of Foo Fighters
the a8 chip really works well with this
device to control that subwoofer and the
bass on this thing is like no other
speaker on the market that I've heard
smart home speaker to be exact so from a
speaker from a sound aspect this thing
sounds amazing
and it's marketed more as a speaker than
a smartphone because Apple will never
have amazon's backing they won't have
audible they won't have a lot of these
apps that Alexa's doing making it an
incredible device Alexa can do
everything it's a speaker it's a smart
home it's you can order apps you can
order food you can order a lot of
different things whereas Siri is very
limited and that's no fault of apples I
mean they can only do so much they can't
connect this to an Amazon store they'll
get sued so I feel like home pod to home
pad to as three 3s whatever they're
gonna make of this will never be as good
as Alexa in the echo series that being
said if we are going to move this more
towards a speaker side it also misses
the mark because there's no aux cord
I know Apple is just taking away
everything with their minimalism they
want to just they just want to minimize
us down to using one port one thing
Bluetooth in this case and it doesn't
work if they would added a aux cord or
an RCA cord I would recommend the
speaker because there is a lot that you
can do with that you can hook it up to
your sound system your PC you can make
whatever you want they're gonna add in
later on a way to add to home pods so
that you can create a kind of surround
system which would have been amazing but
they didn't do that and if you're going
to make this a speaker make it a good
speaker if you can't compete on an app
front if you can't compete on a store
front which you can't Apple then at
least make this a great speaker that's
all they have to do instead they made it
a very nice product and through that
they've even made it smaller because
only a certain amount of people use Siri
like Siri even to that extent and they
have it work in the way that they want
we couldn't say so for the past week
I've tried to use the haunt pod over my
echo from Amazon and I miss it I miss my
echo because the home pod is just not as
good
whether that's asking questions the
Serie whether that's just getting my
turning my lights on it's just not as
good and for 350 it's leaving people a
little bit flustered and which is
totally understandable I do think you're
paying that Apple tax on this Wow
the speaker is incredible it has that
spatial awareness it has a lot of
different features they didn't make it a
speaker they made it a Apple speaker and
this ruined the product go back to the
drawing board Apple add some ports on
here and this thing if people are gonna
use it for the Siri at least they will
have a bomb sound system
until then I'm sticking with Alexa my
main girl so that's just that but
anyways guys that is gonna do it for
this review I hope you guys have enjoyed
this video there's gonna be more videos
to come I'm currently shooting a lot so
expect more very very soon all right
guys
thank you guys for watching don't forget
to hit that sub button if you haven't
already hit the like button are there
any more buttons I don't know I think
that's it that would be much appreciated
thank you guys for all your support I
will see you guys in the next video it's
been your boy BT saying peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
