another battle a battle that I didn't
want to do but you guys kind of forced
my hand
a lot of people have been asking for
this review of this battle and I don't
really see how these two compare per se
but I can't see how people might be
deciding between the two I don't think
they're direct competitors but they are
competing for your money at the end of
the day right and that is between the
beat sex and the air pods two of my
favorite favorite wireless headphones on
the market today each with their own
unique style comfort sound and we're
gonna get into all that today to help
you guys make a decision now when it
comes to comfort and design these two
are completely different now the beat
six has a great neck band a stays in
place it's great for work it's great for
the gym it's just great all around they
also use the silicon tips which give you
a lot of isolation they also have wings
that keep them in your ear all very
lightweight it's just the materials that
they use are very quality that's the
best way to put it the materials that
they use are very quality that's the
best way to put it so stick to your neck
it doesn't get caught I haven't found it
to be a problem for me I do running I do
sprints I do biking I do Stairmaster I
do all those things and I haven't had
them bounce to the point where my
earphones will come out so if you're
worried about that worry no more now
they're a box on the other hand to come
in this cool little charging case very
sleep which slips right into your pocket
great they also don't have any
connecting parts they're just two single
earbuds which are nice and a lot of
people will rag on these for
having that longer stem compared to the
regular earbuds that Apple puts out but
you have to realize that there's a
receiver there's a mic in there so there
has to be some kind of compromise and
they did their best to put in a small
enough package and honestly I don't
think you want them that small because
if they're really small they're gonna
fall out and in this case these do not
fall out at all hey guys I have never
had these fall out on me once not about
doing stuff while jimmying well anything
they just haven't come out and I know a
lot of people the first thing that they
do when they see me wearing them is do
they fall out and my answer is always no
now keep in mind if you're trying to use
this for the gym they do let in a lot of
sound because of their design they're
just like the old Apple earbuds so
they're gonna let in sound so just be
aware of that but they do get loud
enough to kind of block out a lot of the
sound around you if I had to choose for
comfort at winter it would have to be
the air pods they're just there's no
moving parts it's just a - ear buds and
they work really really well and they
stay in your ear really really well so
those are my winners for the comfort and
design round now let's move on to this
sound now this is where the ear pods are
really surprised it's not like Apple
just gave us this $160 product of their
old here but it's sound quality no they
revamped the sound in these guys and
they are very very rich I'm sure some of
you have gone to an Apple store and
there's just something about that
mysterio butts and everything just
sounds good they have their iPods
they're playing high-quality music and
that's what these remind me of it
reminds me of that classic Apple rich
headphone design and I was pleasantly
surprised I didn't think that they put
this great of sound quality into these
but they really did the bass is good the
mids are good the highs are good it's
just very very clean a very clean
experience now let's move on to the
beats X the beats X are very focused on
the highs so much so that they can kind
of hurt your ears but I did notice that
after I've burned these in for hours and
hours that it's kind of tamed itself but
they are very very clean
the mitts are great the base I will say
that people will find that peace will be
lacking if you are a basic so just keep
that in mind if you're a base head but
overall if I have to choose one again it
would be the air pots they just sound so
rich and putting them on they sound
better than a lot of the headphones and
the ear buds that are fu much don't tell
anybody that because you will send an
army of people after me but it's the
truth
Apple did these really really well so
these are my winner for the sound round
let's talk about the battery life now
the beat six come with eight hours wear
out of the box they have a quick charge
15 minutes for two hours which is really
great if you forget to charge them
alright so Apple gives you five hours of
battery life with the air pods which is
great considering its small package and
when pairing that with the case you get
over 24 hours of play now just 15
minutes in the case gives you three
hours of play which is insane and I
haven't run into the problem of having
to charge these on the go it just works
I thought it would be a hassle to keep
popping these into the case but it's so
nice just to pop them in there leave
them in your pocket do whatever you got
to do come back to the case and it's all
there waiting for you so in the battery
life round that's a tough one I'm gonna
have to say it's a tie because the b6
have the longer charging hold but then
also too with the charging case and the
being able to slip into your pocket it's
very nice having their pots with you at
all times so let's talk about the
connectivity now the connectivity of the
beats X is better than the air pods
testing this out I was able to go
further away from my phone using the
beats X I didn't measure any steps or
anything like that but it's just a
real-world experience and using these I
know which ones I can go further with
now the call quality is great on both
but Apple really outdid themselves on
the air pods these are made to be an
everyday headphone they have the same
quality that we've come to expect and
love from the Apple earbuds so this
route goes to the air pause again
alright guys so in conclusion my
favorite headphones
the ones that I would pick if I had to
choose between the two would be the air
pods if you can get your hands on them
they're just the package alone is just
insane I thought they were gonna be
overhyped
I thought I'd return them or give them
away these things don't leave me guys
these don't leave me these are one of
the best products I've ever put my hands
on and you can quote me on that you can
go out try these
let me know what you think spend a week
with them and just be amazed be amazed
telling you Apple
outdid themselves on these all right
