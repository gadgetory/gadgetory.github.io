with another review today we're gonna be
looking at my new speakers I have to go
Wyatt for this review i'm using my
wide-angle lens I had to get both of
these beauties in here these are my
newest speakers to Yamaha hs8
these things are incredible so I had to
do a review just on them I was gonna do
a setup tour but these things are so
good that I had to make a full review on
them on their own so let me tell you
guys a little bit about these studio
monitors these are great because they
give you very accurate sound they're not
gonna really color your sound at all
that is what I wanted them for because
when I'm editing and eventually I want
to get into like producing my own music
for these videos I would be really cool
right just a whole production just on
this channel would be amazing I want to
get to that point when I have more time
but for now just editing these videos
and getting clear-cut sound hearing what
you guys hear is very important so I've
picked these up and these things have
been amazing for editing so on the back
you're gonna find an x ll port you're
gonna find a TRS phone jack which you
can just plug like your normal 3.5
milimeter jacks in there and go out to
your sound whatever you have I have them
going into my computer through the XLR
cables and these things have not
disappointed they also feature on the
back what I like about these is they
have room control so you can if your
room is getting a little bit too bassy
or the ku6 or messed up you can flip the
switch and it will reduce that greatly
as for the speaker's themselves they
have a one-inch tweeter up top and an 8
inch subwoofer on the bottom and these
things are blooming don't don't let the
non colored music fool you these are
accurate but accurate doesn't mean bad
these things smash the songs and I like
to really spread out my speakers because
it gives me that like 3d left-right
instrumental kicks here and there and
it's just an amazing experience and even
like watching movies and things like
that are just simply a pleasure to do
with these and it's something that
sometimes you can't get with headphones
sometimes you don't want to wear
anything you just want to come back you
want to come home sit back in your chair
and just enjoy some great music one
thing I do want to mention is that they
do have smaller versions of these if you
guys are interested in picking them up
or these have the HS seven which have a
7 inch subwoofer and they have a 5 inch
which has a 5 inch woofer as well so the
HS 5 ages 7 and these are the HS h i've
heard great things about all of them so
if you whatever your space permits I
would definitely recommend looking into
getting some of these just for you know
your computer setup your Mac setup
whatever it just sounds really really
good and these have been a welcome
addition to my set up I just love them
dearly I don't know how I went so long
without having just full-blown speakers
in my room so amazing job Yamaha I love
these things to death before I go I just
want to mention that these are Zen e
stands that they are on top of these
also get a great mention because these
things have been solid for me they look
very aesthetic they look very clean and
modern and the speakers just sit right
on top of these stands and they don't
move it's crazy I would think that would
fall over but they've been solid for me
and I can't recommend them and again I
will be linking all of this stuff down
below for my setup so you guys can make
a setup like this of your own alright
guys so if you don't already have some
speakers I definitely recommend getting
some for your home stereo system or
setup or whatever you have going on
definitely look into it because it
really changed my life as well so thank
you guys for watching let me know if you
guys enjoyed this video down below and I
will see you guys in the next video
