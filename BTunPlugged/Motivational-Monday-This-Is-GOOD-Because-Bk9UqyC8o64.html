with another motivational Monday today
I'm going to be talking to you guys
about perspective and how we can use
phrases to get into a positive mind
state which then help us to make more
positive actions now let's say your car
breaks down and you get a flat tire
what's the first thing that goes to your
head right now oh my god this sucks the
money but what if you say to yourself
this question this is good because this
is good because you may say well maybe I
wasn't going 80 miles per hour when it
happened maybe I was only going 15 in a
school zone and I'm okay everybody in my
car is ok we're able to walk away from
this now I can get a tire I could fix it
we're now I don't have to worry about it
for another five years yeah the money
sucks but this is a good thing this is
going to help my car run better and be
safer so use this in any facet of your
life anytime anything bad happens or
anytime you're annoyed by something or
something happens that you don't like
use this phrase this is good because and
it will get you into another mine state
which will in turn help you create more
positive action in your life so try this
small technique out this week and let me
know how it goes in the comments below
thank you guys for watching thank you to
all the new subscribers all the old
