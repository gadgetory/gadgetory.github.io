with another motivational Monday
tomorrow is a holiday but we're gonna
kill it anyways because that's what we
do today I want to talk to you guys
about beginner's luck now let's say you
start a diet and those first ten pounds
are really really good you they come off
within a couple weeks two to three weeks
and then all of a sudden nothing or
point five pounds come off or a pound
comes off and it's not what you're
expecting now there's something in the
universe that wants you to succeed so it
gives you a taste but success is so when
you have those big jumps in weight loss
that's what I did end once you have that
and you taste it you're going to want
more of it and it's to show you that you
can do it a lot of people when they get
the beginner's luck and say it was so
easy and then they hit a roadblock where
they hit obstacles then what happens
they stop this is to give you a taste of
what the in taste like is not the whole
thing it's like a piece of cake because
you guys just a very very tiny slice of
the cake and put the actual cakes at the
end so it gives you a piece now and it
says you can have more than this at the
end but all you have to do is go through
these obstacles so once you hit those
obstacles you'll be thinking man that
slice of cake it tasted so good in the
beginning this obstacle will not stop me
from getting the rest of that cake and
then that small piece of cake will take
you through all of the obstacles and all
of the BS that you need to
accomplish your goals so start seeing
this in your life start seeing where
something in this world wants you to
succeed you have to come with that
mindset something wants you to succeed
and there's going to give you a little
taste now that's an indication that you
should be doing it well when things get
hard remember that cake alright guys so
take this kill this week as always I
will see you guys next week in the next
video I love you guys more videos to
come before I endless I got more vlogs I
got the Fitbit charge to coming I think
you guys are really gonna like that one
I'm gonna destroy that video I'm gonna
like I want to make a really really good
video for you guys so definitely check
it out I will see you guys next Monday p
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
