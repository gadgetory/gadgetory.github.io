of me
hey take it man
guys is BT back here again with another
battle today it's all about that bass no
trouble as they say we have the school
can t pressure Wireless coming in at 180
and we have the sony xba-1 coming in at
about 250 bucks now this is a battle to
the bass of ridiculous crazy amounts of
bass these both have it so who did it
better let's figure it out looks can be
deceiving and the Sony's are actually
lighter than the school Candy's even
with these huge ear cups both have metal
bands and their headbands to protect our
breaks and cracks which I really
appreciate I prefer the low profile
design of the school to candies just a
little bit more and I'm not the Sony's
around more times than I like to admit
but the low profile of the school candy
does come at a cost because it is a very
tight on your head it gives you a lot of
isolation but your face your head is
going to be smashed 12 candies are gonna
be a little bit better for the gym
whereas so knees are just gonna be great
for everyday wearing okay just get
unbearable after about an hour where is
it so nice I can wear them for hours and
that makes a huge difference in whether
you like a pair of headphones or not so
that could be a deal-breaker for most
people and I prefer the trigger system
to skip tracks and the separate volume
button says sony has over the standard
three blend system that the school
candies have but I do like that the
school can pressures have the volume
button in the respective shapes making
it easy to navigate when you can't see
the school can use have a base ladder
which is nice for on-the-fly changes to
the base whereas the Sony's they just
have a button and you have to go into
their app to change it so that's just
one more step one thing I don't like
about the school Candy's is that they
have a wire
as a band and that's prone to give you
shorts and you losing money so this
round I have to go with the Sony's for
the comfort and the style they just do
it for me they're a little bit on the
bigger side but I can make do with that
now for the moment we've all been
waiting for a crazy and those as this is
I do think that the Skullcandy crushers
do sound a little bit clear out of the
box don't shoot the messenger I'm just
reporting to guys what I found they
sound a little bit clearer to me than
the Sony xb9 50s now that could be
because the noise cancellation gets in
the way you know a place that white
noise for the most part the sony's they
sound good
but these skull candies they really
sounded and the heisman aids now let's
get on with the bass the bass this is
what we came here for now the school
candies they're only good for certain
genres the bass slider is only good for
certain genres now that's gonna be for
rap R&amp;amp;B hip hop EDM anything that's very
basic anything that has a nice but it's
not a main focal point so let's say
classical jazz rock things like that
it's gonna sound very hollow and it
sounds very fake and I don't like
listening to songs with the Skullcandy
pressures with the bass lighter up so I
have to turn it off completely
now with the Sony's they keep the bass
up but they sound great with all genres
and that's where the difference comes
the the base with the Sony's and the
extra bass it's crazy it rumbles not as
much as to school candies but it does
provide more accurate sounding bass and
bass that's actually bearable but the
Skullcandy crushers I feel like there's
almost too much air coming against your
eardrum and it almost becomes unbearable
it's cool to show your friends and to
wow them but after that it kind of
leaves you with the feeling of this
too much but it's nice if they actually
at the slider so you can tone it down
but who wants to tone it down we want
that base all the way up right guys so
if you want the base we've got that
extra base sound that really just does
it for you then you have to get the
Sony's so they are my pick for the sound
round alright so let's just talk about
connectivity now the connectivity for
the Sony's is a lot better they just
connect through devices seamlessly I've
had some kind of issues with the school
Candy's not connecting on the first try
it with my iPhone so I have to give this
round to the sellers I was talking about
battery life now this is where the
school candies are amazing forty hours
of battery life they're killing it
whereas the Sony's have twenty five
hours of battery which is really good
but not as good as the school can use
forty hours you can't beat that so all
in all you guys asked me for a winner
and the ones that I can recommend is the
sony xba-1 you get the noise
cancellation for seventy dollars more
the base the extra base that you get is
actually clear and it's it's more
controlled so that you can enjoy it
whereas a school candies they go a
little bit overboard with the base it's
fun don't get me wrong they're fun
headphones but at the end of the day
there can only be one winner and I have
to choose a Sony xb9 50 and one to break
them into you guys alright guys so
that's gonna be my time for this week i
will see you guys this week so that has
been my time guys i hope you guys have
enjoyed this battle let me know if you
