again with another motivational Monday
today I want to talk to you guys about
not giving up now this week has been
really rough I've recorded my last
review four different times for
different times there was something
wrong with each one of these videos so
idea of recording it a fifth time and
during that time I I start realizing
like I want to give up I was getting
annoyed I didn't want to do it anymore I
just want to scrap the whole video I
started wondering like maybe this video
just isn't meant to be I know some of
you may be feeling this way with other
things school work all of the above and
I just want to say guys sometimes just
power through power through you know
don't give up on yourself
don't get frustrated with yourself
there's always going to be barriers
there's going to be people that that
come in your way
that annoy you that want to zap your
energy and there's just things I always
want to make us give up and it's it's
easy to give up it's easy that's the
easy thing to do and sometimes you have
to look at the glass half full as I say
so try to I when I was having these
troubles I start to say like you know it
I'm going to make this video better than
the previous four times that I've
recorded it I'm going to add each time I
was trying to make it better better
better somehow some way so you know by
the fifth time I tried to knock out all
the kinks and I made it better than that
first time that I did
it so I took something positive out of
it and you guys came to whatever you're
going to try to look at it half-full and
that attitude will get you to your goals
and push you past barriers faster than
if you were to just give up obviously
because you'd be giving up right so this
week notice when you feel like you want
to give up and turn it into something
positive try to spin it so that you can
learn from it maybe make your product
better make your work better make your
your papers or your tests that you have
to take better so thank you guys for
watching try this tip out don't forget

you guys for the next</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
