with another review today I'm going to
be helping you guys figure out do you
need noise cancellation a big question
that I get asked a lot in the comments
so I thought I'd make a video helping
out people that are maybe either
searching for a new pair of wireless
headphones are wired even and kind of
clarify what noise isolation is what
noise cancellation does active and
passive I'm gonna answer it all in this
video to help you guys make a decision
on what you need to buy ok so first off
we have noise isolation and today I have
with me the v-moda crossfade Wireless
twos one of my highly regarded
headphones sound quality wise and these
do not have noise cancellation but they
do have a lot of sound isolation so what
sound isolation does is it kind of
creates a clamp on your head
using force right these have a lot of
force to press down to make a
environment where you're isolated from
the outside world it doesn't have any
other sounds being played it's just a
music and the ear cups that create that
effect very simple and this is what
you're going to see on most headphones
that don't have noise cancellation the
benefits of having the sound isolation
and no noise cancellation is that the
sound quality is going to be a lot
better so if you're big on just having
the best sound possible then these are
gonna be for you although I can't
recommend it really for traveling I
thought I could get away with it on one
of my trips from California to New York
now six hours and it was dreadful I had
the engine noise in my ear the whole
entire time and I think I had the Sony
XD 950 B ones I believe so don't count
on those isolation blocking out engine
noise or sounds while you're traveling
but they are great for the gym if you
need to kind of hear your surroundings
but not really these are gonna be the
ones for you maybe you want them for
running
cetera now next up I don't have any
passive noise cancellation headphones
but some that I will say are marketed as
active noise cancellation but are really
just passive noise cancellation is the
Beats Studio 2 point nose now these are
a great pair of headphones I really like
these I think it's the best product that
beats me before Apple bought them how
but what they do is it's just passive is
they play a generalized background white
noise to cancel out sounds in your
environment so if you can already tell
this can create kind of a problem
because not only does it affect your
music it's not as clear number two is
it's not gonna block out everything and
even if you have a different kind of
sound coming in that the headphone isn't
tuned to block out you're still gonna
encounter those sounds coming through
into your headphones now moving on to
everybody's favorite a fan favorite the
bose qc25 a lot of people love these
they're highly regarded as a great
travel headphone I myself enjoy them a
lot and one thing that I really like
about the Bose is that they kind of keep
the sound quality there while giving you
guys the noise cancellation the great
noise cancellation that they've always
been known for so what active noise
cancellation does is it plays the
180-degree alternative sound to what is
coming through from your environment and
it plays of that sound through your
headphones with your music and it does
this by listening to your outside
environment through a little mic on the
outside of the headphone and it comes in
and then it plays out 180 degree noise
to block out the sound
hence the north cancellation now as you
can tell that's really good so it can
block out numerous amounts of sounds and
a wide variety of sounds whereas the
passive can only do a generalized sound
but it all sounds green dandy right it's
all roses and flowers and all that stuff
no it's not so the one weakness if you
haven't guessed already is that
quicksand sounds cannot be picked up
and produce the alternative sound very
fast now the technology for active noise
cancellation is getting better but it's
still not completely there and that's
why people in my comments say I can
still hear people talking I still hear
babies crying here are people jumping
plates in my kitchen those things are
gonna get through because they're quick
sudden sounds and those quick and Sun
sounds will get through because the the
headphones cannot react as fast but on
the flip side the positives are that
these are great for traveling so engine
noise para noise anything with a hum to
it or a consistent sound then these
headphones will block out the noise so
let's say you hear a baby crying the
first two cries are probably going to be
heard by you then after a while the
headphones are gonna start to pick it up
pick up the signal and then send that
opposite signal through your headphones
and put that with your music thus
blocking out the sound so keep that in
mind whenever you are looking for active
noise cancellation headphones don't just
throw them away because you hear a
couple of things here and there it's
gonna happen so which one is for you do
enjoy the sound quality of the isolation
or do you like the passive headphones
where it just always plays a sound and
it'll always try to block out the most
sound but then you lose a little bit of
sound quality or do enjoy the active
noise cancellation which is a little bit
slower
to react to different sounds but it will
block out the most variety of SAP the
choice is up to you now for me my
recommendation is if we're home
listening I would just go for something
like the v-moda or travel I would go for
something like the bose qc25
and that's my opinion with the passive
noise cancellation I feel like you've
sacrificed too much sound quality for
the noise cancellation so the active
noise cancellation is a good medium
between sound quality and noise
cancellation so if I had to had to
choose one I think I would go with the
Bose QC 35 for the active noise
cancellation because it still keeps that
the the quality of the music high while
giving you the active noise cancellation
and keep in mind that these cost 350 the
both QC 35 cost 350
so you're getting a little bit more
featured with this and a little bit more
wow factor alright guys so let me know
down in the comments below what you
prefer do you like the isolation do you
like the active noise cancellation do
you own either let me know down in the
comments below and I will see you guys
in the next review always remember to
keep it fun guys I will see you again</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
