with another review today we have an
update to my setup and it's something
that's often overlooked and that is a
good productivity competing chair the
one that I picked up is the Steelcase
Leap version one now if you've been
following me for a while you know that
I've had the ikea market since the
beginning of time I've done most of my
reviews out of that chair and after a
while the mesh on the back start to give
out is start to get loose the lumbar
support wasn't in the correct position
for somebody of my height so it wasn't
really adjustable it was kind of a one
size fits all and of course you know one
size fits all you can run into some
problems you know there's not a lot of
adjustability with that chair while I do
think it's a great chair for the value I
think that your money can go a little
bit further with something more
adjustable and so here we are
the Steelcase lead version one a very
adjustable chair when I sat in it I knew
that I had to have it now picked it up
from a consignment store for about 125
bucks so I know they go for about five
to six hundred so it's not really
comparable to the IKEA Marcus but you
know what go try to find a used one if
you can or go to a consignment store
pick up one for cheap I mean why not
so for me my back bucks to take over a
lot in my day to day life whether it's
just walking around lifting my back
takes a punishment and so I need
something that's going to really support
my lower back especially when editing
videos for a long time or gaming for a
long time we're just browsing watching
movies and relaxing after work now the
one thing before we get into this review
is I want you guys to think about
adjustability and customization so one
thing that really stood out to me and
like I said was the lower back support
of my bar support now they have
abandoned
like the IKEA Marcus but you can move
this band up and down on your seat to
put it in the most comfortable and most
supporting position for yourself it also
comes with an adjuster so that you can
adjust the tension for your lower back
if you want something more is or
something more flexible and you push
your back into this back of the seat you
can do that with this chair it has been
working wonders for me all this
customization for the lower back I have
been able to sleep better I wake up
feeling more refreshed and not aching
from sitting in my Kia Marcus the whole
time so I really enjoy doing work and
sitting in this chair it allows me to
work for a longer period of time as well
you know when your back isn't starting
to hurt you can always just lean back
when your back isn't hurting as much you
can obviously work for longer now it's
recommended for any chair that you have
that after a while you can lean back in
chair and kind of give your lower back a
little rest recline it a little bit and
give your back a little a little rest
so with this chair they also have a knob
where you can adjust how much tension
you want when you recline you can also
do how much you want it to require to
getting do about four different stops
going backwards so you can really
customize this chair and adjust it to
your specific need also something that
another thing that I've never seen on
another chair set of the bottom slides
in and out that is a really cool feature
because you know sometimes you want to
sit further back in your chair you want
to be deeper into a chair and sometimes
you want to be more shallow going to be
having your hang your legs hanging over
the seat a little bit so it is very
customizable I've never seen that before
you can also adjust the seat edge and
make it come up a little bit so that you
can have a little like a bucket seat on
this or you can have more of the shallow
seat where you're like I said legs is
hanging off you know you can kind of
make it to how you want it now the
padding on the armrest I real
like it's full material and is since
I've been using them what I noticed on
my camp market just wanted some elbows
down to rest
the elbow fit to bend out okay so with
these there they stay and keep their
same shade they're very comfortable to
put your arms on you know some chairs
when you put your elbows onto them you
can almost feel the metal beneath it
with these that's not the case they
really keep their shape but at the same
time they're very comfortable they're
not very rigid so it's really nice and
they also swivel in which I really like
as well they swivel in so that you can
also put your elbows on there at
whatever angle you like to work at so
when I say adjustability and
customization you're really getting the
total package with this chair now you
can also bring the chair up and down of
course like any other chair you can
adjust it up down the side depending on
how tall or short the desk is so just
think that it's just a great looking
chair it's very modern looking and I
really enjoyed having it with my setup
and I've gotten a lot of compliments on
it the only negatives that I would say
is that when you sit down in it kind of
sinks down and then when you come up you
know it really like rises up so like
let's say my arms are underneath my arm
rights are underneath my desk when I sit
down and just from there and then
one-sided like pop up it'll rock my
whole desk so it kind of stinks when you
sit down in it but I mean it's kind of a
nitpicking thing with this chair other
than that I do wish it had a headrest
but it's comfortable I can lay my head
back on to the top of the chair and I
feel just fine so I don't I get a lot of
questions on which cheer I have and now
I answer that this is my newest chair
this is the chair that I will be having
for a very long time and I think it's
ours to get another chair it'll probably
still get shared I really enjoy just how
well-made this chairs and how
thought-out this chair is alright guys
so that has been my review on my new
chair I hope you guys have enjoyed this
review and I will see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
