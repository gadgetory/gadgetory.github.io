when a sturdy crow ever techniques is a
very clever arch criminal who must be
put away another what is up guys I got a
little bit of a treat for you guys a
little extra to go on with the soda
review I just released and that is a
battle between two headphones that maybe
you guys might be deciding between and
that I have and then I can give you guys
some insight on and that is the Sony
eight years at Beats Studio wireless 2.0
I had to think about that a little bit
these two are probably going to be up
there with the bose qc25
and i know a lot of you guys might be
deciding between the two so let's get
into a comparison and I will tell you
guys which one I think wins based on my
experiences so based on design I'm going
to give the winner of the design to the
Sony and let me tell you why because of
the Bands now you see on the beats how
they have this band and it's plastic
it's one piece so you're like I've seen
people snap these so many times and I'm
surprised I haven't snapped because I've
had these for about half a year and I
use them for the gym everyday and I have
not snapped them but I can see how
people snap them because they're just a
piece of plastic that's all the only
thing that's holding together is a piece
of plastic the hinges have actually held
up I was assuming that they would get
loose over a long time but actually kept
the next you kept their snap and kept
their stability so that's nice but what
Sony does is they have a metal band here
not only just the plastic they have a
metal band which can stretch so if you
sit on them if you accidentally sit on
them or I'm not saying go and sit on
them but if you actually sit on them
you're okay now another thing with the
design is beats kind of keeps a low
profile they have this right here is all
your controls which I like they have
up down and in the middle is the the
third button like you would have on the
iPhone for three times to go backwards
two times to go forward four calls you
press it once with Sony what I like what
they did was they have a dedicated
button system where they have an up/down
button for the forward and back and then
they have a press of the button for that
and they have a whole separate volume
control which is really nice so you
don't get confused or you don't double
tap something that you don't want to tab
like maybe you double tap forward and
hit pause accidentally and that messes
up your whole flow so that's something
to think about and that's why I give the
design preference to the Sony next up I
want to talk about the connectivity the
Bluetooth now what I found is that the
beats they have problems in public with
interference and it's not just other
beads is with other people coming around
phones headphones and things of that
nature whereas the Sony's never had a
problem
and that's due to the upgraded Bluetooth
in those the beats are a little dated
and they're due for a new update soon so
hopefully that will fix that but in the
meantime the Sony's have them beat at
this point with both of these the cases
are roughly the same
honestly I give it a little bit to the
Sony's as well because they're a little
bit more sturdier it has a nice cloth
feel to the outside while remaining hard
the beats it kind of feels like cheap
plastic real talk it's like cheap
plastic so they kind of cut costs on
that but both will protect your
investment which is most important now
let's come to the sound now in my Sony
review I said these were okay and I
still stick by that these are just okay
the bass is the best part of these but
the vocals suffer and the high suffer
they're just okay they're clear they're
there but they're kind of in the
background it's like the basses in your
face and the vocals and syllabus are so
Vince is in the background with the boat
with the beats obviously everybody knows
they do the bass the best they have
really good base but once you get up to
a certain volume they start to distort
what I've noticed so about like 80% of
your phone they start to distort and the
bass gets too much and it's like the
headphones can't even handle it so
that's a problem with these but with
sound actually would give it to the
beats honestly the beats there I thought
because a lot of people talk trash on
them that they wouldn't be able to keep
up with these keep up really really well
with a lot of the top headphones
wireless headphones and I'm really
surprised with them don't knock it till
you try these and you take off pair home
before you knock off so that round goes
to the beads now with noise cancelling I
use these on my last trip to San Diego
and these were horrendous for the plane
these blocked out nothing like it
blocked out a little bit of the piston
but that was it I heard everything I
heard people around me the notice
canceled on these does not work that
well J these really rely on being
pressed up into your head
I'm getting a tight tight seal like that
but all at all
I mean it's it's really weak that
there's no active noise-cancelling these
if so if they have a little bit of a
hiss trying to block out a general
amount of background static noise but it
just distracts you from your music so
the Sony wins this round they block out
voices like I said in the review and
they block out a lot of the ambient
noises or sudden noises on planes they
are amazing too so definitely check
these out if noise cancelling is number
one on your list because these are no
slouch they're up there with the Bose
and I think that in some cases they beat
the Bose which is amazing now what I
will say is disappointing about the
Sony's is that the volume is very low
and it it can bother I'm telling you
guys so if you guys really like the
Blashaw music these don't get that loud
it left me wanting maybe one or two more
bars on my iPhone whereas these got
almost too loud so that's if you really
like loud music the beats are the way to
go so all in all which one would I pick
if I had to make a recommendation I
would definitely go with the Sony's they
have their flaws they're not perfect but
they do noise cancelling really well
they are comfortable and if you're going
to spend 350 on some I know the beats
are lower in price now but I would go
with the Sony's over the beats
and I'm very proud of them
Sony from BT alright so that's going to
do it for this comparison guys thank you
