I'm gonna film a short video in the car
do that I do and hopefully you'll be
able to help you guys get shredded it's
a Hydra normal training so we're going
to do I'll explain this again while i'm
there but basically i'm gonna do 20
seconds on a dead treadmill Tremmel off
and then we're going to take a rest for
about a minute or once our I like to do
it not by time but when my heart rate
goes back down to a steady pace instead
of beating crazy out of your chest kind
of levels out and you're able to you
know breathe again essentially and then
you give that way you can get maximum
effort you want to get maximum effort on
your hind little tiny bug man let me
turn this music off before I get fucking
copyrighted anyway anyways um just an
update I've been dieting for about two
weeks now always kind of been
fluctuating I kind of have some cheat
meals I'm not gonna lie I'm human kind
of fucked up a couple times but you know
it's all about staying consistent during
the week I've been really consistent and
I'm keeping them keeping track of my
macros and everything so it's been going
pretty well I'm pretty happy with where
I'm at right now have a lot of time what
like six weeks until beyond so be able
to get shredded around that time I mean
I'm already pretty pretty good shape um
I think I'm another update is that I'm
trying to work on the arms like relaxed
I don't know what it is but I'm not
liking how arms are looking I've been
kind of neglecting them because I really
just don't like doing arms I feel like
they're boring I mean a lot of people
just go to the gym to do arms but i know
i just love working out the big muscle
groups and getting that sweat on also
another thing to before i forget it is i
want to bring my rear delts
one thing is that like I have them
really good for a while and I kind of
started coasting I like with anything in
life you kind of you don't take stock of
what you have and how much work it took
to get it to a certain point kind of
forget any kind of sale well I've
already accomplished that and kind of
take your foot off the gas and I
definitely did that with my rear delt so
now I'm making up for lost time I have
one workout last week those are rear
delt I didn't have anybody there to film
it so I'm sorry but I back workouts have
been mostly focused on rear delts upper
back sometimes just get to you know
cultivate a mind set up gratitude taking
stock of almost like taking stock of
what you have you don't take stock of
where you have you know you're bound to
loser you're bound to take it for
granted and you know it's in the day
just going over how hard you've been
working and we would have taken to get
certain body parts how they were to how
they are now taking stock of all that
and therefore you will appreciate the
muscle more I mean and everything in
your life anyways enough rambling I just
wanted to say that real fast before go
in here you know cultivating that
positive mindset before we're going to
the gym and Achille so yeah i'll show
you guys like i said we just got done
with tests maybe some cardio okay
treadmill as you can see leave this shit
off don't try to go press this button
keep it off so since we're gonna have
the treadmill off you want to
started stuff stopwatch on your phone
has started
I usually just go on the by the 20
seconds on this fall
ok so just it first round 20 seconds I'm
going to take a walk around the gym and
come back to the treadmill and do it
again go do it eight times like I said
I'm going to wait till my heart rate
jumps down before I do it a game and
yeah that's jist of it
your appetite goes up way way higher
metabolism goes up doing this have a
cardio as opposed to like walking on
treadmill walking on a Stairmaster as
you can see fucking dying just upper one
round so that's seven more of these and
feel it ok job with you guys again later
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
