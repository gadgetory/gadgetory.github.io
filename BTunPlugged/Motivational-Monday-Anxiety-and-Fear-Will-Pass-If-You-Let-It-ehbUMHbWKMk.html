motivational Monday we're doing another
informal one today but I hope you guys
will enjoy the message today and today I
want to talk about rejecting so-called
bad feelings now let's say you're going
through the week you feel anxious all
this and we think oh man I should have a
feeling like this you know this person
probably doesn't feel like that for me
it's like the rock doesn't feel like
that but in all honesty these people
have the same feelings for all the same
these emotions are common to us all so
you have to think not so shamefully
about it but also think the rock or any
person that you feel like a motivator or
an inspiration your life these people go
to the same exact name and our shame is
what keeps these things continuously
going in our life to let things pass
through anxiety we have to accept them
so what you have to do with anxiety and
all your other feelings is just accept
them feel them know that they're gonna
pass say all I'm experiencing some
anxiety and just breathe with it and let
it go and you'll see what time it just
passes what happens when you don't look
to allow yourself to feel and you don't
allow yourself two capacities feeling
that you feel shameful they stay they
keep coming back so you want to be fair
you want to be anxiety accept them as a
natural part of life and continue living
your life alright guys so that's going
to do it for this week's motivational
Monday go out there and kill it and I
will see you guys next week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
