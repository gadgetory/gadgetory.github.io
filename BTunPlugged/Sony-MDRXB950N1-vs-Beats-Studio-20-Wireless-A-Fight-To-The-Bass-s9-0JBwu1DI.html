you forget - what is up guys bTW back
here again with another battle today
we're gonna be looking at a battle
between two of my favorite over ear
headphones the Beats Studio twos and the
Sony xb9 fifty and one both of which are
wireless now in my opinion both of these
are great but there can only be one
winner so let's find out who comes out
on top today but before we begin let me
know down in the comments below who you
guys think won well you think one is
battle between these two so let's kick
this thing off with the comfort and
design now beach has always been subject
to hate because of their build quality
the price ratio and that's right now you
can find both of these for roughly
around 250 but before they're running
about $400 which I don't think they were
worth now I do feel like the studio two
point knows where beats best product
before being bought out by Apple now of
course the beats X are a little bit
better so the design on these they're
both matte have both matte versions of
these headphones but I do feel like the
Sony's feel a little bit more premium
they actually feel like matte whereas
the the beats kind of still have a
glossy feel to them so I feel like Sony
used better materials I also seen with
the the headband the headband on the
Sony they both have metal bands in them
but the Sony it just feels a lot
sturdier you feel like you got your
money's worth with the product even on
the headband on the Sony's added faux
leather at the top which is a nice
feature it's a lot softer the rubber
that they put on to the beats which is
pretty can be uncomfortable at times
now speaking of leather they both have
leather cups faux leather cups over time
my beats have been borne out they
flattened out
time whereas the Sun is even though I
just got them they still kept their
shape really nicely so that's one thing
you might want to keep in mind although
I do like the design of the studio
choose how close they stay to your head
when you put them on there's not gonna
be fanning out like the Sony's do and
therefore it makes it a lot better if
you're going to be using these for gym
purposes so one thing that I was worried
about with the beats is that the hinge
would break over time but over two years
they've actually held up very nicely but
the sony hinges just feel sturdier and I
feel like they're gonna last all of us a
longer period of time now the controls
on the Sony's and the beats are
completely different sony gives you more
control over the noise cancellation and
base by adding buttons right to the
headphone where you can just tap to turn
them on or off beats just a little bit
more simple they just have the usual
volume up and down buttons and the play
and pause button the play husband on the
Sony's are my favorite thing in this
whole world
guys I just I love the trigger sliding
mechanism compared to the 2 to 3 times
you have to press on the beast to go
forward and back for your tracks it's
just a more surefire way to change of
songs see what I did there trigger fire
okay okay you get the point so at the
end of the day the better materials and
the blood styles of the xb9 50 and 1
have won me over and they've also won
the comfort InDesign
now let's make our way into the sound
around now both of these headphones are
meant to appeal to the basement out
there let's be honest the one just does
it better than the other
now Beats gets a lot of shots for their
muddiness and sometimes I feel like it's
just well deserved not to say that the
studio two photos sound bad but they
definitely lack a certain clarity to
them that you'll find with other brands
especially at higher volume where they
just tend to rattle like image you feel
like the headphones cannot handle the
volume that you're putting out the bass
that you're putting into the headphones
so it's almost it sounds cheap in a way
whereas the song as they rumble
and they rumble all day and night but in
a very very satisfying way while keeping
the clarity and the mids very clear so
if Sony can do beats I believe in you
for an extra $150 you can put some
clarity into the studio 3-0 so this
round has to go to the Sony xb9 50 in
one they even have an app where you can
control how much of the extra bass you
want when the extra bass is turned on
while beef is just a one-size-fits-all
and sometimes frankly just doesn't fit
now moving on to the noise cancellation
one of the biggest things that stands
out to me is that Sony lets you control
whether you want to have your noise
cancellation on or not where's the beats
it's always on and not only that the
beats noise cancellation isn't that
great it's supposed to be supposed to be
active noise cancellation but it's more
passive they just play static over your
songs hoping that it will kind of block
out some of that underlying noise that
may come into your headphones and it
just doesn't make any sense why would
you mess up the quality of the sound and
not only that you're not even giving us
a great noise cancellation so that's why
I like Sony because they actually put in
a noise cancellation that actually
cancels out the frequency that is coming
in
headphones so what Sony has done is they
put a mic on the outside of your
headphones so let's say you hear a baby
crying that baby crying is going to be
heard by the little Michael outside the
headphones and then what happens is the
Sony Vince sends out another frequency
into your ear to block out that sound
noise cancellation that's how it's
supposed to be done beeps so they need
to go back to the drawing board and try
a game so this round goes to the Sony's
so next up let's go to the battery life
now the battery life on the beats is 12
hours whereas the battery life on the
Sony's is 22 hours it's a big disparity
but for my usage for my day-to-day usage
12 hours has been enough for the past
two years but just having that extra 10
hours for when I go to fly it maybe I
want to go on an international flight
and have a layover and I don't want to
be charging it
the Sony's are going to be way better so
if that's something if that's you go
with the Sony's so the connectivity is
also great on both I never have any
issues with the connectivity with both
of these no breakup so this round the
tie but if you're going to be using this
for business for business calls then you
won't be disappointed because both are
great even though the people can hear
you just fine and
you can hear them just fine so call
quality another time all right so this
point guys was a complete blowout by
Sony I'm not gonna beat around the bush
so anyone this one beats really really
needs to come up with something great
this coming year hopefully Apple can
help them out a little bit with the
noise cancellation get something great
into the headphones and I believe that's
why it's taking them so long to actually
come out for studio 3.0 is because my
wishful thinking's a my my intuition
tells me that Apple is putting in some
kind of noise cancellation technology
into the studio threes so guys if you're
on the fence or the baby between these
two go with the songs for now we'll see
what beats has in the future but for now
Sony wins all right guys so before we go
I want to tell you guys I'm send out an
invitation for you guys to comment down
below and tell me a headphone that you
want to see reviewed or maybe that I
don't even know about put me up on some
new headphones thank you guys for
watching and I will see you guys in the
next video don't forget to Like share
