with another motivational Monday and as
you may remember last week I talked to
you guys about getting a salary increase
and negotiating my salary and I want to
tell you guys that I killed it i got the
money that I wanted that I felt I
deserve so I not only want to be telling
you guys about these things but I want
to be living it as well and I want to be
showing you guys that it is possible and
that I'm not just saying this stuff is
not living by what I'm saying all these
topics that I'm going over are things
that you know I go through and things
that I've learned through my journey so
I just want to share this with you guys
and help you guys do certain things that
are similar anyways today let's get in
to the topic today's topic is going to
be about setting yourself up for success
now a lot of times we go into life
without a plan and not only that we
don't plan for the little small
obstacles in life so it's like the
saying goes there are a lot of small
obstacles that can happen every day and
there's a low probability of them
happening but since there are so many of
them there's a high probability of at
least one of them or two or many of them
happening so we have to kind of prepare
ourselves for these things we don't
prepare ourselves enough for the future
we say we want to get this done at this
time let's say meal prepping this is a
big thing in the fitness community and
for a good reason now with milk prepping
the the big thing is to do it on a
Sunday not like a monday tuesday
wednesday because on those days we know
that there's something that's going to
go wrong we don't take into account how
we're going to feel afterward
after we get off of the eight hour day
and then we drive home in two hours of
traffic and i would get home and we have
to be present for our loved ones and
then expect ourselves at eight or nine
o'clock to want a meal prep for the rest
of the week it's just not happening and
we don't take this into account a lot of
time sadly and we end up just putting it
off and it never happens and we just end
up eating out at work and eat bad and
then the success cannot come to us the
this is a prime example of setting
yourself up for success on a Sunday the
middle prep would be way easier to just
before you eat that big Sunday dinner
just to go into your kitchen and throw
something into the oven really fast for
30 minutes cut it up throw it in a
plastic container for the week and then
your dust as opposed to you get home on
that weekday and you're just not having
it you'd rather just go to sleep and
knock out that's it the last thing in
your mind is no prepping so instead of
just writing down your goals for each
day or thinking about okay I wanna get
this done on this day think about what
your moves are going to be like when you
plan that day i'll think about what your
it's gonna be feeling during that day
and not just think that you're some kind
of robot that when called upon you're
going to be able to do it you know it
may be eight o'clock and you only give
yourself 30 minutes to do it til 830 but
your favorite TV shows on can't look
away these things happen we're human we
liked TV we like radio like music we
lose track of time plan out your days
and your
activities around times that are going
to work for you and you can be your best
self and tackle on these different
obstacles and goals that you have during
the week and kill it all right plain and
simple just kill all of them kill all
your obstacles get over the hump heard
of them we're gonna we're gonna go to
the next level this year we got what
four months left three months left we're
going to kill you guys so let me know
what the obstacles or goals that you
guys have down below and we can all kind
of get together and kind of hype each
other up and really like in the year on
a good note so all right guys that's
been my time that's been your boy BTW
thank you for watching again I will see
you guys next Monday be a lookout for
some workout videos and more tech videos
all the good stuff soon I will see you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
