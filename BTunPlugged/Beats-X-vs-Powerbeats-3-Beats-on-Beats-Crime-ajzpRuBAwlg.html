to
you
what is up guys is BT back here again
with another battle today we are going
to be looking at a battle between two of
apples
I mean beats newest wireless earbuds the
beasts X which is more targeted towards
more of an everyday commuter and the
power of these threes which are targeted
more towards a workout crowd for my
testing both can be interchanged between
the two types but which one is the best
today I will be giving you a definitive
answer on the topic before we begin
don't forget to hit that subscribe
button for more content like this now
I'm a big believer in comfort and design
it can really make or break a diss set
of headphones both of these have
different styles of keeping the ear buds
on your head the beats X uses more of a
silicone neck band to keep the
headphones in place it also fits
underneath the collar shirt very nicely
if you're trying to use them for work I
love how the silicone feels compared to
the hard plastic of other neck bands
which at some point always started to
annoy me you barely notice that this
neck band is even on your neck it stays
in place and out of the way most of the
time I did notice that when I fling
myself back onto a bench or a set
sometimes that the neck band would come
off but the ear buds would always stay
in place which is very impressive
in fact the ear buds have never popped
out of my ears once with the the
lightness the form factor of these the
comfortable wings all provide for a
great experience I also loved a little
touch of the magnets to keep them in
front of you when not in use they're not
sweat proof but I did drop them in my
coffee one morning and they still work
to this day now the power beats on the
other hand keep a hook around the back
of your ear to keep them in place so if
you're doing any type of intensive
sports or running those are going to be
better for you although they do have the
hooks I did find that the air bus did
pop out sometimes
when in use a subscriber told me about
this method where you can just put the
little cord that's hanging up into your
hat and it's worked out pretty well for
me it keeps it off of your neck and
keeps it out of the way the buttons on
both these are great but beats really
needs to add in the holding of either
the plus or the minus buttons to skip
forward and back trying to hit that
middle button three times when you're
just in a workout when you're sweating
when you're dying and trying to hit that
three times doesn't always work out so
overall who wins this round I think I
have to give it to the beats X the
materials is feel super high-quality the
silicone just fits so nicely around the
back of your neck I forget that they're
even there most of the time I have to
like really check and I freak out
sometimes I think that I've dropped them
with the power of these 3s I noticed
that sometimes the hooks will start to
irritate the back of my ears when moving
around a lot and if you don't do the hat
trick with the cord it can really pull
on your neck and come out of place so
this round is going to go to the beats X
so let's move on to the sound around
where things get interesting beats has
always been known for their bass but not
in a good way
they've always put in a ton of bass at
the expense of clarity in their
headphones they've really tamed the bass
with both of these products and I've
been very happy with the sound profile
from both now there are very subtle
differences between these two earbuds
the beats X focus is more on the high
end maybe a little bit too much as these
can be a little bit too bright at times
and really hurt your eardrums overall I
really enjoyed using these though the MS
where the vocals live or where the beats
X shine the most the power B's focus is
more on the bass and giving you more of
that huh you know that thump that you
just a lot of the bass heads to crave
the vocals are great as well
adding a lot of emotion to songs they've
added in a lot more detail into these
compared to the power beats tubes the B
sexes are going to be more tailored to
you if you like more of a
headphone the power B's 3s are going to
be more for you if you like a lot of
bass also I get a lot of questions about
which headphone is louder and in this
case the level is about the same and I
feel like it's adequate for most songs
that you're going to be listening to
overall though I picked the power beats
3 as my winner for the sound around
because I listen to a lot of rap EDM
acoustics where these really shine now
let's move on to the battery life both
of these have great battery life but the
power of these three come with 12 hours
of battery and the v-tex
only come with 8 but there's a caveat to
that it's not so simple the quick charge
on the beach X is five minutes of charge
for two hours of battery life whereas
the power of these three is is five
minutes charge for one hour so it kind
of bounces the two out if one was
completely out of battery if you were
pressed for time you would be getting a
better deal with the beats X we've all
been there where we get to the gym we go
to turn on our headphones and only to
find that we're at 10% battery from our
last gym session so one thing that I
really wish beats would add in is a
voice prompt telling you when you're low
on battery how great would it be just to
hear that there's 20% of battery life
meaning you need to finish your workout
don't take your sweet time and get out
of the gym I do like that they put in a
lightning cable until the beats X which
makes it super convenient for us
iPhone users and now with Android moving
to USB C the micro USBs aren't going to
be as involved in our daily life anymore
so that's going to be a problem for the
power b3 in the long run overall even
though the power beats have four more
base hours than the beats X the quick
charge feature on the beats X has saved
my ass more times than I can count
so I got to give this round to the beat
X okay so for the connectivity this
round is a tie I mean they both have the
W on shift
they both never break connection with
Apple products and I've also had a great
experience in great connectivity with my
galaxy s7 so this rounds a time
nothing more to say okay so let's talk
about the call quality now both are
great they're better than most earbuds
that I've actually used Bluetooth
earbuds and I there's something small
that really just puts the beats X ahead
of the power beats and that is the
position of the mic the mic is even
though it has that long cord in the
front from your earbud to the actual
neck band and it actually works out
because the mic is going to be right
here right next to your mouth and people
are going to be able to hear you more
clearly so for the call quality round I
have to give it to the beats X but just
by a narrow margin alright so we've come
to the end we've talked about all the
different features of these headphones
so it's time to end this battle and
there must be a winner for me that has
to be the beat eggs not only is it a
great commuter headphone but it's also a
great workout headphone the ingenious
design of the neck band has me sold with
these I sometimes just forget that
they're even on my neck even on my head
and I have to freak out and try to find
where they are so these are just a great
headphone great overall around headphone
you'll be able to use them in multiple
applications not just at the gym the
power beats 3 they kind of look like
they're made for sports so when you're
walking around work or things like that
it's it's not gonna look professional
I work in the office so that's something
that I kind of think about is I want to
look professional if I have been wearing
headphones right the power be stories
are also a great headphone and I do
recommend them over the beats X if you
are going to be doing a lot of running
or a lot of intensive workouts where you
think these headphones will just be
being thrown around every which way but
if not if you just need something for
the gym for moderate workouts for
commuting the B's exercising for you
