strange entertaining you love
is worth three number
boy
what's up guys speaks you back here
again with another review in my second
edition of the underdog series where I
look at headphones by up-and-coming
companies that are trying to make it
alright and I give them feedback and all
that good stuff so today we are going to
be looking at the eye hard pH 1000 a
very very interesting set of wireless
workout earbuds so interesting that they
have become my daily drivers for working
out over the likes of Bose B's and J
birds now I really want to stress that
I'm not being paid for this review at
all I'm free to express how I feel about
these so they sucked I would just tell
you guys that they was 100% so I Mark
was nice enough to send me one unit for
review okay and one unit to give away
which I will be telling you how you can
win at the end of this review okay so
first let's start off with the comfort
and design and first and foremost I
really want to commend I heart on their
packaging this case can hold and fit all
of the different sizes of the silicone
tips a charging cord a wall outlet plug
all of which are great all of which feel
premium and especially at the price
point of $34.99 which is a steal in my
opinion I'm a sucker for when they
placed a button when they hide the
button in their logo and that's what
they've done on these and I really
really like that these look similar to
the powerbeats but they're much lighter
which causes them to move around less
during your workouts they're way more
comfortable in my opinion these
headphones just don't move around they
fit snugly to your head while being
comfortable the cord also doesn't stick
to your neck like some of the
lower-priced wireless headphones the
volume rockers are nice and clicky and
easy to press they're also rated as ipx7
waterproof so they can handle even the
heaviest of sweaters out there for you
guys
overall the comfort and design of these
mix them feel like they're three times
worth their price so kudos to IR for
putting together a great package now
let's move on into the sound round this
is where I think a lot of people will
love these and the reason why
love them is the base these have the
biggest and I feel like the power beats
should have I know a lot of people that
come to me about the B's and they share
their disappointment thinking you know
if beets are the base brand beef should
have a lot more veins why do they sound
so emaciated so I have to say with these
headphones they have a lot of thump to
them more so than any other earbud that
I've tried the highs are great although
I do feel the miss could use a bit of
clarity with vocals and stuff like that
but sacrifices have to be made for great
bass right now one thing before we move
on that I really appreciate is the
volume these get really really loud and
they also don't distort the sound
quality at the same time like a lot of
other ones do so I know a lot of you
asked me how how's the volume these you
do not have to worry about volume I'm
going to tell you that right now if
you're looking for a loud set you know
not so much that we want to blow out our
ears but sometimes some songs can be a
little low on the quality so we need a
little bit of extra volume so let's talk
about the connectivity and this is where
a lot of the cheaper earbuds fall apart
I started lugging them I take them to
the gym and they cut out every 10
seconds I'm like oh man like I know
these are no good I can't use these not
with the pH 1000s these things are
rock-solid in my crowded gym I go at
prime time 5 p.m. every day they can
also connect to more than one device at
a time so that's great for somebody like
me that has a personal phone and a work
phone I can just switch over back and
forth whenever I need to take calls etc
the call quality is also great on these
no complaints they're people heard me
just fine and the Better Life has also
been rock solid for me I've gotten a
solid eight hours it shows actual
battery icon of how much you have left
and a lot of the cheaper earphones they
don't have that so that's another great
feature about the hard peach 1000 so in
conclusion I just want to say wow I
wasn't expecting to light
more than my beats X which were my
current daily drivers former now for the
gym but these actually outperform them
in a lot of ways that I needed from the
increase in base to light form factor
they don't move around I heart has
really put together a great package
which I have been using every day so
don't let the low price fool you with
these these are some badass headphones
