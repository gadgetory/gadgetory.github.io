with another motivational Monday today
we're going to be talking about acting
as if so have you ever felt like you've
been lacking in an area or you're
waiting to be that person that you know
that you can be but for some reason
right now you don't feel like you
deserve it well I'm here to tell you
that you should act as if you already
have what you think you're lacking and
this will put you in a frequency with
what you actually want so that when the
time comes when you want that job that
car that the friends you're going to be
on that same wavelength you wouldn't
turn into the channel 2 news at night
expecting to see cartoons you would be
on the cartoon channel trying to find
some cartoons on channel 70 or whatever
so put your mindset the way you carry
yourself think about it in line with
what you want to be accomplished have
all those things if you want to have a
nice car put yourself in line with
somebody that has a nice car what's
going to happen you're going to take
care of the car that you already have
you're going to be saving money towards
that car that you want all those things
it'll put you in the mindset of somebody
that has that car what I want to lose
weight I pretend like I'm already
shredded I tell myself that every day 24
7 I'm getting more shredded I am putting
myself in line with somebody that is
shredded I'm picking the right food
sources and making the right choices in
the gym going harder in the gym I'm
being somebody that has that
shredded ab look you know what I mean
don't wait until you have certain things
certain people in your life to feel like
you are the person that you should be be
that person now you can be that person
now think about it you can be that
person now right now you don't have to
wait you can get you can decide like
that to carry yourself a totally
different way to have a different
mindset and walk around like you own the
place put yourself in line with what you
want be that person now so when the time
comes when your number gets called you
will be that person alright guys so
