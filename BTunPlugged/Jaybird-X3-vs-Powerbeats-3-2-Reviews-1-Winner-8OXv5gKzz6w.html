what is up guys is BT back here again
with another review today I have a
battle between the power beats three and
the jaybird X threes now they've been
going at it for three generations now
from the X ones the power beats ones
from the powerbeats 2 to the X 2 to the
now the X 3s to the power beats 3 and
I've gotten to see these companies grow
and I've got to see how the evolution of
these headphones have come about and
from whether its materials whether it's
sound whether it's new apps being added
in it's all very exciting for somebody
like me who works out six days a week
and I need something that's going to be
reliable that's gonna be good sounding
that can block out sound in the gym that
will help me get through those hard
workouts without moving around in my ear
without getting in my way having to
reposition them that's what I consider a
win is when you don't have to readjust
that often at least so today in this
comparison I'm going to tell you guys
which one of these headphones I think is
the best after my testing for two weeks
yes I did not just listen to these for a
day or two I listened to these for two
weeks in and out of the gym switching
off one day from another listening to
them back-to-back getting that good good
comparison for you guys so I can without
a doubt give my honest opinion and I can
give you guys what I know to be what I
think is the best headphones so without
any further ado let's get into this
battle so let's get into the comfort and
design now if you saw my jaybird x3 hype
video j-bert x2 revisited video you will
see that I called out jaybird for having
these huge plugs that go into your ear
and they shimmy out now they stayed in
place pretty well for me after I found
the perfect fit which is the ex fit but
I still found that they were hurting my
ear this little flap right here like
what's just hurting really bad because
they were so big in
would expand my ear right so I called
them out for it and they have come back
and delivered they shrunk down the size
just enough where you don't feel like
it's gonna be pressing against your ear
and creating that pressure and hurting
your ears after listening for a long
period of time they've also shaved off
the back of the headphone so there's not
this huge plug going off the end of your
headphones they've also upgraded their
wings now they are a little bit softer
and they're a little bit more contoured
to go into your ear and give you a
better fit and these are the most
comfortable wings that they have come
out with from the x1 to the x2 is now
the x3 s these X threes are really
really comfortable and I've always gone
with the silicon tips because the phone
sport tips that they offer hurt my ears
after a while they rub they're a really
harsh material so when they're in your
ear yes they're gonna like they're not
gonna absorb that sweat but what's going
to happen is they're gonna hurt your ear
because it has that like harsh foam it's
not a soft comply tip like you can order
separately which I like but I've always
gone with the silicon tips because they
sound a lot better to me I get better
bass response with them so all in all I
always go with the silicon they're easy
to take out when you're working out and
you don't have to replace them so what
they did was they took some of the size
out of the earbud which was the
batteries and put it into the remote now
with the freedoms the remote was so
heavy and I think jaybird has figured
out how to make this thing lighter I
have not noticed this thing tugging out
of my ear like the freedom's did so I
think they lighten the size of the
actual remote now let's talk about the
power beads aesthetically they look the
same aesthetically they fit the same
aesthetically they come with the same
tips and all the materials though are
slightly different though the materials
feel better the cord feels a lot
sturdier so you're not going to get the
shorts and the wire from pulling the
remote feels a lot
on these it's a lot more clicky it's not
rubber like the old ones were and the
old rubber ones on the powerbeats tubes
would peel off I had a lot of rubbing
off and peeling off after so much usage
it was a little disappointing knowing
that I paid $200 for them they come with
the silicone tips but they're not as
thick as a jaybird x3s
so you don't get that comfort as you
would get with the X threes they're a
very thin material so when they're in
your ear you can kind of feel the
plastic from the actual headphone canal
in your ear and that's something that I
feel like they could have worked on at
least put a little thicker of material
on the actual silicone buds so with it
when they go on your ear they're very
comfortable easy fit so the J Brand X 3
is use the wings whereas the powerbeats
3 is used the hooks now depending on
what your preference is the hooks do
keep the ear buds in your ear a lot
better than the wings of course the
silicone is more of an in-ear type of
deal so when you are moving around it is
going to move around with you keep that
in mind so if you want some headphones
that will just stay in place not move
and you can just put them in your ear
set it and forget it and go work out the
powerbeats threes are for you if you
want something where they're more
comfortable on your ear but they are
going to move around a little bit but it
only takes a little pop back into your
ear if you're ok with that go with the X
threes now the jaybird X series have the
x fit whereas the beats have this little
round thing at the end to kind of shimmy
up and down where you can adjust the
length of the chord on your neck
but this thing is terrible it's terrible
I wish they would have updated this
because this little piece pops out one
side of the headphone cord will pop out
guaranteed all the time without a doubt
they haven't fixed this and that was one
of my main gripes with the old one it's
pretty much useless this cord is going
to be on the back your neck period
so the jaybird x threes come with
multiple silicon tips wings and
fit and clips to help you get the right
fit they even give you foam tips whereas
the powerbase trees really rely on the
hooks to kind of keep them in place and
they don't give you many accessories
that really work to your needs so either
way it depends on what you feel like you
like best but for me I'm going to give
this round to the j-bird x3 just because
they have up their quality in the
comfort area and I really appreciate
that the silicone and these are very
very comfortable
I can set these in for a workout and
just forget them I may have to push them
in once or twice but that's a price I'm
willing to pay so next up let's move on
to the sound now the sound in the j-bird
x3 is roughly the same as the x2 s it
sounds a little bit better now these
come very flat out of the box and that
is for a reason because they add the SAP
my sound app they want to have a flat
signature so that you can adjust the
signature to your liking imagine if
these came really base heavy and then
you added more base onto it you would
get distortion so they really wanted to
make a flat profile which I think sounds
great out of the box you can add base to
these you can add your own profiles you
can add mids highs depending on your
song and before I called out the
freedoms for having them out my sound
app and kind of it being a hassle to to
go in between during sets but these
sounds so good on the flat settings that
you can just set these in they have
great sound stage where you don't really
need to have the my sound app anyways
these sound incredible out of the box
and you will not be disappointed I'm a
real sucker for soundstage hearing that
separation hearing you know guitar on
the side and the drums on this side and
just feeling immersed in the music and
the j-bird x3 is really deliver on that
aspect now the sound on the power beats
3 is are no slouch I really enjoyed them
actually got them first and I was like
oh j-bird is in trouble because these
sounded really good out of the box but
the thing is they're not a very fly
signature they are made for fun beats is
a fun brand it's meant for you to go
into the store put them on and you're
like wow I want to take these home now
these sounds the power beats 3 sound
great in all genres I must say I can't
lie I can't lie to you guys they sound
really great as much as you guys
probably want me to hate on beats they
sound great the vocals sound really good
compared to the power beats - they're
very clear they've cleaned up the sound
signature it's like Apple came in and
just made everything so clear with the
power beats and with the beats in
general even the solo 3 is had the same
improvement they came everything sounds
very clear the vocals sound very clear
and fun
the bass is pronounced it's not
distorted at high volumes it's nice it's
a good listening experience you would
not be disappointed by the power beats
threes I'm telling you but while the
power beats threes sound good the
jaybird X threes
sound great that's the best way to put
it they sound great the soundstage from
the base to the flat signature - making
it what you want with them my sound app
you can't go wrong it will bend to your
needs and it's a very smart and
incredible design by jaybird so for the
sound round I'm giving it to the j-bert
X 3s again so next up I just want to
talk about the call quality really fast
the call quality is better on the power
beats 3 then the jaybird jaybird has
always kind of slacked in the call
quality department but it is a great
improvement over the last iteration of
these headphones so either way you will
not be disappointed the jaybird X 3s
have a little less quality on the call
quality side but it's a give and take so
the call quality will go to the power
beats threes so next up let's talk about
the battery life now both have made
great improvements to the battery life
now the j-bert x2 said they got eight
hours of battery life uh uh six hours
tops at max volume
and the power beasts were no better
they're about six hours as well they
were better they lasted a little bit
longer than a jaybird x2s for me but the
powerbeats2 still suffer I'm the same
weakness as today bird X tooth so this
time around they both have increased
their battery life and they mean it they
mean business
now the J Brand X 3s come with eight
hours of solid battery solid battery
these things are beast guys like I went
into the gym with 20% and I left the gym
two hours later and they were still
working what in the world and I was
going up and down in volume but mostly
staying near the higher volumes because
I went to block out sound so kudos to
j-bird for getting that eight hours
solid and meaning it this time I really
appreciate that
now comes Apple Apple comes with the w1
chip as you know I love this W on chip
comes with a lot of benefits and one of
them being the 12 hours of battery and I
can say that these things lasted 12
hours at full volume they're not playing
around either I did not have to worry
about them dying even when they were low
battery they just wanted to keep going
both feature a quick charge feature the
beats charge in five minutes one hour
and the jammers do fifteen minute charge
for an hour so both are really good in
that aspect from the quick charge to
getting the solid amount of hours but
just because the beads have the w1 chip
and the twelve hours I have to give the
battery life to the beats because just
because and that's not to say that the
jaybird X 3s had that battery life is
just that twelve hours is incredible for
this type of earbud now one caveat to
this is that you have to charge this
jaybird x3 headphone set with a dongle
nobody likes dongles it's one more thing
to lose to misplace to have to have on
you at all times when you need your
headphones charged so it's one more
hassle that they have put into this
headphone I feel like the
wanted to take out some of the added
size that adding a USB port would entail
that little bitty piece could have been
in the remote causing it to be heavier
causing it to fall out a year more often
so I see why they did it and I see the
the thought process behind it so I'm I'm
glad in a sense and I'm also kind of
pissed off in a sense so it's it's good
and it's bad I wish I could have found a
way to compromise on that but at the end
of the day it's okay so if you're a
person that is going to forget or lose
their they're charging dongle then you
know what the jaybird x3 is obviously
are for you the connectivity on both of
these is great I got better range with
the power B's threes than I did the
jaybird X 3s but they both were great in
the gym I could walk away from my phone
I could go pick up some weights on the
other side of the dumbbell rack so both
are great workout headphones just
headphones in general if you want some
Bluetooth headphones if you got the
iPhone 7 and Apple took away our
headphone jack and you need something
for Bluetooth while you can charge your
phone then either one of these will be a
great addition to your life but there
can only be one winner and that winner
for me is the j-bird x3 s from the sound
to the my sound app to the Comfort to
the fit to the battery life to the
connectivity it did something's good but
when it comes down to is comfort and
staying in your ear and the design and
and I really feel like j-bert x3 has
nailed it on all of these accounts now
in some areas the power beats did do
better but it was only incremental at
the end of the day with the j-bert x3 s
did better they did it way better they
added more features and you're getting
it at $70 less jaybird was really smart
they know that the air pots are coming
out they know that the power B 3s are
coming out they know that bose is out
i've been using them every day at the
gym since i decided that these were my
winner
and I cannot be happier I love them love
them love them I wear them at work
everywhere they block out more sound
than the power beats threes as well so
