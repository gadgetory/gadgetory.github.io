trying taking your head home
man great try them out okay
these are dough right this is what to do
bro whatever you do don't catch all
right I'll be right I'll be right back
all right
remember that's it don't touch that
Oh what did I tell you man too much what
is up guys is BT back here again with
another review today I'm going to be
taking a look at Sony's newest
headphones the xb9 50 in one's now let's
go back a little bit in time when I used
to have the xb9 50 bt now i love these
headphones but there were two major
things that always nag me about these
headphones and that was the size and the
lack of noise cancellation so when I saw
they were releasing the in ones I had a
gut feeling that they had a hit on their
hands so today I'm going to put these to
the test are these would a great noise
cancellation extra bass headphone should
sound like or will they fall short find
out today let's start off with the
comfort and design now aesthetically
they made these a lot smaller than the
950 BT which I like a lot but I'm not a
huge fan of the top of the band it just
looks a little weird to me the way it
fans out from your head kind of lays
flat I don't know maybe it's for people
that have a lot of hair you know I'm
kind of bald so maybe that's something
that they thought would be convenient
what I do like is the cushions now they
decrease the size of these headphones
but the cushions are still very
comfortable actually fell asleep with
these on my head last night they were
just so comfortable one of my favorite
features of Sony headphones is the way
they have their control setup
I love the volume rocker and I love the
way you slide the trigger like a button
to one side or the other to go forward
or back in a song I'm pressing that
button pauses or plays a song there's
going to be no confusion or miss presses
with beads now on these headphones
you'll find a noise cancellation button
and a base button as well but we'll get
into those features a little bit later
all in all I'm really loving the new
design and the texture feel of these
headphones they feel very premium and
well worth the price and while we're on
the subject of price these are coming in
at about $250 I pick mine
for about 200 so I really think these
can compete with bows at a competitive
price now one thing I really want to
emphasize before we get into the
earth-shattering bass in the sound of
these is that they added in a ton of
clarity these headphones have amazing
clarity over the old BTS one of the old
problems with the extra bass button
would be that it would muddy up
everything else your sound your songs
will just be filled with bass and not
much else these give you the
earth-shaking bass but now with clarity
and that is very impressive they
actually listened to us and listened to
our feedback and that's something I
really appreciate about something so
what they do with the basses they really
emphasize the lower-end now this is
inaudible to us so what they do is is
they make the that frequency Rumble in
these headphones they make a lot of air
movement so it's a feeling more so than
an actual Sam I found these headphones
to be great with rap of course are going
to be the best and with EDM but also to
us pleasantly surprised by the classic
and the acoustics the way those sounded
on these implements the app is useful
but at the same time it's not it's it's
a love-hate relationship with this app
now they have where you can increase or
decrease the extra bass which is a
really cool feature but they have these
sound profiles that don't really make
sense like I press them like the concert
button or all these other different
settings like outdoor and I just don't
get the reasoning for them why would you
put these in it doesn't sound like
anything it sounds artificial it sounds
fake it's not really enjoyable why would
I want to lessen the quality of my music
so it sounds like I'm outside I don't
know maybe it's just me but that's how I
feel about that setting so I think it
would be more impressive for them to put
in something like a jaybird app where
that you can control the highs and mids
and lows instead of just how much space
you can have so that's something they
may want to look into in the future now
let's move on to the noise cancellation
another problem I had with the old BTS
is that they did not have noise
cancellation I took them on my vacation
to New York and the plane ride was
horrible it was horrible seven hours of
just engine noise
in my ears sound like the engine was on
the seat next to me it was bad but sunny
recently has passed Bose in my opinion
when it comes to noise cancellation
hauling these Sony's aren't just putting
in static into your headphone it's
actually receiving outside information
the outside noises that are coming into
your headphones and then what they do is
they send out the opposite frequency to
cancel out that sound so it's actual
noise cancellation active noise
cancellation not just passive active and
I really feel like these are on par with
the QC 35 so anybody that's maybe
looking into the QC 35 s and B's at the
same time comparing I would say these
are on par if not slightly better than
the QC 35 you can quote me on that
let's talk about the battery life these
are rated at 22 hours which will get you
through most plane rides there's no
quick charge features which I'm kind of
confused about but at 22 hours you're
not really going to need that and you
can get that 22 hours with the base and
with the noise cancellation enabled so
that's just incredible 22 hours is more
than enough for any flight now the call
quality is also great with these it
sounds just like you're talking right
into the phone like you have your phone
right here so it's not a problem with
these I have no doubt in my mind that
you guys will be satisfied with the call
quality so found the connectivity to be
rock-solid these have the newest
Bluetooth in it so you're not going to
have any problems with losing connection
around people that are also using their
Bluetooth devices so all in all these
are great pick up I would even go as far
as to say these are ahead of the bose
qc25 and at a lower price point of 250
so you save yourself $100 you can put
that towards something else so if you're
watching this right now you've been
waiting to get these or deciding between
the to go with these you won't regret it
I promise you you can you can quote me
on this I won't go as far as to say that
I will refund your money but I'm very
confident that you guys if you love bass
if you love clarity if you love noise
cancellation if you is a future that you
really need at a low price point these
are going to be the ones for you
I guarantee it all right so thank you
guys for watching and I will see you
guys in the next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
