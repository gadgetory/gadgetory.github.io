with another battle today we revisit the
age-old debate Samsung versus Apple
Apple versus Samsung but instead of the
usual cell phone battle we are going to
be doing a battle between their
complimentary true wireless earbuds the
icon X mm 18s and the Apple earpods they
both offer specific features to their
respective ecosystems but let's just say
you have both phones like in my case or
you just want the best overall earbuds
between the two then this battle is for
you
air pots are coming in at $160 and the
icon XR coming in at $200 but they are
on sale right now as of this review for
$150 on samsung's website so today we
are going to be picking a overall winner
no matter what ecosystem you are in okay
so everybody's ear is different so I'm
just speaking from my perspective and
from my perspective the Apple earpods
are great they are lightweight and less
intrusive than the icon X that being
said the icon x mm 18s have more of the
traditional in-ear silicon tip design
which isn't quite as comfortable since
there's more earbud in your ear although
less comfortable overall they do block
out more sound than the air pod if that
is a concern of yours then these will be
better for gym travel and to block out
people and noises I do wish the
materials and wings of the icon X were
made with higher quality materials
especially at this price point the Apple
earpods have no touch controls which is
a shame you can take out one ear but to
stop the music but no way to skip change
the volume or change a song without
using Siri the icon X on the other hand
use amazing touch controls on both
earbuds which work flawlessly you can
pause play except cause by tapping and
swiping up and down adjust volume when
it comes to cases though nothing beats
the Apple
pots it's extremely pocketable and can
fit in your pants no matter how tight
your skinny jeans are the icon X case is
on the smaller side and when compared to
other companies but still a little bit
wide in comparison to the Apple earpods
using the app of the Samsung you can add
up to four gigs of music on board on
your earbud which is just amazing this
isn't available for iPhone so you lose
some functionality if you are buying
these for your iPhones overall I have to
give the edge to the icon X for the
touch controls I just love them to death
and I think it is a must for these true
wireless earbuds the case isn't too bad
and the comfort is passable the air pots
are good too but maybe just a little bit
too simple Apple but maybe that's what
they're going for what I love most about
the icon X is the volume most true
wireless earbuds are quiet and this can
suck when you don't have the best
quality music if you listen to oldies
like The Beatles or Motown classics
which can sound low because of the
format they were recorded in at the time
so in that case extra volume comes in
handy the overall quality of the sound
is just better on the air potts though
they are a little bit more warm and
vibrant whereas the icon s can be a
little bit too treble focused and can
become offensive sometimes there is a
surprising amount of soundstage with the
air pods whereas the icon X is lacking
in this area by a huge margin they don't
sound bad but it makes them sound very
average the open design of the air Paz
leads to a lot of outside noise coming
in and that can mess with your music
whereas the clothes design of the icon X
allow you to enjoy your music fully with
no interruptions that Apple earpods
sound great for almost every genre from
raft a classical I really enjoy using
them on a day-to-day basis the icon X
are great for the gym they get plenty
loud and have decent sound they are best
for treble heavy music like classical
and rock overall though going strictly
on sound I have to give this round to
the Apple earpods okay so for the
battery life there's five hours of
playback with the air pods and five
hours of
with icon X the Apple case though gives
you an additional five charges giving
you over 24 hours of battery life
whereas the icon X case only has one
charge so you only get about ten hours
of playback that's good but it doesn't
make it a life product whereas the Apple
earpods allow you to carry them around
all day they become a part of your life
and sometimes that goes a long way when
deciding on a product each have quick
charging the quick charge on the Apple
gives 15 minutes for 3 hours whereas the
icon X only gives you about 1 hour so
the choice here is simple choose Apple
if the battery life is most important to
you when it comes to connectivity
nothing compares to the Apple earpods
whether that's connected to an iPhone or
a galaxy phone they never lose signal
and the distance you can walk away from
your phone is insane I always try to
push the limit with how far I can walk
away and I still to this day haven't
been able to lose connection with any
phones the icon X are also solid as well
with little to no interruptions of your
musical experience but video playback is
delayed whereas on the Apple earpods
it's very accurate and it plays back in
real time so if you're going to be using
these for anything other than music then
the Apple earpods are the winner here
for call quality I don't know how Apple
always seems to put the best mics in
these products it's crazy
these make you sound crystal clear and
both earbuds are able to produce sound
when you're listening to your friends
over the phone
whereas with the icon X only the left
earbud puts out sound when you're on the
phone and the call quality in general
could be a little bit better again call
quality has to go to the air bots so if
I had to choose just one set of earbuds
and one only it would be the air pods
for most people whether you're using a
galaxy or an iPhone the air pots are
just simply fantastic the icon X is a
great offering from Samsung and if you
really want to have onboard music on
your earbuds and don't mind using them
strictly for music and not for video
watching then
those are a solid choice Apple needs to
take a page out of Samsung's book and
put touch controls on the air pots and
Samsung needs to do the same and take
the page out of apples book with its
sound signature connection and battery
if each could do that I think it's gonna
be a neck-and-neck race next year all
right guys so that is going to be my
comparison of the air pods and the icon
X I hope you guys have enjoyed this
