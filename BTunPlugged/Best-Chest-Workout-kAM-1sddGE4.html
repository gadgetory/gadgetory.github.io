and i'm here with the chest workout now
first off my dumb ass didn't film our
good set so here you get to see a shitty
incline press which I'm grinding out the
last rep uh you guys get the idea right
I hope so so we started off with the
incline dumbbell as always and then we
moved into inclined flies now you see
the top you want to bring your pinkies
in when I do this I really feel it in
the bottom of my chest of the lower
portion even though i'm doing incline I
definitely feel it all over my chest I
feel everything firing off all my muscle
fibers and afterwards what we did was a
most muscular pose and this will help
you get that my muscle connection and
get blood into the chest as you see here
and we hold this for about 30 seconds
try it out if you haven't it'll change
your life you know what people miss you
know stare at you or think you're crazy
or think you're into yourself but really
do it for the gains don't be shy about
it you know just ignore that feeling and
just do it try it trust me now next we
moved in to 10 Close Grip this really
focuses on contracting the PEC and then
moved into five partial reps on every
single set just to really tire out the
chest and really go past failure next we
did something called the FST seven
fascist stretch training and what we're
going to do here is seven flies and then
we're going to do seven presses here and
then we're going to do seven incline
push-ups and this is a good way to just
completely annihilate your chest and
really you know get that pump going get
the blood in there and finish off that
chest right I hope you guys have enjoyed
this quick but efficient work out took
me about an hour and a half and catch up
with you guys on the next one worth
you know this 50 buck for about 40
servings but I got off amazon check it
out the mango flavor is amazing it
tastes really good and it's just a good
alternative to</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
