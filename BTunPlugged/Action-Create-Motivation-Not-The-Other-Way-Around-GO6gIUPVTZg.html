was another motivational Monday today's
topic is motivation we see all these
different memes all over Instagram
Facebook Twitter all over the place and
these things they make it feel really
good one minute when we read them like
yeah I'm going to do something the next
minute you're playing video games or
you're just on your phone just
mindlessly scrolling through Instagram
or Twitter your feeds or whatever so I'm
going to tell you guys how to get
motivated and it's something that I deal
with this week so it just made me
realize and be very self-aware and what
I found this week is that motivation
creates more motivation what I mean by
that is by doing an activity by getting
up and just doing something making
something creating something doing going
to the gym put it on those gym clothes
not thinking about it and going to the
gym and just working out if you sit
there and think about it and try to
think your way into doing something it's
never going to happen or it's a slight
chance speaking from my own experience
because I'll just sit here and i'll be
like i know i need to make a video i
know i want to make a video and I try to
tell myself okay make it you're going to
make it cool we're going to make a dope
you're going to make businesses it's
going to be cool but I don't come up
with ideas until I'm actually doing the
project what I'm actually making the
video that's when I get the motivation
to do more oh that's cool maybe I can
give it a shot like this maybe I could
put this kind of music on it maybe I can
do this kind of shot or flashback or
orsini and it's just it creates more
motivation for me to do more work
whereas when I saw a scissor and think
okay if I do this it'll be cool
if I do this is really cool yeah she'd
probably do that I never do it I'm
telling you guys I never do it so it
might be like that for some used as you
know what you need to be doing but
you're kind of stuff you're not
emotionally when you try to think about
it and you try to do it either feel bad
for not doing it or you just say yeah
maybe another day no just get up stop
tell yourself 10 minutes give yourself
10 minutes to do the project or whatever
you need to do whether that's homework
just start writing for 10 minutes just
saying I'm going to be as in for 10
minutes see what happens I guarantee you
you're more likely to finish that
project then to actually sit there and
how to think your way through it it'll
never happen alright guys so that has
been this week's motivational Monday
thank you guys for watching and I will
see you guys next week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
