with another review today I have the MDR
1000 X's did you guys know about these
because I didn't I found out by going to
the Sennheiser Momentum's and somebody
saying the MDR 1000 X's just came out
and that's how I found out so what did I
do
I call it a Best Buy went over I grabbed
of the last pair at the store 104 so
these are supposed to be Sony's response
to the bose qc25 s alright they're
supposed to be that high-end noise
cancelling headphones for traveling and
I can say without a doubt that these are
the best noise cancelling headphones on
the market in this price range so let me
get into this review and share my
thoughts on why these are the best
headphones that you can buy for the
money so let's start off with the
comfort and the design now from the
packaging to the case to the actual
headphones themselves these just scream
quality even the cable even the cable
just screams quality at me I was from
the moment I opened the box I knew that
these were $400 headphones yes that's
right they're $400 and Sony makes you
feel like they are $400 unlike some
other competitors who put their prices
up at 3 350 and you're you get them and
you may say look the buttons are cheap
they don't feel that great the product
has no leather I know the band feels
really weak coughed beats cough oh sorry
with these guys they have leather on the
outside of the cup so when you first
grab them you fill them and you're like
man this is a nice touch these feel
great and then moving on to the leather
cuffs inside they remind me a lot of the
quiet comfort 35s the cups on these are
very swivel like and they're not huge
like the MDR 100 a Bien's that was one
problem that I had is that they stuck
out so far from your head that if you
were to move around
or try to lay back in your seat on a
plane then you would feel them they
would knock out of place and with these
you don't have to worry you know I'm all
about the slim profile keeping it close
to the side of your head like so where
you can get a lot of things done and it
makes you very mobile did not notice
them one bit I could fall asleep or I
can game or I can be using them
comfortably at my desk and not have them
get in the way up now I mentioned the
case before and the case is really nice
it has a small footprint where you can
just throw it into your bag right you're
traveling you just want to throw it into
your bag they've included a very very
nice cable it has little ridges on it I
can't really explain it to you guys but
it has little ridges on it and it feels
very very nice it's going to hold up
really well for when you're on a plane
and you need that cord to plug into a
movie and it has a little adapter for
the plane as well so these are all very
nice touches as you can see these can
stretch out a lot and they won't break
so the Sony is helping you like I always
like to say protect your investment they
don't want these to break they know
they're $400 headphones they know that
you're going to be mad if they break so
they've designed them to stand up to the
test of everyday life so you have the
buttons here on the other side of the
headphones and I will get to this one
later the ambient sound you also have
the noise cancelling you also have the
power button which you just hold and you
have input for your three by five cord
and you also have your USB charging port
so for me the controls were the biggest
negative and I thought that would be
very intuitive because their touch
sensitive but at first it was very hard
to hit forward back up down for volume
press play it was very hard for me I
don't know why this is but they need to
do something to fix this
now one thing if you guys have watched
my reviews in the past you will know
that I am very big on companies pushing
the envelope for us the consumers and
not just putting out a product a
rehashed product at that they slap a 50
dollar increase on the products and then
they sell it back to us
with minimal increase in sound noise
cancellation comfort all those good
things and this is one thing that I've
had a huge gripe with Bose about they
pretty much just took the qc25
put them into a wireless forum and sold
them to us for $50 more now if you saw
my sony MDR 100 ABN review you saw that
i commended Sony on upping their game
when it came to noise cancellation and I
said that they are right there right
there with Bose and I said it's going to
take them a little bit of time to pass
them and what have they done now they
have passed Bose guys these will block
out voices very very well once that
noise cancelling button is on you cannot
hear people I've had people come up
behind me saying hey what's up and they
I have no idea I literally had no idea
and this is one thing that I saw a lot
of people complaining about and reviews
on Amazon everywhere that you know what
you can still hear voices you know you
can still hear that crying baby on the
plane so what did I buy these three
hundred and fifty dollar headphones for
well I'm telling you guys these right
here these block out sound all right big
time and not only that they also block
out all other noises now what I will say
is that they do have a noticeable hiss
when the music is off but that's to be
expected when you have a noise
cancelling headphone so if you hear that
hiss don't be alarmed nothing is wrong
with your headphones that's just the way
they work now these have two microphones
on either side of the
phone and what these do is they hear the
sound coming in from the outside world
and then they send out into your ears
the opposite frequency that will block
out that sound from coming into your
ears isn't that amazing and they have
this on both sides whereas Bose only has
it on one side so as you can tell it's
already going to be a lot better than
the Bose and they also come with this
ambient sound mode they have a normal
mode where you can hear your outside
world right and then they also have a
voices mode where you can block out
everything except for voices so if
you're waiting for that train or you're
waiting for your plane when they're
saying mr. Brannon mr. Beatty we need
you at gate 57 you will be able to hear
that but all other noises going on
around you will be blocked out isn't
that incredible they give you so much
freedom with these headphones to make it
what you want to block out the sounds
that you want nobody else is doing that
so many amazing amazing job like they
thought of everything with these who's
doing that who thought of that that is a
step in the right direction
competition wise for us the consumers to
find something new and exciting and
something to be excited about something
that we can buy the product and be like
wow I cannot believe they thought of
this all in all the noise canceling is
the best out period
so next up let's talk about the sound
now that was another gripe that I had
with the MDR 100 a B end is that the
sound was just okay it sounded like
users went to the store and bought some
school candies with less bass that's the
best way to put it it was good but it
just sounded like regular headphones and
for $350 it left me wanting more so now
income Sony I don't know if they saw my
review or heard all the reviews they up
the sound big-time there's sound stage
in these the bass is enough to satisfy
me as a bass head the vocals are very
warm and clearer now and the highs are
very separated guys it is incredible you
were getting a great package and they
made sure that hey you're paying that
$400 you're going to get a $400 product
you're going to get that $400 sound and
these sound better than the bose qc25
I'm sorry it sounds like some audiophile
esque
headphones not all the way there but
it's as close as you can get right now
with bluetooth wireless headphone now I
know a lot of people call me off for not
using a L DAC device but you know what
my thinking is these are for the average
consumer I'm not going to go out and buy
another Sony device when these already
cost $400 and I wouldn't expect most
people I wouldn't recommend these
headphones to you if they didn't work in
all aspects
yes I'm sure they're great they sound
great amazing with the LD AC but you
know for most people it's not very
practical
this time Sony realized maybe not
everybody is using our devices to play
these maybe they're using iPhones maybe
they're using Samsung Galaxy s7 or note
sevens
too soon so what they did was put in
something called digital sound
enhancement engine and what this does is
it upscales your music so you if you
have a low bitrate
music file these will up your sound
quality through the headphones and it
will boost the sound quality isn't that
amazing they really have thought about
everything that anybody could complain
about that I could complain about call
quality is again exceptional guys I know
a lot of people have a lot of questions
when it comes to the call quality people
heard me loud and clear when you have
the noise cancellation on you can't even
hear yourself talking so the battery
life is set to be 20 hours and that is
what I got I got 20 hours now I use
these for five days at the gym two hours
a day so that's ten hours and then I was
using them for gaming which was about
two hours a day again so about 20 hours
during the week and I had to charge them
on a Saturday on my way to the gym and
of course you're going to get more
battery life when you turn off the noise
cancellation they're using the newest
Bluetooth 4.2 I did not notice any
connectivity issues with these
headphones
so I hope you guys have enjoyed this
review of the MDR 1000 X's because I
know I have and I'm glad that I picked
them up so go out but if you need a
travel pair of headphones skip over the
QC 35 s do yourself a favor go and pick
up these right now for your trip because
you will not be disappointed even if you
want to use them in the gym anywhere the
train your daily commute your office
these block out sound everywhere that's
all I can say and with that being said I
just want to thank you guys for watching
and I will see you guys in the next
review</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
