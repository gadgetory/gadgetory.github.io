again with another motivational Monday
today I want to talk to you guys about
the creative grind now this past week or
two weeks three weeks month I've been
kind of going through the paces of how
do I make these videos better for you
guys making quality videos I want to
make sure that every video is just
getting constantly constantly better and
with that comes a lot of stress and it
makes you almost not want to do it now I
have about say two three reviews that
you know I have done but I haven't
released them because I feel like
they're not up to par and that just goes
with our self criticisms and all those
crazy things that we think of in our
mind that just things aren't good enough
with our product or whatever we're
making isn't good enough so what I'm
doing this week it's just keeping it fun
I'm not going for perfect I'm not going
for the best I'm going for fun I want to
make the whole process of making these
videos fun and in life that's what we
have to do sometimes sometimes we get so
caught up in the process and do do do be
better be better that we forget to just
have fun slow down and have fun with
this and that's what there isn't why I
started this YouTube channel was for us
not only to help you guys but also to
have fun have fun making the videos have
fun to do the editing all those good
things and I've kind of lost that I've
kind of lost that that drive to do
what's fun and just kind of reminding
myself going back the camera all videos
I'll just just remind myself just to
have fun and the same goes with you guys
always remember in life to enjoy what
you're doing just have fun find
something within it that makes it fun
I know that we kind of have all these
things that we do that just become
regular and basic and they kind of lose
their exciting nough sand
we need to actually just slow down and
come back to the reason why we started
and that's what I'm doing this week so
this week I will be releasing two more
videos before you guys I'm gonna work
really hard on them and just have fun
you know they're not gonna be perfect so
don't expect perfect but expect fun
alright guys so I will see you guys in
the next motivational Monday and well
next video so go out there remember to
have fun and enjoy life enjoy your
holiday weekend for those of you in the
US and just enjoy life for everybody
else that is around the world I love you
guys too alright so I will see you guys
in the next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
