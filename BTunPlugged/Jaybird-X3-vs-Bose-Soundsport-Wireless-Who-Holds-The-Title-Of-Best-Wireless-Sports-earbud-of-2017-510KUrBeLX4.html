didn't see you there oh is this this is
something you guys have been asking for
for a very long time
you guys ready to see what it is all
right let's do it
I would watch
yeah
what is up guys is BT back here again
with another battle a much requested
battle between two of the biggest names
and wireless bluetooth headphones at the
moment period can you guys guess what
they are
oh I guess you are just all the title so
it is a battle between the jaybird X 3s
and the Bose sounds or Wireless which
one do I think is the best I've given
rave reviews on the Southport Wireless
and I slammed the j-bird freedoms and I
got a lot of flack for that but hey it
was the true so j-bird has come back
with an excellent product in the j-bert
x3 so how do they hold up against the
Bose sound sport Wireless we are going
to find out in this battle right now I'm
going to tell you guys which one I use
the most and which one I think is the
best so without any further ado let's
get into this battle enough talking
let's get into it so first you know I
love to start off with the comfort and
design so that's what we're going to do
so both of these headphones have two
different designs and they could appeal
to different parties different crowds so
I'm going to tell you guys the pros and
cons I feel like of each type of
headphone so let's start off with the
jaybird X threes now if you guys have
seen my how I use glue to video if you
haven't seen it go check it out I
described how to get the perfect fit
with the jaybird X 3s where they're
comfortable you can wear them all day
and they won't move
now I saw a lot of people say okay I
can't run with them I can't do XYZ with
them but you can you just have to get
the right fit and the right fit for me
has been the foam tip the wings and
doing the X fit that is the best for me
and they do not move throughout my
entire workout I sometimes forget to
bury them there I'd never have to even
adjust them because the foam just kind
of sticks to your ear j-bert also
updated the remote from that small
little thin piece that I don't know what
that was feel like a toy to this nice
feeling remote it feels really solid I
like it's very clicky at stay cookie for
the time that I've used it so I can't
really complain jay-bez courts have
always been solid
they don't stick to the back your neck
when you're sweating so all in all great
design from Jay bird and the Jay bird x3
so in my old Bose video I saw a lot of
people commenting oh they look huge
stick out from your ear they're going to
fall out and I can tell you guys that
the Bose sound or Wireless if you get
the right fit
do not fall out they have their patented
stay here tips which stay on the outside
of your ear canal which is kind of like
a Apple earpods almost so you have it
goes into your ear and it kind of sits
there it doesn't go all the way into the
canal like a jaybird x3 so because of
that they're going to let in more sound
than the gay bro decks threes the tips
are made of this nice silicon material
that I forget that these are in as well
I never have to adjust these at all
because they sit on the outside of your
ear canal so with that you don't have to
constantly be pushing them back deeper
into your ear canal to keep them to stay
and some people have had that problem
with the jaybird X threes so all the
pins on you know each individual ear and
what works best for you or it's Bose I
love their cord and I love the remote
they feel very solid I love them they're
very click and honestly wait they're
both they're about the same weight
honestly even with this big big earbud
they still feel very light I don't know
how they did that but even though it
sticks out it's very light guys trust me
on that for the comfort and design round
this is what I have to say if you like
earbuds that you have to push into your
ear and that block out a lot of noise
you're going to want to go with the
j-bird x3 if you like ear buds that sit
on the outside of your ear canal which
won't irritate your ears then go with
the Bose sound support Wireless but keep
in mind these are going to let in a lot
of sound but one tip that I have to kind
of combat that is is to push them into
your area if you guys have seen my
overview I say this to push them this
way into your ear a little bit and it
gets you a nice feel the bass is a lot
better and you'll block out more of the
stuff so if I have to pick a winner for
the comfort and design for me personally
I will go with the Jaber x3 because
there are so many variations you can
wear it in you can wear it in the X fit
which I love you can wear it with the
wire hanging down and with the phone
tips you get that added traction in your
ears where it will not fall out on you
constantly and one tip for I know a lot
of you guys out there to say brands we
fall out all the time
go with the size that you think is
bigger than what you need next up let's
talk about the sound so these both have
apps that come with their headphones but
they are two totally different apps the
jaybird
my sound app is leaps and bounds ahead
of the Bose arbos it just is you can
choose different sound profiles you can
change the actual firmware out of the
headset so if you were to connect it to
your iPhone change the profile to a bass
heavy profile and then go and connect to
your macbook it would carry over that
same setting that is truly amazing so
that is a big benefit of the j-bert X
threes when it comes to sound the Bose
sounds for wireless there are no
slouches these have an active EQ which
will adjust to whatever you're listening
to so if you're one minute you're
listening in the rock and it's going to
adjust to that and they listen to rap is
going to block have more bass so that is
a really cool feature you don't even
have to touch these when you're in the
gym whereas maybe on the my sound app
you know you notice that okay these
highs are way too high for me these
vocals are way too harsh for me and you
could tone it down in the app from the
settings that it has for my EDM music
and now I'm listening to some classical
music to finish off my workout which
brings me to my next point the J vertex
threes are very flat so I see a lot of
people on the continent saying they
don't sound that great that's because
they come with a flat profile they're
not going to have a lot of bass they're
not going to imagine it's like this okay
you have a line straight across this is
so that you can color it imagine it's
like a blank canvas and you can paint
whatever you want on it to make it what
you want does that make sense so when
it's flat it's saying look since I have
a flat profile you can move the bass up
you can move the myths up down high up
and down to color it to wherever you
want if this was a bass heavy headphone
and then you up the bass you'd be
getting all type of distortion which
would affect your music heavily so
that's why people straight out of the
box the J directories
don't sound that great to be honest
whereas a lot of people might put in the
bows not to have to touch anything
they don't want to be bothered and
they're going to be able to look these
sounds way better than the j-bird x3 I
will say that as an all-around headphone
the both sounds for wireless sound
better than the jaybird x-rays even with
them I found out I just sounds so rich
the David x-rays give you a lot of
soundstage but with soundstage comes a
lot of air airiness because you have two
separate things right so you're going to
have that spaces between the music
whereas the bows are going to be very
full and rich and some people may like
that so if you're a person that just
likes rich full-bodied music go with
this one
if you like something where you're
looking in the classic or you hear of
food in a drama and this year you can
hear something in that ear you can hear
something else go with the j-bird expert
my pick for sound is the bow sounds for
wireless I just love the way they sound
out of the box and the act of viewcube
just works so well you don't even have
to touch it you don't even have to even
though the my sound app is great and I
love it I love the sound of the daybreak
series as well these I don't know what
it is just something brings me back to
them every time sound wise next up let's
talk about the connectivity the
Bluetooth right these are bluetooth
wireless headphones now I did notice a
slight delay with the jaybird X 3s when
watching videos so if you're somebody
that's primarily going to be watching
videos the Bose wireless are going to
have a more solid connection for that in
a much faster connection but if you're
somebody that's just listening to music
you're just going to be listening to
these in the gym these both are equal I
had equals success with these I have had
no breakups no interruptions during my
workouts even during busy hours at 5:00
p.m. right after work everybody's being
off I
not have any type of interruption with
either of these so you cannot go but
just for the fact that the boats have a
faster bluetooth and it can keep up with
dialogue on like YouTube videos let's
say my videos my mouth will be moving
with my words as opposed to j-bird they
might be slightly behind so that's
something to take into consideration if
you're considering consuming video media
on your phone or laptop or whatever
alright so next up we're going to talk
about the battery life now recently I
lost my j-bird x3 charging cord but
luckily my roommate has a spare that
he's letting me borrow for this review
yeah yeah just good so guys let's finish
up and let's talk about the battery life
it just why not just put the standard
micro USB on the jaybird X 3s it makes
no sense why do we need a dongle and to
get a replacement I looked online it is
$15 to get a replacement that is crazy
that's insane that makes you buy this
whole big set of all the accessories all
over again and I feel like that could be
avoided because let's be honest raw
human we're going to lose that dongle at
some point over the years you're telling
me you're not going to lose it
I lost it during my move to my new
apartment what can I do I'm out of luck
I can't use them until I get my dongle
back with that out of the way with that
little rant so with the Bose I get about
6 hours and when both of 6 hours it is
definitely six dollars if not more
you're not going to drop below that with
the j-bird x3 it's great it's about 8
hours with the volume of high or low you
know what the battery is going to drain
a different rate sometimes you may be
averaging 7 hour which is still really
good it's still better than the Bose
right so you can't really complain so
the batteries around I have to give it
to the j-bird x3 is because they really
step their game up from the jaybird x2 s
and the ex
to the x3 because now they're getting
almost a full eight hours at high volume
and that's still incredible still beat
out the bows so I have to give it to
them kudos to j-bird x3 they win the
battery around so it's 2-2 to Jaber 1
the comfort and the battery both on the
sound and the connectivity so which is
most important to you both headphones
are great and I don't think you can go
wrong with either one of them but there
has to be a winner this is a battle
after all so who do you guys think won
and if you've tried both let me know
down in the comments below which one you
think is better for me personally the
ones that I use the most to one set I
keep coming back to time and time and
again so for me the winner is the j-bird
x3 and that's just me personally and I'm
going to tell you why I love how much
they isolate sound first and foremost
because when I'm in a crowded gym I
workout in a 24 hour fitness super sport
in the middle of a city a big city and
it's very very crowded and noisy it's
very evident when I'm wearing the Bose
sound for wireless then I'm in that
environment with a lot of people because
I can hear everything with the J vertex
threes I'm able to block out all these
people focus in on my workout I look up
them like where am i oh yeah
a massive gym and that's what I love I
love being just immersed in the music
the sound stage even though it's Airy
even though it's not as rich as the Bose
it still has its own little sound
signature that I just love and I love
being able to increase my bass all the
way up and my mids all the way up for
the vocals it just it's great
another thing before I forget is the
loudness the Bose gets way louder than
the j-bird x3 but that's because they
have that open ear they're going to let
in more ambient sound so to block out
more sound they're going to let you
boost that sound up that's why they're
louder but if you have that isolation
you don't need something to be that high
with a jaybird x3 so you'll protect your
hearing a little bit more as well which
I like my ears aren't ringing after my
and
my workouts so I hope I've been able to
give you guys something to think about
and just give me my perspective on who I
think is the best workout headphone
right now and that's these bad boys
j-bird x3 alright guys so that's in my
time let me know down in the comments
below where your experience has been
with either one of these headphones did
you like them did you hate them let me
know I love getting other people's
perspectives and it kind of gives me
things to think about also if you want
to see me review any headphones or you
want to see a dog battle between any
other headphones let me know down the
cost below and I will be sure to deliver
to you guys and if you haven't already
