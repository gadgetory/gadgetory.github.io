with another review today we're going to
do a battle between the Magic Mouse to
the Space Gray edition coming in at a
hundred bucks versus the Logitech MX
master 2s now these are great editing
Mouse's and I've been going back and
forth between the two trying to find the
best one that allows me to speed up my
editing both have their strengths and
weaknesses so let's get into it today
but before we begin don't forget to
subscribe if you haven't already it
really helped the channel and it helps
me get more of these videos out to you a
so economically these things are totally
different I mean the Logitech MX master
2's is about four times the size of the
Magic Mouse - and it's a Virgo Mouse
which means that it's going to fit your
hand like a glove it's gonna feel more
comfortable right off the bat whereas
the Magic Mouse is a fingertip grip
Mouse which is like more for precision
you know you get that extra dexterity
from your fingers to really get the like
put right positioning that you want I
found what the would logitech even
though it is more comfortable overall i
miss a lot of things so i'll overshoot
things because I have less dexterity my
fingertips aren't really gripping the
mouse it's more of my wrist controlling
it so I'll miss things on the timeline I
have to go back so it takes a little bit
of time to really get exactly what you
want as for the buttons the design of
these the MX master has about eight
buttons on it and this thing can be
bound to anything that you want I mean
my blade tool my scrolling tools
everything is on this mouse was which
makes editing really really easy for me
I like having it all at my fingertips
they have one at the thumb they have one
scroll where you can also scroll through
the timeline horizontally you can scroll
very nicely by just flicking it and
it'll start
spinning it like it and then finished
scroll which is also very nice so there
is a lot a lot of customization and
through the logitech app you can
actually change what each key binding
does per each application so if I have
something in Final Cut that I need to
use like let's say a blade tool I can
bind that to the B and it won't affect
my desktop of functionality the same
buttons will work the same way but in
Final Cut it will work the way I bound
it in the application which is really
cool
now you can click that middle button and
just have your scroll free fly all over
the place that's cool too if that's your
thing so with the Magic Mouse too which
makes it so cool is that it is a touch
pad as well so you can scroll
horizontally it actually has the
gestures on it where if you like swipe
two fingers across it it doesn't action
if you tap twice on it it does a mission
control for you there's a lot of
functionality there and like I said I
kind of am faster with it because I can
control with my finger so the bindings
on the Logitech sometimes even though
they are good I feel like I'm just so
much quicker than with the Magic Mouse
too that it kind of overrides all these
bindings and all these key presses
because you can't have to think your
brain has to think a little bit like
okay this is that button this is this in
even after a while after using it for
months now I still have to like think to
myself what is that key binding what is
that and the Magic Mouse even though it
is very simple there's a lot of
functionality to it the scrolling
horizontally is nice and smooth up and
down as nice and smooth I just I love
the speed at which it Scrolls so one
thing that the master mx2 us has over
the Magic Mouse too is that it can
actually flow so it can connect to
multiple devices which is really cool so
even if I want to use it on a Mac versus
a PC I can switch over using flow which
is very very cool now this thing also
uses Bluetooth and has USB receiver
whereas the Magic Mouse is just
bluetooth and having that added
functionality is very very nice
sometimes where you can just go from
computer to computer switch from three
different devices and not have to worry
about it it kind of makes it in all
purpose all function Mouse so you're
getting a lot of value out of it to me
the scrolling for both of these are very
very good if the sensors on them are
very very good to me they almost feel
very similar both sensors feel great to
me I don't feel like there's any
noticeable difference I know there's
differences in DPI but I think most
people will be satisfied with either of
these and how they track I mean it's not
like gaming where you have to have a
very very specific dpi and have it work
very very well this is kind of just like
all right desktop stuff editing browsing
type deal now the Magic Mouse feat I
feel at first were a little bit weird
when I saw them but they actually glide
very very nicely on tabletop surfaces
and cloth mouse pads where I felt like
the master mx2 as feild is on cloth I
mean it feels good on a table but
sometimes there's a lot of jitteriness
and the heaviness of it can cause it to
kind of drag on some services now we all
know of the infamous USB charging the
Lightning charging of the Magic Mouse -
this thing is horrendous it's on the
bottom of the mouse which doesn't make
any sense because you can't use it while
it's plugged in so kind of dumb so you
got to keep it charged Logitech mouse on
the other hand they smartly put it on
the front of the mouse which you can
just control and just have it work very
very well now the battery life is where
these things cannot be any different the
Magic Mouse is said to last about nine
hours and that makes master can last
seventy days and that's based on an
eight hour a day usage for 70 days as
above 560 hours holy crap so going back
and forth between these two Mouse's
which one do I pick well lately I've
been going with the Magic Mouse - and
let me tell you why
the precision alone I don't know what it
is I'm just so quick and nimble with
this thing I can get to what I need to
get to I can cut where I need to cut and
I can just move around the timeline very
seamlessly sometimes with the key
bindings with the Logitech I would have
them get in the way because I'd have to
think about it so much and that alone
took more brainpower to
then actually just using a mouse being
quick with it and getting the job done
so maybe sometimes having too many
options can be a hindrance who knows
alright guys so that is going to do it
for this battle thank you guys for
watching don't forget to Like share
