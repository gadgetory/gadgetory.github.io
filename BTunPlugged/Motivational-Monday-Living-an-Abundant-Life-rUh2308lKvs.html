again with another motivational Monday
today we're going to be talking about
abundance now let's say that somebody
asks you for twenty dollars but you're
not doing so well in the money
department your first instinct is to
hoard that twenty dollars to keep every
nickel and dime and not spend and you're
going to be hoarding you're not going to
be able to give to others let's say I
give you twenty dollars what I'm saying
subconsciously is that I have money to
give you and this goes with anything in
life with the confidence friendship love
any of these things that means that you
have it already you can't give something
you don't have by me giving you that
twenty dollars and he said I have twenty
dollars so if you give somebody
confidence give them a compliment say
hey you look good today guess what
Dennis day you will get today because
your brain gonna hear you've ever came
to get it here you you as an eye you you
look good so do this with anything in
life give you know whether that's
friendship give more friendship give
more love find a way to be there for
people find a way to give to others even
when it's not asked
and you will see a comeback to you 10
it's the law of attraction it's a lawful
bundage so when you come from abundance
you will have abundant we'll see if i'm
in student life so i hope this guy has
helped you guys today let me know how
abundance has working in your life if
you've done something similar to this
and your life and how it worked or
things that you believe or if there's
anything you want me to talk about let
me know down in the comments below we're
going to start a conversation on how we
can improve our lives and improve the
lives of others I will see you guys in
the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
