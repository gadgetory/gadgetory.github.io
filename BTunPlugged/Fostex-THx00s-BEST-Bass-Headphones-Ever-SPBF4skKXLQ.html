with another review today I'm bringing
you guys the best sounding bass
headphones I have ever tried and those
are the fostex th x zero zeros now these
are supposed to be some of the best bass
headphones on the market and so how I
stumbled upon them was I went on the hit
fight forums I wanted to hear what real
bass sounded like outside of beads
outside of all the nonsense what does a
great bass sound like so I was looking
around and I found the most recommended
headphone that was the fostex x00 and
lucky for me they were having a mass
drop on these and I went on there and I
joined the drop and if you don't know
what master opt is they just join a
bunch of people together and you get the
headphones for a lower price
now I'm not sponsored by mass drop or
anything but I really think that's a
cool idea so this isn't paid for by mass
drop or fostex or anything like that but
I really like the idea of mass drop
because you can just go on there join a
drop and on a certain date they will
give you a lower discount price
depending on how many people join the
drop now this headphone came out to
about four hundred dollars now it was a
true gamble
I honestly bought these and I had my
reservations I was like you know what
I'm kind of throwing away $400 by buying
these I don't really know if they're
great I haven't heard them I've never
even heard of fostex I've never even
tried the brand so what did i do I just
took a leap of faith and got the X zero
zeros so in this review I'm going to
tell you what my findings are on these
headphones
so let's start off with the comfort and
design now the first thing I noticed was
the leather cuffs they're not real
leather their leather Rhett as it says
on the website but they're comfortable
and nonetheless not as comfortable as my
lcd twos the leather doesn't feel as
good if there's a little bit on the
plastic fake side so that's something if
it bothers your ears or something that
really bugs you or nags you about a
product or they use fake leather you're
not gonna want these but other than that
I didn't mind them at all they're very
lightweight so much so that I almost
felt that they felt cheap in a way I for
some reason I don't know about you guys
always equate quality materials with how
heavy they are but you know what that's
not always necessarily true so I'm in
the wrong because the bill on these is
incredible I love the headband
love-love-love at first I was kind of
wary of it but it's very flexible it's
great it just it just feels very nice so
one thing that's often overlooked is the
hinges no I love the hinges on this
headphone I love how you can expand the
headband and fit it to your head size
it's just the clicking the smoothness of
it I've had some headphones where it's
very jerky these are just very smooth
and very well built now one thing I
didn't like about this headphone is the
cord it's ten feet long and this thing
is braided which I really like I like
braided but it does not detach from the
bottom of the headphone and that is a
deal-breaker to some people because
nowadays most headphones they come with
a little jack or you can just take out
the cord if it ever breaks down on you
with these it's like you're kind of
you're gambling with four hundred
dollars every time you you stuff these
in the bag or roll up the cord because
who knows you might get a short right so
in that sense I don't know why they just
wouldn't put a detachable cord I know
you can get a custom design where you
can have people customize your
headphones and put detachable cords on
your headphones but that's another cost
that they could have just avoided so
moving on I'm ending the comfort
with my favorite favorite part of this
headphone and that is this in mahogany
wood this gloss finished wood it is
incredibly sexy and beautiful so these
are my favorite pair of headphones now
these look amazing they just look so
classy so beautiful I just cannot
explain to you guys how great these look
in person truly truly stylish headphone
now each headphone they say is built
with different wood so you're gonna get
a design from so they say each headphone
is designed specifically for you so each
headphone is gonna be different so if I
get these and you got a pair yours are
going to be different than mine so
that's a cool little minor feature that
these are a unique pair that nobody else
in the world will ever have sorry guys
but you can also get your own pair and
you know what I can't have your pair so
it goes both ways so let's talk about
the sound the most important part of any
headphone these are the best sounding
headphones that I've ever tried I
thought my lcd twos the thousand dollar
ones would knock these out of the park I
thought you know these are 400 versus
$1,000 headphones no these are
incredible the wood just gives these
headphones the percussion it just gives
so much resonance now when I was
listening to acoustic songs the string
felt like it was on the back of my head
every time somebody strum did the bass
on these is like nothing I've ever heard
no beats no bows no Sony can compete
with these headphones it's just unreal
if you guys are bass heads these are the
ones to get if you love jazz these were
great if it sounded like the piano was
in the room with me it sounded like the
trumpet was right behind my left ear how
did they put it soundstage into a closed
back headphone and not make it sound
fake these are just have so much
separation
the drums that just everything listening
to the new Drake CD if you love
blink-182 of these work great it's just
an all-around great headphone if you
love instruments if you love bass if you
love hearing emotion in the song I
listen to Sam Smith latched acoustic
version that just sounded it sounded
like a whole new song like that was the
first time I've ever heard the song that
is what these headphones will give you
they'll give you an experience that
you've never had before
I just cannot stress how great these
headphones are I really I just wish you
guys could try these on try them and and
just experience what I've experienced
and plugging it into my court mojo it
brings up the bass even more the warmth
even more and it just it just knocks my
socks off and these headphones are very
easy to drive now these only need 25
ohms which can be driven by a phone I
don't recommend it to get the full full
capabilities of this headphone but they
can't work like that so if you're not
somebody that has an amp on hand or a
DAC on him these will work great with
your phone as well and I tested it and
they don't sound that they actually
sounded really good the bass guys it's
just man I just I really I really really
love these headphones so guys I just
cannot express to you how much these are
worth four hundred dollars I just I want
to convey that to you and I want that to
be the message that even though it's
four hundred dollars beats Sony and all
those those cost four hundred dollars
and for four hundred dollars you can get
these and they will blow your socks off
you think you've heard sound you think
you've heard your music get these try
them out and let me know what you think
can go on mass drop I'll drop the link
below again I'm not sponsored or
anything I just really love the product
and when I really love the product I'm
gonna let you guys know that's why I'm
here I'm not here to just promote
product here to help you guys get the
bed
Bank your book and that starts with a
fostex pH X zero zeros done and we let n
you know your Papa Joe open the window</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
