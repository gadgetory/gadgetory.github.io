here again with another vlog today we're
going to go do some arms we're going to
go to ikea have some fun you know like
he is always fun right gonna get some
food I don't know what yet but that is
the plan for that is the relative plant
it for today we'll see what else we can
get into but I need to first and
foremost I got this new dressers
beautiful dresser from ashley furniture
and have all this junk that I need to
organize so ikea please help me right
now i'm going to head to the gym and
then afterwards we're going to go back
to you see you guys a little bit now you
may be thing isn't that the shirt you
wore last Saturday yes it is but the way
you know it's a different day it had
different kicks on but there are tied
alright so in the vlogs I kind of want
to give more in-depth tips or just ideas
throughout the day maybe to give a
little bit more value in these vlogs so
you guys get something out of it
this is just not pure entertainment you
learn something while you're here so I'm
about to do arms now when I do arms I do
RIT principal what that means is you
want to do the body part thats lagging
first so that's biceps with less triceps
do that one first hit it hard and then
switch over to the next workout to the
next body part so that is a tip that I
have a lot of people they do the body
part that looks best first which I don't
get or they switch off the do bicep
tricep bicep tricep bicep for me it
doesn't work and I before I did that and
I never really got any good games and I
recently started seeing really good
games because I started doing my biceps
first my triceps have always been pretty
good I just started doing my my biceps
first because they're weak and they're
lagging and now I'm kind of filling them
out and my arms look twice the size that
they did before so take this tip use it
with any work out if your lower back is
better than your upper back workout your
upper back first if your lower chest is
weaker or doesn't look as good your
upper chest do the Lord chest and then
go from there alright guys so i will see
you guys after I'm finished so just
finish the workout the AC was
broken so I'm sweating as hell right now
I had to cut my workout short because I
was just so so sweaty and I was just
exhausted like I was going through my
the motions of working out you know
we've all been there we're just going
through the motions and you're like
like I'm not getting anything out of
this you know you do your best but in
the day sometimes
you just gotta listen to your body and
not just say that I'm like giving up
like I'm not giving up it's just I'm
going to come back and fight another day
I'm wearing down the triceps today got
through biceps halfway through triceps
so with that being said I am gonna
finish triceps tonight at home so
triceps get your ass ready for tonight
all right when it cools down some coming
for you another tip this is my favorite
album at the moment the focus John
bellian he had a song with Zedd
beautiful now so you might know him from
that but go check out this album is
called the human condition it's really
good i listen to it in the gym at work
in the car everywhere and I'm not sick
of it since it came out which is about a
month now and I still rocket every I
listen to his CD every single day
definitely go check him out
we're here first I am
so as you see from my videos have a lot
of shoes so I'm thinking about getting
this and just putting them all under my
bed we think nine bucks might do it I'm
trying to decide between these lights
kind of a cool little decoration or they
would like to stand like ones over there
I can vlog because my hands are free so
trying to figure out life right now
don't know which ones to get up
this one I made the mistake of getting
this one last time that was a mistake it
is it's okay but it leans over quality
isn't that good definitely don't
recommend that one you saw the vlog last
time you know I was looking for some art
well we're in the art section and the
price is not too bad so let's get
something well it was a successful trip
to Ikea and not a lot of organizing
stuff although I did not find paintings
I remember their paintings being a lot
better before they were not good and I
don't want to just buy something just to
have something up on the wall I want it
to be something that I love or like at
least if not love like you know so that
didn't work out so well but I got a
drawer a mountain drawer for my desk
which I need I got organizer for my
shoes which I need and I got some lights
for my Phillip Hughes which I'm going to
do a review on sand or probably today
since since i got these light stands
that is that I'm gonna head home I don't
know I'm gonna get some food i'm
freaking hungry I'm gonna get some food
at least and after that we're gonna set
