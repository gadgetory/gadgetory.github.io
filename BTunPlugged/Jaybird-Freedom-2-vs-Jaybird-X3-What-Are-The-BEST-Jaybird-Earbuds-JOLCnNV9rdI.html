with another battle today we have a
battle between in my opinion two of Jay
burrs best products both have their
issues but also have a lot of upside as
well the freedom twos are coming in at
149.99 and the jaybird X 3s can be found
around $100 now so are the freedom twos
worth that extra 50 bucks let's find out
today and let's get this battle started
right now okay so let's start off with a
comfort and design of these headphones
the freedom twos use a speed fit which
is pretty much a built in X fit which is
offered by the X threes I always
recommend that people use x fit anyways
on all Jay Baer products as it just
makes them fit better and stay out of
your way as opposed to lay in the court
hang on your neck it gets tossed around
it gets pulled I prefer the speed fit
though over the original X fit as it
allows you to make adjustments on the
fly without having to take apart and
reapply the X fit clips like on the J
Brand X 3s both have similar remotes but
with the freedoms they are a little bit
bigger and a little bit heavier than the
X 3s the freedom to use Jabir's newest
ear tips that have wings connected to
the ear buds which I feel like they made
to increase the actual size of the ear
buds for more surface area to keep these
earbuds in meanwhile the J Brand X 3s
use two separate pieces which offer more
flexibility when you want to add foam
tips or maybe a different sized ear tip
with a different wing tip you get all
these different combinations that you
can make whereas the freedoms are just
one size fits all the smaller size ear
but casings of the freedom to s would
seem to be better and lighter but I
actually prefer the size of the David X
threes as the added size gives you more
surface area to keep the ear buds in
your ear all in all I find myself coming
back to the X 3s another thing I like
about the X threes is they have this
court design that is flat whereas the
round cable shape of the freedom twos I
have less faith in especially near that
connection to the actual
but housing I think that in the future
the X fours will have the speed fit
which will combine the best of both
worlds in my opinion but the flexibility
of the air buds and the wings of the X
3s lead to more security and less
adjustment so the X threes win this
round okay so for sound you know both
sound great to be honest with you guys
so I'll just go over the subtle
differences that I found the freedom
twos have more bass surprisingly and the
sound stage is a little bit more
impressive it's a little bit more
spacious than the jaybird X threes they
sound more full sounding whereas the X 3
sometimes can sound a little bit more
hollow like some of you guys know both
take advantage of the great jaybird app
being able to change the firmware of the
headphones so that you can take them
from one device to another with the same
EQ settings
is just incredible with the app you get
a chance to customize these headphones
to any genre you like so I can really
recommend either for all genres of music
it's just simply incredible and this is
one of the main reasons why people
choose jaybird over all other products
both are top-of-the-line earbuds for
sound quality but the freedom to sound
like an upgraded version of the x3 so
the sound round goes to the freedom to
use okay so the battery life I'm just
gonna cut to the chase both of these
earbuds use dollars which I hate I hate
hate hate it but the J Brand X 3 is give
you the 8 hours of battery life stand
alone whereas the deeper twos they gave
you 4 hours plus another 4 hours if you
carry around the dongle this in my
opinion is a recipe for disaster
leading to you losing your dongle and
the only way to charge your headphones
doesn't that sound like hell so this
round has to go to the j-bird x3 the
connectivity the Jaber twos get more
breakups than the j-bird X 3s
surprisingly since they're the newer
headphones a newer tech so I don't know
what happened here but both of these
suffer from slight delay on YouTube
videos so I have to give it to the
j-bird X 3s but really if they were
going up against any other headphones
they would probably lose
so coming to the end of this battle now
I have to choose a winner and to be
honest with you guys
although the j-bird X threes are a year
old now they kind of still own the
freedom twos have some bluetooth issues
that kind of really hinder them and the
lack of customization with the tips and
the wing aren't really worth that slight
increase in sound quality you gain the
smaller form factor of the freedom to s
don't really mean much when they're
falling out of your ears constantly so
because of these reasons I have to give
the best jaybird earbud title to the X
threes
alright guys so thank you guys for
watching thumbs if you liked sub if you
loved and I will see you guys in the
next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
