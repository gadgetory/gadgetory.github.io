with another review today we're gonna be
looking at the Trev z2 now Trev lab was
nice enough to send me out a pair of
these headphones which I've been testing
all week gladly might I add these things
are incredible and they come at a low
price of $70 so today I'm going to get
into why I've been grabbing these for
the gym over every other headphone that
i have even sony's included these things
are the real deal now these are the
first pair of headphones over ear
headphones that a company has ever sent
me in the budget category so I didn't
know what to expect really I went in
with the skepticism to say the least a
lot of the times was back in the past
when I used to get the old school
candies they weren't that grade so I was
really excited to finally try out a pair
of over ear budget headphones and these
if budget headphones are sounding like
this then Bose Sony and all these other
companies are in trouble because at $70
these sound incredible the bass is
really really good and the volume is
amazing if you don't want to bring your
$300 pairs of Sony's to the gym bring
these and these are a great substitution
especially since my beats just died
I've been grabbing these every single
day for the gym the bass is good the
treble is good the mids are good there's
clarity all around there's the
incredible detail for this price point
and that's something that took me aback
so anyone that is hesitating on the
sound profile of these don't have to
worry you don't worry at all these
things are also very very comfortable
they stay out of your way they're very
lightweight the cups feel great the
leather doesn't get too hot all the
things you would need in a great gym
headphone or any headphone for any
reason the this just has everything one
area where I did feel like it could be
better is the clicking on the headband
now adjusting the headband did feel a
little bit you start to feel that $70
price point there as opposed to
something like a Sony WH one
XM twos which is just super smooth but I
noticed what these did really well as
they kept the adjustment that I chose
very well it's very sturdy whereas on
the Sony's and stuff like that it would
slip or in my head or will not move
around or do things the band would
adjust by itself because it's so lacks
the button system on this thing works
flawlessly they have a place to charge
it for your USB they have an aux cord
that you can plug in as well which is
very nice and then they have a noise
cancellation switch now this noise
cancellation is not the best and at
times I felt like it got in the way of
actually hearing my music so I usually
would turn it off so they would produce
a little bit of white noise which would
lead to a little bit of sound aggression
in my song so I sometimes would turn it
off when it became too noticeable but
for the most part I was able to leave it
on in the gym either way these block out
a ton of noise ANC on or not the battery
life is also incredible in these I was
not disappointed one thing that I did
notice is that when I was charged them
in my car I usually drive from work so I
go from work to the gym and that's
usually when I charge my headphones so I
plugged these in and usually by the time
I get to the gym with other headphones
that have quick charging usually I have
about 50% 60% with these the battery was
still low and they have a little warning
that tells you that the battery is low
so I couldn't take these into the gym I
think one time which it was just too
annoying but for the most part it has 35
hours it recharge them properly to a
wall
instead of like a car charger then these
charged very fast and also - they last a
long time 35 hours is ridiculous
especially for this price point
now the Bluetooth experience was also
amazing with these I never had dropped
calls or dropped my connection with my
phone ever I really enjoyed this and I
wasn't expecting that usually with
budget headphones that's the first thing
that happens your Bluetooth breaks down
when people come around with their beats
or their fancy Sony's or Bose and you
got these budget ones on you get
breakups one more thing that I do want
to add
you know for the company to ask for my
opinion on the uses I wish the logo was
a little bit smaller they have the logo
here they have a Tribble app on here
that have z2 they have Tribble app again
on here so I really like minimalistic
branding on my headphones just maybe a
little trip lap symbol here on the
bottom you don't need it everywhere else
and I think people would get the picture
and that's something that I really like
and I think that might turn people off
from them again these are amazing and
I've looked past the logo issue I've
been using them every single day but if
I could design these myself I would kind
of just take it down a notch on the logo
stuff so yeah overall for seventy
dollars you can't beat this these are
amazing and sometimes they always have
deals on Amazon I've seen this brand a
lot they have deals here and there so if
you can try to pick up a pair if you
want something you already have Sony's
or you already have Bose or something
like that you just want a pair that you
can just abuse take to the gym it's
sturdy
the connection is great the volume is
great there's bass the clarity is there
these have everything that you could
possibly want in a gym headphone so
definitely check them out again the Trib
lab z2z tubes yeah alright guys so I
hope you guys have enjoyed this review
