with another motivational Monday today
we're taking down that inner critic you
know the one that says you can't do
something you can't accomplish your
goals you can meet the right people that
you need to be meeting and get the right
made all those things we all have that
inner critic that gets on our ass and
that tears us down well I have a simple
solution this is what you do the next
time you hear that voice saying hey you
can't do this when you hear that voice
in your head repeat it again but in a
silly voice so like i like to use goofy
i I can't do a good and goofy
impersonation right now but it's like
you know and say hello you can't do it
right it sounds silly right and it
almost makes you laugh if it sounds so
silly they almost started laughing at
the voice in your head and therefore
laughter is the answer to all the
negativity in your head it's a simple
solution and I realized as I was making
this video this is something that the
rock does a lot if you watch his videos
he makes fun of himself a lot and it's
he's almost making fun of this inner
critic in his head that is saying those
same things about his self but he makes
a joke out of it and I feel like that is
why he is so confident and why he comes
off as this big macho dude that it's
just warm and friendly it's because he's
laughing at this vote even the voice in
his head and we need to start doing the
same so we can get that rock charisma in
our life as well and just to rock it in
everyday life so next time you hear that
voice in your head switch it around make
it a funny voice you can choose any
voice that you like but make sure it's
funny and it's something that you can
laugh at a clown Mickey Mouse goofy all
those things work so go out there and
accomplish your goals knowing that this
voice in your head is not going to be in
your way think of all the things that
you can do in your life without this
voice being in your head bringing you
down it's just some silly voice in your
head that you're you make sound like you
so you identify and you think it's you
but it's not
so turn that voice into something
finally and kill it with laughter
literally and see what happens in your
life see if things also have to change
for you see if you don't try something
new that you wouldn't have thought
before switch it around if you say oh I
can't lift this weight say it in the
funny voice hello you can't lift this
weight right I said and then you almost
make yourself laugh and then you do the
weight it's that simple alright guys so
thank you guys for watching more videos
to come this week it should be a full
release of blah work out I have a
cooking video coming out as well so

subscribers this past weekend and I also

you'll use in your everyday life so I
