with another commentary and another back
day back to back we added another back
day this week because backs win
championships so therefore we're going
to do back if that makes sense but we
started off we did all different
workouts this time we did start with
some Dumbo rose as you see here about 10
to 12 reps on each side and with these
you want to try to bring your elbow back
into your hip and try to keep the form
fairly tight until May the last couple
reps and that's when you want to kind of
start pulling a little more or jerking
it up a little bit more common mistake
is a lot of people don't flex their back
before pulling up they just pull the
weight and yank it you know and taking a
lot of adding a lot of momentum to it
next the workout that we have here is a
low cable borrow I guess you would call
it we do this one standing up this one's
good for hitting the middle back and the
lower lap and I really felt this one we
haven't done in a while but definitely
gonna put this one back in next up we
have
have a high bar row I guess you would
call it this one hits the rear delts we
kind of we want to do some upper back to
so we did some rear delts and you want
to try to grab the bar as you see all
the way at the hit all the way at the
end of the handles and pull your elbows
up in a straight line almost bringing it
up to your neck / upper chest area and
that's going to work more of your rear
delts than your actual back the middle
of your back okay next up we did a 10
and 10 superset so first as you saw with
my new editing you know I don't know if
you guys caught that but what we did was
we did 10 on using the wide grip and
then 10 doing the Close Grip and this is
just to hit all bases of the of the back
the wider grip will get you more of the
upper portion of your back / middle and
the middle grip will give you more of
the that I have picture that line
running down your back that crease it'll
get you that crease you know we'll keep
it real simple for you guys that crease
in your back if you want that grab that
that that lower grip that's what you
want okay and next up we're moving on to
some rear delts and with these you see
we're not really bringing it all the way
back we're kind of just pumping it out
just get a good pump and finish off the
back day right and just really tie up
the muscle and just end it on a good
note with that being said enjoy the rest
of the video
hey where's cream man I thought you
wanted apps before before the end of the
year they're talking about now she's
talking about cream it's not the way you
get apps ladies and gentlemen so at the
moment we are about to head to Ike's
sandwiches one of my favorite places to
eat it's going to be amazing gonna have
