gonna go hit some back with my girl and
cut out felitti definitely recommending
these headphones if you guys haven't
don't already own them the powerbeats 2
been through a lot of work on headphones
because I mean music is really important
to me I love music and oh just for me it
makes a difference if I don't have good
isolation or good music with me or I
don't know if I can hear people talking
I really don't it just distracts me like
to just go on the gym and up
and you know be in my own world
sometimes people can put that up gonna
make a video pretty soon about what the
what I want to channel to be about and
you know things that I want to
accomplish with the channel and maybe
you do just an all-around informational
video and what I'm about where I've come
from things I believe in and it'll be
pretty interesting feel where i'm coming
from not only no feel where i'm coming
from how about that what's up guys is
BTW and i'm back with another commentary
today we did back and on this day we
started with y lat pulldowns these are
really grateful to start with because it
gives you a good stretch in your lats so
good warm-up exercise instead of going
straight into dumbbells or barbell or
anything like that I liked it either do
these or pull ups now before we go any
further I just want to comment
a lot of people don't pull with their
elbows going into this watching the
video look at all these movements as
pulling with your elbows that's what we
aim to do we didn't pull not pull out
their hands we almost treat our hands
like hooks okay next up we have dumbbell
rows one doing it one armed I like to do
this I like to imagine not pulling
upwards but I like pulling back ended up
so I try to pull my elbow into my hip as
you can see it's going right next to my
hip and that's where you want to be it
gets that'll get your lower lash your
middle back your upper everything
instead of just pulling it up and it'll
be your traps doing the work or maybe
just your upper back these are just all
around a good mass build and with back
you really want to just focus on the
squeeze and I guess I say that every
video but you know especially with back
somewhat a tip that I have is to close
your eyes and pretend like you see your
back you know see your back as you're
working out what you want to look like
you know the striations whatever and
really get that my muscle connection
that way you know the other body parts
are easy you know because you're working
about the mirror looking at yourself you
know you're being egotistical but with
your backing me you can't really see it
while you work out so that's just one
tip that I have for that today was our
cheat day so
the way I set it up was we fasted until
about one o'clock ate some food and then
we went to the gym to kind of utilize
those carbs that we had from earlier in
the day I didn't have anything too crazy
I had eggs and I had to toast wheat
toast
kept it pretty simple and then later on
of course got wouldn't stop because who
doesn't love him stop you haven't tried
it what are you waiting for you haven't
lived yet so I'm prepping for our
vacation we've been kind of doing a carb
cycling me and Alicia we've been doing
three days of low carb so about 50 grams
and then on the next day we're having
about 200 grams carbs if not more as
like a refeed day
you
me
you
you
okay next up we have a move that i'm
bringing back which is the pullover kirk
with the cues in the curl bar after
doing these i'm gonna have to give these
a thumbs up because these really really
hit my lads i could really feel my last
contracting which want to do is you want
to keep a bend in your elbow and kind of
pretend like you're pulling like shirt
over your head cuz if that makes sense
another thing that i stress is if you're
feeling a workout and you say okay going
you say okay I want to do three sets of
this but you're just really feeling it
more so than maybe other workouts that
you're doing go ahead and add one or two
more sets to your workout why not right
it's working I quit a lot of people quit
when something feels good or you know
it's getting its working out the muscles
sometimes some days maybe your body
responds to a certain exercise or
machine and sometimes you just gotta
roll with it be intuitive about your
training be smart about your training I
know this comes with time but at the
same time you know that it's little
things you feel like it's contracting
you fill your muscle really getting
worked out by all means keep it going
yeah you got to keep it real with
yourself and just bang out a couple more
sets keep it 100
you know next up we have the low cable
bar row using two handles now this is a
workout that I've recently added to my
routine and I find that it's very good
towards the end of your set if you just
want to you know really just bang out a
couple more sets and just push yourself
to the limit and again pulling with your
elbows back and I'm kind of pulsating a
little bit so once I come back with my
elbows then you'll see I kind of do like
little I'll let it drop a little bit and
then do it again do a little back pump
that makes sense and here you see my
beautiful girlfriend doing them with
perfect form might I add so ones they
take home from this whole video that I
want you guys to take home is pull with
your elbows and any movement with back
pull with your elbows a lot of people
don't do that and a lot of it gets lost
in the forearms the biceps you know and
one thing is just stress that just try
it pretend like your hands aren't even
there pull with your elbows and see you
don't feel it more in your back
yeah i mean just try it out see how you
like it and if it doesn't make some
you're not already doing it and it makes
a difference let me know in the comments
if it doesn't do for you feel free
to hate down below it's all the same
trying to give me some more Christmas
tree action so we did some back
extensions and you really with these I
like to put an arch of my back to put
more attention on my lower back instead
of my hamstrings and really get that my
muscle connection with your lower back
and just squeezing your lower back at
the top and of course adding a drop set
in here you see I drop the weight and
just rip out a couple more reps ya dig
well I hope you guys enjoyed this
commentary let me know down in the
comments if you know I can do anything
better or you know things that you want
to see or if you have questions about
anything nutrition wise meal wise
workout wise technique-wise at the end
of the day this is for you guys and just
a way for me to give back in a good way
so until the next one who's
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
