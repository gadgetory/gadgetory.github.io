with another video
today we are gonna be announcing the
giveaway winners I also want to give you
guys updates on the channel and a little
bit of backstory on me what I do on a
day-to-day basis why I love headphones
my day job and all that stuff so you
guys can kind of relate and also give
you guys some motivation for yourselves
for this upcoming year so I just want to
give you guys a little back surround me
I went to UCLA in California I got my
degree in molecular cell and
developmental biology yeah it's a
mouthful and right now I work at a
top-ten pharmaceutical company now keep
in mind guys I am putting in about 50
plus hours especially during this
holiday season I've been putting in a
ton of hours at work meanwhile trying to
edit these videos I'm staying up to like
2 to 3 a.m.
trying to get these videos out to you
guys so I hope you guys see the quality
increase and just the amount of effort
that I'm putting into these videos is
not easy you guys see the finished
product but there's been a lot of
setbacks a lot of failures so that kind
of leads into what I want to say to you
guys to motivate you guys for this year
now we see all these quotes all the time
bla bla bla it sounds so great we see it
on Instagram but what are we actually
doing and my advice to you guys is don't
give up always be doing something even
if it's very small even if you think
it's very very small just start on it
and another thing that I want to say is
one thing that really spoke to me in
2017 that I really learned is when you
are in a room let's say or in a building
or let's say you're in a public place
you may see all these people like oh my
god this person is amazing you may talk
to this person they're so great I can
never be like that you see all these
amazing people walking around and you
put these people above yourself you want
to know why it's because you can see all
these other great peoples you can see
everything in the room beautiful people
architecture everything but the one
thing you can't see is your
and that is where we lose ourselves is
that we can't see just how great and how
special each one of us is and our
talents right now I can guarantee that
each one of you guys even if you think
you're great right now you are even
under estimating how great that is and
how other people are seeing you so
really think about that when you feel
self-conscious or insecure about
yourself think about it you can't see
yourself you can't see how cool you are
how cool you walk the great things and
the hard work that you're putting in but
other people see it and they think that
you're great so try to have an
out-of-body experience and kind of
realize that you are great and you have
something to give the world now with
that being said I want to give an update
on the channel moving forward and what
we're gonna be doing now I'm always
gonna be a headphone guy don't worry if
you guys sell to me because I'm a
headphone guy that's me I'm not going
anywhere trust me they're only gonna get
better I have so many plans so many
ideas that I've written out for this
coming year and I take your guys's
feedback seriously I know a lot of
people were getting mad at me for the
sound effects so those are gone guys I'm
just going to keep it simple I'm gonna
give you guys great content and I'm
gonna focus on that now the extra fluff
now moving forward the channel I really
want to broaden my horizons and go into
other aspects I know I dabbled in like
PC stuff Mac stuff editing a little bit
so I really want to come back to that
and do some more computer stuff because
that's one of my passions I love
building computers so I really want to
incorporate that more into my channel
maybe some set up tours some what's in
my bags coming very soon the camera gear
that I use all that stuff is coming very
soon so maybe one of you guys out there
wanna start a channel and I want to kind
of give back and help you guys as well
another thing that I've really thought
about is I want to get into the realm of
cell phones not because it's a cool
thing to do and everybody releases like
millions of videos but I want to
challenge myself and also to I use my
phone a lot actually I have two phones I
have the iPhone 7 plus right now and the
galaxy s7 and I use them a ton because
what I play music I'm gone most of the
day I'm at my job
at the gym so I think that I can kind of
bring the aspect of audio guy to cell
phones I kind of want to bridge the gap
between like audio and cell phones
somehow and incorporate both because
both are important both are used on a
day to day basis for me I don't know a
lot of you guys as well what are we
gonna play our music through we play it
through our phones expect some cell
phone reviews this year bear with me I'm
gonna try to make them as best as
possible also guys always always leave
me recommendations the more
recommendations I see for a certain
headphone or earbud the more likely I am
to review it and get to that you know
that have a list and the more people the
more I see it the more I'm gonna want to
test it out for you guys and put out a
review so with all that stuff out of the
way moving on to the giveaway thank you
guys to everybody who entered there's
gonna be more giveaways soon I wish that
everybody could win keep in mind that
there was like I think a thousand views
there was almost a thousand entries and
I wish that I really kind of sat in me
that I can't give it to everybody but
bear with me guys I'm self-funded right
now but I am working with companies to
try to get you guys more headphones to
people that have just supported me and
had my back because the channel I've
gotten more opportunities because of you
guys so I can't thank you guys enough
like you guys are opening doors for me
and I kind of feel like our success is
tied I'm not just doing this for me I'm
doing it for you guys as well I know
that kind of seems clich√© but that's
how I feel if it wasn't for you guys
watching my videos and asking for
reviews there would be no BT or BT
unplugged so thank you guys very much so
the winners of the headphones let me
grab them okay so the beats X is going
to go to Wesley Mayim I believe yes the
beats X congratulations
and the Sennheiser's are going to Ke$ha
B I think Keisha yeah I would be
reaching out to each one of you guys and
getting your addresses and shipping
these out to you guys there
very soon so if you didn't win I am
probably going to do a birthday giveaway
my birthday is I think in like two weeks
so I think it's in two weeks
so I will be doing a giveaway around
that time as well so stay tuned thank
you guys for watching it's been your boy
BT it's the start of 2018 I'm ready
let's do it guys let's go out there and
crush some of these goals peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
