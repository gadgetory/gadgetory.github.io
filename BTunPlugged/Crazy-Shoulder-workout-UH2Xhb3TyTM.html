commentary chea so uh no I haven't
really posted his shoulder workout so to
get a good shoulder workout for you guys
and usually we like to start off with
dumbbell seated dumbbell press it to hit
all sides of the shoulder and one thing
we tried to do this week was we tried to
not go to failure on every set this is
something I'm going to implement to haul
my workouts is kind of saving those last
few reps so keeping one rep in the tank
for every workout and that way you will
be able to do more weight on our last
set for more reps so therefore creating
more muscle next we moved in to dumbbell
lateral raises and these are probably my
favorite shoulder workout I just love
doing it I love to get in the prompt and
I like doing all the variations like you
see here I'm bringing my the dumbbells
in front of me and then bring them back
up you can also bring them to your side
you can do them see it is so I usually
just try to mix it up every week this
week I just happen to try it this way
and do something different next we move
on to a superset that I created which is
a rear delt fly with your chest on an
incline bench and then what next you'll
see we moved right into front incline
raise keep your arms straight and
bringing them right up front
and this is just a good way while your
rear delts are resting you'll have your
front delts being worked out obviously
okay and then next we have rope face
pools seated and we do this on the lat
machine and what you want to do is want
to keep your elbows flared out and kind
of pretend like you want to bring your
elbows back and together behind your
behind your head and really squeeze hold
it for about two seconds and let it back
up I really enjoy this one and I really
feel like it works better than the
standing for the standing I kind of lose
my balance or other I just don't feel
like it does a good job next we moved on
to the cable lateral raises and for
these you know just nice slow controlled
get about ten reps each side and really
just you know focusing on getting
squeezing the hell out of that muscle
I'm getting that
you know keeping proper form all right
next we moved into a new one that we've
been doing the last two weeks which is a
rear delt fly cable on a yoga ball and
I've been loving this one I've been
trying to bring in my root delta more up
and kind of you know my route dos got
good and I kind of slacked off and all
happening to be i'll put take our foot
off the pedal when we get to a certain
level and i'm just trying to get him
back to what they were before so just
doing my best and next this is a great
way to just burn out your shoulders at
the end of the workout which is an
upright row what we do is we get a
crowbar we do 10 in the middle and then
we do 10 wide making sure to bring up
with your elbows and not bring it with
your hands you know I see a lot of
people doing that and there's something
going to keep away from
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
