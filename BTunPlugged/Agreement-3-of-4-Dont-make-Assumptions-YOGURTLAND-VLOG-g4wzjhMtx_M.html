on lunch fair to say it like i do these
videos at lunch which is why i'm in my
car just to get some privacy and i don't
know if it's okay for me to film around
the building or around the eating area
so i don't make people feel comfortable
so that's why i fill in my car as always
i got chicken avocado today but there's
a twist today it's high carb day so i
did two days of low carb day and now i'm
gonna do have this but the twist is i'm
going to yogurtland so next we're
doing the agreement so today is day
three day three oh yeah and i forgot to
say i had a little bit of trouble like
uploading the last video so these videos
may be a little off but yeah I ran into
some issues whatever I got it up for you
guys it's up now so this is day three
and the rule number agreement number
three that he has is never make
assumptions don't make assumptions this
is a third of the fourth agreement and
what do what that means is we make a lot
of assumptions because to fill in the
void of not knowing sometimes instead of
not knowing we find comfort in knowing
even if that's thing is false or totally
fake so we may say oh this person hates
me but do you really know that they hate
you or this person thinks this about me
they don't like my shirt they don't like
my pants whatever you're just making an
assumption right so without actually say
hey do you like my shirt do you like my
pants do you know for sure for certain
the truth knowing the truth is better
than making up a false lie and it hurt
to you right you suffer from it you
because segregated from people you
simply
self because you assume that maybe
nobody likes you that people don't enjoy
your company you know things like that
and you know we all do that we all would
rather make assumptions and find comfort
and safety in that say okay we know this
person to like me okay it doesn't like
me I can just avoid them or whatever
instead of trying to see hey does this
person like me find out spend time with
them do we get along with each other
like that coming from that mindset it's
more based in reality and it will make a
difference in your life you know it'll
bring it closer to people it will bring
you more opportunities do you know that
you're going to fill your goal or you
just assume me oh I can never do that I
can never do this right you assume
because in the okay I know that can't do
that okay what's next for me what's SN
well let me find out let me be here now
and let me find out let me do these
things let me research let me do this
and that and see can i really do it now
which one do you think is going to take
you further which one's going to give
you the relationships that you want in
life the the ladder you know think not
making assumptions in finding out being
here being present and finding out
what's really real that's how you become
better so that is that for today you
already know i'm going to do with my
eating as always i got my hydro flask
BCA is in it yeah and I'm looking pretty
good right now I'm not gonna lie i might
do a little body update later also to
hitting legs tonight you know i think
i'm gonna make the appt video of the app
i do usually two or three AB movements
every day after i work out so i will
show you guys that as well yeah i think
that's gonna be the video for now so i
will actually you know i'm gonna tell
you guys a yogurtland okay i'm gonna
show you guys what I get alright see you

else a new york cheesecake since they
didn't have my favorite toasted coconut
I got some sup sour patch kids some
mochi lots of sprinkles and strawberries
