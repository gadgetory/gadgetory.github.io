with another review today we are going
to be taking a look at one of my
favorite brands now one of you guys the
subscribers asked for this review i
didn't even know that these were out
until the subscriber asked me to review
them and me loving this company I went
straight on amazon and i bought them and
those are the q 16s by sound Pete's now
sound Pete's makes a lot of budget
earphones budget-friendly wireless
earphones and they're made for spores
working out now can this quality hold up
to something like the airpot something
that's completely wireless so in the
review i'm going to tell you guys how
these bad boys hold up in the real world
let's get into this review so we're
going to start off with the comfort and
design on these now these are very very
light there they remind me a lot of
beats but without the cord if you guys
out there have tried the power beats and
you like them you're going to like these
there a little bit more heavier because
they have to add in the battery and they
have to add in the receivers and all
that but for the most part they are very
very comfortable when in I forget that
they're even there when I have them in I
walked outside my house and I was like
wait I had these on my music started to
cut off it was crazy I love them they
have a split charging cable so that you
can charge both of these headphones on
the underside of the headphones they
both need to be charged you can't just
charge one and have the other one not
charged so i found that a very very nice
touch because i got the the package and
I was like wait how are we supposed to
are we just supposed to charge one and
then we have to wait while this one
charges and then we have to go and
charge this one on another cable it just
gets kind of messy I'm glad to see that
they included that kind of cable into
the package oww for the design of these
headphones they both have the back
forward the volume controls on the top
of both sides of headphones so if you're
a lefty or righty it kind of works out
for you right I kind of like how each
one is kind of stand alone and you can
kind of hit on this side or hit on this
side whichever you prefer now that we
got the comfort out of the way
let's get into the sound the sound on
these is great guys I was pleasantly
surprised other people that I shared
them with shared my same skepticism $44
completely wireless headphones how much
how far can they go with these how much
sound can actually put in these how much
quality but they hold up very nice I
would compare them to the old jaber the
old jaybird ex ones without the sound
app they sound very very similar if not
a little bit better because of the added
bass these create a lot of bass it does
sound a little weak on the mid-tones the
vocals but it wasn't anything too I did
feel like it was kind of flat in the
mid-tones and in the highs and the base
is very very nice so good on the low end
okay in the mid-range and so so on the
high end I did notice a little bit of
distortion while playing some music so
keep that in mind but overall I liked it
great value for forty four dollars I
must say now let's talk about the
Bluetooth connectivity this is where it
all falls apart for this headphone now
these feature some of the newest
Bluetooth they say right so we expect it
to not have any hiccups we expect to
walk next to that person with some power
beats and just not have anything break
our connection and wrong wrong wrong
wrong now this is crazy as soon as I
walked towards the gym it was all great
I had them on in my car I was getting
pumped up with some music about to go
into the gym I walk up about couple feet
about six feet from the door these
headphones on one side start to give out
and here's my theory on why that happens
my theory is is that when you connect
these to your phone you have to first
hit this button it connects to your
phone you pair it with this button like
all other wireless headphones next you
have to pair the left side now the left
side is then going to pair to the right
side and then the right side relays the
music from your phone to your right side
and then to your left side so what I
noticed is my rights
we'll stay so so strong my left side
will go in doubt it would get very low
and then very high very low the volume
would go up and down up and down losing
connectivity and I feel like it's due to
the design feel like they put a weaker
receiver into the left ear bud so the
phone to your right receiver is very
strong so left to the right is very weak
so when people with the beats come
around you you're screwed because that
connection between the left and right is
gone so it's just going to create all
kind of interference and that's where
these headphones follow up I had such
high hopes I was like man I'm going to
give a rave review about these
headphones I love the sound the comfort
is grade they're very lightweight watch
see so that's where these headphones
really fall apart so I can't recommend
them for going outside period they just
don't work as soon as you come close to
anybody using Bluetooth connection even
a building I was just it was just crazy
crazy distortion crazy drops in signal
so the final verdict on news is I can't
recommend them they're great for home
listening but for that $44 price tag it
has to have some kind of short coming
and I feel like that is the short coming
for these headphones you can only use
them for home listening at the moment
which kind of sucks but what can you
expect for forty four dollars but sound
Pete's if you're watching this please
you guys have to figure out how to put a
better receiver into the left one so
that these two can interact better which
will give a better connection to your
phone and less drops and then you will
have a potential heir pod killer in the
form of sound peed q six teams alright
so thank you guys for watching if you
guys have any questions as always leave
comments down below if you enjoyed the
video like share comment and subscribe
and also if you have a headphone that
you want to seem your review let me know
also down below so that's been my time
spend your boy BTW
I will see you guys in the next video
