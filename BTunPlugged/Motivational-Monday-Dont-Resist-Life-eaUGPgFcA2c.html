with another motivational Monday today
we're going to be talking about
resistance have you ever had an
embarrassing moment happen and you play
it back in your mind over and over again
you're just thinking to yourself man i
wish it happened this way or this
shouldn't happened or I should have
never been it even at this event or this
party whatever and you start thinking
about what if it's all resistance to
what actually is you've already been
embarrassed you've already been
humiliated you've already been sad mad
happy whatever whatever the the
situation was it happened and we try to
ruminate in our mind and go over it over
and over again to try to change
something we want to change the
situation or look at it a different way
but what I'm gonna suggest to you guys
is is to realize that this is what
happened nothing can ever change that
and then from there you say what can I
do now that's the question I want you to
ask yourself now that this has happened
what can I do now and you'll find that
you'll be able to improve on the current
situation let's say you made a friend
mad you're like all right this person's
mad now what can I do now maybe I can
bring them their favorite junk food or
bring them some ice cream and get back
into their graces or I can sit here and
think man that shouldn't happen I was
such an idiot why did I think like that
and it solves nothing you get anxious
about the situation making it even worse
so when you deal with this person you're
going to be timid you're now going to
want to interact with them but you have
to realize that this is what is and
dealing with what actually is the
situation reality then you can change
your situation and that goes with
anything whatever situation you're in
right now guys accept it completely and
then start thinking about what
you do to improve don't say I wish I
could go back and do something
differently no it's already done the
past is gone it's all about right now
right now is where you can make a
difference so take this this week you
