with another commentary today i'm
bringing you guys a back workout now i
wanted to share something that i found
this week that really works for me is
right now i'm doing a low-carb diet and
many of you that know when you're
getting down to about 50 grams of carbs
you start feeling it in the gym you
don't have as much energy you want to
give up very very fast and what I was
doing was I was going into the gym
trying to keep my same routine but still
trying to lift as heavy as possible you
know and it got me in a lot of trouble
because throughout the first one first
couple of exercises I would burn myself
out and I would be done I'd want to go
home so what I did was I came up with
this rep range of 20 18 15 12 10 and
this gave me a huge pump this fix my
problem in the gym of not getting a pump
especially when you're low carb you
don't get those as big a pump as you
would when you're full of carbs and your
muscles are really full looking and
banging all that so I'm just going to
give you guys a general explanation of
what i try to do when I do back I try to
keep my elbows as tight as possible and
I try to squeeze as hard as possible
sometimes during some of these workouts
since you can't see your back you want
to close your eyes and just pull and
imagine what your back looks like
imagine it shredded imagine it looking
like Arnold Schwarzenegger's back just
keep squeezing as hard as you can and
that's one thing where a lot of people
you know they don't put their mind into
the muscle and it shows so this is one
way to do it another thing is you want
to protect your lower back so I always
try to have an arch in my lower back at
least slightly just to give up my back
some stability so when I lived it go and
I can squeeze in all the right places
no I'm saying but that those are my tips
for today let me know if you guys use
these yourself or if you guys want to
know any more information about what I'm
doing diet-wise I think I'm going to
make the full eating a full day of
eating video very very soon I'm doing my
last cut of the year for Halloween so
thank you guys for watching and I will
see you guys in the next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
