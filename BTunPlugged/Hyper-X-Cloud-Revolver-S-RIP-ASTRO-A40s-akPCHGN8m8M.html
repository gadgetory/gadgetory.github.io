well
what is up guys is BT back here again
with another review today I'm going to
be reviewing an awesome pair of gaming
headphones by HyperX called the revolver
S's
now in the past I've owned their cloud
tools which are really good but they
weren't great the surround sound and
those sounded very artificial I should
say superficial artificial and that
happened when the sound card was
activated which was pretty disappointing
I mean they came in at about a hundred
dollars
you know we expect a little bit more and
what I set out to do is is to find out
have the revolver s's fixed hyper clouds
problem so I was excited to see that
their revolver SS came out at a retail
price of 150 for the PC and ps4 with
what seemed to be better comfort and
better sound I mean it better be for $50
more right so let's see how they perform
today
so let's start off with the comfort and
design now the first thing you may
notice and that you will notice when you
pick these up is how light they are and
I love the black and the silver the
gutta metal look of these it just makes
it very modern it'll give a very modern
touch to your setup to your gaming setup
the headband is really nice I like the
design where the top cushion once you
put your head into it it will fit snugly
to your head so you're not going to have
all that that plastic and all that or
even leather sometimes just sliding back
or whatever during an intense game when
you're like moving your head around
trying to look all over the screen right
I also like that they braided the cord
it's a very nice touch
obviously we've all been there where we
will set our headsets
down the next day somehow I don't know
what kind of wizardry this is but our
our headphone courts are always tangled
the rubber makes it so hard to to unwrap
so that kind of fixes that problem now
with the memory cup foam they are very
very comfortable but but they do give a
little bit of Jaffa Teague which is when
you put them on the back the lower side
of these headphones will actually be
pressed pressing down and clamping onto
your head so it'll give there's some
pressure there so if you don't really
like that these aren't going to be for
you now they also have a detachable mic
which I really like you know you can put
in your own mic or whatever else you
would like to do I do wish that they
would have had another mic jack on the
other side on the right Cup so you know
some people like to have it on the right
or some people like to have it on the
left so it would have been nice just to
have that choice but all in all the
comfort and design is great good at I
should say not great
there's a lot of great things about
these but I think the pressure near the
jaw kind of it makes me take them off
after a certain amount of hours of
playing games so next up let's talk
about the sound now if you're coming
from the HyperX cloud too and wondering
if you should upgrade to words do it the
sound upgrade alone is worth it
explosions and games and movies and TV
shows are just so satisfying with Adobe
Digital active even when I'm watching
twitch streams it'll give me that same
3d stage so I can watch my favorite
streamers on overwatch and and still get
that experience like I'm there with them
playing at the end of the day these are
made for gaming you can hear enemy
footsteps creeping up behind you but
little do they know you have the
revolver s's so you can just turn around
and burn them as they say surprisingly
though these actually sound pretty good
for music there's a lot of separation
with the 7.1 surround sound card by
myself reaching less and less for
my audio file great headphones my
thousand dollar headphones my $400
headphones these will satisfy me if I
just want to listen to a quick tune or
two you know here and there I don't have
to go and switch off just to get good
sound the bass is really good with these
and the sound state is also great
they've managed to kind of balance a
open stage and a closed back headphone
all in one gaming headphone which is
really nice now the sound card on the
HyperX cloud twos they just were how
should I say it it wasn't that great it
sounded very artificial but with these
they've kind of fixed that problem I
think they've kind of figured out a good
sound card that they can put into the
remote to actually give good sound and
when you have that isolation you're
going to be in your own little world
these isolate like crazy you cannot hear
people coming up from behind you in real
life and that's kind of scary but at
least you know you will be deeply
immersed into your games at least for me
I haven't really tried that many gaming
headphones if you guys have tried any
that you think will beat these or if
you've tried these and you know of some
that are better let me know down in the
comments below but as for right now I do
believe that these sound better than the
astro a40 s with the mix app even so
next up I'll let you guys be the judge
of the mic test so here it is testing
testing 1 2 3 there's gonna be right
behind you how do I sound guys
we're flying tinnie let me know okay so
what did you guys think was it clear I
think it sounded pretty clear I thought
it sounded pretty good I haven't had any
complaints from my friends playing
overwatch or anything like that or my
teammates saying I'm too low because I
read about them being really low on
Amazon that just hasn't been my
experience
so in conclusion these are my favorite
gaming headphones and I'm glad that I
picked them up I'm kind of glad that my
a forties diet it's kind of a blessing
in disguise I can wholeheartedly
recommend these to you guys the surround
sound is great the comfort is good but
not great the mic is clear and what more
could you ask for what are you waiting
for go out and buy these right now
they're a steal alright guys so thank
you guys for watching thank you guys for
tuning in and I will see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
