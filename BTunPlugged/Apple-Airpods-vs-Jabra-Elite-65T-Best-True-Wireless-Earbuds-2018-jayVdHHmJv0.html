another battle today we're gonna be
looking at the Jabra 65 T's vs. the air
pods
two of my favourite true wireless
earbuds so I thought I'd do a comparison
sized battle on them just comparing what
I found so far to be true with both of
these earbuds but before I began to
forget to hit that subscribe button for
more content like this it helps me
create more for you guys put out more
reviews more quality content all that
good stuff so yeah consider subbing okay
so first off let's talk about the
comfort of these now these are
completely different the Jabra is they
go into your ear more like an earbud
style whereas the air pod sit on the
outside of your ear now a lot of people
have had fit issues with the air pots I
for one they work really well for me but
I know they can be hit or miss for some
people because they have to sit in the
crevice of your ear if you don't have
that you're out of luck or ask the Jabra
is I think they will fit more people
because they kind of twist and go into
your ear they have different ear tips so
there's more flexibility there the air
pots are a lot lighter though and their
have like a smaller footprint overall so
most of the time I forget the air pots
are even in where as a job rose I know
that they're in and sometimes I have to
readjust them once in a while now
speaking of ear tips
I wish the jobbers would have added in
some foam tips that would have put them
over the top I'm still trying to find
some that will actually fit these
hopefully I can find them soon come ply
if you know of any hit me up but the air
pods
don't have any ear tips they just sit on
the outside of your ear and they let in
a lot of noise so if you're taking these
to the gym or in a crowded area
commuting it can be a problem but the
jumpers aren't that much better at
blocking out noise I found even with
trying all different types of ear tip
sizes they still let in surprisingly a
lot of noise so I would say they're
almost equal in that regard so for the
comfort round I think I have to give it
to the javis just because I think they
will fit more people of course for me at
the airport if they fit there
fit really really well and I haven't had
any problems with them so let's talk
about the cases now that is a very
important factor in any true wireless
earbuds they have to be carry Abul they
have to be pocketable they also have to
give you enough charge for you to get
through your day and obviously the air
pot is smaller but I give the jobbers a
lot of credit they have a bigger
footprint as an earbud overall but the
case is really really small it's
actually one of the nicest cases that I
found for a true Wireless sports air but
so either way I think you'll be able to
carry either one of these earbuds where
the air pods really just shine is the
battery life they charge really really
fast they last for 25 hours total with
the extra charges on the battery case
whereas the Jabra is only giving you
another two charges which is equals to
about 15 hours big difference there it
depends on your use if you're gonna be
out for long periods of time you're
using your earbuds all the time then the
air pause might be better for you case
and battery life go to the air pots okay
so how do they sound now the air pots
you know people think that oh these are
just gonna be the normal Apple earbuds
you know that come with the phone or
iPods or iPads and things like that but
no these have an upgraded sound
signature and I really like them they
have a good bass line that really just
attends to most music genres and most
music listeners but where the job is
really really shine is that they are
able to have an EQ where you can change
the EQ and change your sound profiles to
how you like it
so there's more flexibility there and
there's more of a chance that you're
gonna like the job rows and the sound
that they provide and I found that
overall I just really prefer the Jabra
sound compared to the air pods when
using the EQ just can't beat it so for
the call quality nothing tops the air
pause for me and these are the most
solid Bluetooth earbuds for call quality
that I have found whether using an Apple
device or an Android device these are
amazing crystal-clear sound all around
no breakups anything like that
the Jabra is on the other hand
they sound good they sound really good
don't get me wrong but I'm comparing
them to the air pass there's definitely
a big difference there and you can
definitely tell if you were to go back
to back and talk to somebody they tell
immediately oh the air pots are better
so if you're gonna be making a lot of
calls if that's important to you go with
the air pots now another thing that the
droppers do is they have a volume rocker
and they also have a press play pause
button on each earbud and that is
something where you can bind different
commands to your ear pods on each side
but it's kind of limited I wish they
would have had like some kind of touch
control we can swipe up and down but
they don't have it so for controls I
have to give it to the jaw press there's
just more flexibility there it's easier
you don't have to tinker with settings
or go into your phone settings and
decide what you want to give up they've
already given you it right there right
out of the box easy boom BAM done so
yeah if you're using the Apple ecosystem
you know the Siri integration is really
good so if you're using Android or any
other type of device I would go with the
Jabra if you want the voice command if
it's not that important to you the Apple
earpods will suffice so here we are at
the end of the battle there can only be
one winner of course as always and for
me it's still the air pods nothing can
beat them I mean there's no delay when
it comes to YouTube or Bluetooth or
anything like that with a jobbers but
the air pass is just something special
about these things the small footprint
the battery life how easy they are to
commute the sound is good enough without
having to use an EQ if you really want
the best of the best sound quality go
with the job risk but if you're okay
with just good sound quality good call
quality great battery life and a small
form factor that just works Android or
iPhone whatever you use the air pots are
amazing alright guys so that is gonna do
it for this battle don't forget to hit
that sub button if you enjoyed it like
the video comment I'm always down there
saying hi if you just want to say hi or
just talk or recommend me some
headphones you know I'm always down for
