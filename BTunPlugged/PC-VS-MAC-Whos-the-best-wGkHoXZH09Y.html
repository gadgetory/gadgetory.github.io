with another review today i'm going to
look at the most controversial topics
that I've ever done on this channel and
it might be in the world and that debate
is the pc vs mac debate now before we
get into it i want to give a little bit
of a background on how I got to this
point and a little bit of my background
with both os's now when i was 16 i built
my first pc you look great i play
counter-strike all that good stuff and
then naturally i wanted to go to college
and so I needed the laptop so naturally
I will with Adele a pc right a year into
having this del it died on me one night
I had a paper due and it died on me so
whether that was from updates or
whatever happened it just did not work
for me so I've been a huge pc person I
was a huge people person until all of
that happen and then I had switch it up
because at that time i believe those
windows home that i was using the one
after windows vista just did not work
for me and that ended up having to go
and buy a mac i never got with a high
flow
Mac I never got why people would want to
give up gaining or having all this the
best hardware for the bang for the plug
and I finally got a macbook in 2011 18
macbook pro at 2011 and actually still
happy till this day and it still works
perfectly but we'll get into that later
so this computer changed my life this
laptop change my life I used it all the
way through college the rest of my
college years and I also used it up
until this last 2015 into the year
November when I decided to finally build
another pc for video editing but up
until then it was great and it just
didn't have enough power to get my video
editing done properly so i upgraded to a
pc because you know what Apple wasn't
coming out with any new macbook pro so I
got kind of fed up with them and I said
you know I'm just going to build a pc
because right now I need to be making
content and this was getting in the way
of getting talked it out to you guys so
I built a pc with windows 10 a despite
reading that Oh windows you know is
terrible this it crashes on you this and
that all the windows stigmas that are
still out there and I you know I just
said you know what I'm gonna check it
out for myself and you know what I found
I actually found it Windows 10 is a
great operating system it gets Islands
away unlike old windows systems that
we're cutting your way and you have to
go through all these extra steps just to
use programs and to install things and
Windows 10 is i would say on par with
mac OS in terms of stability and in
terms of just use abilities so if you
read out there that Windows 10 is this
and that those check out for yourself
and see what you think about it what
your own personal opinion of the
awkwardness is because a lot has changed
from that old windows home that just
cracked all the time the blue screens is
dead
we all remember those so things have
changed its 2017 and this is a good
system I really had a good time using
this Windows 10 now that we got that out
of the way I kind of want to go over
some of the pros and cons and some of
the things that I read and the research
that I've done on these products i'm not
going to bore you guys with all the tech
specs and all that but i just want to
give you my opinion in my experience
because you know i just grabbed a new
2016 macbook yeah the one was no SD card
and the one with four USB seaports yeah
I got that one because you know I had to
see for myself so the base model macbook
pro 15-inch that I got runs for about
twenty four hundred dollars plus tax
that's insane for the specimens I'll a
processor in it it doesn't have a 4k
screen it doesn't have a 4k touchscreen
like some of the dells and the razor
blades and all those things that I was
looking at you know you can get for that
same price I built my pc and i got a
third floor in spell widescreen 2k
screen which has been amazing for me and
you say well this laptop how does that
equal with old outdated hardware
compared to a B C's pc with all the
fixings and i will leave the steps for
both of my computers down below in case
you guys are wondering so why is that
why why do we pay this premium price the
apple prize of twenty four hundred
dollars when we can go out and get a
similar priced product from a windows
manufacturer and it'll just have the
specs that are just out of the world has
a gtx 1080 1050 1060 in it why why do we
go with something with the radeon 450 in
it and in telegraphic and that is
something that I feel like most tech
reviewers haven't really touched upon
which Islam against video
and that is the x factor now I've had my
2011 Mac Pro's up until 2016 2017 right
that is five to six years and I pay 1300
hours for that computer now you're
telling me over that time span I had a
dell remember that I had to do and it
died within the first year and I spent
probably 1,500 so there was a big
discrepancy one year for 1500 or 1300
for six years and plus if it still runs
great it just cannot run the video
programs like final cut and rip pro like
I needed to so that's why it was great
for on-the-go edited but for just
general web browsing it still works
great and I'm actually gifting it to my
parents so I think that Apple has the x
factor because hear me out they have to
optimize OS for the systems that means
your macbook or your imap it is going to
be taken care for the next five to six
years they're making that OS so that it
works is tested with every single
generation to make sure that it works
properly that is the x factor that Apple
Springs and therefore the longevity
jadon is spending more front but over
time with a buy windows laptop that has
the top set people put 32 gigs of ram in
it whereas the macbook Irwin has 16 gigs
all these different things right with
the beefier cpu and be for your cpu but
is windows really making windows for
that exact laptop or are they making a
general oh and get something out there
and then update at the code and then
leaving the manufacturers to kind of
figure out okay what's wrong how can we
make our hardware worthless their
software and vice versa so it's a
struggle it's really a struggle which
kind of sucks and I know there's the
surface book
self exams with those are extremely
overpriced ages I mean they're a great
machine a single but I think for the
performance like Dell and all those are
still going to be a little bit better so
that's something to keep in mind which
brings me to my next point pc desktops
are better than I max let me tell you
why because you can update a graphics
card you can update your CPU can update
your motherboard your RAM get back to
ram as time goes on to your you can
constantly just put in you know a couple
hundred here on it all here and have a
beefier system over time whereas you
don't have to buy two thousand dollars
and then buy another three thousand
dollars and then another three thousand
another 3,000 effort so many years you
can kind of just adjusted customized it
how you want and like I said Windows 10
is just as stable as mac OS in my
opinion one thing that I think people
wise people think that the macbook is a
little bit Stabler than the windows 10
and PCs is that when a PC crashes it's a
crashing the whole system crashed like
application will crack so game will
crash right sometimes you'll be able to
stay the windows sometimes even up
whereas mac OS it will always stay
within macro lens you're not going to
get a random restarting you're not going
to get all this extra stuff it's just
going to spin the beach ball and then
figure it out and then keep you in Mac
OS so there's little things like that
that make it seem more stable but I will
tell you my mac has crashed as much as
my windows
so am I just want to end this often
talking about my experience with the new
macbook pro I just got it last week and
I've been editing guided into my last
quake torturing videos on my macbook and
it's been a pleasure to use the touch
bar even though doesn't have a touch
screen the touch bar has been far has
gone past my expectations for the usage
of it i thought i would never touch it
but i actually touch it more often than
i thought i know that some sexually
don't go there i'll actually touch the
touch bar way more than I thought I
would especially for final cut is easy
to get to the sound training clips
things like that and also in my web
browser you can type in the youtube com
into your search tomorrow or you can
just touch the YouTube icon on your
touch bar little things like that it
just saves a little bit of time here and
there it's just a cool thing to see and
have a pop-up it's very eye-catching
sometimes I thought I would never look
down on my keyboard but I find myself in
oh man this is actually kind of useful
and you don't really know this and you
think of the inner kids who you actually
get it because I saw a lot of reviews
but I apple fanboy you know I mean
everybody just loved the Apple Apple
Apple but actually use it and there's
actually some functionality was behind
this touch bar so don't knock it until
you guys try it out so in conclusion I
just want to say that Mac is great Apple
is great windows is great Bella's grade
brazzers great all these different
companies are great they make great
products the x factor and why i think
getting a mac laptop and why i got a Mac
laptop over windows laptop is for that x
factor that longevity and then that
matters that matters about how longer
product is going to
sure your money is going to go longer
you don't have to worry about it i know
with this maximum i'm not gonna have to
worry has a USB sees which you know i
have a dongle that fixes the problem
that they're having no USB it has USB
HDMI SD card reader all those things so
that really just one stop shop for my
macbook pro and i'll leave that down in
the comments below as well i'll link you
guys for that but when it comes to
desktops i will always be pc and biased
because just for the good just for the
customization just for the customization
and what you can get and just upgrading
as you go you can make it last longer
and always have to stay fast or as a
macbook it's a one-stop shop and it's
just going to be there it's going to be
the same specs / 56 year so if it goes
down halfway through so you're kind of
stuff where it's a pc if it stops if it
gets a little slow you can say okay time
for me speak to you boom looks like you
have a brand-new computer so laptop
macbook desktop pc that's what it is
that's this that's that's what it comes
down to and that's why I have both
operating systems and you get the best
of both worlds so guys both are great
both have their own little space and
what they do better and now one thing
that TC does that macbook cannot do that
well is gaming so if you're a gamer of
course you got to go with the pc that's
just how it goes but if you're just kind
of productivity what Brock and all that
the macbook would be just fine or widows
of Jesus fine just a fitting on its on
if your mobile or phenomenal really up
to you macta something's better windows
that some things better but at the end
of the day it's they're both great
systems so choose which one you want
that's just my recommendation for you
guys to Satan you guys some money and
have your money go longer
in the long run so thank you guys for
