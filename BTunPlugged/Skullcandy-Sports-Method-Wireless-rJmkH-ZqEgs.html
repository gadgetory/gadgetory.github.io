I'm doing a review on the skull crusher
method Wireless board headphones now I'm
sure we've all had those ten to fifteen
dollar school crusher headphones that
would just blow our brains out with bass
so I figured hey why not check out their
newest wireless headphones so that's
what I did so I picked them up to get
that skull crusher nostalgic feeling
once again the curves - wireless
headphones I'm always skeptical about
headphones with neck bands for the neck
band to be worth it everything else has
to fall in line so that is what this
headphone review is going to be about so
first up you know we love to start with
the comfort and the design now of course
I just talked about they have this neck
band it's very light it has the controls
on the side it has the up volume it has
a down volume and it has a press play
and pause button and it works very well
it's actually very light and I didn't
tell forget it was there sometimes it's
a little tight but it's it's nice it
stays in this place
more so than even the QC 30s but one
thing that I do have my doubts about is
the court of the actual headphones the
course of the headphones feel like those
old 10 to $15 skull Crusher's headphones
it just that they added this the price
of the wireless and making them $80 now
so I'm a little worried about that but
at least you don't have the wire coming
from your ears to your device where can
get ripped out or pulls on and get
shorts in it because one thing with
school Christians back of the dance that
they would give out so you mean they
cost ten to fifteen dollars but you have
to buy like ten of them at least I did
so I think having and going Wireless for
them it's a lot better and the court
won't be in as much danger as it is like
running to your pocket or your hand now
they also feature this locking silicon
tip has a small tip where it goes into
your ear and then again
dramatically bigger as you go out so to
create a locking effect in your ear and
I can say it does really keep these in
your ear but it does irritate my ear I
mean people call me after having
sensitive ears call it what you may
but these irritated me after a while I'm
moving around a lot jumping walking
around my workplace they irritated my
ears and I kept having to burn my ears
so that's one thing to look out for with
let's talk about the sound now these
have that classic skull Crusher's sound
that base that just overpowers
everything else but with that bass comes
a lack of clarity the mids
the highs really stuff on these
headphones and they get muddied so if
you're looking for and enjoy clarity in
your music these are not the ones for
you these are strictly for bass and just
to really give you that something feel
in your ear but is me wanting a little
bit more especially for $80 when you can
just save 20 more dollars and get the
j-bird X to Z Z or for the same price or
going up to the j-bird X threes and
having a better experience with sound in
my opinion but hey it's Skullcandy so we
know what we're getting ourselves into
when we buy these now that we got the
sound out of the way let's talk about
battery life now these support nine
hours and they are great they live up to
the hype I never had these down me once
they last me the whole day at work I was
able to charge them and they just kept
going I never happy down me like even
the David x3 is down sometimes so that
was very nice the battery reader on your
phone is very accurate so kudos to
school crasher they did that really well
so last up let's talk about the call
quality now it's very good although if
the mic gets underneath your shirt if
you're wearing them you tuck them in
you're going to be muffled so that's one
issue that I ran into I had to
constantly be aware of where the neck
band was positioned but that can happen
with any pair of neck band headphones
and that's kind of one of my graphs with
neck man
that is not on the actual cord where it
can be closer to your mouth and out of
the way of interference of maybe your
clothes in this case
so in conclusion can I recommend these I
would say your money is better spent on
maybe even the j-bird ex twos or maybe
some powerbeats2 is going down a step or
saving up a little bit more and just
going with the G vertex threes or the
power B's threes or the Boathouse for
wireless whichever you prefer it's
sometimes worth it just to put in that
extra $20 $30 to get that nice repair so
you don't have to buy these headphones
twice and I kind of have some build
issues with these especially for the
price so I can't really recommend them
to you guys but that being said if you
really love the sound signature of
school candy headphones there and these
are going to be for you it's just a
wireless version to sound exactly like
the 10 to $15 pairs of headphones that
they sell you're going to get base all
that in this package so yeah that is my
software these headphones okay set of
headphones they're better out there for
the price so thank you guys for watching
