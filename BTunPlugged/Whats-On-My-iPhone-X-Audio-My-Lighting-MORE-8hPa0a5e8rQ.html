with my iPhone setup for audiophiles so
a lot of you guys have asked me what I
use what kind of streaming sites
what kind of eq's do I use so this video
is gonna address all that and then I'm
also gonna give you guys some extra apps
that I use to run the channel because I
always get a lot of questions about my
lighting setup and I'll do a whole video
on that later on but for now I'm just
going to show you guys the app and how I
use it and things like that so starting
off of course we have the social medias
on here we have the Instagram to Twitter
to talk to you guys follow me if you
aren't already we also have the YouTube
we have YouTube studio which shows me
what you guys like it gives me
information and it also lets me just
comment back to you guys very easily now
I don't listen to much music on YouTube
because the compression rates and stuff
like that are pretty bad for listening
but I do listen to some live streams
from like yes a suicide sheep and
usually they have like a stream or they
have a lot of different songs that
aren't on Spotify or things like that so
it's a nice place to just go and listen
to a lot of music and you know I'm all
about finding new music and that is
gonna be one of the themes that you guys
are gonna see throughout today's video
so in the next row we have a lot of
musical streaming sites now I don't
download my music anymore I used to do
that a lot especially back in the day my
computers would be just full of music
and I would be running out of space or
all my phones it would be running out of
space or I would forget to update my
phone with the new songs and so I like
having a way to always have my songs
with me streaming I don't know the songs
keep in mind you're paying a monthly fee
but some songs after a while you stop
listening to them anyways right and then
you bought them so I feel like it all
evens out in my opinion so right now I
am subscribed to all three of the top
streaming music sites that's Apple music
Spotify and title and right now I'm
doing a lot of testing on which one is
better so I'm subscribed to all three at
some point I will be cancelling probably
two
them so for now I have all three but in
the future that's gonna change so we'll
give you guys a little bit of insight on
what I'm actually using so what I like
about Apple music is their beats radio
station this thing is amazing they have
a ton of different people come on there
and just create all these mixes and I
really really enjoy that so it's an easy
way if you don't feel like searching for
songs or you're at the gym or you're
somewhere where you just need to throw
something on for background music and
things like that now they also have
these playlists which got better over
time I used to not like them and that's
one reason why I unsub from Apple music
before is because I felt like their
playlists weren't as good as Spotify but
they fixed a lot of the issues that they
had and they've come up with a lot of
good ones that are pretty nice
I do wish they had a feature where I can
make a playlist and then you guys can go
and go to my playlist and listen to what
I've put together you can't do that on
Spotify you can do that and I really
enjoy that feature of Spotify so now
we're coming to SoundCloud I use this
app mostly for sets and for indie
artists artists that are coming up that
aren't as well known I just have a bunch
of as you can see here unknown people
here you guys can check it out and maybe
check out some of these artists but
mostly I use this app for EDM and things
like that another app that I use for
sets for live sets DJ sets for him like
gesto Afrojack people like that is
Mixcloud
the thing that I don't like about mixed
cloud is that it takes forever to load
and you can't skip forward and back so
if there's a fire song out of nowhere
you won't be able to go back in the song
like just you will run into problems and
it's not a good feeling
next up we have Spotify which is
probably my favorite app for music not
the best sounding so they use an old
compression mp3 which is not the best
for quality they are looking to upgrade
it in the future to hi-5 but for now
it's probably one of the worst sounding
streaming apps that you can use compared
to Apple music and title it just does
not compare so one thing that I really
enjoy is that I'm able to make a
playlist I have a bt unplugged playlist
which I'm gonna link down below if you
guys want to check it out I just put a
bunch of music on here that I like and
if you guys want to go and check it out
you can check it out and I really enjoy
that feature it's really like a social
media music app another thing that I
really like about Spotify is that their
playlists they make you these playlists
every week of new artists discover
weekly which is amazing I'm all about
finding new music like I said before so
I've found so many different artists
from just going to this playlist that
they make for me every week so amazing
job on that Spotify okay so now I'm
moving on to big poppa title this thing
is $20 a month crazy I know but this
thing is necessary in my opinion it is
the best sounding app that you can get
title is single-handedly one of the
reasons why my phone bill has gone up
but it is worth it in the end for me
because once you listen to title it is
very hard to listen to anything else I
wish that they put more genres in the
forefront a lot of this is just rap RB
and soul I wish that they would kind of
push like even country music or EDM to
get people into that kind of music as
well I mean this is a hip hop centered
app I mean it's owned by jay-z so that's
what's gonna be at the center but I feel
like they can reach more of a
demographic and have more people sign up
for this so yeah if you guys really want
a good app for just the best sound
quality for streaming you don't want to
download your music you want those
losses files go with this but realize
that it's going to
yeah let's just say let's just make sure
you have a unlimited data plan so next
up we have podcasts and this is a very
good app I love it and it's one of the
reasons why I've gotten the iPhone X is
because I love having my podcast there I
couldn't find anything similar on
Android and this is one reason why I
like this a lot it has everything it has
sets from DJs their weekly shows to
motivational stuff like Gary Vee or just
talk shows so I really enjoy this app
yeah next up we can talk about audible a
little bit now these are some of my
favorite books check them out
yeah for anybody who is in the workforce
or is trying to do something amazing
with their life I recommend audible 100%
because you can get a book every month
for I think it's like 15 bucks a month
so if the book costs like 30 bucks you
can get it for 15 no matter what as long
as you're subscribed you can return
books whenever you want it's just an
amazing service this is not sponsored by
the way I just really love this app now
so listen to some books like ready
player one that are fictional okay so
moving on to my lighting setup I know a
lot of you guys have asked about this
and I'm going to do a full set up video
very very soon trust me guys but until
then I want to show you guys two app I
used to fill up hue lights of course I
have a light strip two blooms three
light bulbs to give my videos this look
so as you can see I can just go here hit
blue now we have a blue set okay now you
want different I don't know why I put
different but that's just what I named
it and then I have different two which
is like this so you can really tailor
the the way your room looks and give it
the ambiance that you want I really
enjoy using this a lot and again through
this app you can go through and change
the different lights to whatever color
as you can see so yeah I really enjoy
this this is clutch even if I didn't do
videos I would still have the Philip hue
lights now the last app that I really
want to talk about is headspace it's
sound oriented right this thing is
amazing it's for meditation and I'm not
being sponsored again by them or
anything like that I just really enjoy
using this app it's a good way after
going through feet after feed through
Twitter through Instagram through
YouTube it's just a good way to kind of
declutter your mind and stay focused to
stay focused on what you need to be
doing there's so many distractions out
there for us so I love this it lets you
keep track of how many days in a row
you've done it's subscription-based as
well keep in mind I think it's like
eight bucks a month which is not bad and
I really stress like people investing in
yourself
I know apps nobody wants to pay for apps
or subscriptions or things like that but
think of it as an investment in yourself
if you feel good if you love yourself
you're gonna do good so I really like
that app for that reason alright so next
up let's talk about my head phone apps
to end it off here now these are just
every single app for every single brand
that I have I can just go in here change
the eq's of whatever earbud that I'm
using right I have the j-bird app there
I have the both app as well
and the Audis HQ obviously these aren't
connected right now but when I need to
change my EQ I usually do it through the
actual manufacturers app so that's how I
change my IQs alright guys so I think
I'm gonna stop there I think that's all
that you guys need to see on my phone I
hope you guys have enjoyed this video
let me know if you have any more
questions or you want to see any more
apps on my phone that I didn't talk
about down below and I'll be sure to
answer you guys as always so thank you
guys for watching it's been your boy bt
