with another motivational Monday today
we're going to be talking about just
that motivation how do you stay
motivated so I'm going to give you guys
a couple tips to kind of get through
those hard times
number one is sometimes you need to not
force yourself don't force yourself to
do things even things that you love
because when you do it puts a attainted
a little bit it makes it less enjoyable
you may hate the thing that you actually
love so sometimes it's good to just step
back away from what you're actually
doing and get a new perspective on
things get it come from a new mindset
why are you doing the things that you're
doing what's your in goal and that moves
me to my next point
always keep your goals in front of you
they need to be somewhere where you can
see them whether that's on a whiteboard
on a notebook or just every day you need
to be looking at what your goals are
sometimes you know we do things that are
going to get us to our goal but are we
actually doing things with the actual
goal in mind and the goal sometimes gets
lost we may be doing the things that we
need to be doing but what is actual gold
seeing that goal sometimes kind of
revitalizes you and it gives you that
spark that you need to get through the
hard times and the last thing I just
want to leave you with is always do your
best no matter what or how you're
feeling just do your best we're all
human and realize that everybody goes
through tough times everybody goes
through those moments when they're not
so motivated nobody is Superman and
sometimes thinking and knowing that can
relieve a lot of pressure and a lot of
guilt off of us so that we can come back
to our goals and accomplish them so this
week try out these tips let me know if
you guys have dealt with this before I
know I have the past couple weeks and
that's why I want to make this video on
how to stay motivated so let me know
your tips and tricks down below on
staying motivated and I will see you
guys in
