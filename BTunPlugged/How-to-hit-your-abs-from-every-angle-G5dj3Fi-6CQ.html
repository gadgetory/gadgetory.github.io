with another commentary today we have a
much requested ab workout then i finally
got one for you guys these are three
workouts that I do normally at the end
of my workouts and they work out really
well I recommend doing at least two of
three every single day now one thing
with abs I want to stress is you want to
blow out all the air when you're
crunching don't have any air right now
on your seat breathe in and now crunch
all right now notice a difference blood
all the air and now a crunch you're
going to see a big difference in
contraction you're going to get more
muscle fibers firing off then when you
have a lot of air I see this a lot in
the gym people always make this mistake
don't be one of those people so next up
we have leg raises now this is one of my
favorites doing it on a ball holding
onto a rail it hits that lower ab and
the upper app i usually do these every
single day and even if you're a pitcher
sore just keep going just do it go go go
because that's how you're going to get
really good at what i used to hit it
maybe once every other day i didn't
really get that good of results so next
up we have one arm cable crossover
crunches now these are really like for
your obliques kind of mimics that the
diagonal way that the oblique should run
down the size of our body so as you can
see like army you can see like there's a
line that goes there so that line
we're trying to mimic that with that
pulse or play across her body and
crunching down bringing the elbow into
the hip alright guys so that's going to
do it for me thank you guys for watching
I will see you guys in the next video
don't forget to hit that like button if
you learn something that you're going to
use forever alright thank you for
watching peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
