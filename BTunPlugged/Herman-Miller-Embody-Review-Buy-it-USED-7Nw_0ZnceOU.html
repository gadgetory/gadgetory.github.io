with another review today I'm gonna be
reviewing my new chair the Herman Miller
embody I don't know if you guys have
noticed this in the videos but I have
bought a new chair to tell you guys a
little bit about why I upgraded to the
Herman Miller and body from the
Steelcase Leaf version 1 both by the way
our tremendous chairs they're both very
very good like both that's the only way
to put it
so let's just squash that debate right
now today I'm gonna just tell you guys a
little bit about the features how this
chair has helped me in my posture and
then we will go from there so there are
a ton of customizations that you can do
with this chair you can elongate the
seat of the chair by just pulling up and
pushing out that lengthens to chair to
adjust to how long your legs are and of
course you have the hydraulic switch on
the right side which allows you to move
the chair up and down so you can you
know pretend like you're riding dirty
and stuff like that the arms of this
chair are amazing they go out they go in
they go down and every which way so it's
very customizable probably the most
customizable arms that I've had on any
chair before I like that the Steelcase
Leap swiveled in a little bit but these
are actually really good as well they're
very comfortable the very light it
doesn't feel like very like they get in
the way of you doing your tasks on the
back of a lever that allows you to go
down multiple stops however you want to
lean back or how far you want to go back
you can adjust the levels to that
there's also a tension adjustment for
the back so if you lean back it adjust
how fast or slow you can do that I like
to do about medium myself now with all
the customizations and all that stuff
out of the way let's get into why this
thing is very good why it's priced at
$1000 now this is supposed to help your
posture and that's why I got it so with
the leap
I found myself kind of hunching still I
found
myself while comfortable still kind of
being in a position that wasn't good for
my back and so I picked this up and run
off the bat my lower back hurt and I saw
an Amazon a lot of people were like man
I wish I got to sit in this chair first
or I wish i sat in the showroom longer
with this chair because my back just
hurts and I think it's for a reason your
back is messed up my back was messed up
so I got this chair and when I did that
when I finally like just sat through the
hurt for like maybe two or three days my
back has never been better
like I sleep better when I'm standing in
line like let's say a long line or a
popcorn line or a movie line my back
doesn't start hurting my lower back just
doesn't start hurting anymore like it
used to so I'm already seeing the
benefits of having a great posture chair
now the upper back of the chair is very
flexible as well you're gonna move back
in it and it just flexes to your back
which is very nice but main thing here
is for me was the lower back this thing
just gives you so much lumbar support so
some things that I don't like about the
chair I don't like the seat that much I
feel like there could be more cushion
there while comfortable while you get
used to it something like that leap from
steel case if the seat is just on a
whole nother level so if they could
added a seat like that into this would
have been amazing but this one does feel
good just not as good as like a still
key another thing that I really like
about this chair is how light it is it's
very light you can move it around that's
another thing that the still case just
seemed kind of clunky to me and this is
just almost like the steel case gesture
it's very light you can move around your
desk if you have a big desk very easily
without banging this stuff so that's
nice as well now another thing that I
had to get used to was that this chair
kind of leans back just slightly right
and I think that has to do with posture
if you sit completely down in this and
try to sit upright I can't do it like my
back doesn't work that way so I had to
get used to kind of like leaning back
and having that good rounded lumbar
support and game properly because you
know any game you tend to like hunch
ah so having this and like having it
correct my posture has been
life-changing so if you suffer from a
lot of back pain like lower back or
upper back pain and you don't know why
and maybe you sit at your desk all day
it might be time to get an embody but
like I said find a liquidation place go
on google go on Craigslist find a place
because all it is is just somebody just
got rid of this chair from office
closing down or somebody just didn't
want a bunch of chairs they give them
there and you get a big discount don't
buy this chair for $1000 buy it for
about three to four hundred dollars I
take five max and it's a win-win just
steam clean it and you are good to go
it's brand-new I'll take a couple
scratches for seven hundred dollars off
but that's just me you can do whatever
you want to do but I'm trying to save
you guys some money so if you guys have
enjoyed this video if you learn
something today or if you just want to
say hi drop a comment down below like

and I'll see you guys in the next
