with another commentary today I'm
bringing guys a back workout now I want
to give you guys some tips that you can
use not only for this workout before any
other back workouts that you guys want
to do on your own doesn't even have to
be these even though these are great
first and foremost before you even walk
into the gym you want to be picturing
what you want your back to look like you
want a picture being shredded what
however you want it to look that's what
you need to be picturing now second of
all you want to be pulling down with
your elbows you don't want to be pulling
down engaging your biceps almost relax
your biceps if you can and something
that you can do that really helps with
this is your grip now you can do a
overhand over thumb grip with the bar as
you'll see me doing it many of these
movements and pulling down with a hook
motion now this takes out your bicep
even more and be very cautious of
pulling down with your elbows keeping
your biceps relaxed and keeping your
elbows tight next I want to give you a
tip of stretch and contract now you want
to get a big stretch we want to feel
you're almost here your muscles just
like stretching and you want to fill it
you get a big contraction at the top I
just see me doing these rolls right here
now another tip that I want to give you
guys is to hit all parts of your back
don't just go in there and hit upper
back don't just go in there and hit
middle back or lower back you want to be
hitting all angles of your back get
creative if you know you're going hi go
go mid next time and then go lower it's
as simple as that mix it up if one of
your body parts is lagging really look
at yourself and see okay I need to
really work on my middle back perhaps
all right guys that's gonna do it for me
thank you for watching don't forget to
hit that like button if you learn
something I will see you guys in the
next
yo peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
