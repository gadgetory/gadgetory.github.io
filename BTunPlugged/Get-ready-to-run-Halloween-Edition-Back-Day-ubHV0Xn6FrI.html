BTW here and i'm going to change up the
style of my videos um i'm gonna start
doing more of a diary type thing you
know kind of keeping track of how i'm
feeling i'll tell you guys what I eat
and keep you guys up to date you know
just to kind of show you guys that you
know I go through some of the same
things that you guys go through they're
trying to they're just starting out it
never changes um yeah cuz have one
person tell me that oh I never think
that you have cheat meals unit and
that's crazy to me because I always have
cheat meals and yeah so it just made me
realize like I need to be more open and
more real with you guys about what I'm
doing and this is gonna be a part of it
and I just want to start off we'll start
with today had a Vietnamese rice plate
had pork two pork chops egg roll and a
sunny-side-up egg now I don't know the
macros on those i'll probably put it
into my finished out a little bit see
I'm not always on top of my fitness pal
now it's on a percent straight but just
as long as you know you're staying
healthy you know you can tell when
you're having something that's healthier
when you're having something that's not
so good for you you know I mean like why
don't
you know it doesn't have to be hard you
know really doesn't even I deal with
things from time to time I'd have
cravings I love sugar if you didn't know
and you know we all at some point our
willpower kind of gives in so it's just
a matter of just you know being as good
as you can being the best that you can
and eventually it'll you'll come to find
that even more more and more you'll be
able to stay on your diet more and more
you'll be able to lose weight but you
just have to keep doing it consistently
as for me today the past couple weeks
I've been pretty bad i mean i've just
been eating whatever you know during the
day lunch time I really well I have
usually some type of chicken sweet
potato or a steamer but you know when i
get home i don't have a kitchen right
now so i'm having whatever is there just
because i have nothing to eat literally
or i'll have to pull a witch aren't the
best sodium wise they put butter in the
variety like that so it's been kind of a
frustrating and a struggle for me but
you know you just do the best that you
can up to a cardio if you have to take
out for those extra calories and things
like arms have been getting really well
getting better lately I'm noticed and
I'm I'm very happy about that because
that's something I've been trying to
improve on I've also stopped wearing
wrist wraps and my farms like happening
getting bigger I don't know might be a
correlation there I don't know
what's up guys BTW back here with
another commentary for you guys today me
and forest we did back or the artist
formerly known as Chi why if you didn't
know so we started off with some lat
pulldowns and today i started to do my
lat pulldowns a little differently as
you can see we're putting our head
through our hands almost and this is
just to get get a better stretch in the
movement and i really feel it a lot more
like right in the part underneath your
where your back in your shoulder and
your like arm connect whatever that
little spot is a little lat part next we
moved in to a one-armed landreaux mind i
really like these for hitting the lower
lat and just getting some thickness this
is kind of our compound movement for the
day next up we moved on to a reverse
grip pull down and we did the we use the
same concept as the first pull down
regular grid we stuck our head through
our hands throw arms pretty much you can
see like my lats are getting really
stretched I'm letting my arms almost
hang loose and at the top of the
movement try to flex your back and then
pull and that goes with a lot of
different movements with any workout
flex before you go into the actual
movement next up we have some cable rows
with these four four sets and you can
see I like to kind of keep a lean
forward and pull back instead I feel
like when I lean back too much I just
get like it works my traps and not
enough of my lower back all right my
lower lat sigh excuse me next up we have
one of the staples I always do this at
the tourists into my workout or the
middle I switch it up but I really like
this for you know getting blood into the
muscle we did seven sets 40 seconds rest
of reps and without one same same
concept we tried to stick our head
through and letting the Rope come up
above your head and then pulling and
again flexing at the top next up we have
I don't know what you would call these a
rope lat pulldown I guess anyways as you
can see we're just laying back on these
and pulling down and I really fill these
in my lower lats which is something that
we're trying to target you get that good
v-taper and yeah try it out let me know
what you think keep your elbows to the
side almost pull it like you're doing a
cable but downward next up we have a
double arm cable lat pulldown as you can
see we're trying to hit our lats hard
today and look I'm just so pumped I got
a lot of blood in there and this one is
just to really flex at the bottom and
get that my muscle connection and really
just kill finish off the Muslim right
and I hope you guys have enjoyed this
commentary I'll be back with some more I
just filmed a new leg workout and I'm
looking forward to sharing it with you
guys stay tuned for more thank you for
your support and I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
