agreement to of from the book The Four
Agreements by Miguel Ruiz and you are
here with BTW
now the second agreement is don't take
anything personally I really like this
one and he says that seventy-five
percent of the sufferings of humans come
from the impeccability of your word so
using words against yourself the
poisoning yourself and poisoning others
which then in turn puts bad mojo in your
life in simple terms he doesn't say like
that so don't I'm not quoting him on
that and then there's the second one
which is don't take anything personally
now we think about that we think that
everybody sees the worst the world that
would the way we see it growing up the
environments that were brought up in the
you know things that are said to us that
we have no control over we agree with
them we take them because we don't know
any better right so we have all these
agreements about ourselves you know
maybe bad things about ourselves that
like just just bad thoughts about
ourselves right and where did they come
from really right we didn't think we are
born into this world not knowing
anything and through life we gained all
this crap and same goes with that person
they went through different
circumstances they heard things growing
up and that's what they're going to be
repeating to you right so it makes sense
to them but it's not the same because
you didn't grow up like them all right
you have your own way of doing things
you have your own vocabulary use words
differently you form sentences
differently so he says it's really
selfish to think about to think that
people are talking about you it's very
selfish to think that Oh everything
revolves around me what they're saying
is about me
you know the things that you say and do
you're responsible for yourself you're
not responsible for other people's
reactions to what you say you're not
responsible for touching certain things
and other people because it's really is
there their wounds you know it's stuff
that they have to deal with you know
it's ones that they have to heal
themselves you know you're not
responsible for touching those you know
so you know don't take anything
personally right how can you really when
nothing is really about you of the the
place from which they come is different
from where you come and if you can do
this if you can be impeccable with your
word not spreading this poison not
taking in poison from other people and
letting them poison your life as well
then it'll get rid of he says 75 percent
of the human sufferings and I really I
really can relate to this you know like
bodybuilding said there's a lot of
different perspectives on people's
bodies right what's fat what's skinny
what's healthy what's shredded what's
you know this or that and it's really up
to you to define how you like your body
what you want out of your body you know
it's not up to somebody who grew up
differently than you to say hey you need
to look like this no that's not it it's
how do you want to look what are you
what are your goals you know what do you
feel like in trusting yourself you know
and he also says another good point is
he says you lie to yourself
right we all we all lie to ourselves to
some extent about you know things that
are going on things that we need to
change so don't expect other people to
tell you the truth because they're
afraid they're afraid of you seeing past
their little social mask you know they
put up this facade like oh like
everything's great or you know I'm this
or on that and really are they are they
really if you take strip all that down
they're just afraid of being seen so
don't expect people to tell you the
truth they're most likely gonna lie to
you anyway so you have to know your own
truth know what like is in your heart
and what you feel is best for yourself
not anybody else is up for you know can
tell you how to feel about that you know
and if they do they're most likely
trying to poison your ass so think you
know so today you know I want to
challenge you guys to also you know
don't take anything personally and just
see when you aren't taking things
personally you know see how your actions
it keeps you from doing certain things
or it keeps you from saying certain
things or it it has you feeling a
certain way because somebody said
something or somebody came at you the
wrong way or somebody cut you off in
traffic is it really personal with
somebody cut you off in traffic no it's
not personal there's nothing to do with
the youth and it's selfish to think that
it has something to do with you or to
attack you how could they do this to me
well they it's about them and what they
feel they can do cut walk right it has
nothing to do with you they may feel
like it's okay you don't feel like it's
okay so there's two different things so
when people criticize you or when people
bash you or whatever it's not about you
don't take it personally how can you it
has nothing to do with you think about
how they grew up it's totally different
coming alright so today like I said
don't take anything personally see when
you are taking things personally and
maybe take like him I'm taking this
personally you know I'm just going to
let this go it's not about me it's about
this person I'm not going to take their
poison today I want to finish the video
by just showing you guys I eat the same
shit every day and the crockpot chicken
is good
it's really good because
I'm able to eat this every day I think
eating this probably for the last nine
days and it shows in my body
it's really tasty so the other look out
for this for this crock pot video and I
will catch up with you guys tomorrow for
day three of the three agreement this
has been BTW i hope you guys have
learned something i hope then it makes
sense if it doesn't make sense this is
the way I understand it don't take it
personally is that you know that you can
don't take it personal all right guys
