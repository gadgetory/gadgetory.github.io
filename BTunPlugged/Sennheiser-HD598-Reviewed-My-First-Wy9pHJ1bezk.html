with another review and this review is
very special because i get to present
you guys one of my favorite headphones
ever and not because they sound the best
not because they're the most comfortable
but well the cut our but because they
were the first pair of headphones that
really turned me on to great sound now I
had the audio technica m50 you know a
lot of people hype those up and I got
them and they kind of sounded like
things that I've heard before but I
picked up the sennheiser HD 598 and
midnight on black friday and it changed
my life these headphones by sennheiser
are amazing it's an amazing way to get
into the world of audio files so today
I'm going to be telling you guys why I
adore these headphones and also to tell
you what I don't like about these
headphones I got to be balanced right so
we are going to get into this review
right now so first off let's talk about
the comfort and the design now these
feature these velour ear cups which are
silky silky smooth and soft and just sit
like pillows on your ear and you just
forget that they're even there these are
headphones where I don't get fatigued at
all like I can wear these all day and
not even think twice they don't get too
hot what more could you want so a lot of
headphones even my thousand-dollar audis
LCD tues those I can only wear for a
short amount of time because I start
getting fatigued I have to move them
around maneuver them let my ears breathe
these they're very breathable you would
think with the velour cups that it would
be a problem but it's really now they
also feature this faux leather on the
top was stitching kind of giving it kind
of that old feel so these headphones can
really
yeah if you're set up a cool retro feel
maybe you already have some Tanner brown
that you can throw these in with but I
just I love seeing these I love the look
of these I thought I wanted some black
and silver headphones but no tan and
brown these are really cool to look at
in my opinion they also have little wood
design on the side here it's not real
wood but it just looks cool and they've
grown on me over time and I'm not scared
now when I by their headphones to go for
that tan or go for that brown color
because of these headphones now let's
talk about the sound and who these are
going to be good for now these are going
to be great if you're a PC gamer because
the soundstage on these is amazing these
are an open-back headphone which means
that they will let an ambient sound but
they will also leaked sound so if you're
worried about sound leakage if you are
using these to be portable I wouldn't
recommend these now these are the first
headphones that really wowed me I never
wanted to go past about two hundred
dollars not even barely past a hundred
dollars for a pair of headphones before
and these kind of turned me on to high
quality audio file sound these are a
great entry level headphone if you're
just trying to feel it out test the
waters to see okay go and make the jump
to that next level these are a great
starting point now most headphones like
Sony beads they're going to be a
closed-back headphone now they're going
to give you more bass but you're not
going to have the clarity you're not
going to have that airiness the
soundstage to really wow you you're
gonna be like man this is really
something different that I've never
heard before I'm hearing instruments in
my songs that I couldn't hear what those
beads or Sony's or bows even and I think
that's what most people want at least
that's what I go for I want something
that I've never heard before that's
really gonna Wow me to make me feel like
Dave I really got my money's worth now
let me tell you who these headphones are
for now if you love love love vocals
like I do you're gonna love these
because these really turn me on to how
vocals can really sound before these I
didn't really know I didn't really care
I didn't really notice that there would
it be clarity in certain songs but these
kind of ruined a lot of headphones for
me because now that's what I listen to
the highs are great and accurate all
across the board these are accurate but
with that comes a lack of base now if
you're a super bass head just just exit
the review right now because these
aren't for you but you can stay if you
really like my reviews and just want to
watch your more than well but for those
of you who love mins who love clarity
who love instruments and hearing stuff
in front and back of you to the side
left right these are going to be amazing
for you now because there's such a wide
soundstage these are going to be great
for gaming over something like a sony or
b turbos these are going to be great
because you can hear stuff like i said
in front back you hear footsteps in here
rockets whizzing past you all that good
stuff with you they're also great for
movie watching it's just it's an
incredible experience all across the
board now one thing that I want to
mention is and what some people might be
taken aback by it when they first by
these when they first plug them in there
is a lack of power behind these so
you're going to need an amp or a DAC
even if you get like an entry-level amp
like a Pheo these will get loud enough
for you to hear the power behind these
headphones so all in all these have been
my main drivers for the past I think
those two years is that least I've been
my main drivers until I got my oddities
but before that these were my top dogs
for editing for everything I threw out
my M 50s by audio technica that's how
great I thought these were and how they
still are what am I saying these are
amazing so for any of you guys out there
that are trying to get into the
audiophile world and you're wandering
outside of beats Bo sunny what do I need
to be by what do I need to be looking
for this is a great place to start to
really get your
foot in the door to dip your toe in the
water to really test the waters and see
okay is this for me is this something
that I want to invest money in so one
negative that I really found what these
headphones is the course is way too long
i had to buy a new one because it would
get caught in my computer chair you know
we're all moving around all the time in
our chairs and it would get caught and
let's snatch off my head when i tried to
meet up or things like that if you love
ms if you love vocals if you love
accurate south you know you don't want
your your base overtaking everything
else you like clarity you want sound
stage you love gaming these are going to
be the ones for you so these are
definitely going to go into my headphone
Hall of Fame they already have they've
been there for since the day I got them
so thank you guys for watching let me
know down in the comments below whether
you're thinking about picking these up
