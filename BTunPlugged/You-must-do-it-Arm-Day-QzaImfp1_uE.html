little differently I just want to say
thank you to everybody that has
supported me in my youtube channel and
for continuing to watch and all the
feedback that I've gotten has been great
so far and you know I'm trying to become
better at this and you know I couldn't
do it without you guys I didn't do
without good feedback without
constructive feedback you know having
good people around me I'm moving forward
to towards the end of the year I just
want to keep on making these videos and
adding new stuff and keeping it fresh
you know I'm all about keeping it fresh
and keeping working out exciting you
know what I mean and today I had a low
weigh-in of 169 and i haven't been under
170 in a while since I've been bulking
and now cutting this is my last week of
my cut so after this week I will be
bulking until about februari lean bulk I
mean I don't really like to get crazy I
don't like to eat a lot of crappy foods
well simple is best what I do is instead
of having maybe chicken vegetables and
sweet potato for my cut I'll switch it
up and have chicken vegetables and white
potatoes more calories right off the top
easy to do I am going to do it amateur
bodybuilding show physique men's
physique competition just to test myself
I mean whether I'm ready or not I'm
gonna do my best i'm gonna bring my best
package to the state so without any
further ado let's kill some arms base
hey what's up guys BTW back here again
with another commentary today I thought
I'd do something different and go over
some of the mechanics of you know proper
form which a lot of people overlook and
that's one thing that I think that you
know you see all these people throwing
up big weight you see them
doing all this crazy stuff in the gym
and they're small right don't do that
don't be a ego lifter you know lift what
your muscle can lift you know try to
push yourself but don't do it to the
point where you're sacrificing your form
I mean would you give a baby some books
a heavier encyclopedia with no give them
a little rattle right so I mean just use
a rattle was what I'm trying to tell you
I don't know that analogy really works
but we're going to go with it on to the
mechanics so first I want to talk about
elbow placement you want to keep your
elbows to your side and focus on
squeezing I like to think when I squeeze
almost like a wet rag I think like
you're trying to wring out a wet rag you
know like you're watching some dishes
afterwards just bring it out and try to
get all the water out that's what you
want to try to picture when you're doing
triceps or any not just arms any workout
that you're doing try to do that and
that'll give you that good mind muscle
connection and really tear down down the
fibers in your arms you know a lot of
people I see in the gym they're not
really mindful of the muscle you know
they're just going through the motions
don't go through the motions now we're
going to see for is busting nut enjoy
ladies and gentlemen that's what you
call maximum effort right there by a chi
why now another thing that I want to
stress with arms is hitting him from
different angles you know that's why we
do different workouts you know you want
to just like with any other workout you
want to hit try to hit the muscle from
all different angles and you saw when we
did biceps we changed our grip we did an
overhand grip we did underhand we did
hammer curls we did outside hammer curls
we did inside hammer curls that way you
know for sure you're getting your
money's worth during your workout
because you know you got to think not
all workouts are going to be suited for
you a hundred percent so with that in
mind making sure that you hit it from
different angles ensures that one of
those workouts is going to work for you
it's just odds at that point that's why
we try to mix it up a lot now with
triceps as you can see during this
workout we try to hold at the bottom for
two seconds and that's just to get that
my muscle connection and also like the
rag earlier what I was saying is just
squeezing the hell out of the muscle and
making sure that it's being worked as
you can see we kept our elbows in place
the whole entire time keep the keeping
strict form and that's what's going to
get you to the championship game it's
going to take you to the ship alright I
hope you guys enjoyed this commentary
