another motivational Monday today I want
to talk to you guys about writing things
down now every morning when I wake up I
don't go to social media I don't check
my email the first thing that I do is I
write down what I want to get done for
the day that can be anything from just
small improvements in my life to
cleaning to my big goals everything from
A to Z what I think I can actually get
done in the day I don't try to write
down everything I don't say I do
everything all in one day I try to be
reasonable with myself as well so be
reasonable with yourself what do you
actually have time to do don't try to be
a Superman with this don't try to write
down 20 different things that you need
to do and get overwhelmed and then what
happens we shut down be reasonable with
yourself say you know what I think I can
get this dead or I think I could get a
piece of my goal done today I can get
you know for me sometimes it's like oh I
can get this piece of the video done
today
that's what I have time for with
everything else I have going on and
that's good that's great that's good
enough for me because the next day I can
say you know I can just fill the next
part of the video and then we're done
see how that works or I could say you
know I need to get the whole video done
I need
I need filmed I need all the b-roll film
guess what and I don't have the time
guess what's going to happen I'm not
going to do the video so writing down
small goals your big goals all those
different things every single day every
morning writing down what you think you
can get accomplished towards your goals
this will go a long way and actually
inching your way to your goals because
our big goals are just that they're big
they're not going to happen like that
we need to consistently on a day-to-day
basis be doing things towards our goals
if we're not doing that then we're going
to fall by the wayside we're not going
to be progressing as fast as we could
and this will make you feel so much more
in control of your life I know when I
don't do this I feel out of control I
feel like I don't know where I'm going
but when I do do this I feel in control
in my life I feel confident I walk
around with swag all that good stuff
guys it's it's incredible how much just
the small act every morning what it can
do for your life and I really want this
for you guys I really want you guys to
write down the things that you need to
get done every single day and see if
this doesn't at least help you just a
little bit alright guys so thank you
guys for watching and I will see you
