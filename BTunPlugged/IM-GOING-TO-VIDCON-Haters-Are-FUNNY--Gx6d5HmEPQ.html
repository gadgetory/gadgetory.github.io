with another motivational Monday today
before we get into today's topic I just
want to announce and I will be at VidCon
I don't know if 2800 of you guys care or
if you guys are even going to be there
but just want to let you guys know I
will be there and if you want to meet me
for any reason or just want to say hi
send me a direct message or a message
through YouTube and I'll let you know
where I'm at now that we got that out of
the way let's just talk about today's
topic so for the most part my channel
stays really positive but recently I
think today somebody went on my channel
just just turn me down with all my
videos and just calling me names all
this they just got me thinking it's
maybe laughs like how pitiful this is
like it is just so funny like this
person does not even know me whatsoever
but yet he came to take the time to call
me all these names
it's just fighting it's like it and I
hate to go there but as a man who out
there is doing this I just want to know
who's sitting behind the keyboard
spreading hate it makes no sense
whatsoever it is just funny so today's
topic is just about haters if you're
doing something great you're gonna have
haters
I have people that want to put in their
two cents they're gonna tear down how
you look or things that things that you
do and what matters most is just staying
true to yourself how do you see yourself
what is yourself do you like do things I
always tell my friends do things that
make yourself proud do things that make
yourself proud that's what you should be
living your life by not what your
parents think of like this hater says or
whatever you can only control how you
feel about you if you feel like you're
doing a bad job you need to be honest
with yourself and change something in
this case I know I have nothing to
change I'm working hard and doing my
best so when they hater comes at me and
it makes no impact on my life that at
all and I know that some of you guys out
there I saw the goals that you guys
posted by the way and thank you for that
it was very inspiring to me and I just
wanna let you guys know that you guys
are not alone we all go through the same
thing we all got haters we've got people
naysayers family bla bla bla you just
have to keep pushing and staying true to
yourself don't ever compromise what you
hold to be true for anybody else for any
reason so always always always just
block out the haters as they say in in
this case it literally makes no impact
on my life it actually just gives me a
topic to make more videos so this hater
didn't get what he wanted and that's
okay with me so go out there try this
this coming week if you have any or been
dealing with this or you're in school
and people are trying to bully you guys
f them alright stay true to yourself
it's about what you think about you but
it would matters most alright so I will
see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
