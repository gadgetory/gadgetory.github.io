these are gonna be Beats killers but I
will say this I I don't think you're
necessarily gonna get more enjoyment out
of these than these what is up guys is
BT back here again with another review
today we're gonna be testing out the
sound in tone cx0 fives now I came
across these because they some actually
told me that unbox therapy said that
these could be Beats killers the crazy
thing about this is that there are only
$20 so it immediately intrigued my
interest so I picked them up and I've
tested them out and I'm here to tell you
guys my findings today today we will
find out whether a bucks therapy was
right or whether he was wrong about them
being beats killers so let's check it
out so let's start off with the
packaging now the packaging is so simple
it comes with two 3.5 milimeter cords
there's a case one breaks and that's
actually a good thing because a lot of
the cheap headphones they sometimes give
out with the cords so that's sometimes a
concern so that's great that they added
in a second cord I really appreciate
that one thing that does concern me
though is this little piece of wire
coming out of the headphone now with
higher end headphones like the V motors
it's not really a problem I don't really
worry about it if I yank it but this
could be a problem with some of the
cheaper headphones that's yet to be seen
with these but that's just something
that look out for these fold up they're
foldable and I actually feel like the
hinges are really nice I actually feel
like these feel better than the beats
hinges do they just feel a lot more
solid they don't feel like they're gonna
snap or break this metal piece right
here just feels very nice the headband
is very sleek I love the silver
actuations right here I love the band
they look more expensive and they feel
more expensive than $20 had my roommate
try them and he he thought that man
these must be expensive that's tougher
he said to me so very very nice the
comfort is actually really really great
put these on I'd actually say they're
comfortable more comfortable than any
beats that I have tried so I mean that's
a start to killing the beats overall I
really like the look of these headphones
there's very minimal branding there's
just the CX 0 v on the side overall just
very very nice very very sleek a lot of
the the pricing front beats is gonna
come from the endorsements from LeBron
the packaging the extra pouches for
storage things like that so they've kind
of stripped away all that and just given
us the headphones and there's actually a
pretty nice package alright so let's
talk about the sound now what I did
notice is on my Android phone the sound
wasn't as good as on my iPhone phone so
keep that in mind if you are thinking
about buying these on my iPhone I would
say that these sound better than Beats
I'm not gonna lie to you guys
I think they sound a little bit better
not as much bass but there is that
clarity there there's the MS there's the
highs all sound great they sound like
they're worth more than $20 headphones
and that's one thing that unbox therapy
really commented on is that these
cheaper headphones that are coming out
are actually catching up with the
technology and being able to produce the
the technology and the headphones to
catch up to these hundred dollar
headphones so do you really need to
spend that extra 60 to however much
money more to kind of go above the $20
or cheap headphones that line is
becoming blurred so yeah all in all it's
everything just it sounds good
these sound great these are gonna be
good if you want to just have a set of
headphones like on the go that you don't
really care about maybe that I wouldn't
recommend these for the gym really
because they don't really block out that
much sound but they do fit very
comfortably if you're just going on like
a small trip in a car or something or
you know you just want something for
commuting these are going to be great
so these did move a lot of air and this
is one thing that I did do just to kind
of test this is I used my expensive cord
mojo
and I plug these into to kind of push
these and give them a little bit more
power to their drivers and they actually
sounded pretty well that I was able to
bring the bass up a little bit which was
very nice
overall the they still when I when I go
to something like a Audis $1,000
headphones are the fostex for our
headphones you definitely notice a
difference but when it comes to beats I
think they'll older beats older style
beats these are better
the newer beats like the solo threes
those are gonna sound a little bit
better in my opinion but definitely
definitely definitely like the solo ones
the solo twos maybe these sound a little
bit better now the call quality was
pretty good they have a mic here with a
little remote which is very nice it's
very clicky I just I like this this
remote it's very simple I really
appreciate that I appreciate it simple
so again great for commuting if you just
need something just from the go you can
really take your calls things like that
it sounds good
so at the end of the day you're paying
$20 for these versus a hundred hundred
fifty three hundred dollars for the
solos I would say yes it is worth saving
your money and going with these because
you could use that money towards
something else you can get maybe a DAC
app you can get another set of
headphones for the gym and just have
them separately you get two different
things and still have a great experience
if you're you but I will say that if you
are used to a certain quality of sound
like if you're already at that top-end
if you already have beats or whatever
then these aren't gonna surprise you but
if you're jumping from something like
then you know another cheap pair of
headphones I think that these are
probably on the upper echelon of cheaper
headphones so I would definitely go with
these over another cheap pair of
headphones if that makes sense
so are they Beats killers was unbox
therapy right I would say yes in a way
he is right because you can save that
money and do other things with that
money it whether that's buy more
headphones like it you can get repaired
Jaybirds
and you can get these and you can have
two sets of headphones for the price of
the be
and still have some money left over so
yes I feel like these Arby's killers
when it comes to money sound wise the
newer beats like the Beats Studio twos
the the soul of threes things like that
they are gonna sound better than these
but they have to also cost what 15 times
the price of these so the choice is
yours you can save yourself a little bit
of cash in my opinion get these and go
with another pair of like workout
headphones or maybe you get add a camp
to kind of Drive these and make them a
little bit better at home alright and
also too there is a difference between
the iPhone and Android so if you are an
Android user I think they're okay for
your iPhone user these are gonna sound a
lot better alright guys so thank you
guys for watching and I will see you
guys on the next</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
