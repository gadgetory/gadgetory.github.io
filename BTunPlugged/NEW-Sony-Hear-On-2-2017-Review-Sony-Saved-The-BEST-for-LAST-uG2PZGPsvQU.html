nothing short of a miracle it's
dramatically new made possible only
through years of research invention and
innovation living stereo played on a
record later through the all new 2 &amp;amp; 1
dar√≠o or the phonics high fidelity
Victrola
what is up guys is BT back here again
with another review today we're gonna be
taking a look at the best wireless
headphones of 2017 yeah I said it and
yes you can quote me on this the Sony
her2 s are the best wireless headphones
out currently I mean you gotta love
stories like this last year I ripped
Sony's models of these same headphones
they were terrible let's be honest they
suffered from low sound volume and when
I say low I mean low also they had
little to no bass and lackluster noise
cancellation a lot of people said they
didn't believe me they went out they
bought them came back to my video and
said all my points were right huh
believe that
so let's find out today how Sony went
from the worst to first okay in the box
you'll find a USB cord a carrying pouch
for protection but at this price point I
wish they added a hardshell case and a
3.5 millimeter jack the headphones
themselves have a smaller footprint this
year they made the ear cups and the band
smaller I really love the design on the
headband there's a metal piece between
the two plastic parts so let's say you
were to mistakenly sit on these they
won't break or at least they'll give
them a better chance at surviving the
faux leather on the ear cups feel very
nice they stay fairly cool during
workouts as well if that's what you're
wanting them for also feature touch
controls like their older brother now
the 1000x and two's swiping forwards or
backs gifts songs and swiping up and
down adjust the volume tapping the ear
cups place pause and accepts calls I
find the controls to be very responsive
I do find however that if you're trying
to lay down with these the controls will
activate very easily I wish there was a
way in the app to maybe lock this so
when you're laying down or you're
sitting on a plane and your head falls
over you won't stop the music on the
left ear cup you will find the power
button the noise cancellation control
3.5 million
and USB inputs overall the build is
top-notch on these the only weird thing
on these is there's no protection for
the drivers in the actual headphone
ear-cups there's only like a little
screen a little thin screen so if you're
using these for the gym in your big
sweater you've been warned these things
will probably break on you so let's talk
about the sound immediately when I put
these on I knew these were gonna be the
headphones of the year for me at least
they are everything I could ask for and
probably everything you could want as
well and let me tell you why app lets
you configure the sound how you want it
I love the treble preset for more of the
vocals and instrumental stuff and for
the bass your songs I like the bass
boost mode speech mode is also great for
audiobooks the clarity is just crystal
clear in these headphones even with
noise cancellation on which is just
amazing these also feature Sony's
technology that HSE II so this will take
your low quality mp3 files or some low
quality streaming music and bump it up
to lossless quality or near it they say
which is just amazing I can really tell
the difference between these and some
other top-notch headphones so all in all
I really enjoyed the listening
experience on these headphones and I'm
sure you will too
I mean I will put my name on it that's
one of the presets will fulfill your
needs okay so for the noise cancellation
this is huge guys that noise
cancellation is matched or rivals the
1000x m2 which I think are some of the
best on the market right now they even
put wind reduction on these making them
great for runners or for just commuting
and windy weather these are also great
for traveling I tried to recreate some
engine noise playing for my computer and
these blocked out everything this year
Sony has a really past Bose when it
comes to noise cancellation and these
are no exception these are right in line
with a 1000 X and twos Sony very good
job on noise cancellation this year so
the battery life is rated at 22 hours
giving you almost a day of playback so
these will match the Beats Studio threes
even with the w1 chip so Sony really
good job on that as well
connection there's just no hookups they
have HD quality for their calls these
are great if you want to do important
calls on these you'll sound clear as
well as you'll be able to hear whoever
you're talking to just fine in
conclusion these headphones are beasts
and at only 300 dollars I would go as
far as to say that these are better than
the Sonia 1000 x m2 they combine
crystal-clear sound all I can say is Wow
and I can't wait to see what they have
in store with us with the here on
Three's Sony thank you for making these
amazing headphones and right before the
holidays so until then until the 3s come
out these will be my main things for
listening to music wirelessly at the gym
everywhere I'm taking these everywhere
travel yeah these are gonna come around
the world with me alright alright so
thank you guys for watching if you have
any more questions about these
headphones let me know down in the
comments below and I'll try to answer
all your questions until then until the
next one I will see you guys in the next
video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
