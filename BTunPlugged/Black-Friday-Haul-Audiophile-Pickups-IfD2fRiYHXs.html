guys this beatty back here again with
another video today I'm gonna be showing
you guys my Black Friday haul what I
picked up the deals that I got I'm gonna
give you guys the prices of everything
that I got what it normally costs how
much I got it for and a lot of these
deals are still going on and you can
kind of find them here and there so
without any further ado let's get into
the hall okay so first up let's move all
this stuff out of the way first alright
so first up we have the peak design back
everyday bag I've been wanting this for
a very long time but it's been very
expensive these things go for about 290
not even including tax so incredibly
expensive but I wanted a good traveling
bag something where I could put my
laptop in I can walk around in it I can
take it to a cafe and I can also put my
camera lenses and stuff like that when
I'm filming outside so I picked this one
up I got it for 200 which is a steal for
this thing because of the quality I got
the 30 liter version of this bag again
links down below it has this amazing
amazing system up top here you take this
off and you can expand it like so and
then you have a bigger bag so there's a
lot of expandability with this thing
have Alexa so we have so we have this
bag it has a lot of expandability here
you can kind of see where the camera
lenses go or if I want to put some
clothes in here for just a day trip or
put some shoes in here I can do all of
that as a lot of expandability I hadn't
Manfrotto bag before I don't know if you
guys seen in some of my past videos but
that thing hurt and when I put my
backpack in the back it didn't have
enough padding for my back so my lower
back took a beating on like travel when
I was traveling overseas in China so
that's when I realized like I needed a
really good bag and the good thing about
this one is that it's expensive but it
comes with a lifetime warranty and this
thing is built it looks very good the
quality the materials that they use is
very
vid so all in all I just love this bag
so far where I got it from was Best Buy
they have a deal right now it's like 25%
off accessories for cameras and this is
a camera accessory so I got this and I
got two memory cards I put them in my
car and I checked out and these things
came out to about 200 bucks so great bag
definitely recommend if you guys are
looking for a good tech back I'm gonna
be doing that what's in my tech back
soon all right let's see where do I
wanna go next let's go with the Odyssey
I sign tens now these things usually run
about 360 dollars but I got these
refurbished from Odyssey for about 220 I
believe so I've had my eye on these for
a while and I really really want to try
them because they're the first plane are
magnetic in ear headphones earbuds I
have the LCD too so I thought you know
if they made an earbud version of those
that would be amazing so I picked these
up these claims to have 99.9 percent
less distortion than other in-ear
earbuds so going into the Black Friday I
knew I wanted some in-ear earbuds and I
wanted them wired and the reason for
that is I wanted to be able to when I do
reviews on like wireless headphones then
I will be able to just compare them to
these and I can say okay these are
better these sound pretty close to some
of the most and non distorting
headphones on the market so I can kind
of give you guys better reviews using
these earbuds so I hope we have stuff to
test these and I will have a full review
on everything on this table like I said
so be on the lookout for these these
kind of like the Star Wars a deaf star
thing I think that's what you call it
the Deaf Tsar thingy by the way who's
watching the new Star Wars I'm pretty
hyped yeah so this is a lightning cable
version of these headphones you plug
them into your iPhone yeah great next up
we have the one more quad driver in ear
headphones these things I've heard of
very good things about these so for
reference the jaybird X threes have one
driver these have four that's right four
so it's supposed to increase the
soundstage the quality of the clarity
using all those four drivers to kind of
your eardrums and just create massively
good sound so I'm definitely looking
forward to trying these out they have
the best packaging I've ever seen on any
headphone that I've ever reviewed ever
ever ever so this thing is just I'll
show you guys real quick so it looks
like this and then whoa I mean so be on
the lookout for review on this one as
well and then lastly we have the Odyssey
Deckard the DAC amp so what a deck amp
does is it takes those zeros and ones
from your computer using an USB cord and
it sends it to your headphones and turns
it into sound and the quality of which
it does that it differs so something
like a computer that has a sound card or
built in on your motherboard or
something like that it's not gonna be as
good as a dedicated DAC with power it's
gonna be a lot more powerful as when I
Drive some of the harder to drive
headphones like Sennheiser the five 90s
I love those headphones but they're very
hard to drive
you just plug them straight into your
phone or your computer they're not gonna
sound as good but if you plug them into
a DAC and it gives them enough power it
actually brings up the bass the mids
everything just sounds so much more
clear so having it back is essential in
my opinion if you care that much about
sound quality which I do so this thing
runs about $700 okay retail so this is
my biggest saving so I got this for
about 320 so I got this on Amazon
refurbished you can save a lot of money
by going refurbished and I recommend it
if the company the actual company is
giving you our firmus product it's
usually gonna be very good because they
know how to refurbish they put in the
new parts or they fix whatever was wrong
with the machine and then they give it
back out so sometimes it's even better
than buying it new because they've gone
through the testing more rigorously than
like if it was on an assembly line I
really like to go with a refurbished if
I can and in this case it saved me a ton
of money so if you guys are looking for
a great deck and definitely check this
one out I got it on Amazon to refurbish
section yeah more than half off so I
believe a lot of these deals are still
going on
I believe the Odyssey and the peak
design is still going on if you get this
on Best Buy and the I sign 10 I think
the deal is over but you can't find
these very good or refurbished sometimes
on the Amazon or their actual site so
definitely if you can try to get most
things refurbished so that's my Black
Friday haul so I'm gonna do like what's
in an audiophile tech bag I guess what's
in my tech bag and then I'm also gonna
have reviews on each one of these
products and tell you guys what I think
about each in the near future so be on
the lookout for that and I will see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
