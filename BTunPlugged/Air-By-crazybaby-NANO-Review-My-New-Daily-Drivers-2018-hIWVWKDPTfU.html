with another review now this has been a
long time coming I've seen these
headphones in my review comment sections
a ton everybody's been asking me to
review them so here we are I reached out
to the company and they were nice enough
to send me a pair of these headphones
now the air by crazy baby is
at $100 and they come in 10 different
colors I chose to go with the red
because you know what I just want to mix
it up so today I'm gonna be telling you
guys why I believe these are a great
lifestyle choice just as an everyday
carry they can go everywhere with you
from your workplace to the gym to just
shopping or making calls they do
everything and you guys will not be
disappointed so let me tell you guys
let's get into this review in the box
you're gonna find two sets of wings four
sets of ear tips a charging case the ear
buds and a USBC charger now upon first
taking these out of the box what I
noticed most was how light they are
these things are super light even the
case is really light a lot of the new
true wireless earbuds and the cases are
just super heavy and carrying them
around to be a real pain the one thing
that really stood out to me with these
earbuds is how light the whole package
is from the case to the actual earbuds
themselves when you put them into your
ears they are just a super super light I
love it and that's the number one thing
that I love about these headphones
because I can take these everywhere and
not feel like I'm carrying around this
big burden with me it's very lifestyle
oriented where I can just keep these on
me at all times they can be in my pocket
and it slides to one side of your pocket
so it's not gonna be covering a wide
range in your pocket taking up a ton of
space which I really love and I find
myself reaching for these a ton the
silicon tips and the wings are super
comfortable most of the time I don't you
need to use the wings but I do use them
in the gym when I need more of that
security and this is one area where the
air pods really fell short is they don't
block out a lot of noise so yeah they're
a lifestyle product but for the most
part when you're in the gym I can't hear
my music whatsoever so these allow me to
keep a lightweight system with me and
bring it everywhere and even to the gym
I can bring it to work I can bring it to
grocery shopping anywhere accepting
calls it does everything really well the
case slides open to reveal the ear
which I love as for controls on the
right side you can control your music by
playing and stopping the music by
tapping once you can tap twice to skip
forward tap three times to skip back and
then on the left side you can accept
calls with one tap and pressing it twice
will bring up Siri and Google Alexa and
things like that
so overall design is king when it comes
to a lifestyle product and these did not
disappoint whatsoever as for the sound
signature these are very good they're
very balanced I would put them on par
and what they sound very similar to is
the icon X by samsung both a sound are
very good they have a nice bass response
and these get very loud that's one thing
that I love about these as well so when
you're in the gym it'll block out a ton
of noise or when the person you're
calling has a very quiet voice you can
just raise up the volume and it's no
problem
I love transfer fees I was listening to
above and beyond sin newest CD and the
podcast and these just blew that music
out of the water so I was not
disappointed on any front I can't really
say anything bad about these because
they're so balanced they have the bass
there there's no harsh highs mids are
very clear so I can't really say
anything bad about these these are not
the best of the best sound quality don't
get me wrong they're not on par with
like some Audis wired earbuds but these
are standing up to most of the earbuds
that are true relish right now
for call quality these are very good
they have an embedded double with
digital silicone microphone in them
sounds very clear you guys will not have
any problems you can mark my words on
that the battery life is good but not
great when you have like air pots on the
market that are getting close to 24 25
hours so these have 12 hours which is
good that gives you about 4 charges
total that's a very long time that's
half a day which is I think more than
what most people will need anyways and
what I also like is that a 5 minute
charge will give you 90 minutes of
playback that's crazy so if you're on
the go if you need to charge someone
before you go into the gym real quick
and you see that you're on a little
battery you will have enough with some
to spare for the connectivity everything
was a breeze you just hold down on both
of them they both pair to your phone I
had no issues there they also use the
same technology as iPhones they have
that plane are inverted F shaped antenna
and these are also rocking a Bluetooth a
5.0 so your future proofed with these I
encountered no break ups with these is
so super solid all the way around
I thought it would be pretty impossible
for anybody to replace my air pots I
have been bringing those with me
everywhere every day
since I got them but now I think I'm
gonna be splitting the time a little bit
more evenly now that I have the air by
crazy baby these things live up to the
hype and more so thank you guys for
recommending me to reach out to this
company and get them don't forget that
all these opinions are my own they
didn't pay for this at all they just
sent me the headphones to review so I
can tell you guys if they are good or if
they are bad and these things are good
they work in multiple situations from
your work to your gym they block out a
ton of noise which the air pots don't do
so I can bring these with me to multiple
situations and have them work which is
invaluable so a great job crazy baby I
love the headphones thank you for
sending them out to me
and thank you guys for watching this
review there's gonna be more to come I
will see you guys in the next video it's
been your boy bt saying peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
