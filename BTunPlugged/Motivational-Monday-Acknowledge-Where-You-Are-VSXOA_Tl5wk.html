with another motivational Monday welcome
back guys it's been two weeks I know I
was on vacation last week and also too I
wanted to recharge my creative juices
come back with some fresh new ideas for
you guys to kind of learn and to play
around with so here we are today we're
going to be talking about acknowledging
where you are at this point in time in
your progression towards your goals now
I took the first step end up I catch
myself doing this a lot and that is
pretending I'm further along than I
really thought you really have to go
through the struggles of trials and
tribulations to get to your goals hear
me out everybody has to start somewhere
everybody starts off as a novice as not
knowing anything and then you progress
right and you have you start here you
enjoy
so acknowledging that you are right here
if you pretend like you're really up
here you always see those people
gloating and say oh I'm going to do this
great thing and all this matter they're
really saw themselves short because they
are not going to look for the help the
resources and the knowledge they need to
actually get to their goal if you
already know how to do and be this
version right here then why do you need
to get help why do you need for dress
and if you're at this level in your
faith you're up here guess what you're
not going to progress to that goal so
acknowledging Haley this is how far I've
come I looked at some of my old videos
and now compare them to the ones I'm
doing now and there's a lot of different
cinematography things as I'm doing live
different shots of being more thoughtful
than I was back when i first started so
I can kind of see like okay this is
where I was and now I'm acknowledging
this is where i am now that i still have
a long way to go but that is the first
step in me realizing look this is where
i am what do i need to do to get to
continue on this road to get to where I
need to go if I already think that I'm
Ardley there's a big shot youtuber guess
what I'm not going to do the work that's
necessary to get to this point so that
can go for anything if you're not ready
for a test I know some of you guys are
students let's say you're getting ready
for a test and you say oh I've got this
test your friend you're telling people
you know I got this test really you
haven't really study that much you
pretend like you know more about that
test when you actually go to take that
test and they test you all that stuff
you're not gonna know as much as that
person who you said was freaking out for
the test and was like I don't know
anything there are many to themselves
I'm not ready and then whatever they do
they get ready so you guys see the
difference there we're 11 way you're
acknowledging that you're at a lower
point and that's okay you're being okay
with that but it allows you to grow the
other mindset is a fixed mindset of I'm
already great and I don't need any other
knowledge and not really taking into
account what they actually need to do so
you kind of have to find a balance like
yeah be confident in yourself have faith
that you're gonna get to this goal but
also to realize look this is where i am
trying to go so this week acknowledge
where you're at tell yourself and hyper
self up from there look this is what i
have to do to get from where i am now
where I want to be alright guys so
trying to step a little technique out
see if it doesn't give you a different
mind shift it doesn't change your
perspective on a situation that you
might be struggling with alright guys so
thank you guys for watching and I will
see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
