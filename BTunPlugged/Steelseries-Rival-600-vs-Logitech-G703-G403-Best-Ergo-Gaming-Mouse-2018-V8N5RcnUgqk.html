with another battle today we enter the
gaming mouse realm something I've
slightly touched on in the past but as
you guys know I am a huge logitech fan
and I've used them way back when when I
used to play games competitively like
tribes - or the Warcraft or craft 3 and
now overwatch but as we all know there
is competition and it can be a and
competitive companies will try to push
comfort levels sensor quality and
customization levels to the max so with
all that being said welcome to the
SteelSeries rival 600 versus the
Logitech G 703 battle slash like G 403
now right off the bat you may be saying
bTW this is unfair the comparison is a
wireless versus a wired mouse well first
off they are roughly the same price the
rival 600 is $80 and the Logitech G 703
can be found for around the same price
you can also use the G 703 wired which
makes it like it's little brother of the
G 403 that leads me into my first topic
the Logitech braided wires just suck on
the G Pro they suck on the G 403 703 903
the ologists are super stiff and it just
gets in the way when even when you're
using a mouse bungee I can feel the drag
of the cord on the mousepad and it just
throws off my whole aim the rival 600 on
the other hand has a detachable cord
that is rubberized and very light and it
stays out of your way at all times when
in Wireless mode that G 703 has no
noticeable delay and has been noted as
being better than some of its corded
Mouse counterparts which is really nice
I've also seen a lot of pros use these
recently and that means that they really
trust the wire
this connection and they must not feel
any of this lag because you know they're
doing that professionally they're
getting pay so if he's good enough for
them is good enough for me the freedom
to swipe your mouse all the way around
the mouse pad is nice especially for
those of you who use super low
sensitivities just make sure you're
keeping that G 7:03 charged because the
cord is just terrible and the power play
mat is $100 which charges it and
currently while you use it I haven't
picked one up yet because I've been sold
out and that's just one more thing to
buy it's a hundred dollars people it's
weird to say but I feel like this round
still is a tie even with one being
Wireless and one being wired with even
the slight edge being to the rival 600
just because even though it's corded it
almost feels like there's nothing
attached so let's talk about the comfort
the D 703 gets a lot of mixed reviews
online and rightfully so it has a huge
bump towards the back and that makes the
mouse feel like you're holding an egg
I've actually switched my hand to having
my hand further back on the mouse almost
like a half palm grip and it makes it
way more comfortable I think a lot of
people should try it that way with that
being said the rival 600 you can lay
your hand all over that Mouse and it is
one of the most comfortable Mouse's that
I have ever used personally it just fits
like a glove the hump on the rival 600
is in the middle and it's less
pronounced both have side grips the
rivals being a nice smooth silicone and
the G 703 is being more rubberized but I
find that I prefer the rival 600
ever-so-slightly when my hand gets
sweaty the rubber on the G 703 gets a
little slippery here and there I do
however prefer the overall coating of
the actual mouth of the G 703 more
though when your hand warms up it just
has a very nice texture to it the rival
600 is a little bit more rough or
industrial feeling I should say which
isn't a bad thing but sometimes it's
little things that kind of irked you
when it comes to a mouse you know on the
bottom of the rival 600 the shape and
the blockiness is a little weird when
swiping it at an angle it will stop
tracking sometimes it kind
threw me off I had to get used to it if
you swipe from like right to left the
back right part of this mouse has a lot
of Mouse let's just say that and there's
a learning curve when coming from
something like a g7 no.3 which has like
a uniform shape on the bottom so you can
just it's just smooth all the way across
I do feel like I prefer the rival 600
some Mouse feet a little bit more than
the g7 no threes they just feel a little
bit more smoother now the clicks on the
g7 of three are some of the best of any
Mouse that I've ever tried they are so
crisp they are so easy to press and they
just they just stay that way it's so
consistent the SteelSeries clicks aren't
that bad but you have to get used to
them as it takes a little bit of
pressure to accentuate them compared to
like the G 703 the side buttons on the
Raval 600 are quite thin but feel really
solid I do however prefer the side
buttons of the G 703 they are very
clicky and big so you won't miss them
and if you're using something like a
fingertip grip or a palm grip I think
that the rival 600 is better and if you
use a claw grip I think this G 703 is a
little bit better
I have medium hands and 19 centimeters
by 10 centimeters if you have big hands
the Radwell 600 will be better because
it's a little bit longer and the G 703
is why overall once you get used to the
shape of the rival 600 at the bottom the
swiping and all that it is one of the
most comfortable Mouse's that you can
buy so my pick for comfort has to go to
that okay so how is my aim with these
Mouse's well you know I have a really
good aim either way just kidding but I
did find my aim to be a little bit
better with the latter mouse is 600
coming in at 98 grams and the G 703
coming in at 106 grams you can add 10
grams to the G 703 and the rival you can
add up to 128 grams you can balance your
mouse just the way you want it with the
rival 600 because you can put it at
different areas and different spots to
balance it the way you want whereas on
the g7 about three they just have a 10
gram weight that goes towards the back
of the mouse and it kind of makes it a
little bit back heavy and
and can throw if your aim the true move
3 is set to have a one-to-one movement
so when you move it on the mousepad that
sensor is gonna show what you're doing
accurately on screen
sounds like marketing but I digress the
logitech sensor is great as well the 3
366 sensor I which I love it has no
acceleration or smoothing I did feel
like for flick shots the rival 600 was
better and for tracking I felt like the
G 703 was slightly better overall though
I think I am the best with the rival 600
there's just something about the sensor
that just feels a little bit different
it takes a little bit of getting used to
it's really hard to describe but it just
it just works now me personally I don't
really mess with the software too much
you can change the shortcuts and game
but usually I just do that all in game
I don't really change it in my actual
like software or anything like that you
can make the side buns and DPI buttons
do other things you can change to our GB
settings amongst other things in this
category I feel like they are pretty
much equal one more thing that I forgot
to add is I think I prefer the scroll
wheel on the rival 600 a little bit more
as well that texture it's just very very
nice the G 703 is just I don't know it's
just something about it I just don't
like alright guys so I have love to both
of these Mouse's but lately I've been
sticking to the rival 600 just for the
comfort alone I can game for hours and
not fatigue which is critical when you
want to keep your aim consistent
it has a great sensor great buttons the
bottom is a little bit funky but once
you get used to it and you adjust over
time it's great but not to say that the
G 703 is a bad Mouse because that Mouse
is amazing and when you hold it the
right way that sensor just it performs
so tomato tomahto you know these are
very very comparable Mouse's but I give
the slight edge to the rival 600 alright
guys so that is gonna be it for this
battle thank you guys for watching let
