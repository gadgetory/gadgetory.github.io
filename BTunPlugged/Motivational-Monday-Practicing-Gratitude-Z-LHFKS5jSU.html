with another motivational Monday today
we are going to be talking about
gratitude we can all look around our
room right now we're look around just in
our immediate surroundings and see
things that we can be grateful for in a
lot of times we kind of take the things
around us for Grandma like our bed or
our lighting or you know family photos
that you're just grateful for and
starting your morning off with five
things you're grateful for will then
lead to you looking for the good in the
rest of the day you're looking for the
good that's already in your life and
that means that there can be more coming
into your life more good that's coming
into your life just taking a second out
of our day to just appreciate the people
in our lives and the things they do for
us is a huge benefit because when we
interact with them it's going to come
off like that and people are gonna like
you more right you may you may get that
promotion you know to me you never know
but just being grateful for what you
have and realizing what you have is a
big step in being successful not only in
business or whatever your chosen field
is but also to and near your personal
life both of which are extremely
important so take care of both every
morning list five things that you're
grateful for maybe they can be your car
your bed and also to list five people
that you're grateful for and actually
feel it when you are listing off these
things feel the emotional connection
that you have with these people or
remember what you have with these people
so thank you guys for watching and I
will see you guys
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
