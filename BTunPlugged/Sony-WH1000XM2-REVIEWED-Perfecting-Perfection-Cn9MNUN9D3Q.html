world we can go later
Duda Steve it up
guys be back here again with another
review today we're gonna be taking a
look at the sony MDR 1000 X's mark -
that's right the second version of my
favorite headphones ever and what's
great about this is they've added in
some new features and they've also
brought down the price from 399 from the
last year's model to 350 for this model
so right off the bat I'm thinking man
you guys are doing it right you guys are
listening to us and the consumer and
knocking down these prices right off the
bat so how do these Bluetooth noise
cancellation headphones stand up are
they an upgrade over last year's version
are they worth your money let's find out
let's start this review right now guys
in the box
you're gonna find a case you're gonna
find an adapter for the plane you're
gonna find a 3.5 millimeter jack you're
also gonna find a USB charger to charge
to sleep all of which in my opinion feel
really good they feel all solid quality
all around moving on to the headphones
themselves I just these are probably the
best looking wireless bluetooth
headphones that I have ever seen they
just scream elegance I love the silver
accents with the black it's like a
gunmetal look I just love the look of
these headphones and then to add on to
that they add in these leather cups it
just feels so good really beautiful on
the inside and the out guys you have to
believe me when I say that now on the
left ear cup you're gonna find the
buttons you're gonna find the power
button you're gonna find the new NC
slash ambient noise button as well but
I'll get into that a little bit later
now on the right ear cup that's where
you control your music you can skip
forward you can skip backwards with just
a flick of your finger across and you
can also up the volume or down the
volume and this year I must say that it
is a lot more responsive the technology
has gotten a lot better it really is an
upgrade over last year's model I had a
lot of problems last year with the
marque ones just going back or forward I
would always kind of mess it up and it
was really hard for me so this year
really good job Sony on just upping
everything now you can also hold your
palm or
you're earcup your right ear cup and it
will oppose your music temporarily now
once you remove your hand it will then
continue to play your music you can also
pause the music by just tapping on the
ear cup as well but it's nice to just
have that feature where you can put your
hand over your ear and then take it off
whenever the announcements are done if
somebody's trying to talk to you on a
plane or at the gym this will be great
and it's very valuable I know why I had
my hand out that whole time alright so
now that we got that out of the way
these are a gorgeous pair of headphones
to come with great accessories let's
move on to the sounds out on these is
great guys I love these the bass they
have increased the bass a lot in the mid
they're just so warm vocals just come
out they pop out of these headphones the
drivers on these are just quality guys
all around the highs are also nice too
controlled everything is just I cannot
ask for a better sound profile from
these these even sounded really good
with the noise cancellation on and
that's saying a lot because a lot of
headphones when they have that noise
cancellation on you hear that hiss you
hear that background static and it just
messes up the whole experience with
these no not so much they stand up to
the noise cancellation now they've also
added in something called TS EE H X and
what this does is it takes your lossy
files your mp3 files and it bumps them
up to lossless files which is like FLAC
WAV files that have all the information
from the regular songs mp3s are great
because they save a lot of space but
this causes a drop in quality so what
sony has done is they've created an
algorithm that helps you get that sound
quality back so that is just incredible
that's something more stepping the game
up as they've done so these are gonna be
great for EDM rap of course they're also
gonna be great for do you guys know of a
genre called coffeehouse favorites and
coffeehouse music it's one of my
favorite Spotify playlist and I listened
to that a lot I'll link it down below
let me know if you guys have heard of
that kind of music or if you like it
yourself
I don't know that's just it just makes
me feel really warm inside and these
headphones really bring out the warmth
and the vocals and that comforting music
so if you guys like that folky Mumford &amp;amp;
Sons kind of music then these are great
let's move on to the noise cancellation
guys I just cannot say how impressed I
am with these headphones they're just
amazing they give you so many features
so many options to just try and do
whatever you want with these headphones
to have a mode where you just have
straight noise cancellation and on top
of that this year they added in on the
app that you can now optimize it so if
you hold down the noise cancellation
button for two seconds it will then take
in your environment it will take in the
pressure into consideration so if you're
on the plane it's gonna be different
than the noise cancellation you're gonna
get down here on earth when I use these
without the optimization I can still
hear myself snapping my fingers in my
ear once I then optimized it when I held
it out for two seconds to win through
all these tests I then tried to snap my
fingers again but do you know I cannot
hear the snapping of my fingers now this
is the first time in any noise
cancellation headphones that I have
experienced this I've always been able
to snap my fingers I know you guys have
as well because you guys have been
complaining in the comments that look
what I thought these are noise
cancellation it can't even knock out
these simple noises these will do that
so just wow wow wow wow I cannot this is
just ladies and gentlemen this is 2017
noise cancellation and Sony is bringing
it to us and I'm just I'm blown away
Wow so let's talk about the battery life
now they've upgraded it from 20 hours
from last year up into the 30s this year
so you're get 30 with noise cancellation
on about 38 I believe without the noise
cancellation on
so this is more than enough to get you
around the world and back now one area
where these aren't so great is as a
headset to talk to people people said
that I sounded like I was in a hallway
very echoey so the mic only is they
definitely if Sony if you're watching
this and I have a feeling that you do
watch these increase the mic for the
people that are using these for business
or at my job we sit in cubicles and
working at lab as well and people wear
these kind of headphones they also take
Skype calls with these headphones so it
would be great to have a mic that is up
to standard on these headphones
all right Sony can you do it we'll see
what the mark three all right so I want
to close this out by talking about the
app a little bit this thing is great
it's getting better and better with each
update they went from just having these
little arena settings and stuff like
that that I really didn't like and that
doesn't make much sense it just made
your sounds just made your music sound a
lot worse but now they've added in
profiles where you can customize your
sound experience and you guys know that
I'm all about that so in the profiles
they have on there actually work really
well as is but you can also customize it
yourself to kind of bring up the mids or
the base or the highs and it just brings
this headphone up another notch that
nobody's doing Bose isn't doing it I
haven't seen sin highs are doing a thing
like this so kudos to Sony for bringing
that jaybird element over into these
headphones they also let you control the
noise cancellation a lot more in this
app you can turn it up for the ambient
to let in how much you want to let in
whether that's voices you want to let in
or whether you want to let in a lot of
car noise or train noise or plane noise
whatever it is so they allow you to
adjust how much that you want in there
which is great and it actually works now
back when I demoed the QC 30s those had
a slider from Bose but they it didn't
work that well
what's the same all the way around so
now we have the Sony's that are actually
taking the slider into consideration so
when you do move it it does allow you to
tailor your experience so all in all I
just love these headphones to death
Sony thank you very much these are gonna
become my new daily drivers replacing
the old sony MDR 1000 X's now I know
here we are at the end of this review
and I know you guys I know you guys have
questions I know you guys have questions
still one big question is are they
better than the QC 35 well I'm gonna got
a limb here and say</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
