hurt your eyes like the past ones do
messing around with a few settings let
me know how you like this better I know
it's not as bride in the back so that's
a good thing anyways today I want to
talk about the four agreements by ruined
by Miguel RIA wreath today I want to
talk to you guys about the book The Four
Agreements by miguel ruiz and this book
is about like the agreements are the
beliefs that we have a buddy ourselves
that that'll hold us back from doing new
things in our life or just overall
living the life that we want to lead
today I just want to touch on the first
of the agreements i'll probably do well
i'm not probably i'm going to do a full
series on this all for so the first one
is to be impeccable with your word and
this means to not go against yourself
words what a word wise so i know we
always have those that inner judge the
inner critic that really gets on
ourselves when we don't do something
right like in this instance like maybe
dieting you know you get off track and
you know down comes a hammer like you're
bad you're this you're never going to
have the body that you want you're never
gonna succeed you might as well just
give up now like what are you doing all
the guilt and he says to do is stop
doing that i realize that you're doing
it they have this inner judge and to
kind of like nurture yourself so speak
well of yourself and you will see great
gains in your life let's put this embody
building terms you're going to see
greater gains in your life greater you
know the person that is going to be like
going against themselves it's going to
be fighting an uphill battle vs. the
person that kind of pushes and guys
himself up the hill you know so it's
like having an avalanche an avalanche
versus a ethical spider it also says not
to also speak like bad of other people
and you know we all like have criticisms
of other people and what they're doing
but really you know let's say you have
to he says when you have somebody hate
you in this case what happens let's say
you speak bad about them right and then
they start hating you your words are
hurting yourself because now you have
somebody that's going against you just
like you go against yourself now you're
creating all these things where people
are going to be going against you now so
if you speak well of other people well
of yourself well of you know your
neighbor whatever so you speak well of
your coworker right like your friend you
know then in turn your and get that love
back but if you are saying harsh words
to them then you're gonna have somebody
going against you and that's more and by
doing that you're creating this force
that's going against you so I hope that
makes sense but also to today like when
you catch yourself say huh I'm going
against myself let's do this instead
lets you know you can do it you can stay
on with that okay you messed up that's
okay
now what can we do what can we do to
change the situation and make it better
so come from that that mindset and we
will catch up with the idea number two
tomorrow but I do want to show you the
crockpot chicken that I made today's a
low carb day so we're going to have more
fats which means I'm gonna have avocados
today instead of broccoli and then I'm
gonna have some shredded chicken this is
the one that I made I'm gonna make a
full video i made a video last night on
this but it didn't show every step and I
feel like I want to show you guys each
and every step so you guys feel
comfortable doing on your own instead of
just the end product and how I meal prep
so that's coming this weekend one side
meal prep this again because I have
enough for the week so once that's done
i will post it pro hopefully next Sunday
night Monday morning for you guys so
hopefully you guys enjoy that gonna be
hitting back and bi's today so yeah I'm
gonna really enjoy this and then I'm
gonna have some BCA's with this my hydro
flask always always cold oh man almost
hot right now Wow just sitting in the
Sun it's hot out here right now anyways
I will catch up with you guys later as
always I love you guys and help you have
a great day peace all right so I'm home
now after my workout uh I figure I do a
full day of eating so here is my
post-workout shake it has two scoops of
evl protein and it has some ice and I
used two percent milk um I don't know
why would I have milk I I get shredded I
don't know why something about milk just
my body likes it at first you know
little gassy whatever but
I don't know if that's TMI but after a
while was my body starts getting used to
like my body I don't know I he'd cut off
milk so try it out I mean if almond milk
works for you I think I'm allergic to
almonds now so last time I had almond
butter i freakin my throat was closing
up so I think when I have almond milk I
think I get like my stomach starts to
hurt so switched over back to regular
milk and just to get a little bit more
calories in more protein has some carbs
but slow carb day so this is about as
much cars of us i'll have so yeah i will
show you my meal which i'll be having in
about an hour hour and a half which is
going to be some eggs I'll show you how
I cook my eggs yeah that's pretty much
it nothing special it's not rocket
science alright guys see you later
alright so I just finished my
30 days of yoga with Adriene been doing
these every day after my workouts and
just to cool down and I really want to
fix my posture and like issues with my
flat feet so i definitely recommend
going through all 30 days and kind of
sad that it's over but she has more
series and I'm gonna be checking out so
check out her channel you'll go with
Adrienne really a bittersweet that is
over but definitely check it out it's
amazing yeah and we're back alright so
right now I am in the midst and watch
them in Game of Thrones I'm in the mix
skillet my bell pepper the kind of
talking about like our people faster
okay eggs some have six days also I got
some Kirkland bacon so since I'm having
lower carbs today I'm gonna have more
fats deadly you see there so more
proteins fats say it with less or more
faculty less carbs or fast approaching
so having five pieces of bacon sick egg
I'm going to do 33 whole three white a
little bit more estimate yeah just to
get my proper calories
well temperature comes over here
when egg
yes
or
or takato yoga
and last
by the way
like the scrambled up in the pan out
it'll I
less dishes we
you know you don't have to use a plural
pretty
mix your eggs
let's clean up you know let's clean up
the better
the faster
alright
and also a face olive oil pair on the
road personally I don't salt my egg
I you should just use some salt very
nice thought they use a thick hot sauce
and bacon has a lot of salt as well so
you know I kind of try to pick and
choose my battles you know with me we
don't want to have salt in your eggs
salt on your bacon salt in your sauce
and then just going to bloated oaties
the purpose right
can fire off for burn myself
has a pan a little bit too hot
and get all this usually rather turn
down to about between medium and have
you get this crab right here we talked
did
there you have five pieces of bacon
out of that
and got three whole eggs three white
eggs
