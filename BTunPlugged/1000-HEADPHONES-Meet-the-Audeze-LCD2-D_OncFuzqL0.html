with another review today we are gonna
be taking a look at $1,000 headphones
say that with me $1,000 are they worth
it do we even need $1,000 headphones who
can benefit from having them and what do
they sound like I mean I think we all
want to know what do $1,000 headphones
sound so I will be the guinea pig for
you guys today and I'm gonna be testing
out some thousand dollar headphones are
they worth it can they replace my
hundred other headphones we shall see in
this review so the headphones that I'm
gonna be reviewing today are the LCD
twos by Audis hopefully I didn't butcher
their name it's a company they're based
in California I'm down with that so a
lot of the headphones that we see today
are dynamic headphones
whether it's beats Bose Sony they're all
gonna be dynamic headphones for the most
part I don't like to bore you guys with
a bunch of tech specs and all that but I
just want to give you guys a brief
overview of what it is that differs from
dynamic to planar and why the cost is so
much higher so in dynamic headphones
they have a coil with magnets that sends
an electric current to produce the music
in planar headphones they have magnets
but more of them in a flat sheet so
instead of a single little coil they
have a flat sheet so there's more
surface area for the sound to be
conducted through tiny wire flat sheet
so that is one of the main differences
and because of that the sheet needs more
magnets to power it so that's why these
LCD tubes are a lot heavier than you
would find in a dynamic headphone so now
that we've gotten that little
introduction out of the way let's get on
with the comfort and design now at first
like I mentioned the just a pure size
and the heaviness of the LCD tubes it
weighed heavily on
head but I got used to it after about a
day or two I'm used to the Sennheiser
598 and they're super light super plush
and lightweight and I just move them
around these on the other hand are like
giant bricks on your head not quite as
extreme but it feels like that when
comparing them they have these nice
leather cups which I love they were huge
gigantic it makes you feel like official
you know it makes you feel like you you
just bought this thousand dollar pair of
headphones because they're so huge and
they're so plush
it's like putting two pillows on top of
your head the band I do wish they put a
little bit more cushion on the top but
the band hasn't really bothered me
honestly it feels nice they have a
couple of cushioned off sections up here
which aren't so bad but a little bit
more why not I never heard any button on
both sides you have these adjusters
which I really love they're metal they
have these little ridges that keep them
in place I've never encountered
headphones like this before so that's
definitely a change and I like it it
feels very very premium now I picked up
the aluminum one so they have this nice
aluminum casing around the ear cups
which I really like all I know the
comfort is great on these I love them I
love them a lot it takes some getting
used to
don't get me wrong but after you get
used to them it's just another day
putting them on one thing I will say is
when you do put them on you can't really
move it to the back because this part
really like it really clamps down on
your head so just be aware that if you
are a person that likes to do that a lot
like go like this no this is like you're
either wearing them or you're not so now
let's talk about the sound one of the
most important parts of any headphone
these did not disappoint I will just
start off by saying that but I want to
tell you guys in my experience now when
I first put them on I noticed one thing
I noticed that they didn't have as much
soundstage as my dynamic headphones it
has some soundstage but just not as wide
there's a lot of separation there's a
lot of clarity which I love but it's not
as
as let's say a even my 598 $100
headphones they're not as wide but with
the sound quality increase you get with
these I'm willing to take that cut now
let's talk about everybody's favorite
subject base now I'm not gonna tell you
guys I'm not gonna stay here and tell
you guys that these are gonna be
rumbling off your head and that they're
just gonna be thumping they're not
they're open-back headphones so they're
gonna be a little bit weak on the base
but with that being said these are the
best sounding base open-back headphones
that I've ever tried it's very accurate
I would say if you're a person that just
enjoys clarity separation it's all there
it just sounds great that's the best way
to explain it it's very accurate it's
very fast there's no Distortion one
thing Planner headphones are known for
is since they have that sheet and since
it's so fast add conducting the sound
it's not gonna get all that distortion
when those highs get so high when the
bass gets so low it's going to stay nice
and tight and accurate and fast that's
what I mean by that the vocals I feel
like are the main star of these
headphones and guys it just from j.cole
to opera to Frank Sinatra listen to it
all and these sounded great even the
fray do you guys like the fray I love
the fray where there's rap rock
classical I was listening to Christmas
music because it's that time of year and
it handled everything great it's just
very accurate that's the best way to
describe it there's no extra fluff like
the base of beads or anything like that
it's not artificial like some of the
Sony's can be it's just very nice and
tight the highs are great these are the
first headphones where I haven't
experienced any kind of distortion at
the high end it is insanely good overall
if you're a bass head if you really
really need that artificial bass if you
need that bass boost you gotta look
somewhere else but if you want something
that's gonna sound accurate and
something
that's gonna be gonna sound like the
music is supposed to sound damn that's
exactly what it is it's gonna sound
exactly at how it's supposed to sound so
lastly I just want to quickly go over
the accessories that came with just
because I feel like it's a nice touch
for that thousand dollar price tag so it
comes with a very very nice cable which
plugs into the underside of both ear
cups and it plugs in and it allows for
it not to be ripped out you have to
press the buttons on either side for it
to come out which is really nice I like
that touch and also too it also comes
with a nice case a nice hard shell case
and you know me I love when companies
help you protect your investment and
these are definitely a big investment so
you're gonna need to amplifier for to
not distort so and to get the most
volume the most clarity out of these
headphones because something like an
iPhone that while they still sound great
you're gonna need something to power it
to get it up to levels that you want
whereas a dynamic headphone they're very
easy to drive you can plug them straight
into your iPhone and just be done with
it so there's kind of one more thing in
the way of you getting to your music but
hey if you're a music lover you do what
you got to do to get some good music
right so are these worth a thousand
dollars I'm gonna tell you guys and I'm
not gonna tell you guys oh wait
well it depends on who you are what
you're gonna be using them for do I
Brandon think these are worth a thousand
dollars plain and simple yes I do if you
have the money if you have the extra
cash you know April's coming up tax
returns are coming up and you just want
some amazing sound and you have
everything taken care of you have your
responsibilities taken care of go out
and treat yourself to a great listening
experience and you know what these are
gonna last you for a long time this is
it that's all you have to do you won you
won the headphone game just invest in a
great pair of headphones for home
listening you can watch it movies you
can play games whatever you want to do
with your headphones it's really up to
you
but I can't say that I am glad that I
took the plunge it was long overdue for
me so now I see what the hardcore audio
files are talking about when they say
you need a thousand dollar pair of
headphones there's plenty of great
sounding headphones I'd love the HD 5
9/8 those are a great entry-level
open-back headphones that i really
recommend there's just so many
headphones out there you guys be the
judge but that's my opinion on these and
I hope you guys have enjoyed this review

Oddie's and these LCD 2 headphones so
