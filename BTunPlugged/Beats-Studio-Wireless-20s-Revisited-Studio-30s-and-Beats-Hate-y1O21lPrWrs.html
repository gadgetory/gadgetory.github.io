what is up guys is BT back here again
bringing you guys another hype video
this time we're gonna be looking at the
studio 2.0 they have to be coming out
soon with the studio 3.0 so I thought
this will be a great time to make a new
video getting hyped for the studio
threes it also gives some of your guys's
input from the subs from the viewers
about what you guys think should be in
these next pairs of headphones so my
question is what does beats have to do
to get back into your good graces what
do they have to do to win you back as a
customer to win back the reputation as
an overpriced not worth it headphone
tell me what features you need to see
and also what features you think they
should be adding into the studio threes
now I'm gonna give you guys a little
overview of what I liked about the
studio twos because I've had them for
over a year and they've held up really
nicely for me and what I think they can
do better with the studio threes now I
feel like when it comes to the comfort
and design I was very happy with these
over the past year and a half they've
held up very nicely I know a lot of
people they have ripped cups and all
that the leathers rib that come off the
ear cuffs will come off I've had none of
that happened and I've used these day in
and day out at the gym putting these
through their paces and and I don't know
I don't know if it's just the way I
stored it or whatever whatnot but these
have held up very nicely now one thing I
think that they should keep in is the
color scheme right the color schemes I'm
not so much for the neon greens and all
that I just like black silver white
headphones basic headphones I think
that'll bring a lot more people over to
them on these headphones I feel like the
hinges need fixing they're very wobbly
they're very they feel unstable also to
the headband part right here it has a
little bit for me stretching it out just
to put it over my head it has a little
dip so things like that little touches
that they need to increase the quality
on especially for a $400 priced and
while we're on price tag I really hope
that they keep
around 400 or less which is about the
standard for these kind of headphones
noise-cancelling wireless over ear
headphones so what I liked about these
over the past year is and why I kept
coming back to them is because they are
so low profile so what I'm doing
shoulder press or what I'm doing
pull-ups you know overhead movements
it's staying out of the way whereas some
headphones they're very there stick out
a lot so you're gonna knock them Ino the
sony 108 ears I had those for a while I
tried to bet the gym and they would just
knock all over the place so I really
liked that they had a nice slim profile
for these and they're very light they
stayed off my head doing Crossfit type
stuff you know circuits they stayed in
place and they didn't get too hot you
can improve the materials a little bit
maybe go with some leather up here to
make us feel a little bit better about
the for another price tag and we're good
to go in my opinion with the build
quality keep the plastic because you
know what it does make the headphone a
little bit lighter you don't want some
heavy wireless headphone where you're
gonna wear it and you're moving around
and it's gonna fall off
Beats is really known for having their
bass just be so thumping and kind of
overtaking the midst of vocals and the
highs and kind of losing some of that
clarity because they had so much bass so
what I'm hoping that Apple does and what
they've been doing with most of the
Beats products is they've been lowering
the volume so the max volume is lowered
and then after that on top of that
they've also cleaned up the bass a lot
so it's a lot more clearer there's a lot
more clarity with these it makes it feel
like a $400 $300 headphones with the
solo threes so I'm hoping that they
really clean up the sound and make these
good you know not not just clean it up
but also improve improve the the mids
improve the bass clean it up we want the
bass but just give it to us with some
clarity that's all we ask so the battery
life on the studio twos has been great
for me it lasts me a
week a whole week at the gym 25 hours
and these really live up to the hype and
I've been very satisfied these were the
first headphones that I've ever tried
Wireless that really lived up to the the
battery life I didn't have to worry
about it with you so much and it charges
very quickly as well now I know they're
probably gonna add in the w1 chip and
that's even gonna make it faster they're
gonna add more battery life so these
right now I think are about 25 hours and
I think they're gonna raise it to about
maybe 3540 we'll see what happens now
for the biggest biggest biggest problem
I have with these headphones it is the
noise cancellation I really feel like
it's a crime for them to put that on
their box it's insane that they would
put active noise-cancelling on the box
for these headphones all they do with
these headphones is play some static
Overeem music which you're losing
clarity so they really need to redesign
the active noise cancellation i mean we
have sony putting out incredible
products we have Sennheiser putting out
incredible noise cancel we have Bose the
King we all know and love they are
putting out great headphones so why do
we need to get the beats they need to
make it so the active noise cancellation
can catch up to 2017 and what everybody
else is doing with all not just having
noise cancellation but having all these
different features where we can def
tailor our active noise cancellation to
certain situations instead of just
playing some static so one thing I
really enjoyed about this headphone
before I go I really really liked how
they did the controls now they did the
volume rocker on the actual headphone
and then the Beast logo is a press play
pause answer calls it just blends into
the headphone III I was confused when I
first got these like where is the
controls and I had to press around in
that I clicked on the B and I was like
oh
is really cool so hopefully they keep
that kind of design in the next
iteration of this headphones which I
think they will which I think they will
if they smart they alright guys so
that's been my time I hope you guys have
enjoyed this height video again guys let
me know down in the comments below what
you guys thought about these headphones
the studio twos if you have them let me
know your experience with them and also
to what are you looking forward to with
the studio 3.0 do you think they can
compete with the bows and the the Sony's
and the Sennheiser when they come out
we'll see hopefully they don't raise the
price so don't forget to drop me a like
if you enjoyed this video and for more
content like this and also to sub if you
really really enjoyed this really
thank you guys so much for your time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
