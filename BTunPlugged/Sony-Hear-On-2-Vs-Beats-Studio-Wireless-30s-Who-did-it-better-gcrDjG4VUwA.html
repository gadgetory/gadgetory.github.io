with another battle today we are going
to be taking a look at a battle between
two of the newest over-ear wireless
headphones on the market the sony 8
years or hears on twos coming in at $300
and the Beats Studio 3 is coming in at
$350
I know it's the holidays and both of
these headphones will probably be on
your radar so today I'll be going over
some of the subtle differences between
the two headphones or the full reviews
on these headphones check out my reviews
down in the description below
alright so let's kick this thing off
with the comfort and design the faux
leather on the beats feels more like
leather they also have a little bit of
padding on the inside of the ear Cup
which will protect the drivers from
sweat and wear and tear the Sony's feel
just as nice but on the inside I'm a
little suspect of that sheer little
sheet that they put over there to
protect from sweat and wear and tear I
think the B Studio 3s will last longer
in this regard the beats are also
lighter and more compact which I like
that being said the Sony's do feel a
little bit more sturdier overall and the
hinges feel like they could survive a
small bombing as for the controls the
beats use two buttons one button that
pause plays and answers calls and skip
songs and a power button the Sony's use
a touch control system which works
flawlessly I never have a miss press or
anything like that
swiping up and down adjust the volume
left to right skips forwards and back a
track and tapping plays or pause a song
you can also get control of your noise
cancellation on your right ear cup as
well I appreciate the beats for their
low profile and leather but I feel like
your money would be safer with the
sturdier product and combined with the
amazing touch controls I have to give
this round to the Sony's so let's move
on to the sound the sound is one of
those dividing topics everybody has a
different taste and listens to different
music one of the main things you guys
may be looking for I suspect is bass
everybody loves bass Apple has really
changed the beats signature sound
a sub-base - more of an upper base which
could be good or bad depending on what
kind musically listen to upper base is
faster it comes and goes whereas
sub-base lingers a little bit more after
the initial sound has passed Sony has
more of that classic sub bass that we
can fill in our bones sony also uses an
app which the beats don't that lets you
configure your sound to make them to
your liking this makes them a more safer
pick and more versatile overall this
year studios are actually gonna be good
for rock and classical as opposed to the
common rap and hip-hop like before the
her2 s on the other hand let's be honest
they sound great with everything I feel
like they're best with like rap and
anything with vocals in it they handle
it flawlessly Sony also has their HS ee
technology which bumps lower quality
music up to near lossless quality so you
get that added in there and due to their
versatility I have to give this route of
the Sony's noise cancellation beats say
that they have anc active noise
cancellation but I feel like it's more
of a passive noise cancellation combined
with the tighter seal of their ear cups
Sony's act more like active noise
cancellation reacting to your sounds in
your environment and cancelling them out
without that added pressure of the seal
of the ear cups you can also gain more
control with the Sony's where you can
just adjust what sounds you want to hear
switching from different ambient modes
which lets you cut out when or unless
you cut out city noise and things like
that
due to Sony's actually having the active
noise cancellation I have to give the
noise cancellation route to Sony's Apple
what are you doing you guys can make
better noise cancellation than this you
guys should be way beyond bows at this
point but it's just not there okay for
battery life the Sony's are packing 28
hours of battery life with roughly 30
without noise cancellation on the beats
are coming in at 22 hours with noise
cancellation on and a whopping 40 hours
without 10 minutes of quick charge with
the Sony's will give you 65 minutes of
playback and 10 minutes of charging with
the beats will give you 3 hours holy
so this round I have to give the edge to
beats 22 hours is plenty but that quick
charge sometimes makes all the
difference when you're in a jam and you
need battery fast Toronto on the devil
yeah you need it I experienced no
dropouts with either the Sony's have the
NFC for quick connection with Android
and the beats have the w1 chip that
automatically connects to iPhones in the
area both work great so the connectivity
is really a tie for me so for some of
you guys that are gonna be using these
for Kohl's Sony call quality is nothing
to run home about but it does a better
job of not picking up outside noises
while you're on a phone as opposed to
the beats so this round has to go to the
Sony's as well so in conclusion the Sony
here on tubes aren't my favorite over
ear wireless headphones at the moment
for nothing and for this year great
sound great app that just keeps getting
better with updates and world-class
active noise cancellation oh and build
quality is extremely good the beats are
solid but they aren't gonna be for
everybody the build seems to be improved
but I'm still a little bit suspect
because my beats studio 2 is actually
broke after a year so I still kind of
have a bad taste in my mouth about that
I feel like your money will be just a
little bit safer with Sony the beats
have their good looks but it feels like
they've stripped away
what made beats beats hopefully with the
studio force they can fix this and add
that sub bass back-end that we all love
and that we're all looking for well most
of us alright guys so thank you guys for
watching let me know if you guys have
any more comments or questions down

appreciate it and I ain't really enjoy

me know down in the comments below what
the battle you actually want to see next
