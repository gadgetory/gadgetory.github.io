64 foot buttons and with the infrared
accessory your flicks will be able to
control almost anything
we're so proud to finally show you the
flick up it's ready for production but
we need your support once again to make
it a reality
join us on our mission to make great
technology simple
it looks like a smiley it's white
designed to be very stylistic and
designed to kind of melt into your home
so that it doesn't take any place at all
Swedish design now you can control
hundreds of thousands of noises
it might even flush your toilet for you
stage volume is always a consideration
and if you have a sound man especially a
good sound man they're going to want as
little stage volume as possible they
don't want any speakers I wish you could
feel this stages now and musicians are
going to the in-ear monitors no bass
player that I know odd likes to play
without a large speaker behind that you
can feel whoo for me able to get the
sensation of filling the bass without
turning up the volume I need something
that would vibrate while I move around
the stage the whole body is vibrating
who's coming up with that finally
finally finally we have a solution it's
called the backbeat hi I'm your Co
Sepulveda creator of the backbeat the
backbeat is a portable rumble pack that
attaches to your strap and plugs into
your bass and transmits everything you
play on your bass into a vibration that
you can feel the back beats about the
size of an iPhone 10 and has an internal
rechargeable lithium-ion battery with a
quarter-inch connection that you can
easily plug into your direct box or
Wireless pack the backbeat has two
control knobs the left allows you to
adjust the intensity of the rumble the
right knob is a volume control for my
favorite feature the included headphone
jack maybe you live in an apartment or
you're in a hotel room and you want to
practice but you don't want to keep
anyone awake you put this thing in
problem solved
that's cool we're totally use it for
practicing no amp it's nice as a result
I'm proud to say what I'm holding in my
hand is the pre-production model of Back
Bay ready to go if the Kickstarter this
is the new thing from your coke the back
beat everybody needs one actually you
might be - so that's it
Bank B you'll be inspired to play on
stage all practice because you can feel
your face
this is great the back beat alright so
that means you're gonna have to move he
agrees yeah I told you I shouldn't touch
that thing
the thing has a life of its own
we use technology to improve lives let's
take a minute to explain how this is the
toothbrush that uses light therapy to
give you the best possible oral health
traditional tooth brushing is primitive
and not effective if you think about it
we essentially move bacteria around in
our mouth hoping to spit it out
afterwards if you look at innovation in
other industries you'll see a drastic
change for example in skincare light is
commonly used to promote skin health and
kill bacteria given that oil bacteria is
related to 90% of systemic diseases we
want to bring this light therapy to your
toothbrush and routine use a safe and
natural blue light which is proven to
kill bacteria that causes gingivitis and
other gum diseases the same blue light
is also proven to whiten teeth over time
rather than a one-time teeth whitener
bristle breaks down color day by day for
long-term white natural red light is
known for healing anti-aging and
collagen promotion light therapy - your
brushing routine it's a fun way to have
the best possible gum health
purple light combines the benefits of
both blue and red this patent pending
dual light technology strives to give
you the best possible oral health in the
convenience of your home here's some
features Bristol has - vibration modes
regular and gentle so you can choose
which is most comfortable for you the
brush also automatically turns off after
2 minutes so you know you're brushing
for the right amount of time you'll also
never have to worry about buying a
replacement head because you can sign up

been automatically sent to your door all
