senior product manager at Corbin today
I'm very excited to introduce to you our
new product the core oven model - two
years ago we introduced the core oven
1000 wine system which we have Ellucian
eyes the way people enjoy their wine the
benefits of the core of in 1,000 were
ones that no one had experienced before
we took an age-old tradition drinking
wine and totally change the way people
experience it since we introduced the
core of in 1,000
we've been carefully observing the
product in action we visited customers
we've talked to wine industry experts
we've also attended many events watching
how people use the product learning
about it and talking to them about their
experiences and the course along the way
we've shared many great glasses of wine
today people love Corvin because it
allows them to enjoy their wine without
pulling the cork for some people it
means drinking across many different
bottles of wine and one evening for
others it means tasting a bottle as a
staging we are proud that Corbin has
changed the way people experience their
wine all over the world
and we've now designed the model 2
because we saw the opportunity to make
that experience even better let me talk
with you about some of the innovations
in the model first we continue to use
proven Corvin technology that allows you
to access pour and enjoy your wine while
keeping it safe from oxidation you
simply insert the thin hollow needle
through the cork pressurize your bottle
and pour glass next we have introduced
the capsule cup load cell technology
this technology ensures a tight seal
every time between the products and the
gas capsules that's inside the new
proper fit clamp is easier to squeeze
open and close while providing a secure
fold on the bottle there's more area and
a larger grip surface to allow your
hands to open and close the clamp we
have redesigned the needle as well which
allows wine to pour 20% faster the
needle also locks into place which
prevents leaks with the core of and
model 2 we've combined state-of-the-art
engineering with a more user focused
design I invite you to try the core of
and model 2 for yourself I believe that
will change your experience with wine
