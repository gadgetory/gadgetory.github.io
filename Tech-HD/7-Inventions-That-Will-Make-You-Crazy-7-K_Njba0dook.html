and medical purposes I wonder could I
put this technology to better use I
wanted something that would benefit
every single one of us shaving was the
obvious officer the industry has been
looking for a laser shader for home use
but discovering a viable technology has
eluded everyone until now wavelengths of
light have been discovered the cut
through dark hair but not liked or gray
hair we wanted a laser that could cut
all hair many prototypes were built and
after years of experimentation we had
fun exactly what we were looking for we
identified molecules in the hair that
absorb a particular wavelength these are
called chromophore this chroma forests
are the only continuous structure in the
hair their shared by every human
regardless of age gender and portrays
the scalp razor is for everyone to use
and it works great on any area this is
how it works a traditional razor cuts
the hair shaft at an angle this is what
causes your skin to fill Rupp when the
scar breeze that makes contact the laser
melts to the hair shaft completely
leveled to the surface of the skin this
leaves a smoother softer finish the last
longer to the touch we really need your
support but the scarp razor into
production we have preliminary
agreements with manufacturers we require
capital to forget orders we've spent
many years developing this razor because
we believe after 5,000 years of using
the same technology it's time to make
shaving easier safer and greener help us
bring shave it into the 21st century
you
the problem is with youth how people use
the product sixty-five percent of Brits
admit to over filling their cattle when
they only need one cup of tea
all of this extra water that's being
boiled requires energy and it's been
calculated that in one day of extra
energy use from boiling kettles is
enough to light all of the streetlights
in England for a night
you
working smarter
more information giving more information
we patented the technology to print a
USB Drive on regular paper and now we've
applied that technology to a business
card so how does swivel card work each
card has a unique ID and can be
individually programmed you can set up
each card open any web page you want and
you can change which page the card
points to even after giving it out since
the data is stored on the web you have
virtually unlimited storage and can do
some pretty exciting things you could
connect a card to a Dropbox account or
to a join me meeting invitation or to a
desktop sharing application the
possibilities are only limited by your
imagination servo card also includes a
back-end interface with very helpful
analytics about your cards you'll be
able to log in and see where your cards
are in the world and other helpful
statistical information right down to
the individual card there's also a QR
code on the back to ensure that if
someone doesn't have a USB port they can
still access the card with their smart
device
oh yeah one more thing did we mention
that Silva card is Wireless just bring
your civil card close to a compatible
smart device and the data will load
automatically working smarter having
more information giving more information
help us make swivel card happen thank
you for your enthusiasm and support
I have always been fascinated by
photography and I own you know expensive
DSLR cameras and lots of expensive
lenses you know even though I had all
this gear which would take phenomenon
pictures I found myself taking more and
more pictures with my cell phone because
it was there with me all the time that's
when it occurred to me that if he can
make a camera which has the same quality
and features as a DSLR camera but it is
in a form factor that can fit in my
pocket and stay with me all the time
that I'd be taking much better pictures
all the time what we are trying to do
here now is to capitalize on all of the
innovation that has resulted in very
inexpensive camera modules and
inexpensive high-quality lenses we're
trying to replace a big lens with
multiple small lenses and small sensors
one of the things we do to keep our
cameras very thin is something called
folded optics you have an aperture light
comes in through the aperture strikes a
mirror and then travels down the barrel
of lenses laid horizontally in the body
we are actually using 16 different
camera modules at three different focal
lengths the users can then simply pinch
and zoom the picture and depending upon
what field of view they finally end up
selecting 10 of this 16 modules of fire
and take pictures and then we use
sophisticated computational imaging
algorithms to combine those ten pictures
to basically create one really high
quality picture our software can figure
out how to set the exposures differently
for different cameras to get great
low-light performance the other
incredible thing we offer is really
infinite depth of field control
everything's kind of in focus when they
compose it but I know I'm taking a
picture of you and it's a portrait and I
want a nice blur in the background I can
go set that after the fact this isn't
just moonshot thinking we put some of
the best talent in Silicon Valley
together here at light our computational
imaging team in our Hardware team have
been working for over two years to bring
this to reality now we partnered with
the world's leading contract
manufacturers to actually deliver
product to consumers why I'm really
excited about this camera is that it
puts the focus back on create
photography not just a technology really
the power of photography is the ability
to capture the magic of every moment in
every day and you have to have something
that's portable enough and high enough
quality so that you really are capturing
the emotion of the moment not just the
facts that's what we're excited about
delivering to the market
you

what's that it's puzzle cool
