we'll simply hold up your socks it's
times like these you need adventure tape
we spent the last three years developing
and perfecting adventure tape and it's
got some amazing properties
which means that you can replace all of
this stuff
with adventure tape it's so strong and
stretchy you can do this with it because
adventure tape is self tacky it doesn't
slip meaning you can fasten it with a
simple tug and because there's no
adhesive it will leave no gluey residue
on your kit will rip apart your bubble
wrap unlike regular packing tape
adventure tape is also highly abrasion
and cut resistant meaning you can use it
to stop wear or damage to your precious
items or equipment it's completely
waterproof so you can use it to fix
leaks and in fact if it gets dusty or
dirty just wash it off under the tap or
in a string adventure tape has hundreds
of uses and outdoor activities and
adventures as well as in sports
weekend's away or to help you out with
day-to-day fixes we know adversity is an
amazing product among which once you've
used it you wonder how you live without
it so please support our Kickstarter
campaign and make adventure tape a
reality
the Apple world
getting bigger and the list of
must-haves Apple gadgets keeps getting
longer the problem is there's no easy
way to store all the essentials that
keep our devices powered and fully
functional getting the right charger out
of a stuffed backpack can be frustrating
and when it comes to headphones and
cables well we all know they come out of
tangled massive meat bento stack the
perfect companion to keep all your
must-haves Apple components neat and
organized on the road and on your
workspace inspired by the minimalistic
design of the modern Japanese lunch box
the bento stack is a multi compartment
container that has been smartly
engineered to efficiently hold all your
Apple charging cables power bricks
headphones and even the Apple pencil
let's take a look at how bento stack
works the bottom storage compartment is
optimized to hold larger accessories
like power bricks and wild chargers
adjustable dividers can be inserted to
keep each item stable in its own
customizable space a form-fitting lid
keeps everything secure and also doubles
as an Apple watch band holder stacked on
top is a second storage compartment told
you smaller accessories such as
earphones and various charging cables
additional dividers again can be
inserted keep cords and wires in their
own dedicated space to prevent tangling
the lid for this compartment serves as
your dedicated Apple pencil holder and
doubles as a convenient desktop stand
for your iPhone all compartments tax CMC
together creating a minimal design
aesthetic that has come to be expected
by the Apple consumer in addition to
being stackable and adjustable the bento
stack is also modular to travel
ultralight simply place what you need in
just one of the compartments select the
lid of your choice and create your own
mini bento so if you are an Apple
enthusiast like we are and don't like
the cheaply made mesh line cases on the
market today or prefer not to overspend
on leather accessory bags or travel
backpacks we have the perfect solution
for you this is our first IndieGoGo
campaign and we are looking for your
help to bring bento stack to the world
we funded the tooling ourselves and now
just need your help to purchase the
materials and pay for the first
production run so help keep your work
space neat and your travel organized all
with this one-of-a-kind truly
captivating case that is sure to strike
up a conversation or two along the way
