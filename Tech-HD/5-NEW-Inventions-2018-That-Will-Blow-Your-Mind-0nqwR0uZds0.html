overpriced watch at a shop is done in
2012 everyone laughed
including family how could you build a
quality Swiss watch when the big boys
control everything
could you really make a quality and
accessible watch while cutting out the
normal distribution channels that have
been in place for decades after three
highly successful Kickstarter campaigns
and over 7,000 Swiss timepiece of soul
the answer is absolutely yes but we
didn't stop here we have been listening
to our fans and working around the clock
to come up with the next generation of
live watches
that is why I'm here in Switzerland the
home of precision to meet with some
incredible Swiss crafters who help bring
our killer ideas to life
it all starts here the movement is the
beating heart every movement consists of
hundreds of parts that are carefully
crafted assembled by a master watch
maker with years of experience using
techniques that have been handed down
from generations of Swiss serologist
when it all comes together to work in
harmony precision time is born
now it's time that the movement and case
meet each other
rapping the movement into our fantastic
designs is a critical and fascinating
stage the movement gets it's
multi-layered dial and beautiful shaped
hands
finding its new home in a meticulously
crafted case where it will live for many
years to come
traveling to your world full of
adventure
the end result is truly amazing
we have come up with four new fantastic
limited edition models and here they are
starting with the analogue alarm
featuring a double date window and a
small secondhand
up next the ceramic divers it's an
automatic with a rotating ceramic bezel
and is water-resistant to 1,000 feet
usual Minova multi-layered dial and a
date magnifier moving on is the 46
millimeter corner graph Auto based on
our classic GX 1 this watch features a
25 Drule automatic chrono movement with
a reconfigured multi-layer dial and a
large LUMO Nova indexes and last but not
least the chrono pilot a day date
automatic chronograph with a clean open
dial applied p-51 Mustang and a ceramic
rotating bezel that will be available in
high grade titanium to ensure your live
watch looks killer on your wrist we use
a custom silicone strap that is double
injected making it soft and durable and
for our leather straps we have scoured
for some of the finest Italian and
French leather skins while teaming up
with the world's most skilled strap
builders for a result that is simply
outstanding
of course all of our timepieces come
with a high-quality anti-reflective
sapphire crystal as well as a sapphire
skeleton on our automatics showcasing
the beauty within and each live.watch is
backed by our five-year international
warranty we are building fans not
customers so come and be part of a
passionate brand that is disrupting the
status quo every single day please back
our project and help us get these
amazing watches onto your wrist
how to be twice as smart focus is
something that every one of our stars
most of us don't do as well as we could
we spend a third of our lives focusing
at work how well we do depends on it
yet we neglect it knowing that we focus
is good but it's not enough we need to
begin to understand how our mind can
work better nobody is even thinking of
using the most powerful part of our mind
our subconscious with foci we want to
change that for guys our biometric
wearable for fracture subconscious and
helps you tune into deep focus clipped
your waist
the biometry captures your polluted
state it's a stream of colored orbs
inspired by pixels inside out to help
you visualize your mind but I understand
yourself better this biometrics powers
the AI language closest thing to a real
coach it picks out mistakes you made and
provides real-time advice to optimize
your mental performance you will not
only know exactly when you lose focus
but also access techniques with
easy-to-follow steps to make focus your
second nature we want foci to help you
get into what psychologists call flow a
state of deep focus where your
subconscious empowers you to process
information better
focus based on two daggers us Burton
research which established how breathing
patterns mirrors of quanta state we have
beautiful smooth device that you can
clip to the ways to track your breathing
while you work with machine learning
vocalist your breathing characteristics
and derived personal insight a wrong
time to lose your focus
over the last few months we work with
Cambridge enterprise on the project we
are protested with student tests which
routinely
the results are very positive now we
want to share this powerful technology
with everyone we want the Kickstarter
community to help us shape what we are
building as we build it with your
support we can together help people
better understand themselves and tap
into their potential
here we go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
