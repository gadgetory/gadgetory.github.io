here's a standard weapon the alternative
within seconds is easily mounted to the
top of the weapon
there is no obstruction to the sight
picture for the operator and there's no
obstruction to the functionality of the
weapon or the rail system it still
allows an officer the ability to attach
a flashlight on their weapons once the
weapon is fired the bullet travels down
the barrel embedding itself inside the
alloy projectile with no chance of
escaping instantly becoming one solid
unit the projectile immediately
separates from the weapon as the docking
unit is instantly ejected then a new
bullet is cycled in for follow-up shots
if necessary the alternative is as
accurate as the operator using it once
the projectile impacts the threat it
will send a shock wave of pain to the
suspect without the internal damage that
a penetrating Bullock would cause and
now here's a simulation of police
training and when to utilize the
alternative shove it grab it was legal
let's ladle
Oh
being a gun owner is not just buying a
gun you must always be prepared have to
be trained you are your gun free when
it's not on you you want to know it's
secure and accessible safes are not
always accessible or easy to open
especially in the dark and lots are
inducements to operate as for smart guns
smart guns are a dangerous concept
taking an unreliable technology and
embedding it into your gun is not a
smart decision our mission is to bring
you the perfect solution introducing
zorak the new generation of guns going
nor exit caliber specific it has two
modes the first mode is awareness if
someone tries to tamper with your gun
you're immediately alerted and when you
need your gun charging it will eject
sorex
and chamber a fresh round the second
mode is when your gun is locked when
Zoar is locked
no one can charge your gun if someone
tries to charge your gun the locking
mechanism will immediately expand
preventing the guns from being loaded
special polymers in the locking
mechanism prevent any damage to the
barrel
szura's developed a revolutionary
unlocking mechanism rapid dial rapid
dial is a simple mechanism which counts
clicks while you turn it you don't need
to start from a specific point even the
direction that you turn the lock doesn't
matter these two factors allow you to
unlock your weapon without looking at it
even in the dark you can choose a simple
code or any length code you wish you
won't believe how fast and simple it is
until you try it you can also open zorax
from your phone but you can only lock it
by physically pressing the lock button
zorax normally communicates with your
phone directly through bluetooth it also
comes with a zorb bridge a Bluetooth 2
Wi-Fi router when plugged into the wall
near your gun you'll be made aware from
anywhere in the world if your gun is
being tampered with now if your home is
your safe and you don't lock your gun
but you still want alerts we have a
solution
Raziel watchdog the door watchdog is not
a lock but rather a notification device
its sole purpose is to notify you if
your weapon is tampered with
zorax was assented by veterans of elite
IDF technological in combat unit who
worked on it for two years reading into
the section suresh allows you to be
ready aware and safe more than ever
before
join the zuhr revolution own your gun
hi my name is Kirk Kjellberg and I'm the
inventor of the ideal concealed pistol
also known as the cellphone pistol and
that's because it takes the shape of an
ordinary smartphone and allows a pistol
to hide in plain sight
the mission and ideal conceal was to
make a pistol that could be carried the
same as a traditional smartphone this
would be the ideal conceal in its
holster basically to use it you open it
depress the safety puts the handle will
deploy and then it's actually ready to
be used to reload it or load it you
simply open it that way place two
shelves in there
pulls it latch it is this you've gun
also has hard sights on it which some of
the other very small pistols did not
have we wanted to have people have a way
to cite it in the future this area here
will be able to carry a small laser so
we're doing all the things that are
necessary to make a really great pistol
but also to conceal it very easily you
should invest an ideal conceal because
it will essentially help to get this
product out on a worldwide basis very
quickly and our goal here is to help
people protect themselves so we invented
the ideal concealed pistol so that you
can carry a pistol for self-defense and
not have to have it be difficult on you
ideal conceal carry the revolution
