programmer any engineer any designer
will tell you that if you want to do
your job productively if you want to do
it well you need at least two monitors
you need one to write the code and you
need another to check the graphical user
interface changes that are made back in
the old days we had desktops to do this
which were great but you needed to add
an extra graphic card to add another
monitor to it but for us luckily laptops
came along soon after and made
everything a lot more convenient laptops
are great they allow you the flexibility
to work from home hotels restaurants and
friends houses so all of a sudden with
laptops everything got a lot easier and
more convenient for everybody but for
people like us who still need more than
one monitor it wasn't that simple you
can't take a monitor into a coffee shop
a it'd be weird be it totally defeats
the purpose of the ease and convenience
of a laptop so what we do we came up
with expand de expand expands your
laptop's display real estate
expand de is a secondary monitor for
laptops that slips on and doubles as
protection it runs efficiently through
only your USB port that's right no extra
power cables to deal with it keeps you
portable while greatly increasing your
productivity expander only needs one USB
port for both video and power it offsets
the very low consumption of the LED
panel with photovoltaic solar panels on
its backside these panels provide a
trickle that will continue charging your
laptop even when it's not in use on the
macbook model expander will add two
extra USB ports allowing for charging
and other peripherals while you're using
expander essentially we've given you the
best of both worlds you get all the
portability and convenience of a laptop
plus double the working space so you can
truly work how you want where you want
and when you want now we've been pretty
extensive in our prototype phase we've
designed our board and have a working
prototype the last 18 months have been
spent talking with vendors both home and
abroad to figure out how to bring you a
really special product and we have
everything in line except for one thing
figuring out our mass production
pipeline and that's where you come in we
need funding to pay for expensive
manufacturing tools we need capital to
buy components at a volume discount and
by contributing to our campaign today
you guarantee yourself a lower price and
bypassing any waitlist when the ex panda
hits the market thank you so much for
partnering with us as we bring you guys
a really special product that we believe
in
you
Jones also known a nutshell what is this
all about so what's a special about it
yeah everything look at it it's gorgeous
how do you use it first time you open it
well how do you have you turn it on and
get the music oh so simple to connect
you just literally twist it it's the
only moving function on the actual
device twist it select whether you want
line in or bluetooth pairing up to your
phone and then you're going to get
exploring you'll find the best surface
that you want for you the best surface
for the type of music you're listening
to if you place on the back of a window
you'll hear sound through both sides
bigger the surface you're placing it on
as well the bigger the sound you're
going to recreate
this isn't just a speaker that you're
going to take home and put them aside
and think it sounds great you're going
to show people so the other feature
we've got that's inside there as well I
think it's really quite neat and so if
you're in a space like this you can
place two speakers either side you've
got the stereo sound coming out of it
makes it amazing
we've done things really differently I
think for this campaign we want people
to be able to get hold of this product
quickly we've got 5,000 of the sizer our
products there it's done you want this
by Christmas get it signed up before
december the tenth and will ship to you
for christmas
when you're fishing and you know you you
get a bite and and you hook on a fish
and you're reeling that sucker and you
have all that action throughout that
process but then when you catch the fish
you know you take a picture with it you
smile for the camera and you share that
to all your friends saying look at this
cat so we want to make it so that you
can share the actual action Go Fish cam
incorporated was developed by me and my
brother and then we developed it to be a
technology for what we found to be an
underserved market there are camera
technologies or fish finders in the
market but what we found was there not
capturing where the action was and by
seeing which baits are attracting fish
and how a fish might strike just having
the data and learning about those
aspects of fishing will allow you to
make better decisions in what to use and
why and when that's something that is
very hard to do without an application
like this one of the key features is
that it's it's it's on the line and it
works with your fishing line so it's not
going to obstruct how you fish or your
fishing style and top of that we have
infra red and green lighting around the
camera rim so that you can fish during
nighttime or in darker lighting and then
we also have the depth of it so that can
go up to 150 meters underwater as well
as the ability to last for four hours so
we really put in a lot of work into
making sure that when they go fish that
they're gonna use go fish camp when we
started the project with go fish we
broke down the process into multiple
steps we started initially with a
conceptual design looking at the product
from a both a visual as well as a
feature benefit standpoint it was
important to us that we had a premium
product that had feature benefits that
just weren't available on the market
currently in terms of looking forward to
production the three-dimensional CAD and
mechanical drawings are all completed
the coating for the app is completed at
this point we're really just using
Kickstarter to get ourselves into
production and get this product out into
the marketplace this is a new product
that a lot of people are excited about
and by their support and their backing
of us it's going to allow us to get to
the next step so that we can share our
vision with the world as well
awesome technology that allow you to
capture ton of action-packed footage and
share it with your friends and family
and definitely bring a lot of the
excitement to the industry
