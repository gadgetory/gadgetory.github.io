fun and easier for urban cyclists to use
and longer bikes this vision is called
city
hi Kickstarter I'm Ilana and I'm Mickey
and we're both members of the city lock
team city lock is a comfortable bicycle
saddle that easily transforms into a
foldable tough law anybody with a bike
can use the seat slope and turning to
safety look from settling to walk takes
less than 30 seconds
just remove the saddle open it to a 1
meter long sturdy chain and lock it to
anything stop the results a safe easy to
use highly comfortable solid lock
unlocking and reinstalling the saddle is
equal easy city lock is situated in the
center of gravity of your bike so unlike
any old-fashioned heavy locks you won't
feel the burden of carrying it while
riding we came up with the idea for city
lock about four years ago and after a
thorough market research we had decided
to take it to the next level by - point
city lock had pretty much taking over
our lives and was traveled far and wide
to make sure our idea turned out just
right using the best materials and
manufacturing in high-standard we made
sure city lock fest
all kind of rigorous test until it
reached its unique functionality we knew
we had to make it an amazing product we
dreamt of city lock is designed to be a
solid sturdy lock it's made out of six
hardened steel links that are over
molded with plastic to protect your
frame from scratches the cylinder is
secure and hardened steel housing to
protect it against drilling and the
adapter is made out of high quality
aluminum for extra stiffness and light
weight the Civic adapter is compatible
with ebike PD bike folding buy the
mountain bike or any other bike you
might find the market the city lock
installation is as easy as replacing
their bike saddle and once installed
city lock is fully adjustable city lock
is available in two different models
carefully chosen to fit the widest
demand city lock tracking and safety
lock comfort each model comes in a
variety of designs
styles and colors right now we've got a
full of working samples that we've shown
to a number of potential customers and
partners in the bike industry and
they've all shown enthusiasm and
interest in the city law city lock is a
truly remarkable product between your
support to bring it into the market so
please
beca's on Kickstarter like us on
Facebook and spread the word to make
city lock a reality thanks for watching
right
I'm Chris I love cycling but not so much
when it's wet full-length fenders
protect well but have too many screws
they rattle and take too long to install
and although short fenders are easier to
install they don't fully protect you in
wet weather so I decided to come up with
a better solution and I call it quick
guard quick guard is the first full
length fender that takes just seconds to
install and remove requires no tools and
can be adjusted lower for group riding
to protect riders behind you my short
stay 100% dry which means I stay warm
and when you're warm your muscles
perform better and you feel better
here's what biking expert Ben had to say
about quick guard hey guys I'm here
today to talk about Chris Howard's
quick-release bike fender idea the
install process is super simple you
simply thread the nut off the end of
your skewer that goes through the axle
replace the end of your skewer with the
fender you close down your quick-release
and there you have it the fender is
installed it's a 32nd install it's
really intended for anything with a
quick-release style rear axle fenders
are a nuisance you don't need them on
there 90% of the time but there are
necessity for anyone who commutes on a
bike when it's wet out or is raining you
really want a fender and the fact that
you can simply mount or dismount this as
you need it is gonna really
differentiate it from the rest of the
fenders in the market and I think make
it a standout and that's Chris Howard's
quick-release bike fender I designed the
quick guard to attach to the wheel not
the bicycle frame so it doesn't scratch
or rub the paintwork
it's simple minimalist design mounts on
one side with two sturdy stays that
keeps it from rattling or vibrating and
when installed you'll never know it's
there I've been using testing and
improving the quick guide prototype for
five years it spent two years in Belgium
being tested by pro riders on the
roughest roads and now it's ready for
you please show your support to get your
very own quick guard bicycle fender
thank you for watching and ride safe
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
