right
I'm Chris I love cycling but not so much
when it's wet full-length fenders
protect well but have too many screws
they rattle and take too long to install
and although short fenders are easier to
install they don't fully protect you in
wet weather so I decided to come up with
a better solution and I call it quick
guard quick guard is the first full
length fender that takes just seconds to
install and remove requires no tools and
can be adjusted lower for group riding
to protect riders behind you my short
stay 100% dry which means I stay warm
and when you're warm your muscles
perform better and you feel better
here's what biking expert Ben had to say
about quick guard hey guys I'm here
today to talk about Chris Howard's
quick-release bike fender idea the
install process is super simple you
simply thread the nut off the end of
your skewer that goes through the axle
replace the end of your skewer with the
fender you close down your quick-release
and there you have it the fender is
installed it's a 32nd install it's
really intended for anything with a
quick-release style rear axle fenders
are a nuisance you don't need them on
there 90% of the time but there are
necessity for anyone who commutes on a
bike when it's wet out or is raining you
really want a fender and the fact that
you can simply mount or dismount this as
you need it is gonna really
differentiate it from the rest of the
fenders in the market and I think make
it a standout and that's Chris Howard's
quick-release bike fender I designed the
quick guard to attach to the wheel not
the bicycle frame so it doesn't scratch
or rub the paintwork
it's simple minimalist design mounts on
one side with two sturdy stays that
keeps it from rattling or vibrating and
when installed you'll never know it's
there I've been using testing and
improving the quick guide prototype for
five years it spent two years in Belgium
being tested by pro riders on the
roughest roads and now it's ready for
you please show your support to get your
very own quick guard bicycle fender
thank you for watching and ride safe
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
