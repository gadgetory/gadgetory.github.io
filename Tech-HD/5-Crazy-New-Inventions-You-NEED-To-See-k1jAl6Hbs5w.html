our first ray being heated down puffy
was great for keeping us warm and
everyday use but we kept hearing from
our customers that they wanted something
tougher more rugged so we went back to
the drawing board and created the
Arabian rugged jacket it's as rugged and
tough as you are maybe even a little
tougher introducing the Ray bian rugged
heated jacket we designed it with multi
zone on-demand heat when and where you
need it using our easy access multi zone
controller you can send the heat to your
core or thumbhole cuffs independently or
both at the same time with three heat
settings per zone you're in control with
the world's first patented heated
thumbhole cuffs we designed it to keep
your hands warm while keeping your
digits free for intricate work they're
also thin enough to work with most
gloves to keep your hands even warmer
arabian rugged jackets are compatible
with batteries from Milwaukee to Walt
Bosch Paquita and most 12-volt power
tool batteries it's also water resistant
to survive the elements with an inner
soft breathable liner it's tough enough
to survive the jobsite but comfortable
enough to swaddle a newborn baby
we didn't skimp on the zippers either
with the industry standard beefy YKK
zippers there's also two waist cinches
to keep out the cold drafts when
reaching for that tool you need there
are five pockets a large stuffed pocket
and smaller security pocket on the
inside and large chest pocket and two
hand pockets on the outside we've also
given you two battery pocket locations
that allow you to connect to any 12-volt
power tool batteries or you can use
Arabian battery each battery depending
on capacity can power our jackets for up
to eight hours in a single charge or
with our Arabian battery you can charge
your mobile devices up to four times we
made our outer shell with thick stretchy
soft shell from the new ver ability and
water resistance we also made it machine
washable how's that for convenience so
if you're that guy who is rugged and
tougher than nails this jacket is for
you you're welcome
hi everyone I'm Chadwick I'm Joe and
away our big idea design last year were
meant to TIR tell people love this pin
and it's our best rated pen yet despite
it being a huge success with five star
reviews we challenged ourselves to make
it even more versatile intuitive and
comfortable for every day carry today
we're excited to show you the TIR toe
EDC it's the most refill friendly pocket
and ever our new TIR toe EDC has been
completely re-engineered and can take
hundreds of different refills without
any tip wiggle or compromise first we
redesign the entire mechanism to
eliminate the previous gap between the
grip and the body in addition to prevent
the possibility of losing any parts next
we change to orange measurements to have
them stay in place better we also
improved ability to truly fine-tune the
tip length on both rollerball and ball
pen refills allowing the tip extent out
exactly how you prefer it this pin has a
unique ability to transform its length
from a full sized rollerball pin down to
a compact pocket size EDC pin thanks to
the unique telescoping back post so how
does it work simply load the refill in
from the back screw the back to the
desired pin tip length and tighten down
the grip to fully secure the refill this
pin is well balanced has a full titanium
construction with no plastic parts which
makes it a pin that will adapt and last
for generations to come
