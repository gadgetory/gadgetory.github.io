McKenzie I run Mendocino magic it's a
600-acre campground where we host a lot
of outdoor weddings the one two three
sixty has been a really valuable
resource for us because it helps us to
create virtual tours of our property
with a street view style approach and it
makes it a lot easier for potential
guests see what they're getting into
before they get here
being able to click through the property
was huge you know looking at the 360
video tour just set this place apart so
much using virtual tours in advance
helps set us apart from our competition
in this industry I've been playing
Minecraft a lot for the last several
years and recently I got one of the new
Wonder 360 cameras to help me with the
in-game rural design I built myself a
rig where I can just strap it onto an
old bike helmet pairs really easily to
my phone once I'm connected I can just
like take it outside into any of the
environments that I'm finding
interesting by the time I get back the
3d point cloud is waiting for me on my
computer and I can turn that file into a
Minecraft world right away the 1 to 360
has been really helpful as a tool when
we move into new builds and construction
putting the helmet on I was able to walk
around and make sure I knew exactly what
the designer and the architect were
going to see as well as far as the space
and what we were gonna be working with
what was really great about this project
was the property owner handing off a 360
capture where I could see how my design
will fit into the pre-existing landscape
I think that it'll help a lot with other
landowners in the future for their
builds and how they can more sustainably
interact with their spaces and it'll
make a huge difference for us as we
develop more of this property my name is
trevor i have a travel vlog and the
product that is enabling me to do
what I love the most recently is the
Wonder 360 hey I'm Jack and I've been
riding with a helmet camera for a couple
of years now
and I recently switched from a one
directional camera to a 360 camera and
with this I can see in all directions
everywhere I go I'm such a Luddite when
it comes to technology especially
cameras this thing's amazing it's super
easy I just pop it down because it's 360
I can make it follow her movements my
name is Zack I think acrobatics in
parkour and I really like the Wonder 360
because it makes it really easy to bring
the camera into class set it down
and it captures the whole room no matter
which way our practice goes and that way
I don't need a whole camera crew in
order to get every part of my run as I
go up and down back and forth I love
that I can live shooting a face book and
it stitches the 360 for me automatically
it works with all my old attachments and
it's waterproof love the cool filters
artificial bouquet tilt chip classic I'm
Creek I've been drifting for nine years
and I just started using the Wonder 360
the fact that the image comes out of
this camera is stabilized and I don't
have to modify the footage with the
computer is outstanding
I've been strapping the Wonder 360 to my
dog Shiloh she's got a huge following on
Instagram her followers really love the
perspective that this camera gives and
in the city where it's a little more
dangerous I've got a record of what
happens if I'm involved in a close call
I can prove it
I also love the Phantom flipper it
allows me to capture every part of
emotion and
easily analyzed individual aspects of
that motion and really show the students
where they need to improve and practice
I love that I can view and edit that
clips on my phone so if I'm on a nice
ride in the countryside I can come home
and recreate it and show it to all my
friends and the 3d mode is pretty cool
it's really easy to edit on my phone
directly from the app a video that I
actually want to share I love it
do you find yourself rubbing your neck
throughout the day do you find yourself
slouching over your cell phone or laptop
regularly well you're not alone neck and
back pain affects most of us daily and
it's mainly caused from our bad posture
while using our mobile devices or
laptops this is referred to as nerd neck
or Technic which is medically known as
forward head posture with mobile devices
and technology taking over our lives
neck pain and bad posture is becoming
more and more of an epidemic the stress
put on our necks everyday from looking
down at our phones and laptops and
slowly moving our heads closer to our
devices to see them better is causing
the spine which connects all our central
nervous system to stretch out which in
turn affects our overall health the only
way to correct tekneq is to strengthen
the neck and back muscles through
exercise and stretching and until now
there hasn't been a product that does
both of those for you this is the neck
retracts it was created by Andrew sock
Ronnie a licensed strength and
conditioning athletic therapist in
kinesiologist specializing in
musculoskeletal injuries most commonly
in the neck and back when the majority
of patients coming in to see Andrew were
not athletes but actually just regular
people with neck pain he knew he needed
to create a product he could use with
these patients to strengthen their
muscles and correct neck pain and spine
injuries after rigorous testing and
numerous prototypes he developed neck
retracts neck retracts combines cervical
retraction exercise device and neck
traction device into one easy-to-use
product that anyone can use anytime
anywhere neck retracts incorporates the
very popular and proven chin tuck
exercise but increases the effectiveness
of the chin tuck through the adjustable
elastic resistance band which enables
the user to gradually increase the
intensity of the resistance as they go
the resistance can be adjusted by
placing the ball stopper at different
links in a doorway this tightens the
elasticity which allows the weight
resistance on the band to adjust between
0 to 5 pounds 5 to 15 pounds for 15 to
30 pounds so everyone from people with
neck injuries to athletes who want to
increase neck muscle strength can use it
wow this is really effective you really
feel it strengthening my neck and back a
lot when you want a relaxing cervical
traction session simply wrap the loop
around any door handle or in-ear alien
and rest your head in the cradle to
stretch out the neck muscles and relieve
tension for extra comfort and relief add
in the optional cooled or warm gel pack
to melt away the stress by strengthening
stretching the neck and back muscles we
pull the head back over the shoulders
instead of out in front which is causing
the tension and pain in our neck this
makes us have better posture relieves
the aggravating pain and improves
overall health performing the chin tuck
with neck retracts for 2 minutes a day 3
or 4 times a week is all you need lay
down and relax in the cradle for at-home
cervical traction for 10 minutes to
boost your recovery time and bring you
back to good spine and health posture
this is really good I feel like I could
just fall asleep if your weapon here
it's amazing it just feels like all the
stress and tension is going away

ice pack holder oh it love it neck
