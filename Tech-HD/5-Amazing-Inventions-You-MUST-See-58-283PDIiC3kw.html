kind of cup the packs down small for
ultra portability and it pops up big
whenever you need a drink on the go
like most people I really enjoy my
takeaway drinks a few years ago I
discovered that most paper cups like
this one and not recycled can go
directly to landfill in the UK alone
over seven million of these are thrown
away everyday stacked up would be 7
times taller than Mount Everest every
day so I bought a bunch of travel mugs
and they try to solve the problem but
they're either too big and bulky and
heavy to carry around all day they were
plain and safe or soft and squishy and
unstable
or simply leaked in my bag my idea was
simple
I needed a reusable cup that was ultra
portable safe and kind to the planet
Nikita had built an insulation so no
more cardboard sleeves or the dreaded
double power
I love my Paquito it's versatile and
super convenient
made from strong odorless and FDA
approved materials which won't
compromise the safety or flavor of your
drink hey Kickstarter this is a new
poquito cup and it does the job of more
than 1500 of these
1500
with your pledge we can get Paquito in
your pocket so backers hit that green
button and choose a better way
Paquito magnifico
when I wrote a bike for the first time
they had an electronic shifting I
thought it was the coolest thing ever
I can now experience two of my favorite
things at the same time my passion for
riding and great use of technology the
electronic shifting has been around for
a long time but it's so expensive that
only professionals could afford it I
knew there had to be a way to make it
affordable and it had to fit almost any
bike it had to be easy to install it had
to be Wireless it had to connect to a
mobile device and had to do things that
had never been done before
or what's the point so I created the
Ector it's a wireless shifting system
and it's smart let's watch a few things
that you can do
Multi shift press and hold and jump two
or three gears
hold a bit longer and you shift the
entire range you can configure the press
time to your liking intuitive and fast
with the semi-auto function you only
need to press up and down and the ex
shifter will automatically shift your
front and rear derailleurs to the
optimum gear ratio think of it as the
automatic transmission and a car take
your mind off shifting so you can enjoy
your ride
manual mode the remote has four
configurable buttons each button can be
assigned a function for example if you
are left-handed you can easily invert
the standard settings for a one by
system you could have the right side on
manual shift in the left side for multi
shift mode X shifter is universal it
connects to your existing derailleur it
fits any bike any frame any brand of
derailers and it works with a precision
of plus or minus ten microns that
shifter can be used on road bikes
mountain bikes tandems recumbents hand
cycles and even dropper pulse
anyone can enjoy the advantages of ex
shifter
the X shifted design is done we've been
testing it for months this design is so
robust that even 3d printed prototypes
that working perfectly Wireless shifters
cost thousands of dollars and are very
limited in what they can do the Exeter
starts at only $200 and does everything
the others do and a lot more we're at
the final stage of development please
support our campaign and help us deliver
this amazing product to everyone
as photographers we buy DSLRs with high
hopes of capturing amazing photos but up
till now
pushing the limits of what can be
captured has come with countless
accessories high price tags and
complicated setups we've designed one
accessory that will unlock all of that

time you held it get ready to be blown
away again and again by cam Buddy Pro

features would normally cost you all the
extra bags it would take to carry them

takes to use them how much would those
of you professional photographers paid
just combine all that equipment into
this small and portable of a package
this is cam buddy Pro unlock your true
potential as a photographer our final
prototype is ready for production
support our campaign and help us deliver
this amazing product to everyone
those were the days that quote someone
like challenges the mother of invention
or hardship is mother invention I think
necessity necessity accessory is the
term
we were kids nothing compared to that
clock it was so rad
but as adults we get a lot of hurdles
with only eight LEDs we couldn't share
our selfies or cat photos for our memes
and then one day John said hey Nick
there's a way we can do this so in 2011
we set out to make it happen get images
to appear out of thin air anywhere in
the world anyway a hard thing and at
first it was pretty rough
thankfully had some good ideas
Steve brilliant rather than good but
okay we can continue all in the hospital
recovering I've had some I think pretty
good ideas to make the future direction
of the product but then I dug a bit
deeper in some technical areas it was
heartbreaking it all down and we
struggled for a while but after months
of development and temporary losing
sight in one tada
jonno
we cool we would we would love it if you
like it just a fraction as much as we do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
