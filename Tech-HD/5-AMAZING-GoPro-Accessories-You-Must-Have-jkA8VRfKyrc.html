hey Kickstarter it's been a year since
we launched the world's first pan until
GoPro poll and we're back with a whole
new wave of products it's been a year of
development but we're now excited to
introduce to you the microchip to
microchip XL and all new microchip plug
three great ways to take your GoPro
filming to the next level flows a GoPro
mount like no other it's the first ever
hand drip that it's both extendable and
floats allowing you to get great footage
into through cameras safe in the water
it's unique design is both compact and
comfortable making a perfect companion
for go cruisers who love to get wet
extendable to 23 inches and collapsing
to just six and a half inches it was
easy to take along on your next water
adventure it and get great shots without
the worry of losing your camera since
our first Kickstarter campaign we've
learned a lot microchip has been on all
seven continents has been embraced by
the GoPro commune
but for some great feedback from our
customers and took it to heart
developing the microchips predecessor
the microchip - simply by turning the
handle you can rotate your camera 360
degrees you neither the panning or
tilting motion thanks to a few
adjustments the micro tube - is smoother
than ever
aligned for an endless variety of
professional shots and enemies
oh yeah and did we mention that it's not
waterproof you can now taking microchip
anywhere and keep it safe we like new
katashi will rest rather if you're
looking to go big the microchip XL is
people to take you to new heights at the
same awesome features of the hydrogen -
just in a bigger package extendable -
over 5 feet that excel gives you longer
range for cinematic jib shots with ease
if you're usually the one behind the
camera making the magic happen my
courage of excellence definitely
over you so Kickstarter once again we
really do need your help and bring these
three amazing products to life the
development and tooling is already done

goal and complete our first board be

this is what you will get in your split
down port package add-on port a short
booklet with some tips and instructions
amount few screws and bolts and a carbon
hand grip the GoPro camera is of course
not included now let's take a look how
the split dome works first we want to
put the GoPro camera inside the housing
to do this we must unscrew both on/off
screws when both buttons are unscrewed
you can leave the clamp that presses the
GoPro housing into the dome and remove
the housing this separate housing keeps
your camera safe in an unlikely event of
water getting into the dome it looks
very similar to your Allegro GoPro
housing but it's not it's specially
designed to fit into the split down port
so your regular GoPro housing won't work
now let's put the GoPro camera inside
housing and close it the next thing that
you need to do is attach the GoPro mount
to the top of your carbon hand grip make
sure you tighten it then attach the
GoPro housing to the top of the grip and
secure it with the supplied screw you
could put the housing into the dome
first and then attach the hand grip but
this is the easier way make sure that
the screw face is left not right this
gives you the better access to the
camera on/off button also make sure that
you tighten it really well using the
supplied key this way the dome port will
stay in the same position before putting
your camera into the split down port
make sure that the rubber gasket inside
opening is clean any dirt sand hair or
other debris can compromise the seal now
it's time to put the camera into the
dome port make sure the lens of the
housing sits well into the hole then
close the clamp and tighten it this way
the GoPro housing will be pressed into
the dome and the dome port will be
sealed the best way to do this is to
squeeze the housing into the dome port
with one hand and use the other hand to
tighten it make sure that both buttons
are screwed tight and there is
space left underneath this is how you
assembled the dome port and put the
camera in it's pretty simple right now
let's check what all the buttons do the
on/off buttons as you have seen are for
taking camera in and out of the dome the
top button is your camera shutter button
side button is your camera setup button
the bottom at the bottom is your camera
on/off and mode button so if I press it
the camera will turn on the last thing
that I want to show you is how to remove
the dome from the back plate in case you
want to clean it from the inside you
will need a number 8 allen key and
remove all the 10 screws that hold the
dome in place use microfiber or similar
gentle cloth to clean the dome before
you reattach the dome back to the back
plate make sure that the rubber gasket
is in place and clean off any debris
then tighten all the screws until you
get some resistance but don't over
tighten them because you can damage the
thread if you're using your split dome
port in salt water then make sure you
rinse it with fresh water after the use
it is also recommended to put the nail
print color over the dome when you're
not using it to protect it from
scratches for more don't port
photography tips and tricks please check
our website split gadgets com
have fun using your split down port be
creative and would love to see photos
and videos that you came up with see you
in the water
