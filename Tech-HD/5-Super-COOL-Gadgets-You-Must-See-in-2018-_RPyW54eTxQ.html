I would like to take you back to that
place where you lived your best days
that place were the only thing that
mattered was whatever laid before you
where the only responsibility was living
now that we have come all this way and
that place seems distant sometimes I
would like to take you back there for a
while every day an adaptable sand for
the mobile devices you love so well

that blaze that Nestle's within you that
place where humans and technology merge
in a friendly beautiful and constructive
dialogue a union that opens new horizons
of possibilities the sand will be there
for you from the moment you wake up and
until you go to sleep there for you when
you're communicating cooking a meal or
even when you want to forget it all for
an instant not just make your life
easier but more real as real as the
ceramic of which it is made the artisan
who lab rates it the traditional process
from which it was born as real as the
hills which inspired it's designed in
the best moment of my childhood which
remind me they're not all has to be
symmetry he sepsis perfection that
everything must be human after all no
matter how much technology advances that
is all we are right
silencers or suppressors are devices
that attach to the barrel of a gun to
reduce noise much like a muffler on a
car suppressors make it possible for
firearms to be hearing safe a gun shot
is a combination of several noises the
mechanical action of the firearm violent
shredding of the air as the propellant
gas exit the barrel and the crack of the
bullet as it breaks the sound barrier
with a bare muzzle the gases escape and
expand rapidly after leaving the small
volume of the barrel when fitted with a
suppressor the gases now have greater
volume to expand into thus disrupting
and dissipating the noise suppressors
drastically reduced the perceived recoil
of a weapon and reduce the muzzle flash
thus increasing accuracy suppressors
make shooting a much better experience

hi I'm Keith and I'm Vanessa and we're
the husband-wife team behind nomads lane
we founded Nomad lane after traveling to
more than 40 countries together we
launched our first collection of travel
accessories in 2017 and received way
more press attention than we could have
ever imagined that's why we're embarking
on our most ambitious project today over
our travels the one thing that we had
been searching for that we couldn't find
was the ideal personal item bag we spent
months serving the market and every bag
we found was too bulky too unorganized
her two unpolished so we decided to
design the ultimate travel sidekick over
the course of the last year we
interviewed frequent fliers to
understand their needs and wants and a
personal item bag and then we flew
halfway around the world to meet with
our supplier to build the best travel
bag ever as frequent travelers we are so
excited about the ultimate personal item
bag the bento bag and we hope you are
too
there's a designated spot for everything
you might need it slides over your
luggage for convenient carrying and

companion for any trip spend less time
