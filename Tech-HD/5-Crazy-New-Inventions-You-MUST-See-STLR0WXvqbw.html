simulator for all your favorite PC games
videos and VR imagine feeling the heat
of a flamethrower when you're playing
battlefield 1 got it great since the
heat it's interesting because it
immediately makes you sweat so it's
really quick to immerse you into it I
know what an explosion is gonna happen
I'm gonna feel the flame so I'm already
scared about it happening but it makes
the world more tangible whatever I'm
watching you're playing like it actually
makes me more fearful this is like the
flame that's gonna hurt me and it's
missing through our hardware and
software the vortex system is able to
respond to any kind of stimulus on
demand
I'd say the coolest thing is how fast it
can switch between temperatures so like
watching the shadow mode or and that ice
part of the scene is switch it's like
the fire it kept switching else like
okay this is actually really cool so
what's exciting about vortexes we're
taking a large amount of input data in
audio-visual format and we get to turn
that information into usable feedback
that creates an elevated level of
immersion for the users it kind of
caught me off guard after we started
putting some of this work into play
because the unit was a blast to use it
was genuinely fun and it is it makes
almost every piece of content that you
consume better it's just a whole lot of
fun
oh my god you feel like you're in the
environment that you're watching a plane
the vortex enables you to understand the
atmosphere at another level
it gives you more sense and more
attachment to what you're doing
seeing people having to face light up
when they have that experience for the
first time is like everything personal
satisfaction of that is just amazing we
know there's a huge void in traditional
gaming and video that's why we started
whirlwind FX we want to get it into your
hands the content creators the gamers VR
enthusiasts action lovers now with your
support we want to breathe life into
your entertainment experience feeling is
believing live the action
here it goes son we believe the son is
capable of powering our lives so we
create solar powered devices to feel the
world today we're excited to release the
go son go
a solar stove that roasts a meal in
minutes can be taken anywhere works any
day yet remains cool to touch no matter
how hot just like it's named the go son
go comes in a bomb-proof package ready
for outdoor adventure or relaxing at
home with friends if you're craving a
hot drink or need to sterilize water
flip the adjustable stand and use it
vertically to boil 14 ounces are ready
in as little as 30 minutes the secret to
our breakthrough technology is the solar
vacuum tube which acts as a perfect
insulator trapping your foods moisture
and flavor cooking made us human and it
continues to bring us together
it's an international language and an
art as a kid I was encouraged to explore
and pretty much do whatever I wanted and
I was really attracted to cooking
because of the creative process involved
it's like my creative outlet even to
this day and I love gathering friends
and family together and serving up a hot
plate of food
I'm Patrick Sherwin and I'm a solar
energy guy I've been working with
renewable energy for a long time and I
came up with go Sun five years ago and
we rotation a big dream trying to fit
fuel free cooking into the bellies of
people around the world it's clean easy
and healthy and for some people this may
be the only alternative where they're
not burning something for dinner tonight
most people think that solar is too
expensive or that it doesn't work so go
Sun has made an affordable solution
that's four times more efficient than
solar panels and works its magic
whenever needed
packed of power and free from batteries
the gosun go is something you can take
anywhere to cook up a hot meal or drink
with a no effort no gas no fire no
safety hazard and no mess to clean up
the gosun go is like a ticket to an
adventure with no strings attached
there's no fuel to burn there's no mess
to clean up
it's in this tiny little case that you
can take anywhere you can cook just
about anything through the clouds
through the freezing cold all just with
the power of the sunlight and what more
could you want when it comes to outdoor
cooking we're just getting better at
burning and smoking meat that's the same
thing we've been doing for 350,000 years
go son invites you to join the 21st
century solar revolution we want you to
experience the magic of the Sun and
share its goodness
axes cut cut
get out of the city authenticity lies in
the woods comb your beard stand near
water war in water find your way won't
get lost
climb rocks any rocks above all drink
coffee fresh ground coffee can yeah we
get it I think we can all agree fresh
ground coffee is the best that's why you
brought a hand grinder all the way here
but there is a better way this is the
loom grinder let's see how it works
nope they're better than good
they're great but how did we get here
let's step back a bit when you want a
rich rewarding cup of coffee you need
beans that are ground into particles of
consistent size now the word consistent
is key here why you know when you roast
potatoes how you want to cut each chunk
the same size it's to make sure they're
all cooked the same none overcooked
none undercooked well the same thing
goes with brewing for example if you
like the French press brewing method
like I do
coarse particles get good extraction but
the fine particles will be over
extracted that means a bitter tasting
cup of coffee the same goes for any
other brewing methods you're looking for
consistency no exception today's hand
grinders generally have one major flaw
the burrs am stabilized it rocks back
and forth creating some particles larger
than the rest loom grinder on the other
hand uses a patent-pending design that
applies a stabilized conical ceramic
burr to keep everything precise and even
you'll get the same quality grounds you
get from your favorite coffee shop
thanks for listening now back to that
amazing cup of coffee you've been
waiting for okay he's done back to the
woods and whatever the heck you're doing
out there
bring the grinder it's a light too you
know so you could read or knit or read n
it go to the woods
bring your beans Lu it's a grinder and a
light but mostly a grinder
you
there's no sweet cheese the leading us
love is all will ever trust ya
we'll go
through the wastelands through the
highways summer shadow through the
sunrays and
I phoned away melodies we haven't played
I don't know
go in around these walls to create a
song
we'll go through the wastelands through
the highways
usually the taste of bottled beer has
something missing in craft brewers
everywhere know how much UV light
temperature and oxygen really do degrade
the taste of a beer what if you could
have the world's greatest tasting craft
beer at its best tasting a moment right
from your home with hoppy you can I buy
a beer kit from the app the kit arrives
at my door I clean and sanitize with one
touch put yeast into the growler then I
have the dry hops and flavor cartridges
and hit go
hoppy knows what kind of beer and making
and it uses the exact temperature
pressure and time presets to create the
perfect tasting beer now my beer tastes
just the way the brewer experiences it
my brewing career pretty much started at
Lost Coast then Russian River has a home
brewer it's really hard to get low
oxygen levels that make the beer
delicious so it inspires me about this
is you get this professionally made wort
and then you get to ferment it at home
with the same yeast that they would use
the same dry hops without having to
worry about the things that we worry
about like the oxygen levels and the
cleanliness of the equipment I'm about
to get my first drink out of the hoppy
brewing kit yeah that's delicious so you
can make the best beer in the world but
it's most likely that when once it gets
to the customer level it won't be the
best beer anymore we're very excited
because we're now finally seeing maybe
the next stage in how a beer is
delivered to a consumer we created hoppy
so we could bring you the freshest
purest beer we are so excited about the
results and the quality of beer were
getting out of hobby we've had so many
prototypes and now we're finally ready
to bring this to market we want you to
be one of the first people to experience
what hoppy can do please help us bring
this to the world
it'll tell you when it's 100% done it
knows when the gravity is low enough it
seals itself up it carbonates itself and
then you have to pour it right there you
get to have the perfect pint the perfect
aroma the perfect flavor the perfect
mouthfeel beer like we drink from our
bright tanks hoppy makes home brewing
easy with one touch automatic cleaning
and ingredients made by the breweries
themselves it's a totally closed-loop
system which means there's no sunlight
or oxygen getting in now I enjoy the
world's greatest craft beers at their
best tasting moments with almost no
effort Cheers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
