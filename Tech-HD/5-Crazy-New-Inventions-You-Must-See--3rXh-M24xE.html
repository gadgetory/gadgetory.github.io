sparkling drink maker which fits to any
plastic soft drink bottle you can make
any drink fizzy or even Reef is a
flattened coke we wanted to make it as
versatile as possible so we'll bring it
with two adapters one to fit a
refillable household co2 tank commonly
sold on any supermarkets and another
adaptor for portable use with small
disposable country
hi I am Jung I'm a boat builder and the
inventor of p√∫blica I really like
sparkling water but I also like the sea
and as former environmental science
student I realized that it's not a good
combination because of the plastic
pollution of the Seas so I decided to
get the soda machine but it was too big
for my small kitchen so I missed the
bubble
our goal is to make your life more
convenient and happy and make the
environment protection a pleasure bubble
caps saves your money counter space and
the environment so if you agree that it
is a good idea to save the environment
by using bubble cap or you just pass the
sparkling drinks please order now and
also save these to all your friends
you
we're biolite and we love fire a
campfire is all about gathering round
but the smoke that comes with it can
often get in the way of sticking around
it's time to upgrade your fire with the
biolite fire pit a Bluetooth controlled
wood burning system that can cook your
meals and create an outdoor floating
fire without any of the smoke central to
the bilat fire pit is the advanced
airflow system an integrated fan injects
the fire with air across 51 jets
dramatically improving combustion by
burning particulate matter before it has
a chance to escape the fire so you can
go from a spark to smokeless in under 30
seconds the result no more shuffling
around your campfire to avoid plumes of
smoke unlike typical fire pits you might
encounter the fire pit features x-ray
mesh giving you a 360 degree view of
your flames and creating the feel of a
floating fire in nighttime conditions
the high temp coated steel chamber can
hold up to four pieces of cord wood at a
time and with a hyper efficient burn you
get a roaring campfire with half the
fuel typically required so you can do
more with less control the strength of
your flames from the palm of your hand
with a free bio light app that talks to
your airflow system to modulate fan
speeds the more air you introduce the
hotter the fire the airflow pack can
provide up to 24 hours of clean burning
on a single charge and it detaches for
easy recharging via micro USB utilize
the USB port on the side to connect bio
light lighting for a perfect outdoor
setup and when you're not burning that
same USB port doubles as a power bank
offering power and a pinch to your other
devices exclusively for our Kickstarter
backers your pledge comes with a free
integrated solar cover that
automatically recharges the fire pit
when not in use ready for the beach the
backyard and beyond the fire pits
folding legs and the solar covers
integrated straps make it easy to
transport if you can carry a cooler to
your favorite outdoor spot you can carry
this no problem
looking to cook with your campfire we
got you covered the fire pits a dual
fuel system can accommodate both
charcoal or burn your firewood down to
embers and with the included great top
your system transforms instantly into a
hibachi style grill or epic outdoor
meals here at biolite we've been in the
business of fire for over five years

campaign will help us onboard and train
our new production partner as well as
cover the costs of our first large
volume production run we've got a great
selection of rewards lined up featuring
gear from the entire biolite family of
products and special collaborations with
some of our favorite outdoor friends

you
hello my name is Scott come Fuhrman
founder of clinically fit the developers
of the extensor first thank you for
buying our product I want to take a few
minutes to show you exactly how this
device works and help you make the most
out of using it you're going to notice
that the in your bag they're going to be
a series of finger bands in three
different sizes the device fits on both
of your hands with the blue thumb bands
fitting on either one of your hands
first thing you want to do is find the
bands that fit most suitable to your
fingers place them in the device and
then slowly a few times for each one
going through the motion of
prestretching your finger bands which is
going to activate the elasticity in
these bands making it a little bit
softer and a little easier to use next
you're going to notice that there's a
grid on here and this grid has three
different rows that allow you to
increase or decrease tension for each
one of your fingers individually the
first thing we're going to do is place a
device on its lips on either hand and
like a glove and just by sticking your
fingers in these bands both the blue and
the gray securing the strap to your
wrist
you'll be ready to go make sure that you
seek approval from your physician if you
have any kind of a condition before

exercises each time you use them the
device will help you overall just
increase the overall fitness in your
hands your wrists and your elbows now

more than a few minutes a day a few days
a week we certainly don't want to get
