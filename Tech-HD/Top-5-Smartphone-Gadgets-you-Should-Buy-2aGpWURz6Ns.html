right here on Kickstarter since then our
mounting system helped thousands of
customers use the mobile devices in
places like cars offices bicycles and
more but to achieve the ultimate freedom
there was this one more challenge to
solve we didn't want you to worry about
running out of power ever again
interestingly our existing magnetic
locking mechanism provided a unique
opportunity to solve the problem by
combining it with custom-designed
wireless charging components we were
able to channel the energy much more
efficiently than standard qi chargers
that is how we developed a series of
blazing fast charging mounts they're
designed to blend perfectly with your
daily activities from the moment you
start your day
all the while providing the ultimate
freedom and convenience
I'm a power user but I never like bulky
battery cases on my high tech phone I
use power banks but you can so easily
forget to charge him while I was
charging was an obvious choice but in
its current form it was far from perfect
it was definitely slower than wired I
was always searching for the sweet spot
and sometimes charging just stopped so
my top priority was to completely remove
the ball but still keep the phone
charged with zero effort we knew our
mission would be accomplished only if
we're able to come up with a product
that is much better than existing
solutions so we test it for months just
to select the best components then we
designed our own circuit boards
optimized for speed and low heat
dissipation the result is stunning in
every aspect technical and aesthetic
we've invested more than a year to
design seven new products made for
iPhones and Qi compatible smartphones
they're great at home car or office and
we're now at a point where the tooling
is all set and all that is missing for
production to start is your pledge join
us and I promise that together we will
finally make conductive charging truly
useful

frustrated by tangled cables the take up
too much space and are expensive to
replace introducing spooly a cable for
the rigors of modern-day life on the
move
no more frayed cables the design
prevents damage at join between the
cables and connector reversible USB
wires are aligned side by side to
prevent bending and fatigue the cable
bends along the natural curve of the
wires higher build quality for enhance
longevity allows reliable syncing and
charging of your iPhone iPad and iPod
available in different sizes 25
centimetres and one metre connector
doubles as a cable spool
rounded edges prevent damage to the
internal wires when coiled the cable
efficiently forms a coil via the
innovative mag system the end of the
cable is securely fastened small enough
to fit in your pocket or purse coiled to
prevent knots and tangles when traveling
available in a range of colors
you
hi Kickstarter's my name is Vadim and
this is history from the vaults most
versatile tools for model photographers
and get all the B script Pro is the next
generation of B script the world's first
universal lens adapter and rig system
for all smartphones we redesigned all
the major components to improve its
functionality and manufacturing process
the beasts grip pros body components
will be manufactured with an injection
molding process made from a durable
glass filled nylon material combined
with custom machined parts and carefully
assembled by hand in Chicago Illinois
the B script Pro is compatible with
virtually any smartphone our new clamps
are optimized for holding both small and
large devices and the redesigned lens
mount is now adjustable on three axes
for improved alignment even on phones
with protruded cameras the bespoke pro
is completely modular it has a removable
handle and lens mount assembly allowing
the user to modify their setup to their
own personal preference if you're
looking for a tripod mount comfortable
grip paired with your favorite clip on
mobile lens or a full-featured setup
with tons of accessories then look no
further the beast grip pro can do it all
along with the B script Pro we are
launching our B script depth of field
adapter for SLR lenses plus wide angle
and fisheye conversion lenses this grip
drone the world's most versatile tool
for camera phone photographers and
videographers
it's a company this group wouldn't exist
without the incredible support we
received from Kickstarter community
during our first campaign now we are
back asking for help once again all
raised funds will go towards tooling of
injection mold manufacturing and place
an initial order for all necessary parts
and components together we will bring
this group rock depth-of-field adapter
and viscri flanges to life thank you
so we're all born with the pristine skin
maybe bottom skin but as we go through
life being in the Sun exposed to
different chemicals pollution things we
eat toxins our body's ability to repair
itself isn't quite to the job that often
can develop into skin malignancies given
that the skin is one of the most exposed
organs it's the biggest organ in our
body each year more people get skin
cancer from the Sun and then get lung
cancer from smoking cigarettes one
American dies every hour from melanoma
and is one of the only cancers the
United States that still has an
increasing incidence but there's good
news unlike most cancers it is possible
to detect and treat skin cancer up to
95% of skin cancer deaths are
preventable by early action our mission
is to end all preventable skin cancer
deaths and it is possible that's why
we've created so the hood is a polarized
magnifying lens that attaches to any
smartphone camera once attached it
allows you to take medical grade images
of your moles together with our app you
can track your moles or skin cancer
warning signs and even share the images
with the dermatologists
now instead of waiting weeks having
uncertainty and concern about your own
health you get an answer back within
hours that gives you not only peace of
mind but you get a prioritized
dermatologist appointment instead of
waiting on three weeks where you go
through a family doctor and then two
dermatologists the dermatologist will
tell you hey come straight into my
office and I'll get removed for you
right away
so for the past 15 years we've worked
hard at developing the most capable
medical grade devices for dermatologists
now with who'd we have created a device
specifically for consumers that has been
designed to be friendly accessible
intuitive we really want to eradicate
skin cancer and I believe this is our
restaurant with your help our vision is
to add the dramatic scope to the family
of medical tools we keep in the home
with hood skin cancer can become a thing
of the past and we can spend less time
worrying and more time enjoying the
things we love
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
