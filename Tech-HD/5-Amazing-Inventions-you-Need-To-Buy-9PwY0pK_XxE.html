magnificent options are at your

and evening concert that you drift off
into a peaceful as restful sleep
i was born in the pastoral countryside
of heaven on earth it was a peaceful and
beautiful land as a child I was orphaned
early on and at the end of the day I lay
down to sleep on our porch under a
canopy of stars sparkling and twinkling
until the break of the morning today I'm
able to bring to the world but beauty of
my everlasting evening sky through
starsailor it's only through my
never-ending dedication that I'm now
able to bring everyone the chance to
sleep with the stars of the night so the
moment would be twisted off to rest are
mine and I wanted
you
choose to be a video maker choose a
camera choose the best equipment choose
the spot choose the position choose the
transition hit record and choose what to
do next I do not to make too many
choices I choose star slider size flyer
is a motorized camera slider with
modular component and a plug-and-play
system that lets you create food camera
movements monolight if the additional
module which allows you to have rotary
movement around multiple axes panic
tilting and rolling as you prefer by
turning a few nos you can couple two
mana lights with star slider and get the
three axis motorization system then you
only need to mount the camera on it
whichever model it is plug in the
battery and use your smartphone with a
dedicated app to take control of your
shoes
we push flexibility into the project so
you can choose the bundle that they're
just cute adapting listen to your
specific needs each module is indeed
matchable with the other giving the
opportunity of limitless configurations
use two mana lights together Malcolm on
style slider or use them separately for
breathtaking still life shot move the
camera and the subject at the same time
and you'll be the only thing staying
still
we also tried to reduce this noise we
try it again but unfortunately we
couldn't fix our coffee machine so we
decided to develop stealth mode motion
just in case you want to record live
audio sessions or interviews
the motors are able to lift small
payloads average Palos or very very
heavy payloads as well interesting case
you want to shoot camera car mount the
Magnetic seats stick star slider on a
metal surface and drive away safely the
wireless control allows you to set the
motion from unlimited distances and you
can free your imagination finding out
extraordinary points of view the
Starfighter app has a user-friendly
interface between simple manual mode
control or a more complex target point
driven preset mode set up to five
keyframes you want your shot and twist
your forums adults take a look
the same logic is applied to time-lapse
mode allowing you to move towards faith
and time settings in just a few clicks
at the end you can always save and load
preset movement to remake the same shot
or combine it with another in a
different environment it will enhance
your creativity
designing star slider was the most
challenging and fulfilling project we've
ever worked on after several months of
developing prototyping and testing was
professional video production we are
happy to announce that the design is
complete we have worked hard to make
improvements on the manufacturing
process in order to achieve high
standards of quality at affordable
prices

this is only the beginning we have
additional features plan in the pipeline
