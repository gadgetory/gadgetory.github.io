let's put it that way that's what he's
been doing for the past 20 years and
he's becoming pretty damn good at it
well I wish this story was all fun and
games but sometimes you gotta take
action to preserve your body mics ears
are paying the price whenever he is
DJing and producing he feels fatigue
pain and loss of sensitivity but not
anymore now he uses D but a pleasant let
sound in and keeps noise out ha what is
this D but thing you ask D but is what
saved Mike from imminent silence and can
save a lot of other people featuring a
slider that allows you to adjust to the
amount of decibels you want to filter
out D but gives you a clearer crisper
and safer music experience what's the
difference between D but and a regular
ear plug you might ask well here's some
scientific explanation your ear is
designed to naturally boost frequencies
around two to four kilo Hertz like human
speech most ear plugs simply fill out
your ear canal to block sound problem is
that they alter your years resonance
frequency causing muffled unclear
hearing as a result with D buds you can
speak feel listen move do exactly what
our acoustic mesh is designed to reduce
volume evenly for all frequencies
throughout the spectrum while the
acoustic or mechanically enhances
frequencies in the range of human speech
d-bus simply brings you clearer say
sound for mic this was a decision that
dramatically changed the quality of his
life with a simple slide and he is
telling all his friends about it three
test slides it to pitch down the high
notes of joyful children and still be
able to talk to the parents ed and Paul
slides it to tone down machine noise and
keep the creative juices flowing Anna
slides a jet so she can hear herself
think at the agency and still be aware
of the latest gossip
Samuel slides it to maintain sanity and
focus and make every chance of small
talk a prolific dialogue after years of
research prototyping and testing we
achieved a sleek design plug with
minimum visual impact perfect fit and
ease of use
this means crisper clearer hearing with
reduced volume every time we're ear labs
and our mission is to bring you a better
and safer listening experience no matter
who you are or what you do back us on
Kickstarter and help us make a
difference for millions of people around
the world
d bud let's sound in keep noise out
you
you
waste we're engulfed by mass production
accelerating consumption and rampant
materialism products are designed to
become obsolete then discarded for the
next big thing for depleting our natural
resources at the store machine rates or
public pollutants and trash into the
environment developments and
sustainability are promising but they're
not happening fast enough and the
solutions are still too expensive and
inaccessible what if we can make a
machines last longer run more
efficiently and self-improve instead of
supporting the high turnover consumerism
that we see today what if we had
solution here and now that's our mission
at try rotex
we're tackling the problem of waste by
creating the first of its kind
nanoparticles that actually repair
machines are increasing performance and
efficiency harnessing the power of
nanotechnology we came up with a small
solution to this big problem
turbo text nanoparticles have two faces
one deadlines are one less slides a
sticky side reinforces and strengthens
or the slippery side reduces friction
just like carbon telling the diamond in
a mantle of the earth
TurboTax sulfa lies through a diamond
like lattice structure under the heat
and pressure of the engine unlike other
protective coatings this process
actually reverses engine wear particle
by particle restores it to a better than
new condition for initial focus was to
make lubricants safer among many
nanomaterials we worked on one unique
outlier reduced friction dramatically
down to super lubricity level with the
help of national labs and research
agencies we understood the mechanism and
developed proprietary production
products after years of research and
rigorous testing we're proud to
introduce car boss a safe and green
additive for your car by improves gas
mileage boost source power and extends
the life of your engine car boss comes
in a small recyclable applicator that
you inject into the oil fill of your car
as you drive Toa text nanoparticles are
forged into a diamond like armor around
engine components rejuvenating a daily
driver to become more efficient then
when it was new
1/3 of the gas that you put in your car
is wasted on engine fish with 612
million cars on the road that waste adds
up running on car boss will use less
fuel reduce pollution and leave a
smaller carbon footprint we're ready to
go to market and we need your help back
our Kickstarter and be the first to
adopt a revolutionary technology they'll
make our world more efficient more
powerful and more sustainable car boss
by tribo tanks
introducing the view doorbell the
world's smartest video doorbell the idea

production and deliver it to your door
soon the view doorbell the world's
smartest video doorbell at your
fingertips
have you have a dream of an entire
automated practice management with Bell
robotics mowers and ball Pickers it's
now possible the Big Mo and the ball
