do you often have to sit for more than
an hour at a time or find yourself
constantly slouching and hunched over if
so I'm guessing you might be dealing
with back and shoulder pain as well and
having back pain can keep you from doing
and enjoying even the little things in
life that you used to do but it's not
your fault
it's likely your job requires it study
shows that one out of three people
suffer from back issues in the workplace
if you are spending hours sitting and
staring into your computer over time
doing this can cause pain and permanent
injury to your body but sitting like
this
puts your spine in perfect alignment
which automatically reduces the painful
pressure and tension you feel in your
neck and that and when you're not in
pain you can focus and think more
clearly did you know your head weighs
about 12 pounds and when you lean
forward
gravity can add up to 60 pounds of
pressure on your cervical spine it's no
wonder your back hurts all the time now
there is a simple drug-free solution
that you can set up in less than 30
seconds hi I'm Shirley tan the inventor
of posture keeper for 10 years I
struggle with neck and shoulder pain
caused by sitting at a desk for nine
hours a day every day to get help
I've done it all I've seen chiropractors
orthopedic surgeons and pain doctors I
had MRIs x-rays and more physical
therapy sessions than I can count
but nothing I tried gave me relief
finally I found the right doctor who
told me if I just stopped leaning
forward and corrected my posture the
stress on my neck would go away and so
with my pain then I tried most of the
gadgets out there I even bought an
expensive chair but none of them worked
so I had to create my own solution I
call it the posture keeper and it will
change people's lives I love the way
posture keeper feels on my back
makes me feel like I'm treating my body
well even at work even with a dad as a
chiropractor hunching over and rolled
shoulders were starting to become my
trademark then I had my moment with the
posture keeper and really straightened
me up here's how it works the posture
keeper gently reminds you to
self-correct
when you are slouching or leaning
forward over time you'll retrain your
muscle memory and body to maintain the
correct spinal alignment and reduce your
pain the posture keeper allows you to
stay in an active posture rather than
such a relaxed or sluggish posture where
usually the head is tilted forward the
shoulders are rolled forward
hence putting your upper back into a
state of kyphosis what the posture
keeper does it puts you more into and
assumed to active posture a more upright
posture taking pressure off your neck
your upper back increase your breathing
and metabolic rate thus giving you a
more function in all areas of life the
straps are comfortable lightweight and
designed to reduce neck and shoulder
tension while it's built in orthopedic
lumbar support cradles in comfort your
lower back the quick release design
allows for total mobility when you need
to stand or change position over the
last year I spend hundreds of hours
working with doctors and the factory
testing prototyping to perfect the
design and we're finally ready to show
you the model you see here today this
device will revolutionize the way you
sit and work I actually had no idea how
bad my posture was until trying the
posture keeper now my lower back upper
back my neck everything feels better I
highly recommend it
I read contracts all day long and the
case in my neck feels so much better
after using the posture keeper
whenever I let my colleagues try it they
always love it too and want to keep it
if you're sick of back pain keeping you
awake at night or you can't concentrate
at work I want to tell you it doesn't
have to be that way
please help us by backing posture keeper
today together we can change people's
lives and help them become pain-free I'm
Shirley tan and I want to thank you for
honoring me with your time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
