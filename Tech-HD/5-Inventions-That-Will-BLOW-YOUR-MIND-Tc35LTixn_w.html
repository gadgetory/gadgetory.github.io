were just here involved after hundreds
of prototypes Tessa the violent
information to look Alan is our version
comfortable market utter fear camp cubes
organic form last hold it and riser
displayed that are all written onto a
typical panel is also bilateral
especially sevens it works for both
recommend Pamela equal the designer
series have a human partner bomb Monique
and changing out Liz quick deep and six
she is a magnet and exactly absolutely
Valentina's preventively picks up
thicker materials automatically teaser a
new be offering full solver cookies as
well as injections of the plastic to the
wood handle knife is perfect with the
artistic craft who love beauty tool and
the plastic handle is the affordable
accessible option which we want to be
able to every art architecture student
qe works with a cell with exact a few
growth all other major brands and
precision recently the quality model in
between an eight-year us there's
significant that's what we need your
help with your contribution

precise us now hardly traditional head
and our public defender sold to you
beijing-based artist lee hyunwoo crises
amazing sculptured out of stack sheets
of paper the idea for these sculptures
comes from traditional Chinese paper
decorations and toys each bus that Lee
humble crates comprises of roughly 7,000
to 26,000 sheets of white paper they're
glued together in the honeycomb
structure which gives the sculpture
added stability this process is
painstakingly done by hand she by sheet
we Hong go even has an assistant that
helps me do this please sculptures are
made up of numerous stacks of the glue
paper leak glues around 350 sheets into
a stack and then cuts the stacked with a
Woodworking saw into the rough shape of
that section of the sculpture small
sculptures will I need a few stacks of
glue paper where larger ones may demands
40 to 50 stacks after the stacks are
placed
he uses an angle grinder to fine-tune
the sculpture shape once the majority of
the form is complete Lee will then use
sandpaper to smooth the sculpture and
complete his final piece each one of Li
Zhong de sculptures can take up two
months to complete
Lee has been featured in numerous
exhibitions starting since 2007 using
gained popularity year after year after
the sculpture is complete a shock comes
when he grabs it and he starts morphing
it around what do you guys single with
