yelling about how his dog ate his paper
this is John in the same situation using
brick so what is brick so it's an
awesome version of building blocks that
makes your designs come to life with
electricity sensors and Bluetooth let's
see some prototypes from our testing lab
closing a circuit this is Bluetooth
sound sensor light sensor proximity
sensor how amazing is using brick so
this is Kate making her morning coffee
while discovering Roy used all the milk
for his cereal this is Kate same
situation with Rick cell brick so has
three types of locks connectors action
blocks and trigger blocks use the
connectors to make a circuit then embed
the action box to give your design light
or movement now you can use trigger
blocks to control your design with sound
proximity and light Rick so can also be
controlled remotely which means you can
connect your design to your phone and
even to the Internet and automate stuff
if you're into that sort of thing but
who likes to automate stop right oh and
there's a battery block which well is
the battery here's Mike while his
coworker turns off the air conditioner
even though it is 90 degrees outside
this is Mike same situation with brick
saw you can use brick so to upgrade
designs made with regular building
blocks which will make them like a
hundred times cooler no wires needed all
break so block components are built in
brick so is also an amazing educational
tool for your kids but know that they'll
forever mock regular building blocks
buzz and Amir have been working on break
so for a long time they're both
physicists so they know a thing or two
about electricity so if you like
building stuff and don't
I am getting addicted support them and
get your own brick so it'll change your
life or just make you happy brick
