loud it's like like you can plate like
you're like a one-man band
the
now eleven signs of my practice sampling
all my Pelton stuff the answer ten times
as big and doesn't sound nearly get I
love that I can just tune it right on
the spot here and then when I want to I
can just pick up and go alright thanks
man in the past piece on the rise of the
typical electric guitar amplifiers
they're big loud and push a lot of air
but frankly come with some pretty
serious limitations amps just refused to
move on introducing the jam staff the
world's first attachable guitar
amplifier and the most versatile way to
play the electric guitar traditional
amps take a long time to set up this can
kill not only your motivation but your
inspiration as well unless you've got
the space to lead or gear setup getting
going with a fax can be a pretty big
pain in the butt the jam stack attaches
in seconds
Hey
mmm
okay say you have space to always leave
it here setup to really is most of live
in places where jamming at full volume
is just too loud but when you turn down
traditional amps even a little it makes
them sound choked and frankly pretty
crappy also ants can do very little out
of the box you need several hundred
dollars of pedals to really take
advantage of that massive speaker with a
jam staff you can easily access cool
effects like delays loops or distortions
all powered by any smartphone
okay let's say you want to get mobile
and head out into the world well that's
going to be difficult when you take into
account your amps wires pedals and
guitar that's a lot to carry for one
person the jam staff packs up easily and
can fit in your jacket pocket and even
your guitar case even cheap practice
amps are heavy and a real pain to bring
anywhere the jam stack gives you the
freedom to play anywhere with your
traditional amp you're going to need to
find some power so what about portable
amps you ask these amps sound terrible
at any volume don't allow you to use a
fact and still don't give you the same
level of freedom as an acoustic guitar
player enjoys
see you have to compromise with current
solutions
you either have sound quality or
portability but not both that's why we
created a brand new way to play the
electric guitar one with no compromises
and unlimited potential the jam stack
attaches to the base of any electric
guitar body uses any smartphone for
effects and allows you to bring
shockingly rich down anywhere you want
no limitations in effects and recording
no limitations and where and when you
play just pure enjoyment but wait what
if I just want to play music to my
puzzle it also functions as an ultra
premium bluetooth speaker so feel free
to snap it off and set it down to
entertain your friends like not good
father this is going to work the jam
stack is durable and designed to be
taken anywhere it'll last you eight
hours on a single charge and is gentle
on your guitar
we've already funded our design and are
working hard with reputable industrial
design firm and manufacturing so ask
yourself why go to the trouble to halt
your entire rig width when it could be
this easy why spend this much money when
all you need is this
why settle for poor sound quality when
the jam stack sounds like this
help us make the jam stacker reality
thank you
[Laughter]

hi my name is Glenn clucker this is my
son Nathan I I've been a engineer and
designer and inventor for about 14 years
now and I've designed a lot of knives
and multi tools that you might be
familiar with I came up with the idea
for the clacks last year over the last
six months I've been designing
developing prototyping and testing out
the clocks to end up with the floor
versions that we have here today the
clacks is more than an axe the clacks is
a multi-tool built into the head of an
axe it has a lot of useful features
carabiner thumb jimping this is the
bottle opener the axe blade the scraper
lanyard hole the hammer with a built-in
ruler five wrench sizes and a hex bit
driver the clacks has a lot of useful
features like wrenches hammer head and
scraper along with our innovative new
clamping system that allows you to take
the axe to the field and be able to
break it down for easy transport relax
is useful for people who are involved in
hiking climbing camping survival experts
people who do bushcraft all sorts of
things including emergency preparedness
I'm Mike peel for Mike Pihl logging
Vernonia Oregon and I'm a logger the
clacks it's a great tool this morning I
used it to wedge over a Douglas fir tree
and it did a good job
this is the klax lumberjack it's our
most popular model because it includes
all of the features this is the clacks
woodsman the clacks woodsman has the
clamping system carabiner hammer the axe
blade but the more rustic version that
we've created is called the clacks
feller the clacks feller attaches using
the paracord bracelet by pulling the
paracord out and wrapping it around the
handle like you would a tomahawk this is
the tie clacks the tie clacks is a
titanium version of the clocks
lumberjack it is our top of the line
model and it includes all of the
features plus it has blue anodized
highlights and it comes weighing in at
half of the weight of the feller that's
why the tie clacks is our top of the
line model we've backed to dozen
projects on our own already we're
reaching out to you the Kickstarter
community to see if you'll help us by
backing us to get the clasp out there
glass thanks for watching we appreciate
your support
relax more than an axe
if you wanted to make a realistic
picture in the days before photography
was invented you had to draw it and for
centuries artists use optical
technologies to help them make those
realistic drawing tools like the 19th
century camera lucida leverage
cutting-edge technology to help artists
draw accurately from real life in the
camera lucida it looked down into a
special prism you see your subject and
your hand superimposed so you can trace
directly from real life in 2013 I teamed
up with fellow art professor Golan Levin
and made the NIA lucida an inexpensive
but authentic replica of the vintage
camera lucida we just figured this will
be for art history nerds like us but to
our surprise over 11,000 backers
supported us people really wanted to
draw with it obsolete tool and since
then we've sold over 25,000 neela CDs
and ship them to over 90 countries but
one thing we heard over and over again
people would say this is hard and we
would say we know the prism is really
small and so the viewing area is really
small using camera lucida and other
optical drawing tools took skill and a
lot of practice it certainly wasn't a
magical path to making masterpieces but
we were inspired thousands of people got
excited about drawing from our first
Kickstarter so could we make a nuni
lucida one that had a larger viewing
area and was easy to use and not just
for enthusiasts and art history nerds
but for young artists and beginners of
all ages so after two years of testing
and prototypes here it is the Neal
heceta XL totally redesigned with a
larger viewing area to make drawing just
a little bit easier how does it work
clamp your nielsie 2 XL to your drawing
table then adjust the flexible arm to
place the viewer over your paper when
you look down into the new Lucita XL you
see through the glass to your page but
the glass also reflects an image off of
the mirrors making a ghost image of your
subject and because the image reflects
twice the image isn't backwards or
upside down so you can just trace what
you see
when you're done fold up the needles
free to Excel put it in the custom patch
provided it's lightweight compact and
doesn't even require any batteries
drawing from life is hard
the world is three-dimensional but your
page is flat drawing tools like the new
Lucita flatten a real-world image onto
your page for tracing it may not be a
shortcut to great masterpieces but it
just may make drawing a little bit less
frustrating and sometimes that's all it
takes to motivate you so support the
elsita and let's get drawing
70% of Americans have trouble falling
asleep at least one night a week it's
never been harder to turn off our mind
completely unplug and reach a deep
relaxation and restless that we actually
need introducing gravity a weighted
blanket engineered to be 10% of your
body weight to naturally reduce stress
and increase relaxation through deep
pressure stimulation over the last year
we've studied the incredible science and
medical research about the positive
effects that weighted blankets can have
on serious conditions like PTSD insomnia
OCD and serious forms of anxiety this is
critical because 40 million people in
the country suffer from prolonged
anxiety that is 18 percent of the
country and so we wanted to take this
science and design a product that could
help everyone each gravity blanket is
tailored to represent about 10% of your
body weight it evenly distributes
pressure across your body while you rest
by stimulating these pressure points
gravity blanket increases serotonin and
melatonin levels while decreasing
cortisol no some studies even reported
that 90 percent of participants felt an
overall calmer feeling and a reduced
sense of anxiety and it isn't just for
sleep the black you can be used in bed
or it can be used on the couch after a
super long day or it can assist you in
reaching a deeper meditation or mindful
we've developed a range of weighted
options spanning from 15 20 and 25
pounds to fit your individual needs and
preferences from beautiful design to
material sourcing we set out to create a
blanket
that looks and feels as great as it
performs the inner shell is a hundred
percent cotton while the outer shell is
a beautiful and ultra comfortable micro
plush fabric the soft outer shell
provides amazing comfort for warmth
during the colder months and it's easily
removable to remain cool during the
summer this also makes it super easy to
wash our trusted manufacturing partners
are ready to go all we need is your
support to make this product a reality
