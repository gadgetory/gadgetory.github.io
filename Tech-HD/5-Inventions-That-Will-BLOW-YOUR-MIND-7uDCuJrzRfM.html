I love going outdoors staying connected
with great Mother Nature and staying
connected with family and friends I love
sharing my adventures but I've realized
that it's really hard to get access to
electricity to stay connected outdoors
the thing is today's mobile devices use
significantly less power than
traditional consumer electronics so one
day I came up with the idea what if we
could convert every energy resource into
personal power I want to introduce you
to e stream it's a portable water
powered generator it converts any type
of running water into stored energy you
can get personal on-demand power with
nothing but water energy this is how it
works
remove the cover unfold the turbines and
lock them
hook and release eastream into running
water let it spin freely to generate
electricity and it charges the built-in
battery it takes approximately 4.5 hours
to fully charge one eastream which can
charge up to three smartphones GoPros or
tablet PCs two times faster than
charging through an outlet
you can also use it as a lantern with
four different modes even underwater
eastream works well even in weak current
for behind a kayak and regardless of the
weather or time of day it fits perfectly
into any sized backpack it's ideal for
use while you enjoy camping fishing
kayaking biking or any other outdoor
activities we didn't start it just to
charge your smartphone at the campsite
we wanted to provide a personal on
demand energy our goal is to discover
every energy resource around you and
convert them into your own power we've
been working hard to get here to meet
you
our journey has just begun please join
us in our adventure let's embark on this
journey together stay connected as one
by November yes Thank You Cigna Brussels
thank you thank you
yeah
you
you
yeah
you
you
before heard that sleep is important or
that we spend a third of our life in bed
but quality sleep is rarely what we need
and it seems harder and harder to
achieve these days what if your pillow
could be an active participant in your
sleep rather than just a dumb rectangle
what if your pillow could help you fall
asleep
you could analyze your sleep
intelligently wake you up or even react
to when you snore here we believe a
pillow should do that that's why we
invented Zeke
the world's most sophisticated pillow
the easiest way to think about what Zeke
does is to walk you through how you
would use these before you go to bed
you'll open up the Z gap you're going to
set your alarm answer a few optional
questions about your day even choose
what kind of music you want to listen to
Zeke will wirelessly stream your
favorite music whether it's iTunes
Spotify or some of the included sleep
tracks to eight precision placed
speakers inside once your sleep timer
goes off Zeke starts monitoring and
analyzing your sleep as well as
listening for snoring
if Zeke detects your snoring too loud
it'll subtly vibrate to encourage you to
change sleep positions additionally when
it's time to wake up is equal vibrate
again to make sure you wake up exactly
when you wanted to but what's really
neat is with our smart wake feature
since we're already analyzing your sleep
we can tell if you should wake up a
little earlier than your alarm
I needed music to fall asleep at night
but my wife needs absolute silence so
one night I took a pot a pair of
wireless headphones and shoved them
inside my pillow and to my surprise I
was able to hear the music but my wife
wasn't I knew I was on to something so I
began to figure out how I could make
this pillow better
Zeke's packed with amazing innovations
and technology in order to make all of
this happen we use eight speakers inside
of Z so the sleeper can experience their
sleep playlist no matter how they lay on
their pillow Zeke also features a 3-axis
gyroscope to analyze motion in
three-dimensional space this is going to
allow for detailed analysis of your
sleep the microphone in Z is so
sensitive it can determine to the
decibel level how loudly your snoring
if you do begin snoring zekeyl use its
vibration motors to gently nudge you to
encourage you to change sleep position
you can wake you up either at your set
alarm time or using smart wake wake you
up
based on your sleep cycle all the Zeke
settings can be personalized to your
specific sleep needs in the app any time
we went through many different component
designs to come up with a pillow that
was not only smart and sophisticated but
also incredibly comfortable for the
sleeper comfort is one of the most
important aspects when choosing a pillow
and as we tested various fabrics for the
outer cover of Zeke
we found that tensile was the perfect
choice we spent the last two years
making Zeke out favorite pillow and it's
nearly ready for you all the hard work
is being done the prototypes finalized
the supplies are lined up we just need
your help to start mass production
please help us bring Zeke to you thank
you for your support
I never really thought it was a problem
I'd always suspected those around me had
seen my incessant pen clicking me
shaking and desk tapping but I had no
idea how bad they got
I just figured it all the time with
anything I could get my hands on didn't
matter what a bubble wrap a bubble wrap
the way pop-pop-pop
I just couldn't get enough that was
probably where
thankfully my Kickstarter community told
me
from the people that brought you to it
comes over the counter fidget cube
fidget cube is a final desk toy designed
to satisfy any urges to click roll spin
and other common fidgety impulses
without driving your colleagues and
loved ones away
the GQ is it cube that you fidget with
studies have suggested that fidgeting
increases focus and improves
productivity side effects may include a
sudden ability to cope with boring
meetings pay attention in class power
through Netflix marathons which a club
is designed to allow discrete visioning
in any setting do not fidget cube if you
have an aversion to rectangular prisms
digicube lets me satisfy my fidgeting
without endlessly annoying those around
me I thought I could stop at any time
and now I realize I don't want to fidget
cube can help take the first step to
fidget in freedom today okay so in all
seriousness we make joke about fidgeting
we give our friends and coworkers a hard
time for the pen clicking and the nail
biting but what if there aren't
something what opinion is a coping
mechanism a way for us to stay focused
and more present in the moment sometimes
is smarter than us believe that we have
this thing called floating attention
which makes it hard for us to focus in
certain circumstances okay hey Mark yeah
yeah and actually the genie has been
shown to be able to help keep that
floating attention occupied which helps
you better focus on the task at hand
what's maybe even a little crazier is
that some recent studies have suggested
that students who use fidgeting as a
mechanism during testing tend to perform
better on the test and when their arts
itself bridgett cube has been a project
we've dreamt about for almost 4 years
now and we're excited to finally be
bringing it to you it's been a long road
with a lot of prototypes but we think
we're going
when designing fidgets cube we wanted to
ensure two things first the
functionality needed to truly satisfy
fidgeting needs it needed to be an
entire toolbox of fidgety options while
staying small and compact which leads us
to our second and equally important
priority we wanted physic u'b to be a
premium desk toy that could be
discreetly used in any situation from a
classroom to a board</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
