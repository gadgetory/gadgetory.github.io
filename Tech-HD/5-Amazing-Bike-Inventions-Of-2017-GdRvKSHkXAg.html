you
three years ago we started our journey
to really make light power meters
affordable and now we need you to be
part of our test team teams SWAT the
first sales are made to leading brands
but to take the technology one step
further we need a lot of more diverse
test data to refine the algorithms
that's why we need people like you to
share raw data with us get your own bike
power meter and be part of the world's
largest test team dedicated to improve
power meter technology we want to get
more out of the data and bring down the
cost to the point where all your bikes
can have one so in other words by
crowdsourcing this collection of data we
will be able to take the technology to
the next level with our Kickstarter deal
you can get a bike power meter for a
really low price if you share just 30
minutes of ride data per month on a
trainer up a mountain in a forest on the
road you decide we want it all to make
the deal even better we split the price
into a low hardware cost and a small
monthly maintenance fee and as long as
you keep riding for us we even give you
a 50% discount on the monthly fee we
have developed several different models
based on the same firmware and
electronics they all measure both power
cables and other parameters the
rechargeable battery can be charged
using your phone charger and yes they
are all waterproof
be part of team swap today cheer your
ride data collected with the app and
help us to take this technology one step
further
oh hey Kickstarter no you weren't
interrupting I'm just doing that later I
got a project I want to show you so a
little bit about myself I'm 17 years old
and I'm currently a junior in high
school my dad's an engineer and he's
always been inspiring me to build stuff
with my hands so like I said over the
past three years I've been working on
this project and it's almost there so I
just need your guy's help I've made a
little video to help you understand what
I'm trying to do so roll video wait no
come on guys we need something a little
bit more inspirational revolutionary
let's get a background going all right
perfect
it's good beat going start with an idea
make coffee just kidding I don't drink
coffee sketch the design kill the design
think some more get out the sewing
machine make a seat sit on it stop
sitting start doing find it found it
test it back to the drawing board tear
tear share let's do this for real
machine it well bit
reveal it give it a leather seat give it
red stitching give it a shiny paint job
give it a handle for precise steering
did I mention it spins
consonant get it in the newspaper patent
it again we're on a mission to make a
product that is not only unique but fun
as well when you're sitting five inches
off the ground suddenly every tree
becomes an obstacle every ramp becomes
an opportunity in every corner becomes a
drift
spin-spin-spin your way to happiness
find your path or your turn because in
the end it's all about the feelings and
the excitement this is what you've been
waiting for so go ahead get on the one
hi I'm Joe head zukie and you just met
my son Tyler I've been designing and
manufacturing products for over 20 years
a couple of my favorite products are
revolution graphite skateboard and our
four line kite when my son came to me
with the design for a bike he wanted to
build I said let's do it after we built
a few prototypes and did some road
testing we knew we had something special
well we like best about the design is
his versatility its steering
capabilities are incredible
the seat can be adjusted within seconds
it's fast enough to be used for
transportation now I'm not sure I'd be
riding this to work but it's pretty fun
to ride through the park and go get an
ice cream now the important part
Kickstarter we need your support
