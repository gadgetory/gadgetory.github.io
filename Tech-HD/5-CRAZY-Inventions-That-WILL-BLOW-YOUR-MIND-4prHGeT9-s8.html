invented the world's first multi gym

you to do pull-ups push-ups and are an
anchor for other fitness gear
accessories to make the ultimate gear we
talked to hundreds of people who care
about fitness and found that needed to

patent-pending design allows cross grips
to lock on to almost any doorframe
because you should be able to bring your
workout with you no matter where you go

seconds and an internal spring allows it
to securely clamp on to your door so you

introducing spark maker full-hd
the most affordable 1080p SLA 3d printer
featuring better printing quality faster
printing speed and larger building
volume and the most important thing is
that we keep the full HD version
affordable as always our approach to
making affordable 3d printers has been
proven in our first kickstarter campaign
now we are back with the second
generation of spark Maker with 1080p
high resolution thanks to the 1080p LCD
screen spark maker full HD can achieve a
resolution of 57 micrometers in XY axes
and 25 micrometers in the z axis giving
you more flexibility and freedom for
jewelry dental or prototype designs
spark maker full HD keeps the SD card
slot so that you can easily print off
line to make printing more convenient we
developed an app to control the printer
through your smartphone simply select
the STL file in the app and you can
start printing wirelessly right away
we are also watching for additional
types of resin so you can have more
options for your printings it has been a
great journey since we first launched on
