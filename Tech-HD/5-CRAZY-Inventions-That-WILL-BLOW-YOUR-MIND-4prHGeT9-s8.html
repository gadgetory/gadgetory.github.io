fitness gear created with one purpose in
mind and that purpose is you so that no
matter what no matter where you can be
fit most of us know that fitness is
important but we need equipment that's
better at meeting our needs the crowded
gyms the bulky equipment and the cost of
it all make it hard to access equipment
that will keep us fit that's why we
created cross grips here at J flex we
invented the world's first multi gym
fitness handles these two grips allow
you to do pull-ups push-ups and are an
anchor for other fitness gear
accessories to make the ultimate gear we
talked to hundreds of people who care
about fitness and found that needed to
be three things compact versatile and
quality crossed ribs are compact they
transform from pull-ups to push-ups to
the size of a book making cross grips
mighty small it's the upper body workout
you can take wherever you go try
bringing the alternative not gonna
happen
so whether you're at home at work or
halfway around the world we've got you
covered
cross grips are versatile as to
individual handles they allow you to do
multiple variations of pull-ups and
push-ups for a complete upper body
workout need help with situps
cross grips has your back and feet cross
grips also serves as the perfect anchor
for ab straps extension straps
distant pants so you can trade a roomful
of equipment in your home or gym for
this finally cross grips are quality our
patent-pending design allows cross grips
to lock on to almost any doorframe
because you should be able to bring your
workout with you no matter where you go
you can set them up in less than 15
seconds and an internal spring allows it
to securely clamp on to your door so you
can exercise with full confidence that
means more of this and less of that we
also know that your equipment needs to
be as strong as you are no problem
cross grips hold up to 300 pounds in
weight if you have felt the pain of
trying to stay fit and balance life at
the same time cross grips are for you
after almost a year of research and
development and now with world-class
manufacturer standing by we can't wait
to put cross grips into your hands my
backing this Kickstarter campaign you'll
be one of the first people in the world
to have the gym that fits anywhere so
you can be fit
introducing spark maker full-hd
the most affordable 1080p SLA 3d printer
featuring better printing quality faster
printing speed and larger building
volume and the most important thing is
that we keep the full HD version
affordable as always our approach to
making affordable 3d printers has been
proven in our first kickstarter campaign
now we are back with the second
generation of spark Maker with 1080p
high resolution thanks to the 1080p LCD
screen spark maker full HD can achieve a
resolution of 57 micrometers in XY axes
and 25 micrometers in the z axis giving
you more flexibility and freedom for
jewelry dental or prototype designs
spark maker full HD keeps the SD card
slot so that you can easily print off
line to make printing more convenient we
developed an app to control the printer
through your smartphone simply select
the STL file in the app and you can
start printing wirelessly right away
we are also watching for additional
types of resin so you can have more
options for your printings it has been a
great journey since we first launched on

very experienced 3d print fans and group
together we appreciate all the help you
