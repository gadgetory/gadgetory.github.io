treated with chlorine and it's
continually getting harder to hydrate
ourselves during the day the tap water
we drink leave the glitzy of debate in
considering more than part of our body
is made up of water it's a crucial
supplement where energy levels and a day
to day function going to do seem to
refill an activated charcoal filter that
removes chlorine and other organic
contaminants from tap water engineers
but on the 6550 of the plastic bottles
you'd find in the city market over the
last two years we've been studying the
science of activated charcoal and the
filtering qualities that has been tapped
were deposited to the pool and it's
proven to move to liquid metal even some
chemical contaminant so we wanted to
utilize the science and design a product
that was benefit everyone each filter
contains an activated charcoal stick
made from coconut shells they can filter
a 700 ml bottle 150 times or for 105
liter activated charcoal has made a
small low volume quart and one gram of
it has a surface area of one Demeter
twigs were just he bit into size of a
football field the force contained
negatively charged ions which attract
the positively charged elements from tap
water as lead copper and pouring it
effectively removes these contaminants
but retains the Metra mineral
loading in a fish and flower filtration
we visited the five main supermarket
here in New Zealand and we found with
exclusive on 265 the theme of the
bottles you could buy off the shelf
which in a global nature could because
of thousands of differences odor and
water beverage bottles in a refillable
identity
this means that encourages people to
keep reusing their pre-loved plastic
bottle as pivot of the scene of the
world new bottles go to landfill and we
believe refill of another step in the
reduction of favorite bottle consumption
worldwide the encasement has a hexagonal
and mixed all designs achieving extreme
line and steady flow it made from
recyclable plastic the 28 millimeter
super cap means we can screw into a huge
range of beverage bottles all around the
world for any person which means that
makes it the ultimate travel accessory
and anywhere you go you can have access
to filtered and tasteless tap fluid with
a hundred and fifty rupees of 700 ml
bottles you can save hundreds if not
thousands of dollars on bottled water
each year Luke's been a countless amount
of time perfecting and finalizing the
design to get it to this point of
manufacture no we need now is your
support to make this product a reality
two years ago we set out to change the
way backpacks are you we redesigned
everything everything buckle and we
released Joey and you loved it all your
support inspired us to challenge
ourselves even further so we started
thinking about today's wallets
let's face it wallets are either bulky
and uncomfortable or way too minimal so
we came up with something new to combine
fantastic traditional materials with an
innovative design meet Jin Jin has just
two compartments you can access
everything you need in one swift motion
the stainless steel clip can hold ten
cards twenty bills for any combination
of the two so there's no wasted state
coin it has a pocket that holds
everything from coin to key to us DC
we've also given Jin a concealed drawer
for small items you need to keep safe oh
and once again we've got your back
Jin comes with an RFID blocking card so
forget about your information being
stolen everything about this wallet then
and like we make out of leather or
microfiber so you can choose the style
that's right for you Jin's is tiny but
it's got room for everything you need
everyday everywhere
this is our second campaign and once
again we're ready for production we just
need your support to make it happen from
our whole team here at koala gear we
want to thank you for bringing gin to
life
you
you
hi I'm and I'm Audrey and together at
weave NP design Co with independent
product design studio in Detroit what we
do best is make really nice toys and
gifts especially ones that you assemble
yourself lately please become obsessed
with pipes pipes are awesome because
every single culture around the world
has their own design we've made over 50
versions small kites and big posters
reading everything from paper to ripstop
nylon china bamboo and tape to see what
gets the best results along the way
after all these iterations were ready to
present the Kakaako cupcake it's a
rectangular project with two long tails
in a single bridle it's as easy as again
this is an educational paper and bamboo
kite kit that teaches you how to put it
together we wanted to make it as easy to
assemble as humanly possible so all
materials are included the kite has
peel-and-stick adhesive to make
construction completely mess free
assembly only takes five to ten minutes
and as you put it together the
instructions disappear once it's ready a
beautiful pattern kite is ready to soar
we try to make our products as locally
as possible so our girls positively
affects our community and this Pike kit
is no different
our kit also comes with bamboo that's
cut the length reinforcements to keep
your pipe going a handle with strings
and elastic bowline for extra stability
as we were holding it around
we realized that it needed a case to
keep its face between floyd so we
designed a super-fun cardboard briefcase
that uses the kite string handle as the
handle our goal in this project is to
create a clay kit at an accessible price
point that's both beautiful and flies
great we're excited to tell you that our
design has been finalized and our kite
kit is ready for production it will be
available in three colors peach mint and
black and white with three different
geometric patterns printed directly on
the front we're three years old and
completely self-funded and we need your
help to produce this content of scale
with your generous contributions we'd be
able to get the diagnose and buy the
materials in order to manufacture the
first round pick with your help this
kite kite will become a reality
