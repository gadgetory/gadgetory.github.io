my name's Dan Campbell I'm an aerospace
research engineer at Aurora flight
sciences and this is the world's first
3d printed jet-powered aircraft
our goal with this project was to show
the aerospace industry how quickly you
can go from designing building and
flying a 3d printed jet-powered aircraft
my name is James Berlin I'm an additive
manufacturing research engineer at
strategy aurora flight sciences is
really pushing the boundaries of what's
possible with flight Stratos is on the
other hand is pushing the boundaries of
what's possible with additive
manufacturing so it's really a great
relationship recently we decided to
really see how far we could push the
envelope
no one has 3d printed in aircraft this
big this fast and this complex Stratasys
3d printing can address these challenges
through design freedom design freedom
can help number one with weight so
reducing the weight of components to
meet stricter fuel requirements and also
by creating components that have higher
levels of functionality or higher levels
of complexity than what's otherwise
possible with other technologies one of
the things this aircraft represents is
the ability to make a mission specific
aircraft we can really create an
aircraft that's designed to do one
specific thing because the cost of
producing a one-off aircraft with
additive manufacturing is significantly
less than with other traditional
manufacturing processes just as much as
cost or saving on schedule I think
that's really where the technology shine
we're talking about a schedule that's
half the design and build time of
additional manufacturing methods the
design process was completely
collaborative so there was weekly design
reviews there's a lot of back and forth
the stratasys grab cast system allows us
to manage the CAD models to communicate
back and forth these line changes we're
able the real-time track things like
wait how components fit together and how
different portions of the airplane will
come along some of the more functional
components took up to 20 iterations they
get right so in terms of time for making
it iteration because we're updating a
digital inventory it's a matter of
simply replacing the CAD file this
aircraft is 80 percent 3d printed by
weight 100 percent of the parts I work
for an anomalous aircraft were either
printed at Stratasys or printed by
Stratasys technologies
their craft is about 30 pounds as a
9-foot wingspan jet engine capable of
around 150 miles per hour this aircraft
is made primarily out of FDM aasa'
they're more plastic there are also LS
parts so the fuel think for example is
made from no less and the nozzle the
exhaust nozzle is made from DMLs it's
actually inconel material in the future
3d printing will allow the aerospace
industries to build more affordable
aircraft to build more aircraft specific
to certain missions really allow the
industry to be more agile and with
Stratasys you can tell that's part of
their culture
you
it's a revelation
it's a vision of the future of mobility
not only tumor on your card like an
inferior for extra components it's
really an airless tire wears a tie
without pressure
the second aspect which is a
connectivity ecosystem we can help the
consumer in a journey giving information
to the tire to avatar in need in terms
of safety and mobility and the last part
which is really really revolution it's a
biodegradable tread that can be
recharged with a 3d printer on demand
this is beautiful as the nature this
inspires
I'm Clint O'Connor and Penhall a
Kickstarter project I have a passion for
pinhole photography a deduct man the
visual impact of images always been very
important to me I love the unique
perspective of pinhole camera and analog
quality of film this is the simplest
possible form of photography that are
nothing more than a box but the hole on
one end and film on the others I've
taken ten whole picture the far north of
Labrador and candidate and a far
solitude Antarctica question a I've done
trouble design projects project using my
3d please and I thought this would be a
great way to do it again and Berrigan
usually depend on camera
3d pointing offers a way to produce go
deep in Hall camera well definitely
tells us to get a reasonable place and
so called your cell latex technology to
produce something so simple for those of
you who view cameras before this will
give you a different perspective on life
and art and those have for those of
Europe growing up with only digital
cameras the camera will take you back to
an earlier time and give you a new way
to look upon the world I've been using
one of prints prototype pinhole camera
whilst on vacation I have never used
stone before but this camera is so easy
to you I usually use my iPhone and I
usually upload photos onto Instagram and
use the filters on there to achieve
interesting results but in fact this is
the real deal
I want to show you some of the pictures
that I have taken on this and I also
want to show you how easy the fifteen
years first you unwind at school
you insert it into the camera like this
put the lid on
and attached eve of the family
there are some pictures that we took
with the camera
I need your help to finalize the design
and portability of the camels and to
went to enough film to read about the
exposure tables we will need to take
pictures with it like well I would like
there to do you and your children here
the magic would be a point kind of help
and hold photography and the bygone era
of film thank you for listening to my
pitch
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
