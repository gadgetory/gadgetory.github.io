lumen boards is introducing illuminating
skateboarding that means we developed a
product which combines the best
materials of glass and wood and giving
you the feeling of a skateboard which
can be light up with just one click
skateboarding started with rebellion and
the combination of materials that were
not supposed to work together
combining glass and wood into a
brand-new product I'm skating for longer
than 10 years right now the
skateboarding was ever feeling combining
and creating new stuff getting along
with my environment getting new
friendships and having fun I've tried to
create a new product with new materials
never been created it is designed to
have a futuristic look designed like a
hard work
but sir give you the feeling of a board
made out of wood innovation and
technology was always about creating new
things combining all the known stuff
with new elements so we came up with an
idea that was never done before
you're not skating in on the board
you're skating light under your feet so
this is where it needs your help we're
trying to raise money to get our product
all over the world glass and wood
combined and pure beauty this is room

Eisenhower he's watching a movie hi I'm
Louie Crowe medical doctor the
researcher and an inventor I have done
the caloric equivalent of a marathon on
my couch watching TV
I've even trained for a marathon with no
running no pounding of the joints just
this ionic chip an app and a wrap that
goes around your tights electronic
impulses of stimulates and muscles to
exercise the users at low levels the
equivalent of walking you can burn
calories at work maybe to slim down you

pretty good doing a session Partrick 54
warm up and then peak levels my heart is
beating as fast as it can maintain this
for an hour and stop I've gotta taste
and calories this was a tough
it's well researched and proven we've
loved scientific publications we've even
tried it with European Space Agency in
zero-gravity it works up there too that
was fun hi I'm Barry Broderick the
electronic engineer responsible for
bionic Jim's physical device we have a
working prototype but before we go to
market I mean to shrink the size of
electronic components to make it ready
for mass manufacture we need to further
develop the user interface of our app to
make the consumer ready we can only
achieve this with your support so please
join us and spread to add importantly
pledge today so we can get the ionic jam
into production thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
