i love yu ting great food and i love
sharing great food that i made cooking
can be stressful especially when making
new food cooking for a family or
entertaining guests how many times have
you made a recipe well wants but can't
duplicate the results the next time when
you serve two friends hi I'm Chris we
wanted an easy way for aspiring cooks
like me to make food perfectly every
time so we created the paragon induction
cooktop a critical element of cooking
food rightist temperature Paragon takes
the guesswork out of cooking with this
wireless sensor that communicates the
precise temperature of your food to the
cooktop the cooktop uses a constant
stream of information to adjust the
burner power level so that your food is
cooked to perfection you just set the
temperature and walk away one of the
coolest applications of Paragon
precision cooking is called sous vide
it's a method that's been used in top
restaurants for years because it
produces consistent results with very
little supervision simply seal the
ingredients in an airtight bag and place
them in a pot of water attach the
magnetic temperature sensor set the
desired temperature and press Start you
can use the optional Paragon mobile app
to find the right time and temperature
for your food in three simple touches
Paragon maintains precise water
temperature to cook food evenly
throughout once it's done cooking
briefly sear and serve with sous vide
you can achieve edge to edge medium-rare
medium well or whatever you like with
Paragons precise temperature control you
can be sure that food will be cooked
perfect every time I don't like having
extra stuff in my kitchen so I wanted to
develop an appliance that can do several
things and do them well Paragon is
versatile it can deep-fry sous-vide sear
saute our just maintain food at serving
temperature you can remotely check on
the progress of your food and even get
notifications when it's ready Paragon
will hold food at the right temperature
until ready to serve so you can focus on
what you want
do with the Paragon induction cooktop
you can easily master the art of
precision cooking Paragon is coming
about through collaboration with a
community of designers engineers and
food scientists who are fueling the
evolution of home cooking using our open
source API community members are already
working on additional applications like
brewing beer and making candy and it's
just the beginning with your help we
will improve the app lower cost of
production and enhance features I've
been developing appliances for over 13
years and Paragon is the product that I
have always wanted

our journey started three years ago
inspired by NASA we set out to find a
technology to grow plants without
watering and fertilizing after lots of
research we created our first smart
garden and the idea caught on quickly
today click and grow smart Gardens can
be found in more than 50,000 homes
around the world I got to hide the car
degree after i read that nasa can grow
plants in space and that while there is
all this great technology people threw
away billions of dollars for house plans
every year our first product was
successful but we wanted to make it even
better so we went back to the drawing
board we designed a smart herb garden
that has a built-in light and can grow
three plants at a time it is extremely
easy to use but the technology behind it
is far from simple the backbone of click
and grow is what the plants grow in this
material here may look like normal soil
but this is nano material we've
engineered it to provide the ideal
amount of oxygen and nutrients for plant
roots at all times in a normal flowerpot
soil gets compacted which reduces the
oxygen available for plant roots
furthermore when you water the plant
nutrients are flushed out and lost in
our growth medium nutrients and oxygen
are available in nanotechnological
capsules throughout the soft bread water
fills the material evenly and the plant
always has access to the right amount of
oxygen and nutrients we also put a lot
of effort into the lighting solution we
worked with the world's leading led
companies to invent a light that is
perfect for plants and looks natural
with the new clicking grow smart herb
garden you can grow three herbs with the
tiniest amount of effort
the starter kit comes with basil thyme
and lemon balm to add flavor and variety
to your cooking plant refills will also
be available so you can grow various
other herbs mini Tomatoes Chili Peppers
or even strawberries in your kitchen or
living room help us build this smart
garden so you can enjoy fresh herbs at
home all year round</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
