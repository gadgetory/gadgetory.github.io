send and receive messages browse through
news feeds Trek Fitness stats and much
more all directly on my wrist all on its
own
here's a pocket screen much like a mouse
a keyboard or a monitor this pocket
screen is simply an interface for my hub
it's not very smart it doesn't need to
be if I need a bigger screen I can grab
a tab screen or I can plug it into this
keyboard if I want to be more productive
I can even use this dongle to turn any
existing TV into another screen for my
wrist now that I'm always using the same
computing hub I can start an application
on one screen and seamlessly continue it
on another if I lose a screen no worries
it has none of my personal stuff and
because these screens are inexpensive
and can be everywhere all I ever need to
carry is my hub
you
there are a lot of smart things in this
world a few smart people too and this
smart person looked at this dumb thing
and said I can make this dumb thing
smart now why in the world would I want
this dumb thing to be smart because the
easy part is the online ordering the
dumb part is the tracking waiting
stressing planning to be standing by my
front door during the all-day delivery
window where the carrier guarantees to
show up while I'm in the shower
ring the doorbell once drop off a
misdelivery note because who would want
to leave something on this front porch
it's a real pain in my Pony Express it's
high time someone made the thing that
was invented 100 years ago
smart this is you Sela it's more than a
mailbox for letters
it's a mailbox robot that can see when a
package gets dropped off and sends me a
notification through the app yes there's
an app and yes it's smart even if you're
nothing like me you're probably a
one-click purchaser on the Internet just
like me so this thing will transform
itself to fit just about any box so I
can order more stuff
you can always return it speaking of
returning I can put stuff in there as
well and you sell it will up the carrier
know that it's ready to be picked up
it's also got other useful features like
a microphone for voice messages and
security features like a couple of
cameras and one time use access codes
all of which I managed through the app
plus package tracking online order
management and easy access to retailer
support the apps great I just didn't
like that phone you sella is like my own
teeny tiny little post office right
there by my front door but you Sela is
not a toy it's not an excuse to have yet
another connected device it's a
responsible way to protect and manage
the things that are meant just for me
the things that often get left out for
people who aren't me you Sela my
personal post purchase package and
postal concierge
sound sound is everywhere there is no
accurate count for how many sounds an
average person hears in a given day a
Dorado audio we understand that sound is
what inspires us motivates us drives us
and connects us introducing the Apollo 7
the world's most compact true wireless
earphone we just wanted to make
something that just made sense we wanted
to create an earphone a completely
wireless earphone that delivered
incredible sound the Apollo 7 earphones
come in a sleek aluminum case with a
built-in lithium battery that makes it
easy and convenient to store as well as
charge on the go see you'll never run
out of power no matter where your day
takes you these earphones are ready to
go they're coated with a nano
waterproofing technology that makes them
perfect for any situation as an athlete
I absolutely love the Apollo 7 not only
are they waterproof they're Wireless
true Wireless meaning no wires involved
at all and they're very small and
compact and they sit in the ear
incredibly comfortably and I've done
products for monster and beats and the
Apollo 7 is truly innovative
well-thought-out design and excellent
execution it's a lot of times you get a
wireless Bluetooth headset and you still
haven't an outside box and this wires
all over the place I can't stand wires
I've gone through like I said several
pairs of headphones are just like
garbage the Bluetooth like it just
doesn't doesn't sound good at all you're
sacrificing a lot usually when you go to
a small earbud and these just sound
awesome it sounded really really good
that's my favorite part about them well
it's brilliant
you have the carrying case has wireless
charging essentially where you drop the
earpieces in and then there's a battery
in the case you don't have to find an
outlet to plug it in and charge it so
this is an all-day solution we wanted to
keep the Apollo 7 easy and intuitive
with it's single button features you'll
be able to take a call skip tracks
control volume activate Google
or even talk to Siri we also built an
omnidirectional microphone for the
Apollo 7 because we know how important
it is to have a crisp hands-free
solution for taking calls on the go
support us now and be one of the first
to experience true wireless audio the
way it should be
Apollo 7 by errata audio
you
home security shouldn't be complicated
or frustrating it should be
inconspicuous
easy to install and easy to use and it
should be reliable
that's what glo-bo stands for a modular
and flexible system to protect and to
monitor your home and the things you
love even when you're not at home our
idea developing low vo was to create a
fully working alarm system with a
functional range far above conventional
assistance but at a fraction of its
price the globe U app turns your
smartphone or tablet into a full-fledged
alarm control unit by using its camera
its microphone and various sensors
hidden inside in combination with the
members of the global family which are
equipped with additional sensors your
device becomes a modular monitoring and
remote control system when an alarm is
triggered you will be informed by email
SMS phone call or video message that way
glo-bo makes your smart phone become
your permanent eye on everything in your
home no matter if you are at work or
anywhere else
logo monitor is not only motion and
vibration
but also temperature air pressure and
air humidity
glo-bo is also an anti-theft protection
if you install it on your bike or on any
other movable property you will not only
get a warning if someone unauthorized
moves it but the serial number will be
sent to the cloud giving you a better
chance of getting it back
moreover glo-bo is a telecom anding tool
which can improve your personal safety
take your global with you and start an
instant emergency call in case of a
threat
you
