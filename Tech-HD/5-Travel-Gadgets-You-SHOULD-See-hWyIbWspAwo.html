no Joe mojo
we invented mojo the personal mobile
Brewer
which is basically a travel mug sized
coffee maker where you can add any
temperature water your own coffee
grounds or our to go sticks power up via
wall car or rechargeable battery push a
button and you have coffee on the go
anywhere anytime we probably went
through 30 different designs or
calculations but the issue was how do
you move water from reservoir a to
reservoir B without big motors or small
parts yeah and he came to me with this
challenge and I said hey Joe you know
have you guys looked at vacuum coffee
you know it it uses the power of the
water itself to kind of move the water
in the in the device so it pushes the
water down it goes up brews the coffee
and it comes back down into the same pot
that really was the lightbulb above my
head and we and I realized that this was
in fact the brewing system that would be
able to work in the Mojo and would
accommodate a coffee drinker on the go
so mojo is for the active coffee lover
the professional coffee lover that are
always on the go
whether they're at work whether the
commuting it's for them the patented
back drip system allows the Mojo to brew
coffee under active conditions so if
you're riding a bike
or if you're brewing while mo juggling
your backpack by the time you get to the
end of your ride mojo is still gonna
brew just the same but it doesn't skimp
on quality it's still providing great
great coffee and giving you that
satisfaction that you need there are a
lot of mobile coffee makers out on the
market but the thing is they're either
not mobile or they're not really good
coffee makers mojo brings that together
and it is in fact a genuine mobile
personal brew the support from our
backers and the money that we raise on
Kickstarter will go to finalizing a
rechargeable battery fine-tuning some
details with the mojo personal brewer
and also just fulfilling an unfulfilled
need for coffee lovers I mean the R&amp;amp;D is
done the design is complete Mojo's here
and we we believe in this product and we
can't wait to get it to you
you

finally a travel pillow that works
introducing face cradle
I've designed developed and marketed
over 30 products globally and I've
traveled a lot so being a taller guy I
know the frustration of trying to get to
sleep in economy class for extended
periods of time in bed our hat is
horizontal and we're able to quickly
shift our position to get comfortable
but during economy class travel our head
is vertical and our comfort options are
really limited so this makes getting to
sleep an economy class seat almost
impossible face cradle is different
because it has an internal frame in each
of two pillows that fold out and quickly
lock to your desired position it has
five modes of comfort for more than a
regular neck pillow and allows you to be
held or supported in the whole 180
degrees forward of your seat the great
thing is the multiple new positions you
can try standard neck pillow
we call this dozing mode but we need
more comfort positions neck pillows can
be uncomfortable our first improvement
is mode 2 we call this snoozing to open
pillows hold and depress buttons release
and lock at twenty to ten o'clock
position face cradle supports the head
higher up and onto your shoulders taking
pressure off your neck mode three we
call table nap place face cradle onto
your tray table prop it with a pillow or
your bag if necessary fold your arms
between the two pillows you can use this
mode anywhere there's a table mode four
and five are deep sleep modes
attach the harness open and lock the
pillows to the 11:30 o'clock position
loot the harness around your seatback
it's even better to put it around a
winged headrest now lean forward into
your face cradle select your most
comfortable angle by the quick adjust
cam lock relaxed and cradle your face
into the luxurious memory foam this is
deep sleep front mode
it's like resting in a massage table
turn your face cradle and your head
slightly for deep sleep side mode face
mask and headphones on pull over your
hoodie or a blanket lights out gently
doze off to longer periods of sleep no
other travel pillow offers such comfort
the design not only considers comfort
and sleep it carries so conveniently it
considers those next to you and folds
down quickly when service arrives some
other products don't work when the
person in front puts their seat back not
face cradle and your seat is upright so
the person behind is also not disturbed
and less likely to knock your seat and
disturb you we all know you pay huge
money to upgrade to business class or
even to get extended legroom and you
have to pay that every time you travel
but with face cradle you can buy it just
once and you can upgrade to sleep in
class every time the market for face
cradle is huge it could be used on
planes trains buses ferries or even in
the backseat of a car we need your help
to take face cradle to the world setting
up production shipping holding inventory
visiting retailers it's all really
expensive so if you'd like to get in
early and help us we've got some
incredible offers for you we really hope
you like them and thank you so much for
your help
and you can look forward to upgrading to
sleeping class
you
hi we have come a very long way since
the iguana fishes was released five
years ago we have sold thousands of
pairs all around the world and today I'm
proud to present you our new amazing
product the iguana jungle most of us
live in cities we spend most of our time
and enclosed concrete cubes or in metal
boxes our bodies are wrapped under
layers of clothes the part of our body
that suffers the most are our feet all
day long they are literally locked up in
tight shoes there's nothing like the
feeling of finally taking your shoes off
and let your feet breathe at the end of
the day when summer comes and
temperatures get high we can't wait to
get our shoes off the dream is walking
barefoot on the beach and ideally
anywhere but on rough ground our feet
need to be protected flip-flops
and other type of sandals have a design
that haven't evolved for centuries they
are inefficient and old-fashioned let's
change that introducing the Edwin I
jungle like the iguana fresh shoes the
jungle is inspired by the Amazonian
Indians that used to dip their feet
directly into natural latex to create a
second skin thereby protecting their
feet with our new concept the ultra
minimal piece of technical rubber will
only wrap around your big toe and your
heel
by doing so it secures a thick and soft
economic sole they assemble together
like a 3d puzzle and guess what it holds
the feeling is amazing it is literally
as if carpet was set in front of your
feet at all times the Uni jungle lets
you walk as if you were barefoot on any
type of grounds put them on and walk
like never before
all the Uni products are a hundred
percent made in Portugal there are two
types of sole available the first type
the luxury one is made of cork and
leather leather is ultra soft for your
feet and cork absorb sweat the second
type is made of EVA foam a flexible foam
that is ultra light and
waterproof we are now aiming at making
this dream product come to life we have
one month to reach our goal
please join us by sharing the link below
on your social media and spreading the
word thank you for your support
hello I am Joe Massa and this is banana
we have been making products since 2014
with a simple vision we are always
moving so product shaka with us nowadays
people need rest on the go but every
travel pillow we tried didn't meet our
expectation all of them there was always
another problem so we decided to create
our own travel pillow our goal was to
guarantee high quality rest no matter
the situation we design and three in one
product that transforms in a compact
shell that is light and water-resistant
each shape the pillow takes fulfills
different uses the first is the
traditional neck pillow made for long
slides and the morning commute with the
convenient pocket for your phone and
blanket catcher 2 keeps your hands-free
the second form is the square shaped
pillow it delivers the comfort of a
premium memory foam pillow while on the
go the last form is the pillow topper
which can be used for added comfort to
any pillow in any travel situation the
unique design of the product allows for
a clean resting surface no matter what
shape the pillars in when choosing the
materials we fell in love with a pure
dynamic memory foam and its qualities
like softness and freshness and the fact
that it smells really good we are
dedicated to the product to its design
and quality that's why we only choose
Italian suppliers and materials made
with passion and love
this is our third Kickstarter campaign
we already successfully delivered two
other products thanks to our amazing
backers and now we are ready to present
the banal a pillow to Kickstarter's
first the design process is done and the
supply chain is lined up we just need
your help to run production invest rests
