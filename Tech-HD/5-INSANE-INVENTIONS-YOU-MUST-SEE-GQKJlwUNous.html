connected staring at our screens well
that would be how we spend the rest of
our lives you see as humans we are
vulnerable and our smartphones are
engineered to use these vulnerabilities
against this this is why we've
intentionally designed a phone to be
used as little as possible it's a phone
that encourages you to leave behind your
smartphone to spend that quality time
doing the things that you love the most
we call it going light almost three
years and 10,000 phones later to find
ourselves asking how can we go light
more often how can we go light for good
introducing life on to a beautiful math
display more G connectivity and
messaging we are rethinking what an
operating system can be a few essential
tools thoughtfully implemented and
pleasure to use may be an alarm clock a
ride home a playlist or some simple
directions these are tools not feeds
it's a phone that actually respects you
light was born as a refreshing
alternative to the tech monopolies we
don't want to be made
feel that we're not enough we believe
objects can empower us can help us
appreciate our lives even more you're
humans we're taking back our lives hey
Kickstarter five years ago we came to
Kickstarter with an idea for a company
based on the Japanese style of
fly-fishing called tenkara chancara is a
simplified form of fly-fishing it uses
just a rod line
Tippett and fly the rods are fully
collapsible starting around 20 inches
and fully extending to 10 to 13 feet in
length as we continue to develop new
ideas and products we wanted to bring
our latest rod to the crowdfunding
community this is the Teton zoom the
Teton zoom is our first adjustable
length tenkara rod this means that it
can be fished at either 10 and 1/2 feet
or 12 foot lengths it weighs only 3.5
ounces we've been developing and testing
this rod for over two years now it works
well for smaller water and has a really
fun action but can also handle larger
fish on big rivers and lakes
I think our whole vision has been to get
people to kind of get out and experience
the outdoors through a form of
fly-fishing and I think in doing that
you know more people getting outdoors is
great because it helps people understand
and appreciate nature and kind of take
stewardship over the land the more
people who are out enjoying it it will I
think turn them on to help protect it we
really love the crowdfunding community
and are so excited to bring the Tetons
into life here first our goal is to
inspire more people to get out and fish
anywhere
have you ever felt uncomfortable when
speaking over the phone in public places
or open space
introducing push me the world's first
masked for mobile bounds hush me is a
personal acoustic device that protects
speech privacy open space environments
by using exclusive passive voice
suppression and active voice masking
technology a stylish aerodynamic design
for a long-term wear
Rashmi keep talking
till it is the word for trust in Swedish
till it can easily be operated with just
one hand
till it works with a wide variety of
bikes it can be stopped easily in any
position for maintenance it's designed
to look great even when it's not being
used
through this Kickstarter campaign with
your help we aim to raise enough money
to put till it into production we're
offering you the opportunity to earn one
of the numbered first edition of tonight
and to become part of our story</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
