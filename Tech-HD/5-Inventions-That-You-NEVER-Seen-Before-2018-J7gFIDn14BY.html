hydros live outdoor reality rowing
brings you balance and peace while
generating 86% muscle engagement burning
400 calories in a 20-minute workout led
by athletes including those training for
the u.s. national rowing team the hydro
delivers a live on River outdoor rowing
experience at home now more than ever
people's over scheduled stressful lives
leave little time for meaningful
exercise and the sole enriching
opportunity to spend time outdoors
I've been around rowing for my whole
life I think I started when I was 18 or
19 years old I've coached people on the
u.s. national team I've been to the
World Championships and what I've
discovered is one critical thing about
this sport that is different from every
other sport so when you're out on the
water you are moving in exact
synchronicity with the person in front
of you so you get this kind of
connection that no other sport delivers
because you really you're experiencing
flow with another person we started this
company to take that experience of
working so closely with somebody else
and delivering it to your home stay
motivated and engaged with world-class
instructors in a community that keeps
you connected and inspired you'll find
more success with crew than anything
you've tried before crew is about more
than a new way to exercise it's a
connection with people in nature that
motivates you keeps you coming back for
more
designed by Juliana Miller with a focus
on performance and high quality
materials the hydro delivers a full-body
ergonomic experience in a stunning
streamlined package we wanted a user to
love it like a piece of furniture there
is this flowing line between the live
classes that you're watching and the
rower and just trying to try to kind of
put the rower in their own little bubble
in their own little space which is how
they all described it when they were
actually on the water the hydros
patented design features an electric
eddy current break this break provides
resistance using electromagnetic force
making the machine almost silent while
in use the resistance of the break has
adjusted 100 times per second meaning
that the hydro can be anything you want
it to be at the touch of the screen the
field can change from a one-person boat
to an eight-person boat even to a weight
stack the comfortable seat accommodates
bodies up to 300 pounds the brilliant 22
inch touchscreen is sweat and
water-resistant and has high quality
forward-facing speakers so you can see
the beautiful River escapes and here are
the matching music choose the workout
that's right for you want a heart
pumping challenge or a scenic journey at
your own pace or to join the instructor
live on the river they're all there at
your fingertips I've been an athlete for
many years I'm now strength and
conditioning coach and I've now found
that rowing is such a satisfying
movement it's a total body workout it
helps to boost metabolism I can feel it
in my legs and in my core one of the
other things I love about the hydro is
its commercial-grade it's got a nice
feel to it and on the other side of the
screen you've got somebody there to
motivate you to keep you on your plan
and keep you on your program learn to
row in less than 10 minutes combine
strength and cardio reduce stress zero
impact fun workouts with engaging
instructors burn up to 1250 calories per
hour
great for ages 10 to 100 bring the river
to your home and discover the best kept
secret in fitness and community with the
hydro find your rhythm
make it is proud to introduce macro make
it a full two by four feet in the XY
dimension and over thirty inches of
printable height macro make it is big
enough to print pretty much whatever you
want since 2013

printers and offering them at desktop
market prices we want macro make it to
represent the same unbeatable value for
large format printing after two years of
development we're ready to offer macro
make it to you through Kickstarter so
that you too can enjoy printing really
large stuff but it's about more than
just build volume macro make it is a
fully featured 3d printer with
everything you'd expect from a modern 3d
printing company hi I'm Russell
Development Director at maker and this
is macro make it as you can see the
printer design is almost complete we're
just finalizing the last few details and
sourcing of some components we're
offering this on Kickstarter so that we
can reach the critical volume numbers we
need to get price breaks in sourcing
that make this a viable product each
macro makeit arrives partially assembled
with high quality video instructions
backers should expect between 10 and 25
hours of assembly time depending on
experience even though it's a kit you
can expect the same excellent support
that make it provides for all of their
3d printers keep watching here for more
details on the design and performance of
the printer as the Kickstarter moves
along we will periodically update you as
