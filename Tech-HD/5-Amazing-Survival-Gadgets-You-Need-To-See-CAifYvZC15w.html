you already know that choosing the right
equipment is essential when putting your
pack together you will understand the
grueling demands of the wilderness and
most of all you will have a respectful
appreciation for nature and know that
sometimes your equipment can be the
difference between life and death when
the lead engineer of survival archery
systems started developing the SAS
tactical survival mode he was already
aware of the need for equipment that was
properly engineered having survived a
near-death experience in which his
knowledge of the outdoors together with
some well chosen critical equipment and
literally saved his life he set about
developing a product for food
acquisition it would possibly one day do
the same for someone else having spent a
lifetime growing up in the woods and
having spent 15 years as an automotive
and petrochemical engineer he set about
developing a set of requirements which
encapsulate the eight critical aspects
of a survival bow that you should look
for in a premium product these critical
aspects led to a design which was
launched after two years of development
and testing and now the SAS tactical
survival bow is sold to technically the
morning people all over the world who
understand the need for premium
equipment package spoiling is critical
to a compact design and to overcome the
need to strap your bow to the outside of
your pack it absolutely must be 21
inches or under when in transport mode
the SAS tactical survival bow comes in
at that all critical length of 21 inches
it even fits into most one-day packs in
order to get a bow that does not stack
and is still efficient you need to have
the right limb to rise a ratio as well
as the right overall in designing a 60
inch long bow with a carefully chosen
limb to riser ratio gave the SAS
tactical survival boat this perfect
balance and
bow that does not stack all the way past
31 inch draw for long-term survival
purposes it is crucial that all working
parts of a bow are fully corrosion
resistant and so survival archery
systems chose marine grade materials
throughout the only part of the bow that
is not fully corrosion resistant are the
all-important eye tensile steel limb
retaining bolts which were chosen to
give an extremely high factor of safety
in the field and only require a light
layer of animal fat or oil to remain in
perfect condition durability is key for
a survival bow and so during the
development the engineers employed what
is called design for infinite life which
basically means that the theoretical
design is capable of withstanding 500
million shots at 31 inch straw going a
step further some hefty safety factors
were added to ensure a superlight bow
that will last more than a lifetime in a
composite limb with a through-hole is
prone to cracking around that hole
unless it is properly secured using a
correctly talked bolt and washer system
the SAS tactical survival bow makes use
of a positive limb retention system to
ensure the limbs remain safe and secure
in the field having a compact bow is
important but having a solution to store
your arrows is critical to your choice
of a well-rounded product the patented
SAS tactical survival bow is the only
bow in the market that allows for a
storage solution of arrows inside the
riser and this comes at no additional
cost to space to reduce pack weight and
ease of use and maintenance-free and
truly ambidextrous bow that requires no
changing of parts are the last two
critical aspects of a great survival bow
the SAS detector has evolved Oh is the
only truly ambidextrous survival bow on
the market and requires no tools to
maintain it or convert it from left to
right hand simply place an error
Istanbul adds of the riser and swap it
between hands if you are looking for a
premium survival bow that captures these
eight critical elements then look no
further than the SAS tactical survivable
to meet the specific critical aspects

if we're lucky most of us can take water
for granted turn on the tap and there it
is but what if that changed
hurricanes earthquakes all sorts of
other disasters natural or man-made can
leave us vulnerable water is vital to
survival emergency prep kits should have
three days of drinking water per person
but if you need more what can you do for
safe drinking water would you be
prepared for a disaster an emergency a
desperate situation even if that
desperation is just about getting in
touch with nature whether you're
prepping an emergency kit or going for a
hike Puri so is an easy to use and
dependable water purification system
that's an important yet inexpensive
investment to make the Puri so water
purification bottle filters and purifies
water by removing a variety of
contaminants bacteria protozoan cysts
and particulates and it reduces viral
chemical and heavy metal content simply
place the bottles Inlet into the
freshwater source and pump water is
drawn through the hollow fiber membrane
and carbon filter resulting in purified
water
close off the inlet flip it over unscrew
the pump handle and sit directly from
the 410 milliliter purified water
reservoir contaminated water never
enters this chamber or save in a
separate bottle so you can purify even
more water the replaceable filter can
process up to 1,000 liters the pure reso
water purification bottle is great for
hiking emergencies and for travel to
places where you might not be so sure of
the local water quality with the funds
we raise from our Kickstarter campaign
we'll be able to complete the final
steps needed and bringing pure reso to
market
hey it's Andrew with outdoor gear TV
today we're reviewing the Olli camp ion
Micro Titanium stove this is the
lightest and most compact canister stove
on the market let's go over some of the
features and then I'll talk about
performance after that the ion micro
measures one and a quarter inches by two
inches
requires manual ignition and weighs in
at just 1.5 ounces
it's made from titanium with stainless
steel pot supports and fits universal
screw on fuel canisters of butane
propane mixtures the design is set to
spread out the flame for heat
distribution and will output just under
9,000 BTU resulting in a boil time of
four and a half minutes so my first
impression of this stove was obviously
the size it's really hard to put it in
perspective but at just one and a half
ounces this stove weighs about the same
as a single hiking sock and that's not
the pair that's just one mid top hiking
sock a while back we reviewed the
kinetic ultra titanium from all camp and
we thought this was small but when you
see them together it really puts it in
perspective we have a lot of fun testing
out this stove mostly just to see what
it can do my first time cooking with it
I cooked an entire spaghetti dinner for
two people and while it did take a
little bit of extra effort it's just
amazing that it could be done in the
first place the pot supports are nice
and strong especially considering their
size and although I wouldn't recommend
it it did easily support a 1.8 litre pot
full of water the valve is amazingly
precise allowing you to really dial down
that flame until it's barely visible
likewise when you crank it up it's like
a rocket of heat the only downside is
that because it's so exposed you'll
waste some fuel so take some time to
really build up a good windscreen to
maximize that efficiency all in all I
think this stove is amazing it surprises
me every time that I use it and if
you're a backpacker I would highly
recommend it be sure to head on over to
