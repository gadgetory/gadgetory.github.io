refined it's almost like a different
language people react to cross and ship
in in an emotional way because it does
it's stir something within them you feel
something you feel an emotion when you
can you can sense the human in it it all
depends on er the materials you use the
people you work with and a lot of the
times the clients as well we've taken
the Lexus IS and converted it into a
one-to-one Harwood model form of a real
car through hand craftsmanship turning
mundane material to a beautiful
sculpture
cross and ship can be something I'm sure
yes but it can also be something very
humbled that is just made in a beautiful
way can you see like how this these
lines it'd be nice to actually have make
the grain follow this we've got three
phases to work with obviously if it was
just a white sheet
it'll just be white throughout and you
wouldn't have these three tones playing
together what I kind of envision is that
once you've walking around the model or
you kind of get this feel that I guess a
feel of movement depending on the angle
that you're looking at the car it's a
play with the material and to offer
different gradients and grain is what
it's all about to be able to cut all
these sheets within a matter of weeks as
opposed to probably a couple of years is
revolutionary we're able to take the CAD
drawing that's used in production of the
real car slice it up and produce a
carbon copy in cardboard this job for
Lexus would never happen if it wasn't
for technology from CAD work to laser
cutting and then eventually the
traditional approach which is putting it
all together because there's no
technology that can yet put things
together the way we do as humans we've
never heard of this thing being done
before we've heard of you know scaled
versions of this possibly but nothing to
this scale where someone could actually
end to the car and move it backwards and
forwards it's I think it's something
special that we've done here
we've managed to explore such a flat 2d
material and we yet managed to explore
such complex design lines I think we're
all quite impressed with it to be honest
with the results I mean the wheels the
seats I think it's a very very cool job
I think Lexus statement creating amazing
is what we have created when people come
past they take a double take and think
hang on a second is that a digital piece
of work
in the real world it's something where
you see where there's a crossover
between animation and reality and I
think that surprise is what's so special
about the project
what you can see here is Kabul vacuum
cleaners that are designed in my final
year at university all came about from
my year in placement of VAX
the brief was to design a vacuum cleaner
out of a material that is an injection
molded plastic that doesn't rely on
tooling that can be made anywhere at low
cost this came about from looking at how
cardboard is being perceived in the
design world people are using it for
furniture for lighting for structure
people were seeing that it wasn't just a
packaging material and that then kind of
sparked what could we do with it and how
can we make something that would never
be made out of cardboard what the the
aspects that we can change to make this
a very environmental project
VAX have taken on this project and a
100% behind it the idea is that all of
the workings and all of the theory
behind the vacuum cleaner is exactly the
same as a normal vacuum cleaner which is
taken outer shell and having some fun
with it and making it out of something
that people can interact with the the
cardboard itself is a specialized
cardboard using a non-toxic coating
which allows it to be flame-retardant
and waterproof so the cardboard itself
should withstand all weather situations
it's fully recyclable if it does get
damaged it can go into your green bag
outside and be collected by the bitumen
and you can just replace the panel as as
and when it's called Eevee eco vac and
it just gives it a little bit of a
personality a bit of a character behind
it so it's not just a product code name
the Kabul vacuum cleaner is designed for
young families quite stylish trendy
people the kind of wanting something a
little bit different bit of a status
symbol the idea behind it is it's low
cost it's maintained by anyone you can
personalize that you can have fun with
it
takes the idea of your child putting the
drawer in on the fridge they can
personalize the vacuum cleaner and it
can be like a part of the family all of
my friends from university were at the
start just thinking you've designed
vacuum cleaners for a year back what
you're playing about just do a normal
project so it it took a while for people
to start to understand but with all that
the press coverage that it's given and
in fact taking it on board and lots of
companies kind of wanting to know more
about the product the credibility is has
brought my friends around to my way of
thinking about it
it's getting a lot of worldwide coverage
and I was in China a couple of weeks ago
and saw it in a magazine on the bullet
train which you never expect to kind of
see
what's next where could we take this did
we develop this idea or do we move on to
something else do we take cardboard and
try and put it into some of our
mainstream products and at the moment
we're just we're playing around with so
many bits and pieces we just need to
kind of look and think about cardboard
especially in product design but also
just watch this space for VAX with
vacuum cleaners the we're not going to
be doing things so conventional
you
you
it has always excited me to take
negligible materials and then turn in
something completely different
something useful bicycle it's my sort of
hobby that's what I do in my free time
it's in my soul one of the time that I
had to buy some parts I went to the
bicycle shop and then they were talking
and then suddenly I heard about a guy to
build a canoe out of cardboard I went
home and then it's all disturbed me this
canoe made of cardboard was sitting in
the back of my head and couldn't let go
and suddenly just strike my mind why not
to make a bicycle out of cardboard
soon after I talked to three engineers
which I really highly appreciate and
they said it's impossible there's no way
it can be done while I was eating with
my wife one day she noticed that I'm a
little bit disturbed and then she asked
me what's bugging you I told her all the
thing about the cupboard can you and add
all the engineers I went to and all the
things that they said about it's
impossible and then she looked at me and
gave me that look and then she said I
know you if you're not gonna try it then
you're gonna drive yourself crazy then
you're gonna drive me crazy then you're
gonna drive the entire family crazy so
just go ahead and try it
very soon I realized that there's no
actually any know how not to work with
the cardboard beside making packages out
of it so I started to explore it and
then I figure out a lot of things out of
it basically the idea is like a Japanese
origami and you fold it once then it
doesn't come twice the string it's
almost three times the strength so
that's I took it from there and
basically did the same thing with
cardboard
my first operational prototype it looks
like a hybrid between packaging box and
sort of bicycles so it was a package on
wheels
pretty much then I realized it had to
look like a real bicycles how to take
this cargo box and turn it into ordinary
bicycle and so that's where the real
challenges started
I did a lot of things in my life working
with robots which stands
electromechanical machine and I
basically took everything I knew and
focus it to work with that material to
accomplish what I wanted to do wheel
structures frame design and strength
transmission parts cardboard seat
and then things started to click
together
you
my name is Brennan Macaluso I'm an
industrial designer and I lived in
Houston Texas graduate of the University
of Houston decimal design program I
picked Harper because Harvard was a very
extreme example I said if I can do at a
cardboard imagine what we can do that
so it was the cardboard thing wasn't
about just being recyclable there's
actually kind of more making the corn on
the extreme example look man a cardboard
it works
Wow welcome we have to how do we build
off this idea why do we have so much
stuff we need this much stuff and so my
idea was maybe I just rip a compare down
to its bare working bones and I realized
all I really need to have a running
computer was a hard drive the
motherboard the processor and some
memory and a power supply I have a
running computer so I took a running
computer and I actually screwed it to a
piece of plywood nail it up on the wall
so the recompute everything there are no
hard screw fasteners or rivets or
anything that holds the other everything
all the parts electronic components are
friction fit the case Harvin is slide
together and the actual case is
surrounded by the base cardboard that
has no tools you know they let me just
have it you can go in there and you have
to take it out to recyclers
get out well the biggest problems with
recycling computers was the dismantling
of the computers and the separation of
the case from the actual electronic
components and the reason that's not
done so much because it's a lot of work
it's really mean to take it apart
unscrew it on riveted whatever the wires
became a picture especially for
manufactured in a factory because he's
recycling centers happily whatever you
gotta know and of course a lot of things
are being sent over to Africa in China
in other parts of Southeast Asia and the
dismantling there and it's if that's a
whole other issue in few weeks right now
but to me the car boy wasn't the old
material it was just materials
applications it's a piece of the
ingredient the recipe but it's not
everything there's there's there's more
to it ideally I why she want to chase
differ idea down which I won't get into
right now the cardboard was kind of like
wow that would be pretty extreme big man
so I did
what is recomputed precompute was a
design for a sustainable desktop
computer that came out of some research
addressing sustainability in design and
the end products in this case happen to
be computer
retail outlets regularly vent box goods
direct the public that are very
difficult to carry move it is a compact
self-assembly carriage system for boxes
up to 20 kilos made entirely of
cardboard it's a cheap simple stylish
solution which enables the user to carry
virtually any size or shape of box with
ease assembly and fitting will take
retail staff under a minute the handles
are vented flat and assembled in store
then the components are stuck on the box
in whatever position the user feels
comfortable with it has excellent
stability due to the wide track of the
wheels and the natural cushioning
quality of cardboard protect the load
and absorb vibrations making it very
quiet
even on cobbled roads all the parts use
a special report bulk contact adhesive
which dissolves in water when move it is
recycled and the adhesives unique
qualities mean that the product can be
peeled off the box without damaging it
move it offers a practical solution
which provides for the users needs
enabling them to make light work of the
journey home then recycle or reuse the
product as they see fit the first
prototype was made entirely from waste
materials and can be seen here on its
10-mile journey across London carrying a
new microwave oven move it will not only
make an immediate difference in
providing a more ecologically sound
alternative to transporting boxes in
vans cars and taxis but should help to
create a shift toward a healthier
greener and more responsible attitude</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
