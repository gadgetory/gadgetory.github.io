and was sick at the time and I was on
crutches and I saw electric bike which
was $4,000 electric bike and I said with
all my manufacturing background
experience I could really redesign this
bike and an engineer certain aspects of
this bike in a way where it could become
affordable to everyone that's how it all
began
buycks got some throttles so you just
push down on it and you go you can write
a full electric or use the pedal assist
if you want to give yourself a little
bit more exercise you ride with pedal
assist if you want just go pure electric
you your pure electric not needing to
pedal all the time and just being able
to just zip along at 20 miles per hour
speed just the whole idea that you can
ride these long distances with pretty
effortlessly is an amazing aspect of a
bike
so you can really use it for a short
hops you know to work or to store or to
go to a coffee shop that's the future
you know where people will be more
conscious and aware of the fact that
there's alternative to their vehicles
on our previous crowdfunding campaign we
had a tremendous success we raised over
6 million dollars we sold like the 67
countries worldwide I can't thank enough
our early backers some people who
believed in me and in what I was
building for them so it's the most
humbling experience ever and just to
have this kind of support from the
communities it's tremendous honor to
experience and I just can't wait to grow
that base with this new campaign
this is the last run of bikes we're
going to do for 2015 so if you would
like to get your hands on one please go
to campaign page and reserve a bike for
yourself
I
you
