there is no much barrier to stop private
conversation being bugged
just eating little efforts and
techniques all your privacy will be
exposed to the criminal intention spying
equipment are widely and easily
accessible online data flows fine by
criminal or government is virtually
impossible to prevent the out pone
encrypted earbuds are the first truly
secure and private earbuds for the
smartphone without any compromises your
phone callings and audio messages sent
via text are end-to-end encrypted it
doesn't have interference with mobile
carriers and service provider your
privacy will be assured without phone
encrypted earbuds all your callings are
secured and well protected from the
secret surveillance program the password
used to encrypt telephone calls is a
one-time password encryption key that is
automatically generated by a digital
encryption algorithm in the group
encryption key
it destroys - out phone earbuds by
themselves and will not be stored or
recorded by anyone including yourself in
addition to digital encryption
algorithms our phone's built-in
encryption chip will provide even better
security it makes sure your personal
information will not be leaked out via
iMessage whatsapp and major voice
messaging applications the encrypted
message only can be decrypted by the out
phone encrypted earbud without having to
install any encryption add-on
our phone has two security chips one for
microphone signal encryption and one for
headphone decryption audio encryption
and decryption are achieved by
stimulating the dynamic frequency shift
in the audio signal just by pressing the
encryption button on the earbuds during
a phone call to distort the audio with
background noise out phone encrypted
here buds offer uncompromised sound
quality with high five who stick design
for clear phone callings and voice
messages the snug and hanging design
offer the most ergonomic wearing comfort
that comes with no additional pressure
to the conch and ear canal areas the
durable outer shell can effectively
avoid the sound laid out bone is a
simple and secure communicating solution
protects you from secret surveillance in
any time at anywhere if you won't settle
for anything but the best out phone
would be the best for you to wear plug
and talk just that secure
for over two years we've been developing
a product that pushes the technical
boundaries of what's possible and is
revolutionary and both appearance and
functionality meet the oculus onyx the
world's first additively manufactured 3
axis camera gimbal the future of camera
motion control
current electronic stabilizers help to
keep cameras stable in shooting video
but they also have many shortcomings
they don't consider camera safety they
are heavy cumbersome and hard to operate
our mission was to stabilize your camera
and the most protective lightweight and
agile package possible allowing you to
unleash your creativity in the most
challenging situations and environments
hi kickstarter together with my brother
Jimmy
we're the cofounders of oculus inspire
our love of action sports and the New
Zealand outdoors the Onix needed to be
extremely versatile so it could be taken
on the most wild adventures with
backgrounds and industrial design
mechanical engineering and filmmaking
our complementary skill set has allowed
us to push manufacturing boundaries to
rethink redevelop and redesign what a
camera motion control device can be
creating the ultimate tool for
risk-taking filmmakers
what makes the Onix different the
skeleton the structure has been
additively manufactured using grade five
titanium alloy the high strength to
weight ratio of any middle this gave us
our design freedom to innovate with
incredible complexity in combination
with typology optimizations we have
mathematically calculated material out
we know the current internal structures
every gram of weight has been optimized
to provide maximum structural integrity
the Onyx is very compact with its unique
handle geometry that is very intuitive
to operate its weight in size then it
can be used in the most awkward and
difficult situations it can be passed
easily between operators and when it's
time to ever break the gimbal can be
placed without the need for a stand it
maintains a payload weight of up to two
kilos and with our tallest preset
balancing system it's genetically
reduces set-up and rebalancing time a
32-bit control system with encoder
brushless motors provides optimal image
stabilization performance with a battery
life of up to eight hours it also has
the means to power the camera and other
accessories we've got a great selection
of options available a naked version for
an extremely lightweight setup and the
ultimate protection package with
exciting foreign foam covering the
carbon fiber shells and the handle along
with the polycarbonate dome
our oculus we're developing a team of
engineers filmmakers and business
developers with the same goal in mind
inspire creators to take risks and
unleash their creative visions
funds from us campaign are going
directly into expanding our electrical
and software engineering department and
further developing our printing
techniques tolerances and materials we
will only be producing a limited
quantity of units for our Kickstarter
campaign and shipping an order of our
backers we've been getting some amazing
results and we can't wait to see what
our backers will produce let the Onyx
inspire your creativity with the
confidence that you need create without
compromise and back us today meet even
the world's first stickable camera that
fits on your phone so you always have it
when you need it the back of the camera
is made with a micro suction tape which
means you can stick it and stick it and
stick it to just about anything
evo syncs with your phone using an
internal Wi-Fi chip bring you to step
out from behind the lens and capture
stunning 1080p video from just about any
angle at only six millimeters then Evo
slides seamlessly into a custom-designed
phone case which means it goes into your
pocket and onto your next adventure
without you even thinking about it say
hello to the hands-free selfie and with
our fully integrated app you can upload
your memories with the click of a button
onto social media where your friends and
family can follow along but if that's
not fast enough you can go straight to
livestream in HD and if you have more
than one Evo you can even link them
together to score the perfect shot from
every perspective
Evo is only possible because a designer
and an engineer in Italy saw problem Evo
the selfie perfected</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
