industry is still yet to see it has tons
of cool features that makes it just
something else

hi I'm Harper Gorman founder of Joule
and before I tell you what Joule is let
me tell you why Joule is like many
lightbulb moments Joule with a spark
ignited by too many repeated frustrating
situations for example how many times
does this happen to you
you're at the airport and maybe just a
coffee shop and you need to charge your
laptop but all the outlets are taken and
nobody feels like sharing what do you do
or maybe you've done something like this
because you just fed up and tired of
digging behind the mattress or the TV
stand or crawling under your desk simply
to plug something yet well how about
this you take one power strip plug it
into another power strip because it's
not long enough or sometimes you take
the extra length because it's too long
and you have to stuff it behind this
thing or that one of my personal
favorites how many times have you tried
to plug something in in the dark and you
can't find the power outlet and you
actually sit there and you try to find
the socket with your fingers and it's
not safe what's wrong with this why have
we accepted this as normal
or maybe a better question is why hasn't
anyone done something about it
welcome to the stagnant abyss of the
power outlet market where every one of
us needs them and uses them but nobody
in the right mind gets excited about
them but what if we could fix that what
if we can make something that fits your
lifestyle and looks great doing it while
we can
and we did welcome the Joule
this is our inspiration we want you for
the first time to look at power outlets
and say to yourself this really
complements my life at home around town
when I travel when I work even when I
play and we would love for you to be a
part of making it all happen we've done
the engineering the prototyping even
over to get you'll make so if you're
like us and you get a thrill every time
you see something cool something new and
exciting some piece of gear that makes
you think where has this been all my
life then jump on board and back us here
on IndieGoGo by pre-ordering a jewel bar
of your very own with your support we
can take jewel the rest of the way and
make the whole world just that much
cooler
you
I remember as a child I was watching
this for hours okay maybe just four
minutes but still it fascinated me how
cool it looks strange geometrical shapes
and vivid colors and the fact that it
lived inside the same box where Star
Wars and back to the future so he just
didn't made any sense to me but I loved
it
my name is Simon and I'm a designer from
Hungary and I've designed a lamp
inspired by the world famous television
test guard a lamp that symbolizes a
whole era of analog television history
in a unique way and also cherish so many
sweet childhood memories I spent over a
year experimented with different
production technologies materials and
locations and finally I've got the right
balance between quality cost and
scalability the language you can see
here is made in Italy it comes with a
wooden metal stand an easily replaceable
standard light bulb 2 years of Varon tea
and it will be available in classic
color and greyscale versions so for more
information please read the description
below and if you like this lamp help us
make it join our campaign and let's
celebrate a whole era of analog
television history together</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
