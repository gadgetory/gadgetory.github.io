air sling to be able to carry all of
your essentials in a sleek and adaptable
way
keep your phone charged with the USB
port sorry dude it's mine
the air sling is cut proof and extremely
hard wearing that's because it's made
out of the most cut resistant fabric in
the world
magnetic clips are smooth and quick
stay active without having to carry a
massive backpack
save time and hassles when on the move
and keep your valuables safe perfect for
traveling
it's water-resistant stain proof and
exceptionally durable light asleep and
totally essential err slain by alpaca
the Hydra shredders are for that upper
level athlete she's very strong and fit
and really needs that extra resistance
in the water to give them that high
level workout you don't get that 0 to
400 pounds of pressure from any other
workout thing it doesn't exist so the
Hydra shredders they come in pairs you
can use them like anything else that
you're used to in a dryland environment
you can do the same thing in the water
we did actually open up and really
amplify that inner cavity to allow you
to use it one in each hand or use both
hands on one of the products if I pull
it really slowly through the water I'm
only gonna put 10 pounds at most of
pressure on my body if I'm more
physically able the faster I pull it the
more it pushes back
so it's an accessible object and then
you can get into just the full hardcore
crazy workout anyone who thinks that
aquatic fitness isn't challenging enough
I would give them the Hydra shredders
and say try these because they'll work
you
more than half of us skip breakfast each
morning for a speedy exit out if your
rockets gonna take off its gonna need
some fuel that's why I invented the
crunch cup great for breakfast on the go
as a rocket scientist I have a very
rigorous schedule sending rockets into
space I'm a busy guy and I need to eat
my breakfast on the go this whole spoon
and Bowl thing just doesn't work out
plus it makes your cereal
Sami the crunch Cup keeps your cereal
crunching I've spent countless hours and
and sleepless nights trying to figure
out how am I gonna make my cereal on the
go and then
the crunch cup separating the milk and
the cereal and fill it hits your mouth
we have perfected the ratio of cereal to
milk so you always have a one-handed
mess free ready to go breakfast or snack
you can rely and you don't have to be a
rocket scientist to use it just add milk
to the outer cup add your cereal in the
inner cup twist on the lid add the cap
and you're ready to crunch the crunch
cup is dishwasher safe and it fits in
the standard sized cup holder so you
could bring it wherever you want whether
it's on your way to work school or by
the pool we need your support to make
never soggy cereal on the go of reality
for everyone with your help we can get
the Print Cup into production and
straight to your door and we have great
rewards and incentives for you to help
us reach our goals that means everyone
in the family's getting a crunch cup
here's looking at you mom what are you
waiting for
let's crunch</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
