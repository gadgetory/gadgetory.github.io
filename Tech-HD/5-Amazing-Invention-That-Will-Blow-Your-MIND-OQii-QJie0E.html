and the ritual that comes with it but
the roast of the beans the most
important factor in our coffees flavor
has always been completely out of our
control we want to change that
this is Kelvin a home coffee roaster
that turns roasting into something you
can do from your countertop we use to
accept that someone else roasted our
coffee for us with industrial machines a
while ago these pre roasted beans cost
us fifteen to twenty dollars a bag and
start to get stale the instant you open
them
we knew we could make coffee roasting
simple enough to do at home so we
created the Kelvin home coffee roaster
Kelvin lets you start with green beans
straight from the source and roast them
to your exact taste for 1/3 the price to
create Kelvin we immersed ourselves in
coffee culture to understand the details
of the roasting process and tested every
technology available to produce the
simplest most effective roaster with no
complicated routines all you need to do
is set the roast time and let Kelvin do
the rest
Kelvin uses hot air to evenly roast the
beans it eats up to the right degree and
it automatically cools down the beans
after the roast has ended Kelvin even
filters out the chaff during the
roasting process making cleanup a cinch
to make sure you always have a supply of
fresh beans we also created an app that
allows you to choose your beans from all
over the world with our suggestions for
different roasts
that way you can enjoy a range of
flavors each time you roast Kelvin can
roast enough beans for a cup or an
entire pot of coffee we want everyone to
be able to have control over the most
important factor in their coffees flavor
our team of experts have dedicated their
years of experience into making Kelvin
beautiful technically feasible and easy
to use with your help we can make home
coffee roasting simple and let you
discover a new side to coffee Kelvin
roaster this is the story of a connected
why narrator well actually it's the
story of a bar and a group of friends
Nikolas Matthew Miranda another nicola
and julian the one with the bottle just
there he's a sommelier the one who's
late here
Tibo and then there's orna oh I nearly
forgot
Nikolas his grandparents were winemakers
so you could merely say that wine runs
through his veins at least that's what
his friends think and that means high
expectations along the lines of which
bottle should we start with can I put it
in the fridge I opened this one you
first Nico la vie du Valhalla for the
market back to our group of friends
drinking and speaking about wine and
discussion after discussion they
realized that people did not take the
time to enjoy wine properly believing it
was only for an elite group of educated
experts give more to Vaughn Secunia hell
they decided to act - think - drink -
think again and then they found the idea
a connected why narrator don't need to
allow everyone to enjoy the entire
palette of aromas wine can offer because
as Julian always says salty elevated
and so after two years more than a
thousand bottles tasted as many legal
scans six prototypes nohomo saw so many
men that saw six new members joining the
team and a total of five thousand eight
hundred and eighty hours of research and
development the event smart wine aerator
was born and it is smart indeed first
you open no big revolution here but then
you scan the application sends the
information directly to our smart friend
so that it knows how much air the wine
needs and calibrates it instantly and
you serve and drink yes now that's the
revolution the wine is instantly and
perfectly aerated as you pour and that's
how this group of friends created the
connected french art de vivre if you
want to join us loving wine for what it
is and a party no adventure you can
provide or connected why narrator today
on Google
did you know your toothbrush misses
almost half your tooth surfaces most of
it is between your teeth sir told to
floss but who likes flossing anyone
that's what I thought and I don't blame
you it's awkward it's time-consuming and
here's the real kicker it's not even the
most effective way to clean between your
teeth according to a recent Associated
Press report there has to be a better
way until now water flossers have been
one of the only players in the game
their tedious messy and more often than
not end up stuffed under a cabinet
similar to shower is next level water
flossing and so much more it's a
complete oral hygiene experience from
the comfort of your shower
simply attach it to your shower wall and
hook it up to the water source tooth
shower uses water pressure so no
annoying plugs or batteries are needed
it's got three different attachments for
a triple threat approach to all care
first there's the dual headed toothbrush
which hits the front back and chewing
sides of your teeth for comprehensive
surface coverage then there's the
irrigating tip it reaches where the
toothbrush is handled it's like a water
flosser only it's in the shower so it's
no mess no fuss because it's in the
shower you'll never run out of water and
you won't have to sacrifice any precious
counterspace and let's not forget about
the revolutionary got massage
ear gaining and stimulating blood flow
and your gums this is a huge part of Cub
disease prevention and in less than 10
seconds you can flush out everything
between all your teeth while massaging
your go
for the first time ever you'll actually
enjoy reading with each attachment you
can adjust the water pressure and
temperature to your comfort level and
use with your choice of water mouthwash
or tooth whitener when you're ready to
switch attachments just remove this
block worrying about getting water
everywhere well you're in the shower so
it doesn't matter and with multiple
attachments the whole family can use to
each other which means better oral
hygiene for everyone that means a lot
fewer expensive and painful dental
procedures and fewer instances of gum
disease you probably won't be surprised
to learn it was created by a dental
hygienist Lisa's been deep in the tooth
world for over 25 years and she realized
there wasn't a single easy convenient
way for her patients to effectively
clean them to you so she decided to
design one herself
no power source no mess and because it's
in the shower to shower is easy to
integrate into your routine becoming as
second-nature as washing your hair place
lisa and her team have been hard at work
perfecting 2 showers design and
prototypes of over 2 years now they just
need your help getting to shower to the
masses with the funds raised here
they'll be able to place a bulk first
order to get these made and bring tooth
shower to market for a whole new
approach to oral hygiene tooth shower
the future of oral hygiene is in the
shower back our campaign today</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
