as creatives professionals athletes
makers we use our phone from the mobile
we wake up to the moment we go to sleep
but there's nothing out there that
adapts that phone to all those different
activities and empowers you halo effect
is the first complete hands-free
smartphone kit that will adapt to every
activity in your day and we realize that
there are four mounts that need to be
brought together to make a solution that
fits your entire day and this kit comes
with all four of those mounts if the
plate perform now is actually the hub of
the entire kit because it connects to
all of the other mounts but it also
works as a mount by itself on tabletop
surfaces so you can do horizontal and
vertical loads and any kind of different
angle it's great for taking selfies
because it frees your thumb up to be
able to easily take a picture
it also can hold your subway card your
IDs credit cards just as easily as if
you bought a case to do just that the
drive mount pops in and pops right out I
use open the stand insert it and then
you can do whatever you want with it for
GPS or music or watching video of fives
in the passenger seat I can mount the
phone to the side of the vent so I'm not
blocking the air can be angled in any
direction from any vent in any car
the run ride mount is one of my
favorites just because it solves every
problem that's out there with mounts
that go onto your arm the great thing
about this is you can wear it on the
upper arms before a runner ride you can
also put it on the lower arm and it also
rotates you snap it on and you push a
button to take it off and so this is
really easy in workout they need to stop
and do anything crazy to get a phone
call push a button take it right off put
it right to your ear and when you're
done with your phone call you snap it
back down how many times do you just
want to put your phone on to something
and aim it at you while you're in your
house in the bathroom of the kitchen you
could attach this mount to kind of any
vertical surface glass tile paint metal
of those types of things they'll affect
does everything you need to get through
the day to integrate your smartphone
into your activities in a way that's
hands-free but it aims a screen directly
at you
we've been tuning halo effects for the
last 18 months we feel like we finally
got it perfectly dialed in this thing
will work for all of the top phones
we've got fantastic working prototypes
manufacturers that I've been working
with for years
we've got a great dedicated team we're
really excited to launch this on
IndieGoGo and we hope you'll join us
