Tom the creator of the original bring
anywhere tool or that coin for short
which was successfully funded here on
Kickstarter just last year we designed
the Triton with your feedback about the
original coin to be larger sharper and
provide more leverage these changes mean
that the Trident is not
CSA compliant but the trade-off is you
get a ton of other possibilities from a
compact package
it's the ultimate minimalist multi-tool
that can be attached to a backpack belt
or live in your pocket so you'll never
forget it the Trident includes a
Phillips head driver hey sharp a scribe
point razor edge a captured cutter a
bottle opener and fire starter rod
attached with o-rings a ruler
and 3m solace reflector a wire stripper
fire rod scraper saw edge and a flathead
driver scraper after several months and

knife companies you've heard of and
their processes are top-notch grinding

polymer with soft to the touch rubber to
keep everything quality and compact s a
ghost
patent-pending design sets it apart from
any other styler or tool on the market

perfect for smoothing out those rough
edges it also includes a tip to get any
dirt under your fingernails to use all
you do is open up s a go find the no
break dial real it out and close
