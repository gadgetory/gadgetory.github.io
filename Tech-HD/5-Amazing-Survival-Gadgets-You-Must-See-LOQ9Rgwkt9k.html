something comes along that works so damn
well that you don't need to fuss over
appearances it reminds us that above all
else we just want something useful
Jason freed said you need to get the
fundamentals right fun wears off cool
wears off useful never wears off
when we're rolling down the highway of
our lives what is it we want people to
see a rebel a trendsetter a man of
wealth and taste there's a funny old
saying from Mark Twain that goes clothes
make the man naked people have little or
no influence in society
but sometimes designers come along who
are the rebels they remind us that above
all else we just want something that can
be used
you
you
camping backpacking hiking just being in
the outdoors gives us a chance for
adventure and of course the opportunity
to buy some really cool gear here at
bare minimum we love innovation and
we're changing the way you eat outdoors
camping has significantly evolved over
the years the sleeping bag has gone from
big and bulky to small and light the
lantern has gone from heavy and
dangerous to light and bright the cook
pot has gone from this to this cooking
on the trail hasn't changed much than
till now introducing the bear bowl a
super lightweight collapsible cooking
pot designed for hikers backpackers and
Preppers it's made of a food grade flame
resistant material the deceptively small
container can fit 32 ounces of water the
four inch base makes it easy to use with
a variety of heating sources we chose an
aluminum base because of the heat
resistance durability and weight so
you're asking yourself why do I need one
of these well let me tell you it's about
the size of your wallet and it weighs
less than the cellphone
hello mr. Baer with four folds and two
snaps it's so simple to put together you
can even do it during a bear attack easy
barring any unfortunate bear attacks you
can take your bear Bowl from flat to
cook in no time
well at least as fast as it takes a bear
to get coffee at a drive-thru simply
reverse the process and you can take
your bear bowl back to flat and ready to
pack clean up on the trail can be a real
bear but not with the bear bowl simply
open the bear ball flat and wipe it
clean it takes less time and water to
clean the barrel than any other ball on
the market hi I'm Cory the inventor and
founder of the bear bowl we've got a
great product and we're really excited
to share it with you we've done our
testing and we've secured manufacturing
but to bring the bear bowl from
prototype to production we need your
help
we need to purchase tooling and place a
large production order so that we can
bring the bear bowl to you at the very
best price choose one of the perks below
and help us meet our goals so that we
can get the bear bowl out on the trail
today bear bowl
pack light cook fast clean easy
you
hey guys it's Mike from outdoor element
and we love some carabiners
they come in a variety of shapes and
sizes there that third hand that you can
rely on and they've been around for a
while they've evolved over the years and
as the adventure type we wanted to
develop an everyday beater they can help
you out when things get crazy palmer
introducing the fighter beaner
understanding that fire creation is
crucial in times of emergency we've
introduced our ever spark technology to
the bener sometimes all you need is a
spark to totally change the situation
designed to be titanium coated stainless
steel and at one ounce this should be
part of everyone's everyday carry
we integrated a blade for those ad hoc
moments paracord fishing line
perhaps a seat belt and of course a
bottle opener for those moments of
celebration
we've partnered up with SolidWorks with
their entrepreneurial program to develop
the fire beaner for an ergonomic design
for stress analysis and for overall
manufacturability so go on slap it in a
keychain or put on your pack and always
be prepared
we have our manufacturers set up and our
first set of prototypes have been
approved and now we're asking for your
help to help launch our first production
run to bring the fire beaner into your
hands and to your adventure and all the
features of the fire beaner come in
handy day in and day out
you
so get those grills and stoves lit clean
up those loose ends and get the backyard
ready
so please back this project you'll thank
yourself later
you
oh it's fine do whatever you want
[Laughter]
that is awesome
[Laughter]
that's awesome
yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
