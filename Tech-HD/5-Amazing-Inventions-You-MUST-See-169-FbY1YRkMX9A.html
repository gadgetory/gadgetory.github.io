of the exact status of your plants this
is Evgeniy he's the mastermind behind
this device ok if Jenny I'll take it
from here
for years now if Jenny has been growing
plants and helping his friends with
their growing setups and it's always
become a mess with all the wires
adapters and timers but slow loop so he
looked for a solution but couldn't find
a simple affordable controller that
connected to standard sensors
thus that's how grow director was born
after two years of research and
development he now has a working
prototype that can control everything in
the grow room and with your support it
can revolutionize the way people grow
plants in their homes yes you have all
the fun ready for manufacturing and
confirm the production of tools we get
the order please support us so we can
bring from drawing in the 21st century
close to I get up time is barely outside
I don't always
the snows which ISA leading us love is
will ever trust ya no I don't always
through Eastlands through the highways
so my shadow through sun rays and
finding life along the way melodies we
haven't played
go in around these walls to create a
song
I think that design belongs in real
homes and to prove this we made a camera
a link between the peers design and you
this is snappa it's a kiosk cardboard
camera it's very easy to use and let me
show you the camera works like this just
press this little button here and wait
till the green light turns up and then
you ready to shoot the camera comes with
a zoom function and we developed an
advanced image stabilization for indoor
use without image stabilization and with
so now you're ready to go stick the
camera into your computer upload images
from your home
browse through homes from all over the
world
big small odd or ordinary homes so be in
inspiration and be inspired
my name is Mike Bradford and I created
the wonderful stuff walk wire the
wonderful stuff waffle iron allows you
to take any of the foods you love to eat
with your waffle and put it inside your
waffle so the kinds of waffles you can
make just limited by your creativity
it's portable it's cordless it's modular
you can easily take it apart to cook
with on a clean it's made of high
quality materials including
heat-resistant handles lastly it's just
fun to cook life my professional
background is in mechanical engineering
but I also have a passion for cooking
growing up we cooked at home my mother
taught me everything she knew in the
kitchen later on I got a chance to
travel to Africa and the Asia and the
Europe and I found that one thing that
brings people together is food
the wonderful stuff waffle iron is a
device with which one's creative ideas
can come to fruition if you don't like
to cook you can use it as a gift if
you're a professional chef this would be
a great addition to your kitchen the
wonderful stuff waffle iron makes a meal
and a waffle
