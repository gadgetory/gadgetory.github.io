something I want to do it Allison
I always try to be a step ahead of us in
terms of nutrition in terms of training
every second counts
the equipment is is closure today also
sunglasses
in 1996 the air force approached us we
were three professors at Kent State
University's liquid-crystal Institute
and they asked us to see if we can
create a technology that will allow a
pilot or a soldier going into a building
to adapt to the different environmental
conditions as fast as they can that
means that in the dark state it needs to
be like sunglass and in the clear state
as clear as possible it took us about 17
years to create it and we've invested
close to 40 million dollars to create
this technology it will allow a person
to be able to control the amount of
lights that hits them and went to it I'm
convinced that control we revolutionized
eyewear industry add them on automatic
mode and I said this is not gonna work
but I went to a darker place where I was
about to drop my glass and take them
dock instant at clear lenses
if you go for an easy ride it's nice to
play a little bit like here in the race
it's not safe to take your hand off the
bar I will tear it on automatic mode as
soon as I leave the bus it's
extraordinary that this piece of
equipment designed for the US Special
Forces is available for any demanding
consumer for any athlete for anybody who
wants to enhance performance the product
can be customized in different ways for
optimal fit you can bend the sides and
then outfit
second of all you can also choose the
color of the frames and the color of the
lens you can take 200 cyclists and let
them try this and they say this is
 fantastic
you
a little bigger
Oh
smartphones tablets mp3s
GPS computers are the everyday
fundamental devices for all of us but
every day we could see people wearing
headphones and earbuds that bug one or
both of their ears while they are
driving cycling or walking we thought
that they are often a danger for
themselves and others and technology
offers little to really help just this
made us think to come up with a device
so that I can listen and talk through my
smart phone or my tablet without
earphones without wires and with my
hands totally free that's why we
designed and carried on our special
sunglasses project they are able to
listen without earphones
thanks to their boo hell vibes bone
conduction speakers to talk without wind
disruption thanks to their powerful
built-in microphone to be active without
wires
thanks to their 4.0 Bluetooth
we call them sound glasses because they
change your way to listen and stay
connected with your help and support we
can make our dream a reality and you
will be the first to enjoy this amazing
pair of sunglasses Thank You backers
sound glasses give you innovation
freedom safety and easier life

unique motion sensing interaction and

call my stimuli and when you write my
integration software
from off to Kersey
just for a creative experience
cos it's really one of those innovations
which comes along once in a while and
that has applications in so many
different fields and so many different
sports we've had really fantastic
feedback from a lot of different sports
a lot of different communities tractors
see was that today I absolutely loved
the idea one of the main problems we do
have in triathlon is trying to
coordinate that getting the helmet on
and the sunglasses at the same time I
just had my son is on because he's in
the pool and I just was going to go
underwater so I decided to just hold him
against my head and as I went under I
noticed that I could see underwater I
just have a guess I created mind and and
I just prototype my own little parts in
my garage at home and and so these are
what sprung out of my garage you place
the sunglasses on your head and you wear
them in this loose position like so and
by pressing the buttons on the side you
activate the mechanism which tightens
them around your head and it's even a
watertight seal if you want to use them
underwater
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
