toilet cleaning robot that cleans your
toilet bowl and seat automatically in

make your toilet cleaning experience
more efficient at the touch of a button

smart sensor scans your toilet shape and
a smart robotic arm goes out of a hidden
cell and gets to every spot in the bowl
equipped with a jet of water and soap
the brush rapidly rotates even
underwater dirt and bacteria don't have
a chance you won't need to take care of
anything the brush cleans and dries
itself killing up to 99.99 percent
bacteria
even the seat gets clean soap and water
Jets are washing the seat thoroughly
followed by a compressed air drying it
perfectly and when it's all done

this is not a natural position with the
index finger and the middle finger half
Dingling but the hand is in this
position when using most Mouse's this is
the most natural position we assume a
natural position like this to control
the mouse relieving the distortion on
our fingers for us that used the mouse
for a long time
team mouse to use your mouse in the most
natural and comfortable position these
are the forward and backward keys
corresponding to the forward and
backward keys in the Windows interface
in an intuitive way the forward and
backward Peas are generally set on the
right side of a traditional Mouse but
most users would flip in the Windows
interface rather than use them for they
do not correspond to the functional keys
in the window interface and the users
are unwilling to waste time to make
judgments the touchpad is just below the
fingers so the user can slide the
touchpad below without moving his
fingers we also set a sound
corresponding with the slide which
reduces your faulty operation and
invalid operation and provides a
wonderful experience as you slide along
with the buzzing sound you will find the
interface inertial as you slide to
touchpad rapidly this makes browsing a
lengthy webpage more convenient by
sending the trouble of rolling the will
continuously for a long time which is
really cool you mouse two's touchpad
possesses a cross slip function so you
can turn the pages to view the picture
or move horizontally this function is
useful for your office work and web
browsing when your fingers are too rough
or your cell phone is far away from you
or when you are lazy you can use T Mouse
to with a Bluetooth supposing you are a
game player you will experience that
clicking team
Jews left heat is just like pulling a
gun trigger the clicking of a regular
Mouse is downward while we can't find a
gun trigger which can be pulled downward
