introducing the limited electric bike
have you ever thought about fighting
both traveling companion and bring you
closer to the world around it this high
quality like an affordable price
to become an integral and enjoyable part
my
the traffic nowadays is getting worse
but Vivid helped me get around buses
cars and even other bikes it's
relatively faster greener and more
affordable with up to 20 miles an hour
of power assist vivid is a relaxing and
enjoyable way to commute now I can
finally start my workday full of energy
after a long day at work can't wait to
ride on my Vivat to get some fresh air
equipped with an advanced power system
and Shimano derailleur the choice to go
hard or easy is at your fingertips I
won't be late for my after work happy
hour with my friends safety is always a
top priority for riders huge integrated
life system makes your ride safer and
more convenient at night the
german-engineered light guarantees you a
clear view without disrupting oncoming
traffic vivid is engineered to be a
high-quality reliable a bike that adopts
the state of the art barfing electric
system allowing me to experience the joy
of riding under all circumstances
combining the best components with an
elegant design
Vivat is my trusty everyday companion
now let's be uphill without breaking a
sweat
on weekends vivid lets me explore new
places and helps me create great
memories with friends and family
cycling is much more interesting
exciting with my loved ones on occasions
like this vivid is that trusty friend
that never lets me down thanks to the
all-terrain tires
filo saddle and full suspension bumpy
roads are now gentle and smooth looking
to exercise and sweat it out simply turn
off the pedal assist through the display
and select from 21 Shimano speed gears
the high-contrast LCD display delivers
important information at a glance
it can even be read under direct
sunlight how do you like to spend your
holidays for me short trips and getting
closer to nature is always my first
choice for a vacation on a single charge
viv you can take us up to 50 miles near
far wherever the best sites are thumb
throttle and auto drive modes allow us
to enjoy a leisurely cruise along the
coastline peace of mind and the thrill
of a ride who says you can't have both
this is my vivid ebike inspire your own
vivid life today back us on IndieGoGo
and help us spread the joy to more
people go easy go green go vivid this is
the driven drive chain from ceramic
speed started life is this prototype
just a single speed on it and it
obviously has no chain they were seeking
to create a drive chain that would be
much more efficient not have all points
of contact and that a chain system has
this is the latest prototype which is
winning an award Eurobike it has two
points of contacts and they reckon that
this is 99% efficient it is still a
prototype so it doesn't actually change
gear on to the 13 years that you see
showing here here is the pinion drive
shaft this is a prototype it's
battery-operated moves opinion bearings
up and down the gears or it would and
the real thing
they went for 13 speed thinking that
would stand out at the Uemura bike show
actually there's been a 13 speed
launched here so they say they could
just add a fourteenth or they could add
as many as they want
they're only limited by the length of
the drive shaft this is still prototype
and they say they don't have the
capacity to take this product to market
so I suspect that we're looking to sell
it on with the patient to another
company as far as mountain biking is
concerned they think that with no
derailleur you'll be able to encase the
whole system and keep mud out what do
you reckon is this the future
unfortunately flat tires happen
the current flat repair options aren't
always the most reliable or easy to use
and pumps take a lot of energy and a
long time to inflate a tire co2
inflators are unreliable if you make a
mistake and release all the gas you're
stuck having nightmares with flats out
on the trails and in backcountry we set
out to make the fastest high-volume
lightweight mobile inflation device
possible introducing the stomp under the
first truly portable foot pump for
repairing any tire the stop pump engages
your largest muscles your legs you can
inflate a tire three times faster and
infinitely easier than a typical hand
pump it keeps your hands-free to do
other things it's also easy to stow and
put into use hands down the best pump
ever made the stop pump is the first
pump that we know of to incorporate an
integrated air filter this keeps the
incoming air clean from dirt and debris
that can damage the internals and keeps
your stall pump working smoothly for
years to come
the creators of stomp pump had been the
brains behind bringing hundreds of
products to market over the last thirty
years through a prolific career in
BattleBots we've created some of the
most extreme air systems in robotic
combat stomp up was designed to be light
strong and efficient just like our
championship robots we've left no stone
unturned in our design and development
process we truly started from scratch
when creating the stomp up it's not just
a pump design that's been converted to a
foot pump every component has been
purpose-built for the demands of the
foot pump the stop pump will be made
in-house here in Marin County California
of the highest quality materials to
exacting standards by our expert crew
this isn't just a unique foot pump this
would be the highest quality pumpkin
pone
we have everything you need to get
started with production of the Stompa
and this is where we need your help we
invite you to support stop by taking
advantage of the great rewards available
only in our Kickstarter campaign
become one of the first to own a stock
thank you for supporting stompa we
expect to be delivering stomp up to the
world 2018</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
