Calista grill the first extendable
barbecue you can transport by bike I
grew up in Munich and as everyone knows
who lives in a big city it's really
complicated to have a spontaneous
barbecue in a public space that's why I
am metric mr. grill at transport of a
barbecue for your city simply hook the
grill to the handlebars of the bike and
write to your favorite part the main
issue is how to transport all the things
you need to the grill location you need
coal food Forex and obviously a BBQ and
if you want to go by bike it's nearly
impossible to carry all these things but
Krista there is no need for a backpack
and one person can carry everything for
us it is really important that
attachment is not permanent and you
don't need a tool to fix it we abide no
matter if you have a mountain bike
acidified or racing bike Calissa is
designed for the city that's why you
mustn't worry if you go of an uneven
Street a curb or grass list I will
always stay perfectly safe to the
handlebars of your body
we developed a barbecue you could also
use when you're down site a lot lists
that can be carried like a normal basket
the clever thing is that the handles are
off on the legs so just flip them over
when you arrive
Kalista off a space for cold food in
napkins and forks whatever you need just
put it inside for the transport the
second main benefit of coasters that you
can extend it to the double size
canister offer space for up to 10 people
we also offer small cool packages the
clue about them is that the package is
also the grill igniter roll off the
paper and light it now it's just as
simple as possible to set the coal into
flames and into spreading recycled paper
so now on earth in toxic smoke on the
grill has two zones which are optimized
for meat sausages and vegetables now
it's way easier to real small Tomatoes
champignons or cheese that's a huge
benefit for vegetarians another main
issue about having a BBQ as the
complicated cleaning afterwards we got
the solution simply put the grill into
your dishwasher
