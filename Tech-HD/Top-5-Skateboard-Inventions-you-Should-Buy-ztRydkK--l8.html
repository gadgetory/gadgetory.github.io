state-of-the-art compact electric drive
system that can fit under any skateboard
within minutes it can transform an
enormous paper into an electric
skateboard tomato is just the small two
point five kilo component but it has the
capacity to upgrade your favorite board
into the most dynamic and high-quality
electric skateboard on the market all
you have to do is unscrew the rear track
of your board replace it with a melon
Drive and you're ready to go now that
Killian tell you all about the new high
the heart of mellow is the motor and
we're really proud to say that it's been
developed tested and produced in Germany
before we founded Melo I was an electric
car engineer at BMW this definitely
opened some doors when we started
looking for the best partners and
supplier they immediately shared our
vision of a compact yet potent in wheel
motor for direct transmission and thus
maximum riding pleasure even if you are
an absolute skateboard rookie the
handling of Melo is really simple with
the intuitive hand control all functions
are just immediate um finding the right
battery for Melo was a challenge on the
one hand he wants to an endless ride on
the other hand we wanted s little weight
as possible the solution is a
custom-made swappable battery pack so in
case you really want to go for an
endless ride you can easily exchange it
on the go okay carry on thank you
so if you think now right story great
product what do you need need more let
you want a sum it up for you
you
let's be honest the skate industry
hasn't seen any real innovation in the
past 30 years that's why we've decided
to think outside the block
introducing the world's first bullet
resistant clear customizable skateboard
here for absolutely any lifestyle
whether you're a beginner skateboarder
or an advanced downhiller the jelly
Manowar is the perfect ride for you
what's going on guys this is Ben CEO and
co-founder of jelly
we're super excited to introduce you the
all new redesigned jelly Manowar which
has been a culmination of all the
awesome feedback that we've received
from our jelly fans across the world but
we thought we could go one step further
so we teamed up with the homies and Lok
risers innovation to give our boards the
functionality to fit your lifestyle the
flex of a snowboard needs to flow the
surf for the jelly Manowar is a
downhillers me so i really like the new
jelly deck
Manowar super shake for scott concave
keep it under my key blocks are super
sick and just click right into my
skateboard
I'm not down the hill without worrying
about my camera hi my name is Kevin
founder and chief technical innovation
officer for blocker Iser innovations
I've always liked putting things in
places that's why I came with this stash
block so I can put more things in more
places what other things can you put it
into the stash block you might ask I
wonder
what's up sup bro got any jelly but of
course here some great yeah
the patent-pending Betty box allows you
to replace your stash block with the go
block and now you can film with added
stability
the standard GoPro attaches to the top
of your board increasing vibrations and
rendering your footage useless plus once
you stick them on they become a
permanent fixture
the go block can be easily taken on and
off allowing for limitless user
experience by absorbing vibrations
reducing speed walls and increasing
stability the space-age material
provides extreme flexibility making
jelly the easiest skateboard to ride
ever it really is the perfect board for
riding down the boardwalk it's so crazy
it was super mellow but really
responsive like I'm not used to skating
I felt really natural on the board it
was really inviting and we both really
had an awesome time skating the boards
they really enjoy how they flex and
about how durable they compete
they're awesome I can't I can't think of
another board right on they don't catch
over cracks it just flowed over
everything
they're good a nice or smooth a fast my
friends love them good time
I love this board it saves you valuable
minutes in the morning it's fun for me
to get from my car into the office look
at it sleek enough that I can bring it
in and feel comfortable
the jelly boys has made it so much
easier for me it also takes you up to
the next level skateboarding get so
scared till a bribe the jelly board but
the jelly forty wasn't actually just so
scary drag you need a food I'm the added
benefit of a deck made out of
bulletproof glass is simple it's super
high impact resistant and 100%
recyclable jellies rock is ready to roll
all we need is your support
you
every year millions of people will pick
up a skateboard for the first time all
of them want to start landing awesome
tricks if you land one you're hooked the
early tricks are very hard for most of
us just like any sport if the kids don't
see progress then quit that's why I
created skatertrainers most tips tell
you to start on the crack or some grass
but it's not enough you don't land back
in the crack and the grass doesn't quite
feel the same there are a lot of great
how-to videos out there but many skaters
give up too soon on their skateboarding
dreams skater trainer is a simple tool
that you slip on the wheels of your
skateboard to keep it from rolling it's
an intermediate step to slow things down
so you can learn the moves and commit
the landing tricks like a nollie or
kickflip my name is Roger I'm an
engineer an inventor and the creator of
schedule trainer I spent 25 years not
skating and then decided that I wanted
to get back into it easier said than
done
it was tough I felt like a beginner all
over again only this time with a lot
more fear of falling and busting my 40
year old ass having spent the last 20
years as an aerospace engineer my mind
instantly went into figuring out a
solution to this problem I built a
prototype out of things I had around the
house and learned a few tricks I knew I
was on to something so I made a $200
youtube video created a manufacturable
design and started testing I was blown
away by the response I got
skaters crossed the world we're sending
in their praise of skatertrainers I got
on up on Monday and I learned a kick
by the end of Monday I think you got
your toes bought their Turner's they've
totally worth it
their testimonials validated the concept
but they also highlighted some key
issues they were hard to get on would
slip off when used eventually wore out
and we're pretty ugly I took that
feedback and created version 2.0
scheduler trainer it's ways your to
install fits on almost any skateboard
wheel won't slip off is lighter and more
durable than the first version
the design is ready the production
prototypes work great and the
manufacturer here in Oklahoma is
standing by to produce them I've taken
it as far as I can on my own now I need
your help to finalize the tooling and
get the volume up on the first order our
shipping system is in place and we can
roll right into 2.0 we are ready to go
we just need your support
skatertrainers are the perfect gift to
help your favorite skater get the tricks
they really want have some fun and stay
excited about skateboarding
you
hi everyone my name's Benjamin I'm the
designer of the brake board trucks now
the brake wood trucks are a braking
system for skateboards then you might
think a brake on skateboard
how does stem apply this is not the case
we spent a very long time to refine a
break that could control your speed
downhill with ease really good skaters
can do power slides and high-speed foot
braking but the general rider like us
can't do this we just want to be a bit
commute down the hill with ease and
control and the brake board trucks
allowed
this is a break board now great board
actually all contained within the rear
truck you can set this trap up onto your
own deck now how it works is is a pedal
on top a pair of disc brakes well
technically they call kind clutches you
can use any desk or any wheels of your
choice and quite simply because applies
pressure on here and replies body weight
so that it won't bite or skid suddenly
you want flat spot your wheels you'll be
able to control your speed with power
and control downhill
you
Avenue Trucks the first-ever high
performance suspension skateboard truck
with an increase in speed better
supported turning impact reduction
increased pop and reduce speed wobbles
it makes avenue suspension trucks the
first ever skate truck of its kind
since almost everything else with wheels
has suspension
why hasn't skating adopted this yet
truth is standard trucks have
limitations they don't improve speed
they don't reduce impact and they can't
maximize the skaters performance that's
why we created Avenue Trucks Avenue was
created in a metal fab shop by small
team of skaters engineers and machinists
we've always felt standard skate trucks
lacked the engineering needed to support
the demand skateboarding requires so we
spent the last three and a half years
designing testing and developing nearly
600 prototypes to bring to you a truly
versatile high-performance truck so what
are some of the benefits first off a
major increase in speed standard trucks
don't absorb vibrations due to limited
wheel travel they don't allow the wheels
to roll smoothly over up concrete which
ultimately slows the board down Avenue
skate tracks absorb pavement
imperfections and vibrations keeping
your momentum forward and your ride fast
and smooth our trucks also compress with
you while pumping through verts and
transitions giving much more speed more
speed overt means more height and bigger
air if you're an aggressive skater
you'll be stoked to know our trucks help
absorb impact on joints and your bones
whether you're dropping off a 10 stair a
rooftop or just perfecting your tricks
impacts add up eventually destroying
your body less stress on your body means
less time recovering and more time
skiing unlike standard trucks our base
play slightly compresses before throwing
a trick releases when you pop and brings
energy to every trick reducing that dead
weighted feeling better pop bigger
tricks having suspension also means
smoother longer grinds by absorbing
rough edges chipped concrete or dented
rails our flexible baseplate helps you
maintain your grind speed eliminating
most elements that interferes
long fast crime we've also discovered
that Avenue trucks have helped reduce
speed wobble in major way we've been
able to take our trucks up to 50 miles
an hour before seeing any sign of speed
wobble we're also introducing our
suspension truck to the longboarding
industry as we're in the process of
successfully finishing the designing and
testing of our longboard trucks allowing
for faster more stable speeds on a
longboard right now we have
manufacturing on standby with a high
quality company ready to go what this
means is the machines have been built
and are ready to produce out new trucks
so all that's left is to pay for final
production costs and the material to run
our very first order with your support
you will make it possible to get Avenue
trucks out the door and under your feet
you can be confident in helping us reach
our goal as we have already invested
$250,000 of our own money and have had
hundreds of riders take out new trucks
to the streets helping shape this
product into what it is today the first
ever truly high performance suspension
skate truck by backing and supporting us
on Kickstarter for just $45 not only are
you helping launch this product to the
world but you could be one of the very
first to own and write a set of Avenue
trucks for a much cheaper price than
retail
so pick up your pair and feel the
benefits of what a high-performance gate
truck can really do for you
together we can elevate skateboarding to
an entirely new and exciting level this
is the future I'm speechless right now
