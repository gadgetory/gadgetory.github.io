created my IDP essentially so that you
never have to remember another password
again simply swipe your finger across
the device any of your crosswords become
available to you imagine the ability to
securely store not only passwords but
also five photos important documents
like passport information driver's
license information so the voice search
features you really easy to use press
the button you say Chase Manhattan and
they have a palmist range it works with
a PC or Mac and seamlessly connects via
bluetooth so that you can use all of the
mobile devices that usually manage
impossible it's just the swipe of your
finger imagine I have a key
my wife has a team my daughter has a key
someone else in my trusted network
anything and we can all access the same
flower imagine that we can share that
net enough we lose a key which includes
complete deactivated and get nothing my
IDP also provides the ability to plug it
in USB into a laptop where it'll
automatically form fill the password for
any web browser excitement you're going
to it's very easy for a computer to
remember passwords going across so
humans will cross roads so using the my
IDP and then after remember I possibly
have
you
we are power practical after
successfully kick-starting for products
we're back to introduce our fifth the
luminol we set out to make a versatile
durable lighting solution that could
stand up to both our adventures as well
as their everyday life we wanted a
meaningful amount of light that was
waterproof and can run off of any USB
port lumen noodle is a 5 foot long 180
lumen LED light it's waterproof with its
silicon wrapped case we designed a
unique fastening system that leverages
loops magnets and our custom-designed
noodle ties the loom noodle comes with a
white rip stop carrying bag that doubles
as a lantern we are coming back to
Kickstarter to raise money to open our
molds and bring the loom noodle to life
please back or share our project and let
us know how you use your noodle thanks
big starters
you
the ubiquitous USB flashdrive we all
have one of these for the times when we
just want to get large files quickly to
and from the computer movies photos
music documents all copied quickly onto
this tiny device there's no easier or
faster way to transfer large files
between computers now what if we can
also connect this to iPads iPhones and
iPod Touches I stick the world's first
USB flash drive with integrated Apple
lightning connector now not only can you
move files between computers but also
between iPads iPhones and iPod touches
as well instantly share files between
Mac PC and various iOS devices you can
transfer music from the computer to an
iPod touch or playback instantly from
the istick say goodbye to the
time-consuming iTunes synchronization

space on your iDevice backup all of your
iPhone photos and videos to the
high-capacity eye stick no need for
internet or pay for recurring online
storage or cloud subscriptions the eye
stick is perfect for business use your
data is now more secure since no data is
sent through third-party servers or
transferred over the Internet and
wireless networks where hackers may gain
access istick is always by your side

even when there's no internet
you can use it anywhere even on planes
expand your ipad or iphone storage
playback movies and media directly from
istick without taking up space on your
iOS device with istick sharing and
transferring files has never been easier
or faster
I stick the world's first USB flash
drive with integrated Apple lightning
connector
hi I'm David laptops are getting smaller
and smaller with fewer fewer USB ports
two ports you've got two ports to plug
in your cell phone your tablet your
printer your mouse your keyboard
external hard drive there's so much to
plug in is just not enough to plug into
hot swapping devices and work either you
can't use two devices at the same time
you want to transfer files between your
flash drives
they've got unplug your mouse from your
keyboard that doesn't make much sense
and I just going through crazy mess of
tangled cords just to get one that you
need that's what we're introducing
infinite USB if an USB is an open chain
of USB ports granted literally an
unlimited supply of available ports it's
just that simple it's just that easy
infinite USB is available in micro
lightning and female USB ports you can
charge your Apple or Android or any
smartphone or tablet all day by taking
up serial ports my favorite part though
are no more wild wires are crazy cable
nests and check this out it's so cool
it's so simple but mixed world
difference is the magnet design
this is infinite USB small design big
change</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
