hi I'm David laptops are getting smaller
and smaller with fewer fewer USB ports
two ports you've got two ports to plug
in your cell phone your tablet your
printer your mouse your keyboard
external hard drive there's so much to
plug in is just not enough to plug into
hot swapping devices and work either you
can't use two devices at the same time
you want to transfer files between your
flash drives
they've got unplug your mouse from your
keyboard that doesn't make much sense
and I just going through crazy mess of
tangled cords just to get one that you
need that's what we're introducing
infinite USB if an USB is an open chain
of USB ports granted literally an
unlimited supply of available ports it's
just that simple it's just that easy
infinite USB is available in micro
lightning and female USB ports you can
charge your Apple or Android or any
smartphone or tablet all day by taking
up serial ports my favorite part though
are no more wild wires are crazy cable
nests and check this out it's so cool
it's so simple but mixed world
difference is the magnet design
this is infinite USB small design big
change</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
