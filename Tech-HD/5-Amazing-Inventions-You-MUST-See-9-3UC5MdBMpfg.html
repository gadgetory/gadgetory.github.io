they'll always shot from the same
perspective are you bored of carbon copy
selfies now you can take photography and
videography to new heights literally
meet birdy birdy is an aerodynamically
shaped case for popular action camps
like the GoPro you simply insert your
device and toss birdy into the air we
wanted to create something that would
allow photographers to explore new
points of view in an affordable and
simple way using birdy feels like a game
of catch
with sprinkle of engineering and the
concepts behind shutterstock of
badminton ball we have achieved what we
expected
once birdie reaches maximum altitude it
will settle start a fall with the camera
facing downwards
the resulting photos are candid
capturing authentic in the moment
expressions
birdie has been specially engineered to
protect your action cam from damage we
completed design and made a tuille
we are alejandro carmen and y ni a young
team of Uruguayan engineers and now we
need the final push to go into
production together let's make birdie
fly around the globe support our
campaign tell your friends about it
you

Oh
I
Oh
Oh
I
I was afraid I was petrified okay we
invented a new kind of guitar that
people can learn to play in a matter of
minutes only around ten percent of the
population plays a musical instrument
but eighty percent wishes they could I
would love to be able to play the guitar
if you don't you know have all the time
in the world is extremely hard to learn
our guitarra has strings for strumming
and finger picking just like a
traditional guitar but instead of
strings going up the fretboard we have
buttons all you have to do is use a
single touch to play entire chords our
mobile app can display the song for you
with the lyrics and the cord numbers
said you get started playing right away
we set up a day and we invited a whole
bunch of people who wish they could play
the guitar to try our product I was
introduced yeah maybe 45 minutes ago so
we'll see how this goes
is it
ma
once again
down
Oh
this is the most amazing thing I've ever
seen it's kind of surreal that it sounds
like that like I'm doing that I feel
really happy that I was able to learn
this so quickly I'd love to have one of
these our vision is to see a lot more
people sing playing and making music
together
the guitar has a built-in speaker so you
can just grab it and go play anywhere or
you can even turn the speaker down and
play through your headphones you're not
disturbing anyone there's a lot that
goes into designing manufacturing and
shipping a great musical instrument and
our entire team of engineers and
musicians are working super hard to
bring you a great product if you ever
wish that you could be musically
expressive right away with this
instrument now you can please Bacchus
hi i'm mike scully creator of the lever
gear tool card i founded lever gear to
design products that solve real problems
look great and will last forever we all
have little projects that pop up in life
and they don't always happen when our
tools are handy it's annoying to have to
spend time chasing down tools for a job
that should take 10 seconds if you're
like me it usually ends up getting added
to your to-do list that's why we created
the lever gear tool card it's a
multi-tool the size of a credit card
that has 40 different tools it's always
with you so you can get things done I
like to be prepared to handle any task
but I also hate the idea of carrying
around a lot of extra stuff a credit
card sized tool that could disappear in
my wallet seemed like the perfect
solution we developed the tool card with
a simple premise the real estate in your
pocket is precious so you should own
stuff that's actually worth carrying we
began our design process by
brainstorming all of the functions we
could pack into a credit card sized
multi-tool we also tested every card
that existed on the market we fought a
lot about the design and layout of the
tool card by nesting the tools we were
able to add tools and reduce weight
without sacrificing strength we kept the
edges smooth so it feels great in your
hand when you're using the tools we
chose not to have an exposed blade so
the tool card is TSA compliant and it
won't damage your wallet instead we
added a blade protected by the can
opener so you can cut cords but not your
fingers the tool card weighs only one
ounce and slips easily into your wallet
so you won't notice it until you need it
or ditch the wallet all together the
innovative money clip is designed to
snap on with a click and disassemble
with ease no extra tools required no
fasteners to lose so you can quickly
switch from wallet card to money clip
tool card is made in America from blade
quality 420 stainless steel which is
then heat-treated for excellent strength
and hardness it's then bead blasted for
a professional finish and laser etched
for rich permanent graphics
the tool card makes an awesome gift that
will last a lifetime and it's scheduled
to ship before Father's Day and
graduation we've put in a lot of time to
make this tool as good as it can be
please help us by supporting our
campaign sharing it with your friends
thank you
