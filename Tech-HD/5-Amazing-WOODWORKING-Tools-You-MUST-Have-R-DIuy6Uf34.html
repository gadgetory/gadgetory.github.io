quality cuts and you can make them more
easily than you ever thought possible
using your circular saw plus the Craig
rip cut the Craig rip cut circular saw
edge guide takes the intimidation out of
cutting and allows you to make cuts
without measuring without marking and
without having to keep the saw from
wandering off of a cut line the RIP cut
turns your ordinary circular saw into a
precision edged guided cutting tool that
makes straight accurate repeatable cuts
in plywood MDF and other large sheets
easy and accurate and because projects
up and call for multiple pieces to be
cut the exact same size with the RIP cut
you can lock in a size and can be
confident that with cut after cut the
pieces will be exactly the same size
also you can make these cuts anywhere
you need to by taking your side of the
material instead of having to bring your
material to the saw the RIP cut makes
this possible with a universal sled that
holds your saw an aluminum guide rail
with built-in measuring scale and an
oversized edge guide that follows the
edge of the plywood sheet to provide
complete control as you cut the
universal sled can also be used on the
Craig enqueue cut the RIP cut works with
just about any circular saw whether it
has a blade mounted on the left or the
right side plus the edge guide is
reversible so the RIP cut works equally
well right-handed and left-handed
mounting your saw on the RIP cut is
quick and easy and your song can be
removed for other uses
then reinstall just as quickly using the
RIP cut is easy to just lock the saw
slit at your desired cut from one inch
up to 24 inches wide
then simply hold the edge guide against
your sheet turn this on and go a large
handle on the edge guide that helps you
maintain solid contact with the edge of
your sheet with the RIP cut circular saw
edge guide it's just that easy there's
no measuring and no marking just
straight accurate repeatable cuts every
time visit us online at Craig to accom
to learn more about the Craig RIP cut as
well as our other Craig cutting
solutions that make cutting easy so you
can start every project with confidence
just kidding
to have all these functions using
dedicated purpose tools you'd have to
tote a toolbox around your shop
woodpeckers odd job tools are made from
the highest quality materials the body
is precision machined from a solid block
of aircraft-grade aluminum the rulers
and knurled head screws are stainless
steel the combination scribe and scratch
wall are made from special C 440
hardened stainless steel and the rulers
are laser engraved in 1/32 of an inch
increments woodpeckers has vastly
improved the odd-job beam compass
feature by adding two special sized
sleeves that lock into the ruler blade
and hold either that provided nine
millimeter mechanical pencil or the
scribe tool in perfect position what's
the difference between the two
woodpeckers odd-job tools the odd-job
body is four inches tall by two and 3/8
inches wide by 3/4 of an inch thick it
comes with a six inch ruler with an
optional eight inch ruler the odd-job XL
is substantially larger at six inches
tall by three and 5/8 inches wide by one
in 1/4 of an inch thick the XL comes
with a 12 inch ruler with an optional
eight inch ruler available every odd job
and odd job XL comes with a woodpecker's
mechanical pencil
plus extra LEDs and erasers in a plastic
case with custom cut foam when you order
the odd-job deluxe set you not only get
both size tools but the optional length
rulers as well and the set includes a
protective plastic case with custom cut
foam interior you can also order the
deluxe set in a sustainer case for an
additional charge get your odd job and
odd job XL the ultimate 15 function
layout measurement marking and gauging
tools the Craig inline clamp
makes it easy to hold work pieces of all
shapes and sizes without the clamp
getting in the way
the inline clamp does this with a
low-profile design that applies pressure
from the side rather than from overhead
so the clamp stays out of the way as you
work the inline clamps stays in place
with a peg that fits into any three
quarter inch diameter hole that makes
the clamp a perfect companion to the
Craig mobile project Center and allows
you to get more from any workbench
that's equipped with three quarter inch
bench dog holes or you can drill through
quarter inch holes in any work surface
to add the convenience of Craig inline
clamping using the inline clamp is easy
simply turn the contoured easy-to-grip
dial to move the push rod and press the
clamp shoe against your workpiece that
makes it easy to dial on the clamping
pressure you need up to 250 pounds of
clamping force the low-profile clamp
shoe is just one half inch thick so it
stays out of the way while you work the
clients chute design holds tight against
work pieces of all shapes and sizes
including corners and round edges and
because you can rotate the inline clamp
it's easy to direct that clamping
pressure in whatever direction you need
with the Craig inline clamp you get the
helping hand you need when you need it
with the versatility you want for a wide
variety of tasks visit us online at
Craig tool comm to learn more about the
Craig inline clamp as well as our other
Craig clamping solutions that help you
create every project with confidence
