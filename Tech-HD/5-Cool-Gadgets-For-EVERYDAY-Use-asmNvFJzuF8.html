creators of collapsing go every time I
took my daughter out I detect so much
into the diaper bag battles
wipes diapers and I found myself just
everyday having to dig through remove
these large bulky bottles just to find
one thing so Matt told me to go out and
buy collapsible baby bottles and sippy
cups
and I told him that we couldn't because
they don't exist that's when the light
bulb went off that it's a product that I
wanted to create so that night we wrote
down what we wish as parents we would
have in a bottle and a sippy cup we went
out and we bought the top-of-the-line
bottles and cups throw down our likes
and dislikes and we incorporated those
features and what we think today is the
best baby bottle it's to be kept coming
to the market as a dad I wanted a bottle
that was very portable because I don't
like carrying around diaper bags so it
was important that I had something that
I could easily fit in my pocket give to
my daughter when she was hungry or
thirsty and then when she was done with
it just put it back in my pocket and
continue on with our day some of the
really special features about the baby
bottle is not just that it collapses so
small almost as small as a hockey puck
but the other really nice thing about it
is it's made out of food grade silicone
so it doesn't crack it doesn't stain
it's dishwasher safe it's BPA free and
the really neat thing is it's shaped
like mom so when you're breastfeeding
and transitioning to bottle feeding it's
a texture and feel and shape that's
familiar to them but it's also very easy
for them to grasp and hold many baby
bottles cause a common problem with
excess air intake with air bottles the
parent can easily collapse the bottle
while feeding releasing this extra air
which will help eliminate discomfort for
the baby
I love that the bottles tip proof I
often follow around my daughter because
she spills bottles over and there's milk
on the floor and I'm just going after
cleaning it up and this is great because
it will not tip cleanliness to me as a
parent is extremely important for baby
bottles and sippy cups because over time
of using my daughter's cups I was trying
to clean them as much as I could but
consistently mold was growing I just
couldn't get into those hard-to-reach
places so that's why when we created our
cups and bottles we made it so not only
can you just put it in the dishwasher
but it only has a few parts where you
can easily get it clean storage in the
house is much easier I used to open up
my cabinet and all these bottles will be
falling onto me because I couldn't
neatly put them in a space now the
collapsible baby bottles and sippy cups
stack perfectly so you could easily
stack for collapse of bottles or
collapse of cups which will be equal to
the size of one average bottle what I
also love about it is you don't have to
buy a separate sippy cup you just simply
have to buy the sippy cup accessory
parts do just twist off the bottom of
the bottle and you twist on the sippy
cup bottom
and the transition nipple and now you
have brand new sippy cup so Kickstarter
we worked really hard on this product
and we really think we're onto something
our goal is to make your lives as
parents easier whether you have an
infant or a toddler so parents join us
so we could get a colossal bottle and
collapse akov and kids hands everywhere
if you want every edge your gear this
Kickstarter is for you we're going to
challenge something you probably take
for granted about your sport watch like
the rest of your performance gear your
watch is evolved to help you achieve
more we simply asked why are your
valuable stats not in your natural line
of sight we want to know our cadence
without losing we want to know our pace
without going slower
we want to know our metrics and we want
to stay focused on a sport and honor
form today's watches deliver a torn of
information in ways we never could have
imagined so why do we wear them the same
way we always have our vision is a bat a
band that moves your watch to the
optimum position abandoned enables you
to view and interact with your watch
using no arm rotation it means staying
informed
it means improve safety when grabbing a
glance and it means improved comfort and
convenience when using your apps or
looking at your metrics on top of
optimizing the position it's designed to
be ultra lightweight comfortable to wear
and durable during activity
ergonomic design creates the perfect
angle of view and interacting on the
move and it's adjustable size fits
everyone on the left or right hand
stopping yet another piece of Technology
from bending is and more uncomfortable
positions and with a versatile design it
can be worn 24/7 or easily swapped
between beds to break a hundred years of
tradition we needed to think differently
we needed to break the status quo if
this sounds like you join us and help
change the face of time
the world produces over 300 million tons
of plastic each year most of it used
once and then thrown away which is a
huge problem for us all because a
disposable lifestyle isn't the
sustainable lifestyle there is a better
way Lumi lets you stop using disposable
plastics like bags plates and straws
at Lumi we want to unplastered the world
with reusable products made of pure
platinum silicon like glass platinum
silicon is made mostly of sand but it's
flexible durable and completely
non-toxic that's because unlike many
silicone products lumi is filler free no
bpa BPS PVC phthalates all chemicals you
don't want your food
Lumias freezer oven microwave
and dishwasher-safe
it can be used for pretty much anything
over and over again which means Lumi can
replace thousands of disposable plastics
so you can help save the environment
while saving money
just one lumi bag can replace 240
plastic sandwich bags in a single school
year and that's just the start of what
you can do
we know we're just one solution to a
global single use plastic problem but
small changes can have big impacts
choose looming and help us unplastered
the world
