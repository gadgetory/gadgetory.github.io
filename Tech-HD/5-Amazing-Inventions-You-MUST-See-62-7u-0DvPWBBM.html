phone case with serious engineering that
hasn't compromised on looks
this is London's Waterloo Bridge a 35
foot drop
here we go
not even a scratch how because we've
engineered an advanced impact material
arrow shop it's inside all our phone
cases this unique polymer contains
thousands of micro air pockets that
absorb the impacts the ball bearing to
drop some regular plastic bounces but on
arrow shot the energy is absorbed the
same thing happens in our phone cases
all our cases are seriously protective
so protective we've dropped it from a
crane onto concrete from 45 feet
all our cases have a steel plate built
into the back and they come with a free
magnetic wall mount for backers they fit
both the iPhone six and seven so you
don't have to upgrade your case the same
applies for the six plus and the second
box here you can see our tools making
our cases using our own materials
hey hurry boss oh this is crazy
that's so cool oh wow oh wow that's in
lar you know I told you I used to be the
military and stuff and I got a lot of
hearing loss from my job and so this is
like a new new level of here and going
superhero right now a couple my friends
have like some hearing issues but
nothing like this this is this is kind
of this is nice so plus the VA is
usually pretty good about covering stuff
but if their hearing isn't covered it's
really expensive for them to have to you
know buy one of these things I'm sure
this is expensive one in five Americans
are disabled what comes to mind when you
hear the word disability why is hearing
impairment so accepted then we don't fix
the source of the problem a decent
hearing aid today cost around two
thousand dollars or more people don't
wear hearing aids as a fashion statement
like they do glasses only Union was
founded to combat the two impairments
price and social perception and
eliminate hearing impairments how the
first barrier price here is how much a
decent hearing aid cost today
$4,400 and here's the breakdown cutting
down significantly on the materials and
research expenses we don't use expensive
machines for testing and diagnostics we
kept our margins as low as possible and
after cutting out as many costs as we
could we were still at $500 the second
barrier is social perception we
approached hearing aids from a totally
different design perspective not as a
medical device but as an accessory
we've designed the Olive benchmarking
the latest earbuds and Bluetooth ear
pieces over the past year we develop the
next generation hearing aid using a
smart sound algorithm and Bluetooth
technology we've also revolutionized the
hearing test and feeding process to make
it quick easy and accessible we don't
fit taps on the only path you can set up
a customized hearing profile with sound
frequencies optimized for your ears you
don't need a funky looking medical
device or amplifier to hear better
you just need on olive but in order for
this to be truly accessible $500 is
still too high
our goal is to bring the olive to you at
$100 flat this isn't just a crowdfunding
campaign is proud R&amp;amp;D campaign in order
to reduce R&amp;amp;D costs I need all of you to
help us paratis the olive and provide us
with the proper feedback so that we can
create the best hearing experience for
everyone let's hear the word together
you
this is oxy light it makes everything
you do with your iPhone 7 even better
just toss out your other bulky adapters
you will never have to choose between
charging and music again with its cool
sleek design oxy light is a perfect
companion for your iPhone 7 the power
light is an LED indicator turns on when
your phone is charging the dedicated DAC
combined with the audio enhancer helps
you get the best music quality without
having to give up your high-end
headphones oxy light also features an
adjustable stand open you multitask
wherever you are so whether it's video
chatting with your friends setting up
your next hot date or watching the
latest Netflix series
oxy light seamlessly integrates into
your daily life it also doubles as a
court organizer so say goodbye to messy
cables forever and you can tuck it away
and take it with you wherever you go
we all love the iPhone 7 it's sleek and
powerful but the missing headphone jack
is a real issue for a lot of people and
big bulky add-ons are just not on so
we've developed the orc slide the
perfect solution it's chic and slim and
matches your iPhone perfectly and
manufacturers are standing by now we
need your help if you or someone you
know is not a fan of compromise pledge
now help us bring our vision to life
why choose where you can have both oxy
white
this is Sarah she's an office manager
with long hours and big responsibilities
working on a computer all day long my
name is Ryan I'm treating Sarah for
tension headaches and stiffness in the
neck and shoulder stress and bad posture
may have contributed to our problem she
always has a great time here in the
clinic
however the biggest challenge for her is
how long she can stay there relaxed and
home a modern days neck has been
punished every day driving sitting
computers and cell phones my patients
always ask me is there anything I can
use at home so I promised them I'll make
something that's safe portable
maintenance free instruction free and
shareable with family members which
means one size fits most introducing
crest it is designed to duplicate the
manual stimulation safe and natural
filling molded into this beautiful
package while stimulating the key result
area it really improves a circulation to
the head and relieves tension and stress
in product testing what's better than
giving it to my favorite massage
therapist this is how to use it wherever
whatever rest on krusty for 10 minutes
or maybe longer move side to side to get
all those spots I want to be happy and
stress-free therefore stiff neck and
shoulder should be managed right so
please invest in the feeling of relief
because we all deserve it take that
weight off your shoulder finally you'll
love it that I can promise thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
