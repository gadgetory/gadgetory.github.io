water if I have water if I we love
swimming and like most humans we love
music
seven years ago we put them together in
the waterproof ipod shuffle and things
were great for a while
but I can't remember the last time I
actually bought an mp3 and I'm over
listening to the same music from my ipod
from years ago cabinet free Soulja Boy
so I thought it's time to move on to
streaming music and listen on to man in
the pool we began to look at waterproof
Bluetooth headphones for swimming and
wondered why hasn't anybody done this
yet how are connected
that's why Bluetooth radio waves bounce
right off the water so they're
definitely not gonna help you listen to
music during your next thousand yard
swim so what's the answer
cut out the Bluetooth middleman and
connect directly to the internet so
we've done it we've taken one of the
smartest audio devices Google's
chromecast Audio and enhanced it to join
you on your swim
we made it completely waterproof and
freed it to move around by including a
battery giving you a direct internet
connection through your phone or your
gyms Wi-Fi allowing for the highest
fidelity audio even underwater and it
already works with all your favorite
audio streaming apps to bring this into
the world's me and my nine friends need
the help of swimmers like you around the
world we've been working the past three
years here in San Diego growing in our
ability to prototype and manufacture
devices for swimmers we've crafted some
great versions of the swim cast so far
but we'd like to scale up create some
new tools and engage manufacturing so we
can get these swim casts made as soon as
possible join us by backing this project
and buying a swim cast or 10
together we can bring streaming music to
pools around the world</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
