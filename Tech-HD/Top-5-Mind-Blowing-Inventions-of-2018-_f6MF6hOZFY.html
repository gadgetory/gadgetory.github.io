cheese
in sports you want to leave as little as
possible to chance you want to optimize
the way you train the way you regenerate
the way you eat the way you drink and
drinking has a massive effect on your
performance so why do we settle for
water that tastes bad contaminated by a
plastic bottle now a metal bottle or a
glass bottle might give you a better
taste but it's too heavy it's too much
of a distraction when you have to
unscrew it it slows you down you want to
keep your pace right keep your focus
also you see I'm a team player and in
every good team you share your bottle
but then it's very important you can
have contact less drinking for hygienic
reasons so you want to squeeze the
bottle to push the water out Alvarez is
amazing equipment everything's high-tech
but then we drink from the cheap plastic
bottles our water deserves better we
deserve better
many told me it's not possible but I
kept going looking for the right
technology looking for the right people

squeezable metal bottle Kegel pour in
Switzerland designed in Vienna produced

occurs a groundbreaking layering process
makes it possible to create a titanium

most of all flexible
by the way the company mastering this
process is also renowned for producing
accelerator parts for CERN now all we
need to keep going is your support to
buy the tools and the materials for our
first production run help us bring key

founder of monitor IO
I've been working with network
technologies for more than 20 years it
should be easier to know how your
internet is performing and how to solve
any problems you might have that is why
we built Monica Rio we live in connected
homes we connect our garage door openers
security cameras maybe monitors to the
Internet it is important for us to know
the health and quality of the internet
connections monitor IO is a service
that's measuring how your internet is
performing even when you're not at home
or at the office your internet
connection data is at your fingertips if
you ever need to call your internet
service provider about a problem monitor
Rio runs continuously to measure how
your internet connection behaves and
provides a more complete picture then
speed test or pain we respect your
privacy that is why we measure
performance without looking at any of
your data

into your router now if your network or
any of your devices goes offline you
will be notified you will also be
notified if any unknown device accesses
your network you'll always be sure that
your internet is working and all your
devices are online please help us bring
monitor i/o to everyone because you
should never be in the dark about your
internet
hello my name is Scott cup Freeman
founder of clinically fit the developers
of the extensor first thank you for
buying our product I want to take a few
minutes to show you exactly how this
device works and help you make the most
out of using it you're going to notice
that they're in your bag they're gonna
be a series of finger bands in three
different sizes the device fits on both
of your hands with the blue thumb bands
depending on either one of your hands
first thing you want to do is find the
bands that fit most suitable to your
fingers place them in the device and
then slowly a few times for each one
going through the motion of
prestretching your finger bands which is
going to activate the elasticity in
these bands making it a little bit
softer and a little easier to use next
you're going to notice that there's a
grid on here and this grid has three
different rows that allow you to
increase or decrease tension for each
one of your fingers individually the
first thing we're going to do is place a
device on it slips on either hand and
like a glove and just by sticking your
fingers in these bands both the blue and
the gray securing the strap to your
wrist
you'll be ready to go make sure that you
seek approval from your physician if you
have any kind of a condition before
beginning any exercise program the first
exercise we're going to do is going to
be with your arm held out straight</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
