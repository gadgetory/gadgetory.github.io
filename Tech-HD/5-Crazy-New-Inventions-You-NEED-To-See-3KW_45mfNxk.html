we're Napoli pizza oven over the last
year through many iterations we've come
up with the most effective high-quality
affordable multi-field
outdoor pizza oven available hi I'm Andi
Burt and I'm Eric Burt and this is the
Napoli the multi field outdoor pizza
oven
the Napoli pizza oven has an outstanding
build with fully insulated ceiling walls
and floor this allows the oven and the
baking stone to reach temperatures of
over 900 degrees Fahrenheit for cooking
classic Neapolitan style pizzas this
oven is multi-field which means that it
can use either wood pellets through a
special wood pellet tray or wood chunks
charcoal or a special gas attachment
which attaches to a standard propane
tank and heats up quickly in less than
15 minutes to temperatures of over 900
degrees Fahrenheit
at this extremely high temperature you
can cook an amazing Neapolitan style
pizza in literally less than 90 seconds
this pizza oven is great for social
gatherings with friends or family and
you can cook a variety of pizzas in a
matter of minutes we design the oven not

you to use a cast-iron skillet with a
handle on it and cook an amazing tuna
steak to perfection and of course a New
York Strip seared on the outside and
nice and medium-rare in the center we've
been through a very extensive testing
process this has allowed us to maximize
the functionality of the oven by
identifying any parts of the oven that
are instrumental in the heating process
or can be affected by the intense heat
of the oven
we feel confident we have perfected the
design so there won't be any design
changes delaying getting our ovens into
your backyard with over eight years of
experience working on multiple projects
with our trusted manufacturers we are
confident that we can handle every
aspect of this process from the
production of the oven that we have
designed all the way to the distribution
to all of our backers in a timely manner
the latest version of our oven is dialed
in and ready for all to enjoy we need to
build our ovens in a large enough
quantity so we can offer the most
affordable price possible whether you're
a pizza lover or a hardcore foodie we
want you to be a part of the Napoli
pizza oven community
