natural water is essential for our
health unfortunately tap water often
tastes bad and it can even be polluted
imagine to get instantly natural water
wherever you are and wherever you go
this is why we develop to drink your own
drink your home is a revolutionary water
filter made in Switzerland you can
easily attach it to every faucet enjoy
great tasting and safe water in most
cases step off the taste buds due to
rust iron and hyaline state levels
universe studies have shown that you can
find the same type of bacteria in tank
water as you can find on your toilet
seat
it was our challenge to develop one
simple device that takes care of it all
drink pure home provides you a safe and
natural tap water instantly in
collaboration with the Swiss Federal
Institute of Technology we have
developed a patented product thanks to
our own high performance membrane drink
your home is the only water filter which
removes taste chloride and also takes
care of bacteria you can filter up to
500 liters the best about drink your
home is that you don't have to buy an
entire filter again you can replace your
filter come true to yourself
it's that simple imagine how much time
and money you can save if you don't have
to buy and carry all these plastic
bottles do something good for your
environment and save some money but now
enough from our site let's hear what
people around the world say
we back Hobart Singapore I used to boil
the water to remove the bacteria from
the water and now we've drink pure home
it's a lot more convenient because I've
just a pattern on attack and there I go
I get PM pure drinking water straight
out from the temple because you are what
you do and you drink
so having heating water it's very
important I spend a lot of my time on
business trips and have a very active
lifestyle drink your home gets me the
flexibility I need and I can take it
wherever I go and it's very easy to fix
during pure home allows me to have tasty
and safe water I just don't like the
taste of the tap water in our area I'm
really happy to have trick room because
it protects my family and I don't have
to carry all this expensive plastic
bottles anymore
after years of development and our 50
prototypes which is one step away now we
need your help</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
