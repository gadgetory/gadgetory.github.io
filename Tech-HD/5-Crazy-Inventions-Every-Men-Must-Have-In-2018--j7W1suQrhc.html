you feel it I mean I think the hardest
thing to get over is the orgasm that I
had with it like I've never experienced
anything like that in my life I think
it's more of one of those things if I
were to try to get someone to use it
it's definitely one of those you have to
try it to understand what I'm saying
because like you just you can't put into
words and it's just not tangible until
you feel it yourself because it's like I
never would have thought that that's the
reaction I would have gotten from it it
was so satisfying and it felt so good it
was just insane
it was amazing if when we tried the
device we the rest of the day afterwards
we were like sexually supercharged the
you know we would fool around in the car
you know and then that night we ended up
just having great sex so I mean it's it
definitely steps up the intimacy for
sure I think what do you think yeah is
you crave the guy and
weird way you and you didn't really
think it would it is doing so much for
you but I mean you definitely the best
we've been having lately has been when
she's been using this device it's been
mid her going crazy and just can't take
it anymore
and it's been amazing it it's it really
has brought that that fiery spark back
in with our sex life that we needed at
least that g-spot one like that in my
mind like it literally it literally felt
like I was coming for like ten minutes
and I don't even know if that's how long
it was but it just it felt like I was
just I was coming forever so if I had to
choose between a regular vibrator and
the hi just laying in bed I would reach
for this one first just because it's
multifunctional because sometimes you
feel like I just I just want to come but
I'm really kind of not in the mood I
feel like this with the with the
massaging aspect like you could use it
on yourself you can kind of get yourself
calm and in the mood and then kind of go
for it with just a regular vibrator it
really serves one purpose no once you
try it is like your new best friend like
you'll give up your children for this
thing like right I it was water I mean a
hundred thousand percent for sure you
know after after the device you know and
experiencing everything that it did for
her and me being a part of that you know
watching her have that intense orgasm
and the full-body ten-minute convulsions
that she did and it kind of sparked my
sex drive a little bit more and we were
six like super ly sexually charged the
rest of the day and even after that and
it was great sex afterwards
pretty single piece of it it is fit and
put in the perfect place to hit every
single spot and I watched her shaking
way she's never shirked and then when
she used it on me it it was able to hit
me in three different spots that I have
never been able to feel a pleasure like
that before
and it just blew my mind the way it was
made there was a lot of time and effort
put into it you can clearly tell that
they knew what they were doing
