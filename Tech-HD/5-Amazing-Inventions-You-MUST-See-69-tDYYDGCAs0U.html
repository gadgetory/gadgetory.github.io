that's why you need vents pressed the
best weapon to take out stinky odors it
works like add in ventilation to your
trashcan another closed spaces freshen
up the air so you can actually relax
when it turns into this guy
it keeps the smell in this area a lot
more tolerable and it makes sure that
you can smell the sweet scent of this
little devil right here rather than this
you can install fancy fresh to your
trashcan easily within seconds just
leave it alone no maintenance it's a
high-tech ventilation system combined in
UV lighting and platinum dioxide
technology to break down autumn ala
pools and yield fresh air a light sensor
starts to deodorization when the
trashcan is closed Fanta fresh adapts to
all kinds of trash cans and you can use
any regular garbage bags
there's no consumables that keep you
spending more and with an additional
portable power bank you can use vent
fresh all around the house such as
treats in the fridge when needed under
the kitchen sink and of course your
smelly shoe cabinets so go get a fancy
fresh so easy to install and 100% hassle
free a task that I call clean job
you
while working on my PhD I realize that
sixty-second could change the world
that's because it only takes 60 second
of UV LED light to kill the germs that
have plagued humankind since the
beginning of time just 60 seconds
underdeveloped immune systems are unable
to fight off deadly germs and viruses
which is why there is le the world's
first portable medical grade sterilizer
just place your baby's bottle pacifier
or teething ring into le and in 60
seconds it's germ-free UV light
particularly UVB particular type of UV
kills all sorts of germs including
viruses bacteria and fungi by damaging
their DNA or RNA Ellie runs on a
rechargeable battery and it's very
compact so you can take it anywhere and
while it's grateful bottles and binkies
le consider eyes anything that fits into
the chamber including water for mixing
formula small toys or even breast pump
accessories just put it into the Le and
in 60 seconds it's safe to use Ellie's
true violet UV digital technology kills
germs and viruses at the core by
breaking their DNA strand including
antibiotic resistant superbugs
we clearly do need to have available
portable devices for when we're carrying
around food or other items such as baby
bottles or other types of things that
might become contaminated and
particularly with their more vulnerable
populations such as a very young child
true violet technology also has many
promising applications that address
global concerns such as air and water
sterilization especially in areas
without centralized water supply or
electricity
and sixty seconds is all it takes
thank you for your time
drift the world's first model car that
performs with the same driving dynamics

again schools were housed in fluency
Afghans can also be big the aeration for
with the internet while ordinary scaled
down model cars appear unrealistic and
are difficult to control drift emulates
the complete driving physics of a real
race car they drive spin and drift like
the real thing on the kitchen table on
the floor or in the office
drift works on every smooth surface and
does not require a special racetrack
even an office desk is enough for
exciting races drift is pure
pocket-sized Motorsports fun and can be
played at any place in the world there
are different setups to suit the skills
from hobby races to professionals if
it's honest productive to bound Timmy
Stavros India organelle from one to hear
a vehicle of the amateur and

gazelles till I give least notice escape
a medium and a complete and für physik
he in the corner of Titan smartphone one
the drift races are equipped with
intelligent senses and the app and the
vehicles can be updated
with the inputs in support of the
Kickstarter community new features can
easily be implemented an intelligent
underbody sensor for example can scan
the ground for different surface
conditions or a start/finish line for
precise lap times track limits and more
it may even become possible to race each
other virtually from any part in the
world
this fire and reproductive victim is

hi Kickstarter I'm davon I'm Jerri
O'Leary and we're Central Standard Time
we've created the world's thinnest watch
ever made the csto one so we start with
a point seven millimeter stainless
spring steel band we etch that half a
millimeter down and then layer all of
the components inside of that pocket
everything from the e-ink screen the
electronics and the micro energy cell
that powers the watch we have a full
working prototype right now with real
production parts and we've spent the
last year designing prototyping and
revising those parts and this is the
first successful assembly we've got the
CFT o1 is a truly remarkable product but
we're going to need your help in order
to manufacture it so please back us on
Kickstarter like us on Facebook and get
the word out there Thanks
you
that's Shane said
thank you for you ladies what is this
to behold before I bear witness to the
hey Kickstarter we want to introduce you
to butter up the idea started a little
while ago trying to come up with an
easier way to use real dairy butter and
have all the ideas have explored the
simple and effective design came to be
our favorite and would like to share it
with you today
the great cooks tip whenever a recipe
calls to use soft butter is to run
through a grater this got me thinking
why not build this into a knife we've
gone through countless sticks of butter
and loaves of bread testing numerous
prototypes to arrive a design that's
easy to use and easy to clean we quickly
discovered that you don't need anything
as sharp or as aggressive as a normal
grater and experimented with different
hole shapes and designs that were safe
and easy to use and easy to clean when
you're done we've also included a
lightly serrated edge to cut the crusts
we've sourced a cutlery manufacturer who
is ready to start production but the
machinery materials to make cutlery
are only economical in really large
quantities thanks so much for watching
and we love you supporting
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
