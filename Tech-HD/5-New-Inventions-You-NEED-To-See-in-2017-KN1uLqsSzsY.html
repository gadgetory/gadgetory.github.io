tea is tailored to your mood your
preference so you can experience all the
joys and benefits of Team hi kiss
daughter
I'm urban co-founder and CEO of team OSA
for 34 years my family has been
producing and growing tea on our tea
plantation in Taiwan since the beginning
our mission has remained the same
deliver the most authentic and healthy
statistics to our customers that's why
we created famosa
a tempering machine that combines the
modern science with the art of the
traditional tea making the brewing
process is very important to making the
perfect cup of tea brewing with water
temperature that's too hot can damage
the natural antioxidants in the teas
steeping tea leaves for too long can
also create a bitter flavor that's why
many people add the artificial flavors
and sweeteners tea mosa is an automatic
team master which learned your taste
preferences
we utilize a special extraction method
ultrasonic extraction which rapidly
takes flavors out of t and enhances the
antioxidants and aroma naturally you can
use the T mosa
paper capsule or you can use your own
loose tea leaves once you insert the
paper capsule T Moses scans the capsule
and sets the optimal brewing temperature
and steeping time alternatively if you
use your own loose tea leaves which
allows you to customize the brewing
process and enjoy the tea exactly how
you like it the demos a companion app
gives you the option of customizing the
brewing temperature strength and cup
size through your device remotely you
can join the team osa community to
explore the tea recipes and craft
process we join has the first and
largest powered style generator in the
world in the past but now we have been
rapidly prototyping and design we are
now ready to start and veteran we have
engineering and business skills to bring
this product to market but to do that we
need your support please back us to
bring this product to life and make a
healthy and all entity available to
everyone it's time to join the
revolution with team OSA

the language of music is fascinating and
being a musician is all about playing
expressing and sharing your passion with
the world when it comes to capturing
that moment of inspiration nothing has
really changed again since the
introduction of multitrack recording
back in the nineteen fifties luckily
things are about to change for the past
three years the Siemens Ilya I've been
working hard but developing ways
currently reversed by the industry as a
revolution in music recording it's
beautifully designed exterior is parked
with a 19 built-in microphone capsules
and his hardware is bundled with Xillia
state of the art track separation
software the Zilla is em1 less you
record multiple instruments
simultaneously and then it separates
each individual instrument from the full
mix while at the same time preserving
the natural acoustic color and the audio
quality of the individual instrument
tracks something no other product has
been capable of achieving up until this
point
for musicians this means unrestricted
creativity and introduces a whole new
live multitrack recording experience
Mazzilli is zm1 was designed from the
ground up to let you focus on the most
important part your creativity and your
music using only one microphone in
addition the sillies atom one is capable
of recording high-quality 3d sound
making an equally great fit for
capturing high order
Hasani cardio for use within virtual
reality augmented reality 360 video and
gears so what does all that mean for you
in your band
it enables you to record the whole band
at once and capture your musical ideas
with absolute freedom and flexibility it
means you can make mixes of your live
recorded songs within minutes or you can
just record for a couple of hours and
then polish up your songs later no more
worrying about technical setups there
you go guys you can start playing right
away okay
our bond is all set and done with their
recordings look the truth is creativity
flows when you are having fun and able
to perform with focus less distractions
and no boundaries and ultimately this is
what the zm1 is all about all you need
to do is position yourselves around
Xillia zm1 connect the USB cable to your
computer and launch the Xillia studio
app to calibrate the instruments you're
now ready to record simple as that
after recording Xillia studio lets you
remix the individual tracks in order to
perfectly balanced your mix the pro
version of Xillia studio lets you create
an infinite number of virtual
microphones in a 3d sound space sounds
complicated think of it like this first
you record and then you decide what type
and how many microphones you want to use
and the exact direction each of them
with this
see through helmet platform is being
created to revolutionize the future of
firefighter
see-through will simultaneously generate
real-time floor plans and optimal escape
routes see-through a revolutionary
technology designed to save lives
this is the best Mac that I've ever made
Mack Beck is a simple and elegant case
for your phone that is also a mount in
addition to providing excellent
protection it inherently mounts to any
metal surface and with it it comes
maxing an ultra-thin minimalist magnetic
stick that can be adhered to any surface
to mount your phone because the case and
Max ik arrow aligns perfectly with each
other mounting your phone feels magical
the small profile and beautiful finish
allow me max tech to blend into the
background when you bring the phone
close the magnet spool and secure the
phone in place and it's just as easy to
take off
but what we really love about it is that
is so simple and the complex layers are
invisible the case itself is made out of
thermoplastic rubber that feels great to
the touch and provides a whole new round
protection embedded there are nine and
fifty-two custom shaped magnets they are
industrial-strength so mounting to a
metal surface or mastic feel super
secure
behind each magnet we play stainless
steel shields that eliminate any
potential for interference with the
functions of bone LTE compass GPS Wi-Fi
wireless charging and any contact with
credit cards is no issue and finally a
high quality lexan label Overland seal
all this tech in place despite all these
layers our team was able to keep the
case at an incredible two millimeters
thin mac stick has some elegant metallic
finish that will look great on any
surface it has three of the same
super-strong magnets and alternating
polarities to match the case this
achieves two things out of light mint as
well as mounting in portrait or
landscape mag back is by far the best
case and mounting solution for your
phone
with the release of the new iPhone
lineup this month we are taking the
opportunity to revamp the entire Mac
back product line we are also making
sure we cover the new iPhone 7s 7s plus
and the much-anticipated
10th anniversary iPhone and due to
popular demand we will now be supporting
the Samsung Galaxy S a and s a plus we
got in touch with reliable sources that
have provided early 3d models and
schematics we use this early insight to
design and work with our vendors to
start the pre-production process here's
where you come in your pledge will have
a scale up and ensure we can deliver the
new Mac back shortly after this campaign
ends and you will secure one of the
first production units just in time for
your new iPhone thank you for all the
support</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
