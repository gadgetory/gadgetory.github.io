do it all the time and almost everywhere
I go and like you I can hear the
difference between what everybody else
thinks is good then what music should
really sound like you and I know we're
being robbed because our music is being
degraded by our laptops and phones we
know that to get the most out of the
music we love and to make it sound like
live music we need better audio hardware
that's why we created geek out v2 geek
out v2 is an audio device that you plug
into any computers or phones USB port to
give your music new life the idea for
geek out came after years of frustration
listening to music through a laptop's
headphone output it occurred to us that
it's become common for a person to spend
three or four hundred dollars on a nice
set of headphones and then they plug
those headphones into a three or four
dollar audio device that just doesn't
make any sense there are a few problems
with the headphone output of a laptop
it's not powerful enough if you sit in a
crowded place like an airport or a
coffee shop and you're trying to listen
to music or watch a movie it's never
loud or clear enough and there's never
enough bass even when you crank it to 11
and most laptops can't play high
resolution audio through their headphone
output you see computer makers spend
most of their budgets on the video
processors and the screens and they only
leave a few dollars for the audience now
that geek out has been used all over the
world for the last couple of years and
has even been featured in The Wall
Street Journal Forbes the absolute sound
audio stream and many others were happy
to announce that we've refined it even
further thanks to the input of our
15,000 users
we've obsessed over every single detail
geeked-out v2 still boasts amazing
high-resolution performance decoding PCM
all the way up to 32 384 and also
decoding VSD all the way up to DSD 128
but we've added in a few tricks first
eke out beep uses a revolutionary
digitally controlled analog gain circuit
with this feature you can choose either
a thousand milliwatts of output power
for your bit cans or a hundred
milliwatts of super-quiet output power
for your IEMs geeked-out v2 now features
a fully balanced topology this makes the
noise floor even lower creating more
space between the instruments and
vocalists and a soundstage
it's imaging is crazy revealing to take
advantage of this new topology
geeked-out v2 has both single ended and
balanced outputs geeked-out v2 s final
touch is the refinement of its chassis
we're using the latest 3d printing and
ultra high temp resin technology which
allows us to incorporate heat sinks and
ventilation chambers that reduce the
radiant heat created in geeked outs pure
Class A amplifier engineering is
complete firmware is in the final beta
test the chassis Tsar refined and being
manufactured now we're crowdfunding geek
out v2 because we want to connect with
more people like you and let them know
that getting terrific sound out of their
laptop or phone is finally Within Reach
thank you so much for your continued
support of LH labs
we try to innovate the coffee and tea
space by creating some of the most
amazing commercial coffee brewers that
is out there today and for the men she
is an American company which was founded
back in Utah in 2012 we made the
steampunk to really make the best cup of
coffee in a really beautiful way in a
commercial environment we really wanted
to distill that down to something that
you can use at home super simply and
it's much easier to clean the flask is a
full immersion brewer it's really
similar to a French press but it makes a
much cleaner cup
when we design a new product it doesn't
matter whether there's a commercial
product or whether it's a product for
home we believe in three core values of
that product it has to be beautifully
designed aesthetics is very important to
us it has to deliver a perfect cup every
single time and it has to be sustainable
in a way that we're using our materials
and we believe as well that the sign in
itself is a sustainable factor because
it both beautiful the product is the
longer you will use it we believe that
the flask is a perfect extension of
alcohol that used for bringing this to
Kickstarter because all of our current
equipment is handmade machined and hand
assembled in Salt Lake City it's
high-quality its high cost its
commercial equipment with a flat spur we
want to bring this to the home and so we
need to make it affordable which means
we need to make a lot of expensive
tooling or coming to the Kickstarter
community to help us fund this and get
it off the ground and get it into your
hands we wanted to bring that beauty of
brewing and and make a really good cup
of coffee really simple to make at home
so that's why we made the flask and it
really makes an extraordinary cup of
coffee at home super easy
