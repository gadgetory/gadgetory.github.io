years ago
I created Roomba small user friendly
robot that cleans home floors all by
itself
since room is amazing success I've been
looking for opportunities for other
practical robots I found a great one in
the garden it's called turtle as the
robot drives around the wheels scrub the
surface of the soil damaging
pre-emergent weeds Farrell doesn't need
to pull weeds because it chops them
every day even if a chopped weed sprouts
again turtle will keep chopping it down
until it runs out of store energy and
dies
there's no mapping or programming
required for turtle you put the robot in
the garden fresco and the robot takes
care of the rest
turtle uses bluetooth to talk to the
user smartphone there's an app that
accompanies turtle through the app you
can learn about conditions in your
garden and what turtles have been doing
because turtle cuts the weeds every day
the clippings are small so they fall
back onto the ground and triple up
returning the nutrients to the soil to
inform turtle that you want to keep a
small plant you put one of the provided
plant collars around the seedling this
lets turtle know that it's a desired
plant once the plant is larger you can
remove the collar if you like turtle
collects some energy even on cloudy days
and it uses this energy very carefully
thus it can keep operating through
extended cloudy periods turtle is helped
by the fact that weeds can't grow very
fast when there's no Sun turtle can
easily cover the typical garden size in
the US which is about a hundred square
feet given favorable soil conditions or
sunny climates turtle is able to cover
more area than that turtle is round it's
short it has four-wheel drive and
extreme camber wheels those are all
design choices that improve Turtles
mobility in the garden turtle requires a
barrier to keep it from wandering away
from the garden this could be the edge
of a raised bed a chicken wire fence or
some other type of border
we've been developing turtle over the
past two years constantly testing
prototyping in the iterating to make the
best product that we can we need your
help to bring turtle to production with
your support today you can be one of the
first to have turtle in your garden
because weeding sucks you should make a
robot do it
I love to drink coffee in the morning I
have to have it and I wake up but I
don't like carrying around a big travel
mug and I don't like using all these
disposable coffee cups smash Cup is the
answer it's a cup for coffee 40 for any
beverage and it collapses into a little
disc that's completely sealed so you can
put it away in your bag a backpack
pocket can take it out again a couple
years ago I was sitting with some
friends having coffee and we had this
idea a few days later they sent me these
2d drawings and from there we kind of
just went I knew that we could make this
thing we made it a point to keep the
design simple three main parts are made
from food grade materials you can easily
take them apart and wash them in the
dishwasher or by hand and when they're
put back together they create a liquid
tight seal
so many people have asked me how does
this product not exist already well it
should exist and with your help to fund
our first production run it will exist
we think you're really gonna like this
product save some space help the planet
have more fun with your cup thank you
for your help
hi folks Aaron Boyd here wanted to do a
quick video show in how the life card
operates there's a latch here on the
upper part in the frame this is the
barrel latch slide that back you can
tilt the barrel up I'm going to just put
a snap cap in there slide the latch back
close the barrel and it will lock closed
there's a similar latch on the bottom on
the handle just slide that forward and
split the two halves go all the way till
it locks open from there it's gonna
operate like a normal gun do you just
 the bolt pull the trigger reset the
bolt to the half cocked flush with the
rear of the frame that's the position
that you're going to use to fold it
closed there you go

hi I'm dr. Andrew bank and if you use a
cell phone please listen to me for the
next few minutes more and more people
are coming to my office with what I call
Technic Technic is when your head is too
far forward from its normal position
over time that leads to damage in the
ligaments and muscles of your neck let
me give you an example my head weighs
about 10 pounds when I'm in good posture
when I move my head forward to look down
at an object that pressure can increase
up to 60 pounds this is how Technic is
created can you believe it 60 pounds of
pressure just when you're looking down
at your smartphone tablet or computer
this weight overtime damages the muscles
and ligaments in your neck
and unfortunately that damage is
irreversible so what I use to help treat
my patients with Technic is a cervical
role I teach my patients how to place
the cervical foam roll in their pillow
and sleep on it every night this
overtime helps to restore your natural
cervical curve the bad thing about these
cervical rolls though is that no two
pills are alike and no two patients are
alike so often times they don't even
work right that is until now I have to
introduce to you the Comfort adjust
pillow this pillow has been economically
designed for both the back and the side
sleeper to get the best restorative
posture you can possibly be in I love
this pillow because not only does it
keep the cervical role in perfect
position all my I sleep it allows you to
dial in the best comfort for you because
the two different types of foam
densities let's face it technology has
changed our lives it's time to change
your pillow
