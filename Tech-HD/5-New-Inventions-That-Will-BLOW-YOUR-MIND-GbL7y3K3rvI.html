hi we're here to talk to you about
coffee health you know that magical dark
bean juice that keeps us going every day
Coffee is a helping hand guiding us
through all of life's ups and downs
early mornings late nights hinder dates
visits tall people coffee is your very
own guardian angel in a cup or a jars
that's what you're into coffee is great
and there are so many different ways to
make it and we would like to introduce
yet another one this egg is steep
chopped and it's super simple let me
show you how to use it with a little
help from my friend Tim Tim likes coffee
Tim really likes coffee this is how much
Tim likes coffee Tim is here to show you
the beauty of oh wait he's done already
hi Tim could you do that again thank you
sure
under nice and slow this time please
first of all you need freshly ground
coffee
and then I think water put the lid on
turn the brew around and let the coffee
steep how long well that depends of how
far you wanna go before you open the
valve to enjoy a freshly brewed shot see
how simple that is but Tim you're not
going to drink all that coffee by
yourself are you sharing is caring them
and look the inventor of steep shot just
happens to be sitting right next to you
so Ari what was your inspiration for
this burying device my wife wouldn't
make us of coffee now she does so simple
so sleek so gorgeous this deep shot I
mean now let me tell you about how this
thing works the process of making coffee
boils down to separating the magical
bean juice from the bean bits the
steaming water makes the air expand
underneath delete doesn't give it
anywhere to go
so pressure happens this allows the
coffee to do faster when you turn steep
shot on its head and open the valve and
the pressure is released and coffee
shoots out like a sigh of relief
simple sleek and gorgeous it doesn't
have lots of pipes just a cup and the
lip it's pretty much zero waste it's
super portable and most importantly it
makes a really good cup coffee and there
you have it yet another coffee geeks
