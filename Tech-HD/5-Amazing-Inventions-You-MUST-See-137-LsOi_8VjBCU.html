quality while you listen to the music
there is a noise cancelling function for
the best experience in case of a phone
call
simply touch on the right side earbud to
receive it double touch to connect with
Siri Alexa or Google
you
if you say hello people's turn on folks
active noise cancellation and acoustic
noise attenuation to create silence
if you say he'll hit us turn it on the
sleeping mode you will turn to the
sleeping mode which activates the
parasympathetic nervous system which
brings us down to a calmer place where
we can relax and fall asleep
hello Hypno's
you
you
you
hey Kickstarter last year we brought you
the
destructible kevlar belt this year our
belt is not only indestructible but has
two more super features for unparalleled
comfort and tailor-made sizes we call it
the smart belt take a look
you
our patented kevlar cord makes the whole
belt indestructible coupled with
beautiful italian top grain leather this
belt will not tear stretch or fail you
in any way
you
it's five times stronger than anything
we have tested as well as light and more
flexible
a major switch for this year is the
elimination of the classic holes on the
belt
our new ratchet and track system works
like a zip-tie it has micro steps that
really lets you adjust to the exact fit
you need in each moment of the day and
each activity
you will be blown away by how
comfortable our belt is let's be honest
holes are not really practical for
adjustment when you want to loosen your
belt and you go one hole up it's too
loose go one hold down and it's too
tight not comfortable at all going from
five holes one inch apart to 32 steps
1/5 of an inch apart is a huge leap it's
a whole new level and a completely
different feel
our ambition is to make a product that
is the utmost quality and beauty no
detail has been overlooked
we have also done away with belt sizes
because they're not really precise
especially if you're named between no
need to worry about ordering the wrong
size or giving it as a present you'll
get the maximum size and you will cut it
and attach it to the buckle for a
perfect do-it-yourself tailored size and
two colors and multiple buckle finishes
this bolt is covered in top grain
italian leather for universal elegance
we are kickstarter veterans with an
experienced production and fulfillment
team our campaigns all start shipping on
time and we'll have our first belts out
in no more than a month shipped with
tracking we're proud to have put
together the most advanced belt ever
made our very own smart belt back our
project so we can make it a reality

anywhere
with my family I found that it was
really hard to share photos and videos
with everyone involved someone has an
iPhone someone doesn't someone is on
Facebook someone isn't so it's really
hard to find a common place where all
our families could share photos and
videos with the ally or you're just one
tap away from seeing them on the biggest
screen of your home which is your TV how
it means home or house in Hawaiian so
it's a connected device for the home to
help family members share their lives
together you can see memories
immediately as they come or you can
easily scroll through thousands of
photos whether they're from yesterday
last week last month or last year we've
been working on the halyard for over a
year
iterating on both the hardware and
software the user interface is built
from the ground up specifically for the
orb it is designed to handle hundreds or
even thousands of images easily
we've been meticulously tuning not only
the way the orb looks but the way it
feels in your hand
well the initial design started as just
kind of an orb split in half but I felt
that it was still lacking some bit of
personality and so one of my favorite
parts about the design that we
eventually arrived at was having this
tilt to it where instead of being just
sort of ambiguously relating to the
environment all around it it really kind
of presented itself to you and invited
interaction with it as a designer my
goal with any project would be to change
the experience of the actual users we
wanted to help family members connect
with each other and that's why we
created the halyard
you
we believe in photography the phone that
we all have in our pocket is not just a
phone it's a camera it's a production
tool the tool that allows you to capture
edit create and share your story with
the world at b-squared are dedicated to
creating powerful take your photography
to the next level
hi Kickstarter's about four years ago we
started this a great idea of creating
the universal tool to transform any
smartphone into professional camera
ready with the support of the
Kickstarter community and two successful
campaigns we brought to the world number
of innovative products and we're proud
to say that our products have been used
in some of the most creative and
groundbreaking videos that's ever been
shot on the phone and now we are back is
exciting new gear that we believe is the
next step in the evolution of smart and
filmic introduce you've all knew this
group that circle the Zephyr mk2 and
throw serious and immortal
using lenses or depth of food adaptors
with your smartphone give you an
entirely new look by changing the focal
length perspective and overall emotion
of your shot so you can focus the
viewers attention on what's most
important our Pro Series anamorphic lens
gives you a widescreen aspect ratio and
more dramatic perspectives without the
need to crop your footage so you can get
a cinematic widescreen look at the
highest possible resolution and creative
lens flares like you're used to seeing
in Hollywood style films it's an amazing
lens that really adds a lot of character
to your videos the most exciting
features come with the DOF adapter mk2
with this adapter you can add SLR or
DSLR lenses to your smartphone to open
up a whole new world of possibilities to
express your creativity via mobile
filmmakers it adds a beautiful shallow
depth of field okay and allows you to
manually pull focus so you can capture
unique photos and videos with an
artistic film style look it's impossible
to do with your phone on its own we also
created a rail support for attaching
additional accessories like a follow
focus so you can have a complete
filmmaking system the same features
found on professional cameras by
combining the latest smartphone camera
technologies with the depth of field
adapter and SLR lens you get a
completely new and unique content
creation experience that's truly amazing
since we release our original
depth-of-field adapter we've been
listening to feedback from our customers
leading us to set two main design goals
for the new mk2 version we had to make
it more reliable product with a
user-friendly experience and improve the
image quality with new optics we
practically eliminated distortion and
vignetting also dramatically reduce
chromatic aberration so a much wider
variety of full-frame SLR lenses can be
used for even more creative
possibilities we also enclosed the
sensitive focusing screen so it's fully
protected for a maintance for user
experience for a fast and easy setup we
incorporated a new patent-pending
mechanism that not only allows the user
to quickly align the focusing screen but
also set the bayonet mount in the
correct orientation so the SLR lens is
aligned properly lastly all the
components of the adapter are made with
the same custom machined aluminum with
an anodized finish that we use on our
Pro Series lenses as a result we have
products that work and feel amazing and
have a beautiful finish
you
the design and prototyping stages are
completed and we are ready to move
forward with manufacture please support
this campaign together we can bring
these products to reality thank you
