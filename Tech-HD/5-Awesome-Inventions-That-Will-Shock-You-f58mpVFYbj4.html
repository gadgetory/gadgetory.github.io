LED shoe lights see more do more
have you seen our parents brush our
teeth can you imagine doing the same
with them it's a dreadful experience for
both us and for them humane max I'm
sorry now I'll focus only on dogs
this is a doll did you note that 84% of
us already have oral health issues by
the age of three it's like the number
one problem for us dogs that bites I
have two toys but they don't clean my
teeth and what's with these treats I
mean they taste good but do you really
expect food to clean food just beef
jerky brush your teeth because the
amount of bad breath I can't talk to
friends freely so I locked myself at
home for days man is dog's best friend
and I'm sure they'll find our way
introducing bristly the revolutionary
brushing stick for dogs
it has paw pads cleverly designed for
easy holding with the toothpaste
reservoir and bristle line grooves
bristly perfectly matches a dog's
behavior and Anatomy
hey I'm Petros the inventor of bristly
when I lost my childhood dog Mickey due
to oral disease it was devastating but
that inspired me to come up with a
solution to this crucial problem as
brushing remains the gold standard to
oral disease prevention i developed
bristly as a brushing stick to allow all
dogs to take care of their own oral
health the bristles help to clean teeth
down to the gum line preventing plaque
and tartar buildup in the last six
months over fifty thousand pet parents
have tried her first version and they
loved it their feedback has helped us
come up with a version that's best
suited to dogs needs please pack our
campaign and help us empower all dogs to
brush soon Monica will have more
Instagram followers than Kim and LeBron
Harry spends more time on his hobbies
now everybody wants to hang out with
Pina and Max he became a real heartthrob
back our campaign to keep your dog
healthy
you
let me ask you something how many times
have you put down a cold can of soda or
a nice coffee then forgot about it the
drink you come back to is now lukewarm
what are you going to do
miserably drink it throw it out it blew
my mind that the only way to keep a
drink cold was to use a refrigerator
it's a dumb problem a lazy one at that
but I know I'm not preaching to an empty
choir I think I've got something that
can fix their problem and I'm calling it
the drink induction chiller no longer
will we have to deal with melted ice and
lukewarm soda let me introduce you to my
one-of-a-kind patent-pending invention I
wanted to build something that was
incredibly simple but something
extraordinarily good at its task it
needed to fit on a desk and look modern
on a nightstand it doesn't stand out it
doesn't connect to your phone or collect
your data
it makes your drink cold and it keeps it
gold will it change your life probably
not but is it worth the small investment
to have a refreshing cold glass of water
in your nightstand every morning and to
not have to dump out ice drinks I think
so glass cup can of soda or nice coffee
no matter what you drink this can keep
it cold
we custom-designed all our prototypes
from the ground up to get to unit that I
felt comfortable leaving in my bedroom
we decide to use thermoelectric cooling
a proven technology that requires
minimum moving parts while producing a
high output freezer today we have a
final product and and begun the tooling
and manufacturing process by supporting
this campaign you aren't buying an
unfinished prototype hoping it'll become
reality in a few years time this is a
real product that will be manufactured
by top-notch suppliers that we can get a
deliver to you as soon as possible
if you believe in simplicity want a
product that can do exactly what it's
designed to do and enjoy a cold drink
then I hope you'll consider supporting
the drink induction chiller</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
