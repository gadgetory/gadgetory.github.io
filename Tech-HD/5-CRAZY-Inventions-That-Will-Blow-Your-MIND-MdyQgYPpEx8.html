northern Wisconsin so I like to sleep
cool my husband Carl's the devil so he
likes to sleep ha the devil still we
fight a lot cuz I get too hot and Carl
gets too cold so either we fight over
the thermostat or I have to cast them
out to the couch even if you're not
married to the spawn of Satan over half
of couples disagree on bedroom sleep
temperature I've tried everything
bedroom fans just dry out my eyes about
pulling me under the covers and most
mattresses get me hot and sweaty
some companies paint and blue and call
it cooling technology but those guys are
just Carl's marketing friends from hell
classic we spend a third of our lives in
bed why can't it be comfortable
introducing bed jet the world's first
rapid cooling and heating system just
for your bed with bed Jets patented air
driven technology you can slow it down
or warm up on either side of the bed

preferences bed jet works instantly and
you can control it from your phone
tablet or remote control it's the kind
of spooky witchcraft Carl goes crazy for
it look it's a lifesaver before we got
our bed jet we were this close to
splitting up what-o from our old bed oh
because we'd be divorced only bad jet
solves the real problem humidity just
like humidity makes weather feel hotter
humidity makes your bed feel hotter and
beds
trap body humidity like a middle school
locker room making you feel hotter
unlike a middle school locker room
luckily the bed Jets quiet cooling
systems
he lates fresh air between the sheets
instantly wicking away sweat just look
at bed jet versus a cooling technology
mattress with bed jet you can go from
hot and steamy it's cool and fresh in 30
seconds or if you get to hold the bed
jet circulates warm air everywhere
making your sheets feel toasty like they
just came out of the dryer back bed jet
keeps your bed ten times faster than an
electric blanket died and gone to hell
bad jet is the best solution for cold
feet I still go on a baby
not like that Carl not ready to be a dad
and when the bed jet quietly streams air
into the patented bed jet cloud sheet
you'll feel like you're literally
sleeping in a cloud okay maybe not
literally so if you care about sleep

cooling technology mattresses are like
children they cost thousands of dollars
and hardly work the bed jet costs a

cooling mattress bed jet is the first
device ever that's clinically proven to
relieve bedtime symptoms of menopause
