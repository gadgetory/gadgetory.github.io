hi I'm EDD Shemp and I just sharpen this
knife with the knife robot
and
when
it's nice that it's very similar in to
the methods that i use using belts to
sharpen blade
it is CNC machine so the repeatability
is wonderful
it's a great tool
you
weird email
made the best shove 11 other shovels
cracks bend and break dimos beats them
all literally last year we launched our
kicker tool the cell shovel on
Kickstarter people loved it but they all
agreed on one thing they wanted
something bigger fatter and made for
everyone so we listened and gathered our
team to make the bestest toughen damn
this shovel ever and we did introducing
the Alpha shovel mother nature new daddy
you wanted big oh it's big over 20
inches long and 12 inches feet of
glorious aircraft grade aluminum means
you can shovel away the Ice Age for your
driveway it's got serrated teeth to cut
eyes and shovel gliders to protect your
deck with me so when we say it's cutting
edge if we mean it the Alpha shovel is
durable and tough rain or shine dirt or
snow we built it to whether through a
lifetime of storms into storms or any
weather our collapsible shaft makes it
easy to pack and the built-in strap
holder makes it easy to carry and we
added a saw for good luck easier to cut
anything that might get in the way
choose between a d handle for better
grip or a t-handle for better
compatibility best of all everything in
the Alpha shovel is interchangeable with
the rest of the demo's family allowing
you to build a collection of
multi-purpose tool for life every job
every day for everyone alpha shovel of
conditions be damned
the most is a collective of lifelong
innovators and adventure we like to go
out and rent face with nature and come
back to make the best product ever we're
born and raised in Jackson Hole but our
family goes far beyond town and state
boozers this is a collaborative effort
not just between the teams the wit pro
athletes action enthusiasts and most
importantly our community back our
campaign today and join the demo's
collective we thank you for all of your
support truly the most defined not by us
but bite you our backers let's keep
crushing
you
Oh
hi I'm Lisa smile CEO and co-founder of
scholar I don't know about you but we
love our pets and so we wanted to create
a product that would make it it's easy
to care for your pets as it is to love
them so we created scholar as an open
modular platform so it can be whatever
you need it to be for every age in every
stage of your pets life and can have
functionality that will work for pet
door and the cut feeder and the
invisible fence and the training modules
and the anti bark in the health
monitoring who needs all those separate
collars we believe that you can have one
caller it serves every function and
that's why we created scholars and
because we created it on an open
platform we can partner with people and
create a community of developers help us
grow the functionality to be what use
the pet parent Munich's p for those of
you that have big dogs and medium dogs
you're going to have to wait a little
bit while we finish the development of
the skull and mini if you want us to
keep you posted about the meeting a
large dog collar click on the link below
and we'll be sure to send you updates
for now if you have a small dog or cat
be sure to pre-order today and let's
reinvent the pet industry together thank
you so much for your support
