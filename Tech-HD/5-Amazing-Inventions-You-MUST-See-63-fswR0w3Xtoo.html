yet there are still a few things holding
us back poor beings external hard drives
countless adapters and of course the
chunky charges that's what living in a
modern life was until now
this is line duck the world's first
device offering a powerful battery full
connectivity fast SSD storage and active
cooling all this in a nine millimeter
cable free shell the massive internal
battery offers up to 1.5 full charge of
any USBC laptop simply connect line dock
using a USBC cable and free yourself
from power outlets and chargers lined up
slides perfectly in your backpack for
laptops leave
thanks to quick charge technology lined
up lets you charge any mobile device
faster so that you never run out of
battery on the go once connected via a

patented PI forest cooling system will
actively cool your laptop for increased
performance and comfort when you need it
the most
instead of carrying a myriad of adapters
on daily basis lined up provides
everything you need right under your
laptop it's smart format allows for zero
square inches loss on your workspace
with in developing lined up for over a
year using the most advanced
technologies and materials we teamed up
with the best engineers to come up with
a symbiotic and reliable device
technology should make life easier we
took a step further with a special
attention to design and portability a
single device for seamless digital
experience
lined up organizes your day while you
organize your thoughts
starting a business nowadays is easy
everyone has great ideas but sometimes
it takes a lot of repetitive work to
realize them this is where do bot m1
gets in do bot m1 is an industrial level
robotic arm production platform it's
precise fast and extendable and also
affordable it can be your 3d printer
laser engraver soldering machine or
whatever else you build upon it yes you
can build one do bottom one has 0.02
millimeters repeatability and 1.5
kilogram payload with these standardized
easy to change heads you can easily turn
this power into productivity like 3d
printing it can print your product with
fluency and details to colors no problem
or use laser to engrave your unfading
masterpiece or do sophisticated
soldering customizing your PCB circuit
board better than a pro besides being
multifunctional do bottom one is also
easy to master and develop doo-bot m1
supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connection
you can connect to multiple arms at once
and control them via our app on PC or
smartphone with a force sensitive 3d
mouse you can control do bot m1 as
precisely as you want no more trying and
guessing on a confusing software with
its hand whole teaching feature
you can input coordinates in the fastest
and most intuitive way
do bottom one is programmable via the
integrated api's you can use official or
self built developing environment or use
this visualized programming interface
making things a lot easier but we don't
stop here do bot m1 is highly extendable
there are no limits to your imagination
on it the maximum reach of do bottom one
is 400 millimeters which is enough for
most of the situations but why don't we
think bigger
when it can actually go further or use a
camera for visual with it's fast and
accurate image recognizing algorithm it
can distinguish colors without making
one mistake do bottom one loves
companions they can work seamlessly
together processing paperwork way faster
than humans could ultimately do bottom
one is built to replace manpower in
production line working day and night
non-stop the built-in mapping and path
planning system provides this excellent
mobility providing inventory management
service in your warehouse to be able to
create so much value to bottom one has
been built with extraordinary
performance the perfect calibration of
the high performance DC servomotor
harmonic reducer and kinematic algorithm
has brought out the best of both
strength and speed repeatability of 0.02
millimeters
maximum payload of up to 1.5 kilograms
angular speed of up to 200 degrees per
second it's also a steady player never
slips up
everyone loves creating things and
having a robotic arm is awesome with do
bottom one it's no longer a giant
business's privilege to use professional
robotic arms everyone can now benefit
from a cost-effective user-friendly
robotic arm technology so when a new
idea hits you do bot m1 will be ready
all you have to do is say yes
how much freedom can you fit in a bag
the freedom of knowledge the freedom
share
freedom to dream freedom of movement now
it fits with linky
mobility is freedom with linky strong
patented folding mechanism it's freedom

skateboard the team behind linky wants
to improve the way we experience cities
wherever we were in the world we found
ourselves wanting a mode of
transportation that is eco sustainable
easy to carry around and a really fun to
ride we've applied our technical
engineering and sales backgrounds to
fill a gap in the market nothing out
there is truly portable so that's why we
need linkie to fit in a bag
we are ready to go into production but
we need a minimum number of orders to
make this possible your support right
now will have keep costs down so we can
guarantee a great level of service and a
tune exciting electric longboard
you
I would like to introduce myself I am
the tma-2 and the ward winning modular
headphone system
currently consisting of nine different
cables for headbands
seven year pots
and for speaker units
all parts easily assembled and combined
offering a current total of 1008
different configurations
so you can find headphone that caters to
your individual needs and is adaptable
to change and future upgrades let me
present the next evolutionary step a
wireless solution
a smart headband with state-of-the-art
Lou tooth integration
the built-in microphone
easy button control
durable nylon construction USBC port and
16 hours playback time
by using the headband as the technical
focal point the system retains full
modularity giving new users the freedom
to choose and allowing existing
customers to upgrade to wireless while
keeping their sound preferences I hope
you'll support us in getting this
project off the ground and on to your
ears
you
we live in a world where one value is
prized above all others
freedom
freedom to speak freedom to move freedom
to live that's what allows us to chart
our own course to be who we are and to
determine our own way when you think
about the internet why should it be any
different
shouldn't technology make us more free
in today's digital world you might think
that your cloud service gives you
freedom but the big print giveth and the
small print taketh away whether you know
it or not our search for convenience has
led us to give up certain freedoms
freedoms like ownership privacy
permission when it comes to cloud
services we've essentially uploaded all
of our belongings to someone else's
computer so that person or business
could then turn around and rent those
things back to us all for a monthly fee
our own stuff stuff that we paid for why
are we ok with that
maybe or not that's weird a plea comes
in we want to help you take back what's
being lost
her moments her memories the music that
shaped our lives we want to help take
back the pallets use how when and where
our digital lives unfold it's why we've
created cloud by dadly it's the first
personal home cloud that gives you back
the keys
no more renting no more contracts no
more using your data to size them
because we believe convenience shouldn't
come such a compost are you ready to
take back your digital life join us
become the master of your
the Deaf Wacom
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
