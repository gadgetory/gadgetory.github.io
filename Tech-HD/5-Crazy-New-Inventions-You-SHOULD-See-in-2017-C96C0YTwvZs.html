suffered from cold feet whether in their
daily life in winter while practicing
their favorite activity like skiing

I've
the really neutral sounding and
effortless systems that don't retry too
hard to sound impressive and I think
this definitely classifies as that but
now all the instruments and voices
really come to shine I would imagine
that that that there are kind of big
speaker standing here looks nice sounds
great I mean looking forward to see it
available in the market it was so much
clearer I couldn't hear a lot of sounds
going in the background which I have as
a third before the idea of green started
when flora and I met while working at
the audio company Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen and we
we saw great products offered by the
industry back then but we often wondered
why do these systems have to be so
complicated Kim is the first truly
flexible Sun system it's so simple it's
just one Sun system that can do
everything
Kien lets you listen to your favorite
music with premium stereo quality or
watch a movie in true Dolby Surround
with five satellites and one subwoofer
and my favorite thing is there is no
setup required the system knows how many
speakers are in the room and where they
are this will provide you with the best
audio experience with absolutely no
effort
what makes it even cooler is that the
music can follow you automatically from
room to room with our follow me
technology the best part of it is keen
satellites are possible you can just
grab any of the speakers from your house
and enjoy music on the go we're also one
of the first to introduce wireless
charging to an audio product speakers
are easily paired with NFC technology
simply tap your device onto the speaker
to pair with it or tap several speakers
together to create one massive speaker
we made it even more convenient by
bringing the controls back to the
speaker control your music simply by
swiping or tapping the dial on the
satellite speaking
in the end this is a speaker system so
what is most important to me is some
quality we are using high-end custom
drivers and with our experience in
acoustics we created one of the best
sound experience in the audio industry
on top of that thanks to the unique
shape of kin we are providing you with
premium sound at a very handy size
