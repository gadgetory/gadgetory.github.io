smallest bicycle ray do you have a
stylish superlight bike you ever thought
that a bicycle rack or basket doesn't
fit the style of your bike and carry gum
is the perfect solution for you with
arugam both hands stay on the handlebar
and transportation becomes safe and
convenient carry gum is really flexible
and you can fix a lot of different
things we've tried and tested loads to
find a lightweight solution that works
with almost any bar and looks great at
the same time carry gum consists of a
super light area a hook and loop tape
with a rubberized contact area and the
durable elastic strap carry gum fits
almost every kind of handlebar we've got
loads of beautiful colors to fit the
style of your bike
perfect
now we need your support to produce the
prototype in series with your support
the fantastic idea of the world's
smallest bicycle rack will become
reality
thank you
like to find inspiration for my designs
in everyday objects and old books have
always intrigued me when flicking
through some at my grandparents house
the aesthetic quality and character of
the books dog-eared corner really struck
me I decided that I wanted to translate
this shape into a solid object I
consequently designed dog-eared an a5
aluminium shelf and hook combination
which is practical and useful in many
environments I have created prototypes
for many materials and found that
aluminium worked the best
due to its lightweight and durable
qualities the small detail of the upturn
corner gives the shop character and
makes it a fun storage solution which
can work in many interior environments
dog it works perfectly for coats jackets
bags and umbrellas in a hallway and the
hooked corner also helps larger bags
stay in place
they can be used individually or in
groups and a powder coated in a variety
of colours hi my name is Adam errington
and I've just graduated from the cap
school of art architecture and design

to produce a product commercially and so

help me produce this simple product
