project cubit calculates the dimensions
of the real world with its dual laser to
measure long distances or its built-in
smart wheel to calculate short distances
and a regular object qubit then brings
those measurements into the
corresponding app along with photos you
have taken of the spaces and objects you
are looking to use to create your vision
this allows you to virtually design your
project with real-world scale and
context it gives you the freedom to
experiment and try many variations
before building you are also able to
share your design with other users as

network of content creators cubit will
guide you to your digitally created
measurements in the real world with
directional arrows with a bull's-eye
qubit indicates where your coins exist
bringing your digitally created vision
to life in the real world qubit allows
you to go from the real world to digital
and back to the real world without you
needing to do any math and removing the
risk of error excess construction or
wasting time
