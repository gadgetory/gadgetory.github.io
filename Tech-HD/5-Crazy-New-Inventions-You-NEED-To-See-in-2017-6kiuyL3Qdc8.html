to their environment by creating tools
to help perform their tasks as time
progresses the need for different types
of tools our eyes with the technology
available to design and create new tools
constantly evolving where's that gear
and over the past few years we've
shipped over 10,000 products to our
Kickstarter backers in 2015 we
successfully funded the original bits
blade with over 700 backers introducing
the bits plate 2.0 an evolved multi-tool
designed with your everyday needs in
mind the bits plate 2.0 has 26 functions
such as nine double-sided s2 steel bits
or 40 C stainless steel knife blade a
box cutter and a scraper a bottle opener
a pry bar a hex wrench
a carbide tip window punch and an LED
light machine from an aircraft grade
aluminum the bits blade 2.0 is super
strong yet weighs less than three ounces
designed to the middle compartment to
store one of the three interchangeable
tools one of the nine double-sided bits
can also remain within the tool
staying secured by an internal magnet
the bits blade 2.0 join the evolution
you
hey Hans what are you building the
technical video let's tackle it's my
invention so ultimately all in one mail
for your phone or camera six
you
you
Idols consists of two pieces of
experimental equipment one for sight and
one for hearing we found that while we
experience the world as many overlapping
signals we can use technology to first
isolate and then amplify the one we want
our first device surplices approach to
the way we see motion achieving a
similar effect to long exposure
photography but for live experience by
detecting an overlaying movement it
allows us to see hidden traces and
patterns in real time it features a
camera and head mounted display and
works by sending captured video to a
computer where it is processed by custom
software and then displayed for the
viewer
our second device lets us hear speech
more selectively
distracting background noise is
neutralized while the speech you want to
focus on is sent directly to your inner
ear so can you hear me now yes good I
can hear you it uses directional
microphones to capture audio input that
passes through the software before being
outputted through speakers and
transducers unlike standard headphones
that have two channels left and right
our device has three the two earpieces
plus a central mouthpiece for speech in
sport post match analysis is often used
as a tool to enhance players performance
by using idols vision we could analyze
motion life letting the player or coach
visualize performance as it happens this
could also enhance the action for
spectators with the evolution of our
software idols can be applied to fashion
or ballet bringing a whole new feature
to arts and life performance
not only a sight in hearing our most
important senses they are also our least
stable declining earlier in life and
touch taste or smell we see applications
of idols in strengthening signals
weakened by aging and disability being
able to hear more selectively which have
benefits for children and ADHD by
helping them to concentrate in busy or
distracting environments
