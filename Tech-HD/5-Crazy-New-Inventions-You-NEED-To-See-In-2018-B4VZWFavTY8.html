the world's first portable
professional-grade laser cutter that
comes packed with powerful capabilities
advanced safety features at an
affordable price
traditional laser cutters require
trained personnel safety equipment and
supporting tools they generate smoke and
odor which require extensive filtration
systems and are unsuitable for home use
enter the craft laser poised to
revolutionize laser cutting simply
design on your computer and just load up
the Machine sit back and let the
powerful Class 140 watt laser do the
work cutting is odorless because of
medical grade HEPA filters and
proprietary air scrubbing systems
next comes mobility craft lasers
extruded aluminum casing is strong and
lightweight weighing only 23 kilograms
craft laser can be easily moved and
stowed away just like your travel bag as
I'm looking at the maker movement we run
workshops but in out of the lab as many
of our participants are first-time users
of the laser cutter we need to make sure
the safety is a top priority
we need machines that are robust
portable and again put at the back of
taxi
crafts lasers a dream come true it's a
perfect investment my business I don't
worry about additional safety equipment
or locking along a large air compressor
or what the chilla I just need to bring
it to my venue put it on the table
plug it in and ready to go the
inspiration behind my project was to
create sustainable fashion using only
renewable materials I wanted my work to
incorporate wood and fabric craft laser
gave me the opportunity to experiment so
I could do things over and over again
until it was exactly what I wanted it to
be I loved spending time with my
granddaughter's doing creative projects
together that keeps me alive engaged and
connected with the family trough laser
is so safe and easy to use even my
grandchildren knows how to use it
together we make things that everyone
left
craft laser cuts in engraves a wide
variety of materials giving you the
freedom to create and build projects big
and small the life of Scott laser was
developed through the community for the
community to help bring safe and
affordable manufacturing power to people
around the way
hi I'm Jonas Eliza fangirling over right
now we are preparing to know Chuck
Kickstarter which is going to be next
week this is Friday today with a lot of
stuff to do but the team is turning away
nicely and I do it great great great
work
we are very very very excited to get the
product and the project out to the world
it's gonna be an amazing experience
and everything is busy or we think about
writing about day not do to get there in
pieces in place and we look forward to
see you there
so this is gonna be fantastic
only me go please stay with me tonight
this is I need this for the album
I'm about to perform with Kanye West at
the American Music Awards it was my
first time on national television I
found out I'm gonna have to lip-sync
because I'm playing talkbox and talkbox
is too cumbersome right then and there I
knew I had to change the talkbox make it
mobile and bring talk boxes to the front
of the stage you can control it with
either your mobile phone connected to an
electric guitar or a synthesizer the
sound comes out of the electro spit you
put the device on your throw
you don't talk and you mouthed the word
so with the traditional talk box you
have a synthesizer that you connect to
an amp that you connect to a speaker
that goes through a tube that goes into
your mouth which makes it hard to talk
now with the electro speed mobile talk
box we've combined all of those pieces
into one unit no setup you put it on and
instantly your funky
[Laughter]
electro spit was birthed from the
culture of exploration and the mixture
between music technology and fashion we
really wanted to make sure that the user
was able to have a freedom of expression
and not be impeded by the instrument in
any way but you can't do the modulation
with this right oh yeah well me let me
show you something okay this rear is
ready for even instrument like the top
now you can feel free to take out the
electoral spit at any given time and jam
whether it's on a street corner
whether it's at church whether it's in
your bedroom and feel like you have the
power in your hands to create something
magic we want to put producers
keyboardist guitarist and you in the
spotlight and we need your help to
unlock the creativity and imagination in
your music
we plays by
in 2015 we took a risk on a
non-traditional time display the
original holograph automatic was the
most funded mechanical watch campaign on
Kickstarter proving that people want
something different
never content we've spent the last two
years improving and refining the
original while remaining true to Zarek's
core mission of creating unusual
timepieces we're proud to reveal the
Haila graph to automatic
the Hitler Graf two features Eric's
innovative Cygnus to display in halo
hands which float of the arch to
encircle the time the inner hand
highlights the hours the outer hand
highlights the minutes every component
on the heaven graph to automatic was
redesigned and upgraded it's powered by
the Miata
eight to s7 automatic movement with an
increased 42-hour power reserve the dial
now features larger arcs and bigger
numbers for improved legibility and
several colors have Swiss super lumen
OVA for reading the time at night two
elements new to the halo graph are a
day/night indicator and a sweeping
seconds display built directly into the
movement grille the dial is covered by
an ultra scratch resistant sapphire
crystal to protect against daily wear
and tear we placed an anodized aluminum
ring between the stainless steel case
and bezel for a pop of color
the halo graph two straps are made from
premium American leather sourced from
the acclaimed tannery court wound
they feature built-in quick-release
spring bars for easy strap changes all
the design elements of the Hillary up
two automatic work together to create a
mechanical watch that stands out from
the crowd back this project and join us
on our mission to create the most
interesting watch in the room
