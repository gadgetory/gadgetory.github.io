give it a spin and it spins then time
passes minutes become more minutes
someone comes in to ask a question he
notices that it's already been two
minutes and this top on your table
hasn't stopped spinning you tell him
that's limbo then it's actually been 15
he calls a friend over they wait more
people gather you show them a trick you
can do
you showed in the field
someone points to the design you tell
them it's made from high-grade metals
you show them the video how it was made
the delivery guy says that it looks like
that top from that movie
everyone agrees
a few people finally ask how it works
maybe you tell them maybe you don't
maybe a friend who already knows tells
them that there's a battery-operated
gyro inside and that the entire thing is
rechargeable a girl who knows her text
says wow that's pretty impressive few of
them not everyone continues to stare you
go out to a meeting you come back you
type that spreadsheet you were working
on all afternoon people come in and out
limbo
keeps spinning you go home only after
four hours of past limbo rests tomorrow
it will all start again
heritage timelessness technology how do
we define the future of tradition
discover our newest creation the vkx
at Adel we believe that knowledge comes
from experience the more we see the more
we learn with this knowledge comes
freedom freedom to explore freedom to
escape freedom to reimagine what we
thought we knew
music transcends both space and time for
us headphones are more than the piece of
technology they're a true travel
companion this is what we had in mind
when designing the vkx Adel's first
wireless headphones over a year in the
making crafted from a single block of
aluminium the vkx Allies pioneering
audio technology with matchless comfort
our artisans trim and shape each skin
one by one for a truly unique finish
innovation paired with precision
excellence born of expertise
the key to success lies in the mastery
of details
each pair of headphones is assembled by
hand in our parisian workshop we believe
that there is nothing more rewarding
than being able to create something from
scratch because small-scale production
doesn't have to mean small-scale vision
at adel we think that luxury is all
about saying more with less so we'll let
the vjx speak for itself
every year it takes a million plastic
bottles and twelve million pounds of co2
from a hundred thousand trucks to ship
800 million gallons of water and
millions of everyday products so we can
shower four billion times and do six
billion loads of laundry traveling 73
million miles to bring 800 million
gallons to our stores and homes where we
already have water it takes rethinking
everything with 10 years of research and
over 30 patents it takes a thin 2-inch
swatch it takes removing all
necessary ingredients eliminating a
hundred percent of the water
producing 80% of the way and giving you
70% more space in biodegradable bamboo
packaging
spun layer by layer that lathers and
transforms when you introduce it to
water
as effective as heavy water-based
products but it only takes one little
swatch to wash all of this and these
these this and this simple powerful
clean for your home and body take on a
world of waste with ds3 80 percent lost
weight 70 percent lost base and 75
percent less emissions
ds3 and lighten clean enlighten your
personal care in laundry today support
our IndieGoGo launch and together we
begin making a difference
cooking is my passion but great cooking
asked for great cookware in reality
Island fresh food is sticking to your
stainless steel pan or one of the
ingredients of your dish is nonstick
coating after using your pan for longer
than a year so we have been working on
one thing and one thing only designing a
sleek and strong nonstick non-scratch
chef laughs a frying pan the black beard
for the past five years we have
infiltrated the worldwide cookware
industry we have distributed more than a
million premium brand pans throughout
the world we discovered these brands are
asking insane prices for Chef level pans
while on the other hand forcing
manufacturers to produce for minimal
costs between you and them there's a
huge hot-air balloon filled with
marketing power play and stake all of
value that is with you as a customer are
paying for
so the cookware industry needs pirates
Blackbeard's together with you we want
to open a smuggling route to the very
best and honest factories that produce
four famous brands starting with the
black weed that we design layer by layer
first the outside made of the toughest
stainless steel mirror-polished then a
core dividing the heat to alcohol pan
making black beat induction proof and
suitable for all heat sources on top of
that another layer of strong stainless
steel which we topped off with a new
black bit coating a honeycomb
non-scratch nonstick framework
we designed a full cast riveted iron
handle that provides a perfect grip and
remains cool you don't need to pay 120
euros for a chef laughs a frying pan
starting from 39 euros is much more
reasonable it would be an honor to
launch called cookware together with you
starting with the black beard and
looking a smuggling route to chef level
cookware uncompromising on quality a
sleek design and for the real price we
are looking for mates preorder the black
beard now on Kickstarter and let's hack
the cookware industry yes we been</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
