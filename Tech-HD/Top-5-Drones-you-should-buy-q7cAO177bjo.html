I've been building drones since 2007 and
since then I knew that I wanted to
create a drone that was water
we made a waterproof drone with all the
sophisticated features allow you to take
beautiful shots I'd remove the fear of
flying over water the splash zone is
rugged easy to fly and as a timeless
features that make it a blast
we put months you can make and share
that the features don't add complexity
during flight the splash zone can be
formed by anywhere from a phone or the
included remote control ease of users at
the core of every added feature we think
that you shouldn't have to be an expert
to allow your fertility to extend the
idea is to remove the barriers and allow
you to lose the fear of falling
different conditions including flying
over water hardcopy that's waterproof
but it doesn't have the features that
make it a real drunk so we've added a
waterproof camera gimbal and integrated
video transmitter and a live video feed
directly from the GoPro
by displaying location battery voltage
altitude and distance right on the
remote you'll always know where this
class drone is and how it's doing we
wanted to make it practical so we added
an emergency flare adapter that allows
you to deploy an emergency flare for 15
minutes rather than 15 seconds its
payload Lewis mechanism is not only fun
but can be used in emergency situations
this blaster neither Thomas functions
like follow me load planned mission
flights and return to launch location at
the clip of the switch

hi I'm JD lead designer the X plus one
and I'm Charles and I've been working
with JD on this project ever since I was
about six years old I've had a passion
for aviation and I turned that passion
into a career and I became an aerospace
engineer I love the technology around
drones and I've been involved with it
and as I've done that I've really seen a
need that's not being addressed when JD
first introduced the Xbox one to me I
was floored
not only have I not ever seen anything
like this on Kickstarter I've never seen
anything like this from just a
third-party company
the X plus one incorporates two key
elements that any drone would love to
have vertical takeoff and landing and
fast forward efficient flight
Charles is right when I first had the
idea I couldn't believe that nobody else
had done it before it's really a simple
idea
it's a quadcopter combined with a flying
link the quadcopter gives you the
ability for precision takeoff and
landing and hover and the flying wing
gives you the capability for efficient
forward flight the difference between
the X plus 1 and all other quad copters
or multirotors that are out there is
that we use aerodynamics in order to
support the weight of the craft thereby
giving you greater
so we've got a variety different
packages we've got the first package
which is more of a DIY package it
incorporates the core frame and you
bring the electronics the battery in the
motor we've got a fully functional end
to end product and we've even got a plus
version which allows you to have an
embedded gimbal as well as a GoPro
that's included in the package so
whether you're a DIY ER or you want an
end-to-end solution we've got a package
for you so in order to make this all
happen we need you we need to raise
$50,000 on Kickstarter in order to get
these amazing drones into your hands so
come join us be a part of this
revolution
get your own X plus one and back us for
the 50,000 we're excited to have you
involved
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
