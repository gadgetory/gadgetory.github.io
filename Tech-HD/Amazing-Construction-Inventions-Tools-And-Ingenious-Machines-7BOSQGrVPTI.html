multifunction pole base template
engineered to hold the anchor bolts
rebar cage and conduit securely in place
during the concrete pourer the result of
years of design refinement and testing

designed by contractors to virtually
eliminate the drawbacks of the
conventional hole base construction
process installed bolt star over the
conduits and place it directly on top of
the tube form both star is
self-supporting which means there's no
time wasted cutting custom support forms
and building templates out of wood check

ensure a level base before securing the
tube to the h frame both stars unique
design features built-in slots for
anchor bolts between 5/8 and 1 inch in
size and accommodates the pole
manufacturers bolt patterns and
specifications
what's more verified that anchor bolts
are set to the correct elevation above
top of form using bolt stars bolt
projection calculator wire up the rebar
cage using both stars specially designed
cage positioning slots in each arm these
slots Center and firmly hold the rebar
cage during the concrete pour in fact
the slots are strong enough to hang 500
pounds call for inspection and you're
ready to pour both stars forearms
feature wide openings that easily
accommodate the concrete chute or pump
including plenty of room for a vibrator
after the pour there's no waiting around
both stars patented arched arms allow
easy access with a trowel so the entire
top of the base can be finished in one
step
while anchor bolts are held firmly and
perfect alignment returned after the
concrete sets up remove bolt star and
