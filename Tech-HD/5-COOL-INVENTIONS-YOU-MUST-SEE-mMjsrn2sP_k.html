tennis is one of the greatest sports of
all time the feeling you get when you

these shots takes countless hours of
practice and with that comes the
inevitable chore of picking up hundreds
of tennis balls scattered all over the
courts players and coaches everywhere
know the frustration and tediousness
that goes into collecting balls during a
practice session and this is why we
invented ten ibattz Tanabata is the
world's first robotic ball collector ten
upon perfectly integrates computer
vision and artificial intelligence to
detect tennis balls on the court and
collect them for players

using the station that easily attaches

the app also keeps track of how many
balls are collected during a session and
how often you practice so feel free to
brag to your friends about how you're
stepping up your game while never having
to pick up another tennis ball Tana

mind the removable bucket holds up to 80
balls and lets you easily continue your
hittin session after tena bot has
cleared the court the battery takes only
ninety minutes to charge and runs for
four to five hours it's portable design
lets you pick up ten Abad and wheel it
on and off the court just like a
suitcase
and when you're done 10 ibattz compact
size makes it easy to fit in the trunk
of your car so instead of picking up
balls players can relax hydrate or just
keep playing we have created multiple
prototypes of Hannibal and perform
thousands of tests to come up with the
perfect training partner with any boss
patented design and advanced algorithms
we can make panis more convenient for
players at all levels whether you're
hitting with a ball machine volleying
with a friend or giving a lesson
telepods helps you get the most out of
your time on the court our dream is to
get more people playing tennis having
fun and improving their shops was a
support hand backhand or a kick sir we
have a great product an amazing team and
we can't wait to put the tiny balls in
your hands but we need your help in
order to start manufacturing and
shipping worldwide we need a large
enough order
together we can kick-start this
revolutionary product and take the
tedious out of things
the 21st century you've got to marvel at
mini-pc advanced technology compared
with a regular laptop you'll find many
advantages from our me mini PC you can
carry me comfortably in your handbag or
pocket without experiencing any back
pain now mean mini PC is ideal for
traveling shopping fast note-taking
presentations and completing your urgent
projects anyway hi my name is Leah me
offers the same functionality and
performance as a laptop and tablet now
you may be worried about its cost in
fact it's much cheaper than a laptop and
a tablet
moreover me even consumes less battery
energy and generates less heat let me
show you our me mini PC it's only 5
inches and made out of aluminium both
Windows 10 and android 5.1 OS is
pre-installed and you can switch between
the two often it has 8 gigabytes of RAM
and the internal storage is a 128
gigabyte SSD even though you're doing a
lot of things it's still smooth this is
a touchscreen it has an HD resolution of
1280 by 720 pixels letting you interact
quickly when you're on the go
alright let me play a video to check out
the sound quality and functionality
performance of course you may think you
have smartphones but this was a larger
display
sometimes if I get an urgent project I
can continue and finish my work while
I'm in transit
I'll open a word document to type
something now
here you'll see audio output HDMI to USB
slots Gigabit Ethernet DC 5 volt input
on this side USB see two more USB ports
one of which is USB 3.0 and a TF card
slot inside is the juban Wi-Fi antenna
and on the front stereo speakers and the
home button it comes with a stylish
stand cover and keyboard and two extra
pockets so you can take a keyboard or
mini pc review individually with the me
mini pc you can replace a tablet and a
laptop with a single device that fits
right in your pocket the end okay no
come on that's fine come lie down
these shoes are so comfy just be careful
not the weight them I mean now if you
could you're dead to the world thinks
these things love this bed sheets you
know they come via sheets in the world
that made from you could let this it's
fine
nobody does it'll be our little secret
well us in the quality quality you can
up this and they sleep for about 20
hours a day coincidence me probably know
it's not a coincidence why we chose
eucalyptus over cotton for our bed
sheets cotton uses about 2.4 percent of
the world's narrable land and about 24%
of the world's insecticides it's a huge
ten to one ratio you could let this uses
no insecticides no pesticides and it
sustainably produced and sourced and
made into bed sheets and by the way
Egyptian cotton a lot of us draw in
Romania no knock on Romania good people
probably get cotton definitely not Egypt
retailers are actually taking about 50
percent of the price that you pay in a
store for the sheets that they sell and
maybe it's just us but going to a retail
store and hang twice what you should for
fake cotton sheets feel so 2020 sorry
with that
if you don't have stuff for years
save money save the world just for shits
and giggles</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
