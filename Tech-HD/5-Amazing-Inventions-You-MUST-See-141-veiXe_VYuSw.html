are you passionate about the outdoors do
you love to ski or snowboard or maybe
you like to hike backpack bike or camp
regardless of your adventure have you
ever thought right now I wish I could
get out of these ski boots snowboard
boots hiking boots or white cleats that
is exactly why we invented beckham's
a shoe you can easily take with you so
you can relax comfortably hi I'm Julie
I'm the founder of hakam's
I was sitting on top of a mountain and I
had my feet on top of my ski boots cause
my feet were hurting so bad and that's
when they turn to a friend and said I
wish had some other shoes with me to put
on right now I came up with Packard's
they are lightweight they are
comfortable and most of all they're
packable they're so easy to take with
you our new line of Packham have an
outer sole that is mostly evie a so
they're extremely lightweight and
comfortable you'll forget you have
anything on your feet they also feature
a cushioned insole for added comfort of
tongue so they're super easy to get on
and off and a pocket which is perfect
for cash and credit cards so you can
leave your purse or wallet at home
they're insulated with a faux fur lining
for comfort and warmth and are
beneficial for the recovery of the sore
feet after a long fun-filled day we've
also added a draw cord on the heel to
easily pack the shoes together if you're
in the wet snow or rain no worries our
new line is waterproof we kept our
signature soft upper for pack ability
and every pair still comes with a tote
bag to easily take backups on any
adventure hi I'm Brian and I love boots
you can imagine how many products I've
seen over the years since I
Oberth business and I've recently become
aware of the Packers product which is a
brilliant brilliant innovation because
I've never seen a boot that caters to so
many applications for after adventure
after activities pack ups are perfect
for going to the gym running errands
walking the dog or as an everyday
comfortable shoe we even have a line for
kids ideal for fitting into a backpack
on those snowy school days and we have
an award-winning one-of-a-kind boot that
comes with markers so you can have fun
designing your own boots the one asset
that Julie has the iPad is raving fans
everybody is contacting her with
photographs of where they wore their
peckers all over the world I've seen
that and that's something you can't buy
and I see she's going through all the
same problems that I went through with
building the ugh brand and that is
dealing with success because every time
you bring on a new line it's a huge
capital investment to bring it forth and
be able to produce enough product for
the expanded market that you have and so
I'm a great supporter of joy I love this
product and I hope you all support her
as well because this is a brilliant
opportunity a brilliant product and I
can see they're doing really well on a
national and international basis
I presented the new line of Paco's to
some potential retailers and they
absolutely love them but the only way
that I can get Pak was manufactured is
with your help
making this Kickstarter campaign
successful means that you'll be able to
be comfortable on your next adventure

introduce Peckham's I truly appreciate
your support lice and adventure take us
