people the opportunity to capture and
enjoy their experience at the same
moment since then I built a team of
engineer marketer and designer and
together we start discovering what
people really need to enjoy their
experience of capturing photos and
videos after the deer validation we have
built our first prototype to test all
futures and user needs we have been
working very ugly during the last eight
