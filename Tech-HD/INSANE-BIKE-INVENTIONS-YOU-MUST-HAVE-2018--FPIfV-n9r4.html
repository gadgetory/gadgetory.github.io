hey and you go go I'm Kent the creator
of Reba lights I'm here today to share
with you an idea we've been working on
for the last year the Revo lights
Eclipse as with the original this new
version of Revo lights will provide
unprecedented 360-degree visibility with
a functional headlight that allows you
to see where you're going
and a smart taillight that can sense
your speed and will flash when slowing
down
we're on IndieGoGo to add the next level
of function into our newest version of
the lights we want to add in the ability
to connect our already smart lights to
your phone to provide a number of
awesome features for starters real time
battery life so you can make sure your
lights are always ready for your next
ride with Eclipse the battery now snaps
directly into the ring making it much
more accessible while removing any need
for cables or parts near the hub and
making installation a snap we want our
lights to work with any riding style so
this new version will include a feature
that recognizes the time of day and
turns the lights on for you if it senses
you're about to ride to achieve the
lighting effect Revo lights calculate
your speed and for the first time we'll
be able to give you this data so you can
accurately track your speed and distance
and work towards riding goals when
developing Revo lights we focused on
creating innovative essential tools for
commuters like handlebar activated turn
signals to make it easier to grab a
drivers attention when turning we also
plan to add features for any commuter
like weather alerts letting you know
ahead of time what to expect and
ensuring you never get caught without
your jacket
but with all these added functions we
wanted to make sure your lights are
secure so just like with the previous
version of our lights they are designed
to be locked up along with your wheels
so if you do have to leave your bike on
the street you don't have to worry about
removing them or having them stolen to
celebrate the launch of Eclipse we
partnered with pier fix to bring you
special edition bicycles with Revo
lights already installed exclusively for
IndieGoGo
whether you're an everyday commuter or a
more casual rider we have you covered
with Oliva Lites Coolidge and Reva
lights a royal bicycles and while we're
incredibly excited about this new
version we can't do it without your
feedback and support please help us make
this a reality by contributing to our
campaign thank you I've been a physical
therapist for over 21 years and I've
treated many bicyclists that have met
with a motorist if these bicyclists
could have been seen better and as the
motors would have known what they were
doing we could have probably prevented
all of these injuries hence the thought
there should be some kind of a turn
signal for bikes so you wear this device
on your wrist that looks very much like
a watch that has a high-tech sensors
that can detect your arm position and it
communicates with the device that you're
either wearing around your waist or it's
mounted on the light it helps kids
understand how to use hand signals by
using modern technology my hope would be
with my turn cycle device that I can
befriend hundreds of thousands of
accidents a year
leading us
we'll go through we stance you the
highways</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
