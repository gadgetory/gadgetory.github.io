prying things apart it's a very common
task no doubt you also found that it's
important to have the right tool for the
job these are some of the prying tools
that have proven most useful to me in
the past now I'm going to add another
it's called the trim puller and that's
exactly what it excels at doing the trim
polar by zenith Industries was designed
to remove wood trim without damaging
either the wood or the walls the ground
bevel on the edge allows the tool to be
easily driven between the trim and wall
the integrated center wedge then
continues to separate the materials in
some cases this wedging action alone is
enough to complete the job the trim
polar is designed to be leveraged side
to side because of the wide contact area
and greater leveraging effect trim
removal goes faster while wall surfaces
remain undamaged the tool quickly easily
and safely removes shoe molding
baseboard chair railing and door casings
it's ideally suited for lifting carpet
tack strip and edging the trim polar can
also be used for prying off molding from
decorative panels or doors without the
risk of damaging either it's also quite
effective at removing ceramic tile the
integrated center wedge combined with
the tools wide surface area enable it to
quickly pop tile away from the surface
beneath the trim polar can be used as a
temporary shim when leveling base
cabinets or for prying off cabinet
countertops that have been glued or
nailed in place it even comes in handy
when replacing damaged floor planks
removing shoe molding baseboards chair
railing door casing carpet strip piles
and more
it's almost impressive when a single
tool can do so many things so well tired
of cutting sheet metal the old
ineffective way it's a never-ending job
of using tin snips grinders or hack saws
getting cuts all over your hands from
the sharp jagged edges
well now you can start cutting any sort
of metal the quick and easy way
introducing the renovator versicolor the
professional precision engineered
renovator versa cutter attaches to any
drill Electric cordless or air with a

keyless chuck and turns it into the
latest powerful metal cutting device tin

edges when cutting sheet metal and
corrugated iron unless you're a
tradesman with very expensive tools

you really want the aggravation the rid
of anniversa color will change the way

punch that nibbles out the metal on the

we all know how hard that is to cut look
how the renovator versicolor glides
through it like a hot knife through
butter with no distortions and no sharp
jagged edges it

metal because the cats are so clean it
even cuts the softest materials like
paper or denim with ease and balsa wood
laminates without splintering this

introducing multi-cut the three-in-one
tool that's a precision slicer wire
cutter and utility knife all in one now
cutting the really tough stuff is really
simple the secret is the mechanical
action of its offset pivot point power
blade that creates superior torque and
leverage for incredibly easy operation
other tools just can't cut it
but even this 10,000 pound strength tow
rope is no match for multi cut multi cut
has a titanium coated wire cutter for
wire in a range of gauges and sizes
slide the adjustable base and now it's a
utility knife the razor-sharp stainless
steel blade sure grip handles and an

shed and the easiest to use extra blades
