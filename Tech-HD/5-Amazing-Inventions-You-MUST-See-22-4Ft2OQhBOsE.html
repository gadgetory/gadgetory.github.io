the creation of a next-generation razor
blade the last major change to razor
blades was over a half century ago when
stainless steel replaced carbon steel
since then
it's mainly been adding yet another
blade to the razor every decade or so
two billion blades go into landfills
every year so our goal was to create
something that was much sharper than
steel but more importantly lasted much
much longer this is a pharaoh the
world's first sapphire blade razor we've
developed pure white sapphire blades
with an edge about beating atoms at the
tip for roughly five thousand times
thinner than the width of a human hair
sapphire is also much harder than steel
which means the blades last much longer
currently up to a year with the
potential to last several times that
long
we're huge fans of design so it was
really important to us not to build the
kind of cheap neon or fake chrome
handles you see in most bathrooms today
ideally we wanted to build something
that might be passed down through
generations like a well-made watch the
project got off to a very rough start we
spent more than a year and a half going
in entirely the wrong direction trying
to make billions out of an advanced
ceramic called zirconia which amongst
other things has been used in very
expensive sushi knives unfortunately for
us and for my face as a tester you can't
get zirconia sharp enough to make a
great razor blade we went back to the
drawing board and after a couple of
months talking to experts around the
world decided to try a finer suppers in
many ways the perfect material for razor
blades because it can be made
exceptionally sharp and it's second only
to Diamond in terms of hardness so
blades stay sharp the downside is that
Sapphire is very expensive it took us
nearly another three years to create the
first affero razor and we couldn't find
a way to make one affordably so we
decided to embrace the high cost and
launched with the most impressive handle
we could build including one version
made out of iridium and another made out
of gold so pharoah's lunch generated an
incredible amount of press and it was
fun to get that kind of exposure for the
product but we knew no matter how much
exposure we got we couldn't have a
meaningful impact on the industry until
we can get our cost down
that's been our sole focus at Sapiro
since launch sapphires used as a
component in high-tech products like
advanced solar panels LEDs and the
iPhone 6 has helped drive prices down
we've also found new suppliers and
worked with existing suppliers to
optimize the manufacturing process for
years later we finally have a path but
we need your help to walk it even with
the cost improvements we need high
volumes to make this work
ideally manufacturing runs in the tens
of thousands or even hundreds of
thousands of blades we need your help to
do that your support can help us change
an industry
and allow you to be one of the first
people in the world to shave with a
beautifully designed sapphire blade
razor
we all have ideas up to seventy thousand
a day but ideas come when we least
expect them
yes that's a great idea for a big
Russian clients but we're often so busy
doing so many things that few of them
get converted into action in don't
forget to brush me don't forget to buy
broccoli tap is the solution we've been
waiting for it's the world's first
wearable thought catcher it helps you
turn your ideas into actions how does it
work well it's a stylish touch activated
wearable that instantly captures your
spoken words analyzes them and then
sense them to the applications you use
to manage your life you wear it
everywhere even when you don't on your
phone it takes your idea and starts your
work for you wherever your ideas come
you just tap it in speed yeah
that's the best idea for a big Russian
client Evernote send the output profit
charts to Alex and Pavel it works with
dozens of apps that you already use like
Facebook Evernote Twitter and SoundCloud
it understands 42 different languages
gracias
now see don't fish aim and it has its
own apps that make your life easier need
help managing your to-do lists
controlling your calendar miles has its
own programs and predictive analytics to
help you with that you can even build
custom apps with the mile constructor
I'm making an app when I'm at work and I
come up with a great idea for pi these
are the founders of mile and they know
that using tap is like gaining the
superpowers we've always wanted the
superpowers of super memory super
efficiency and super like you to never
lose an idea again use it and get your
superpower today
Oh
elf Emmett is an active non-invasive
wearable technology that helps us face
the challenges of our stressful
lifestyle even when you're chronically
stressed elf Emmett will help you return
to a balanced state
with so many things going on it's hard
to keep a clear and focused mind so you
can effectively learn help Emmet will
help you focus and concentrate all you
need to
most people have struggled with
sleepless nights all the stress of the
day just keeps you from resting belf
Mehmet will calm you down and me rock
you into a deep sleep elf Emmet works in
synergy with the natural rhythm of your
mind and body waves when you're active
and focused your brain frequency is high
when you're resting it slows down
however because of our busy lifestyle
our brainwaves aren't always in tune
with what we need elf
Emmet uses pulsed electromagnetic
technology to non-invasively synchronize
your mind with the frequency of what you
want to do learn and concentrate while
feeling stressed
improve the quality of your sleep stay
awake when feeling tired
relax after a hard day we designed the
technology around a beautiful light
headband that is powered by your
smartphone or tablet and operated with a
simple application
people have always used extremely low
frequencies to achieve altered states of
consciousness just think of meditating
to the rhythmic sound of drums Gong
therapy or the steady flashing light of
a fire things that take us into a state
of thoughtfulness
even when the sound of cranes
different rhythms in music
they all have an effect on us we always
adapt to an external frequency our
entire biological system the brain and
the earth itself work at the same
frequencies mister Nikola Tesla once
said that if we can influence those
frequencies electronically we can
directly stimulate the entire body and
mental system of humankind elf Emmet
uses the same power source as your
headphones to generate a weak
electromagnetic pulse between two coils
to demonstrate we can connect the coils
to a speaker and actually hear the
frequency that the application transmits
it's music you can't hear the cerebellum
is the part of our brains that links the
brain and the heart depending on our
situation it suggests our performance
rhythm this is the spot that says slow
down there's no danger
relax or it says hurry up we have work
to do concentrate elf
Emmet works directly on the cerebellum
and can influence the whole system it
tells both the brainwaves and heartbeat
to speed up or slow down
imagine lucky multiple gadgets around
not finding the one you need at the
moment dealing with tangled cables
cramming them into your back issues with
Portability and convenience
it is time to move away from this world
of annoyances and towards the
revolutionary product we hatched after
iterating numerous designs introducing
maza and elegantly designed
multifunction feature-packed hub we
often run out of charge on our phone
midday the internal battery Amazo can
charge your phone to get through the day
the best part is you can charge up to
four devices on contains no more words
about the lack of ports in your laptop
connect up to four USB devices and
transfer files to and from your computer
while charging at the same time Mazo has
a hands-free feature letting you take
calls and have conversations hassle-free
mazo is built-in powerful wireless
stereo speakers letting you enjoy your
music whether you are running solo or
out party conference calls with mazo are
a breeze and everyone can hear you
crystal-clear Mazo can be attached onto
any metal surface with the help of the
embedded magnet the detachable stand
helps you dock your phone to watch
movies take video calls or even act as a
night clock no more worries about losing
your property in fact the built-in
motion detector sounds an alarm in case
of any slight movement in the device
when you are out of range the Bluetooth
tracker can sound an alarm to alert you
mazo has a lanyard slot making it easy
to hook it to your backpack
mazo is about the size of a regular
wallet and fits right into your pocket
making it a perfect portable device for
all your needs on the GUP we've done the
hard work of packing maza with all these
features so you can spend less of your
date juggling devices and more on
enjoying everything life has to offer
