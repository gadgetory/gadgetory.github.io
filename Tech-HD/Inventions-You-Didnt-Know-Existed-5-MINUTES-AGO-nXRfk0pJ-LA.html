called Mayu and through the swirling
motion of the water inside it it'll make
your water healthier and better tasting
how let's go back to simpler times when
water used to move and Tigers try to eat
you if you wanted to have a drink back
then you'd go down to a river a constant
movement of the water made it fresh
tasty and free of pathogens aka bad
bacteria but those dang Tigers they
wanted the healthy moving water as well
because Tigers are smart so man moved
away into cities and brought water to
them using pipes and taps that's when
water stopped flowing in fresh air
there's stuck in closed pipes where no
beneficiary chemical reactions can occur
toxins from the pipes dissolve into the
water and bacterial colonies flourish in
the cracks to kill the pathogens
chlorine is added to the water bad for
the germs but also not great for us Mayu
uses a unique vortex motion that brings
water back into their natural form and
aerate and balances the water through
the atmospheric oxygen this in turn
starts a line of chemical reactions
evaporating chlorine volatile organics
and other toxins precipitating metals
like manganese and irons so they don't
react in your body stripping away the
metallic taste and unpleasant odour and
balancing the waters pH level now you
have natural delicious water at home
who's smart now Tigers the vortex in Rio
is the most natural Universal motion of
energy even a flowing river if you look
closely moves in a spiral my use unique
vortex has created thanks to its
motionless motor it's a design built to
last a lifetime
and everything that touches the water is
made from medical-grade materials just
like with a flowing river the more water
you pour the bigger the spiral
the load cell sensors at the bottom of
the device calibrate the motor strength
and speed for a perfect vortex according
to the amount of water in the vessel to
get the water spiraling
just place the vessel on the Mayu base
take it off and it's off want even more
magic when the Mayu vessel is set it
seems to levitate as if there is nothing
actually creating that waterfall and a
vessel sensation and due to the unique
motor the entire thing is whisper quiet
no noise and still it works my you can
also operate unplugged its battery lasts
up to two hours and it's easy to charge
to not interfere with a design the
charging cable is magnetic for a smooth
touch now for what is maybe the most
important aspect the taste the people of
my you conducted dozens of taste tests
in those tests 85% of people preferred
my use water to regular and mineral
water these are the people behind my you
they care deeply about water after all
water is the source of all life for two
and a half years they observed studied
and even reconstructed natural water
sources to mimic their special qualities
and create this elegant device so if you
want to drink healthier better tasting
water every day support my you and drink
water the way nature intended
we're messy we came from Copenhagen and
yes we're back bitches first of all a
huge shout out to all of our amazing
backers who helped us launch our
sunglasses back in April we sold a bunch
of sunglasses and cleaned up a ton of
plastic waste yeah plastic we partnered
with an NGO and every time we sell a
pair of shades they clean up ten kilos
of plastic waste from the Pacific Ocean
making the world a little better while
looking good not bad huh so why are we
here again
well winter is coming and because we
absolutely love doing this
and this
but this is kind of annoying so we did a
little research to find out what goggles
are so damn expensive and it turns out
it's pretty much the same towards a
sunglasses
one company controls the majority of the
market so they can charge a lot of money
so once again we visited our good old
friend st. hey it's C and after months
in the lab we came out with these bad
boys awesome high quality kick-ass
goggles with a ton of fancy features
easy interchangeable lenses anti fog
system full UV 400 protection triple
layer pansy scratch for mirror coating
dual air impact resistant amazing helmet
fits an anti slip strap play the tongue
twister triple layer foam technology to
protect your pretty face against snow
and wind super flexible and lightweight
frames for a great fit for all places
but then you might ask does that only
come in one color no no no no no no you
can choose from many different styles
for every thinkable weather condition oh
yeah you'll get an extra over cause lens
for free but what do they cost glad you
asked
only 100 euros that's only like half
price normal goggles yeah but then you
could spend more of your hard-earned
money on this
and just like with our sunglasses for
every pair of messy weekend goggles you
buy we clean up ten kilos of plastic
waste from the Pacific Ocean but we need
your help make all this happen to help
us help you get amazing goggles at
amazing prices so please hit the green
button and pledge like there's no
tomorrow
to see you guys on the slope oh and of
course we had a bunch of average skiers
and snowboarders
test out okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
