has become the single most important
communication device that we use on a
daily basis no matter where we are we
need it to stay in contact with those
around us however smart phones are
entirely dependent on a communication
infrastructure that they use what
happens when this infrastructure becomes
unreliable or is non-existent for
instance when we are out in the wild
traveling abroad when there are too many
users congesting the network or when a
natural disaster knocks down existing
cellular towers that's why we created
the sonnet a wireless communication of
ice that enables your smartphone to send
instant messages voice recordings image
data and GPS locations even when there
is no internet access or cellular
coverage how does it work
simply connect your smartphone to the
Wi-Fi access point on the sonnet and it
will transmit the data sent from your
phone to other sonnet users via
long-range radio frequency no cellular
data no satellite service and no monthly
subscription the typical range for
point-to-point communication with the
sonnet is approximately five kilometers
or three miles
it also supports mesh networking that
can dramatically increase its effective
range by securely relaying data through
other SONET devices in the area the
sonnet is designed specifically for use
in the outdoors it is rated ip66 meaning
that its dust tight and water resistant
the sonnet is powered by a 4000 milliamp
power battery that allows you to use it
continuously for up to 24 hours as a
built-in USB port so that you can even
charge your phone with it on the
software side is the sonnet app an
intuitive instant messenger that draws
upon the familiar user experience in
addition the solid app comes with
useful features such as offline maps and
real-time location sharing so that you
always know where you are in relation to
your friends in the case of an emergency
the sonnet app has a panic button which
will activate the SOS mode broadcasting
your distress call and your current GPS
location to any sonnet users in range
we've been developing the sonnet for
over a year now and we're super excited
but as possibilities our prototypes are
now complete and we're ready to move
into full production that's where you
come in we're looking for your support
to bring this form a decentralized
communication into the mainstream the
sauna is just the beginning and we're so
grateful for you to be a part of it
thank you for your help

to dive with you and now I can give that
time I love when people can get to know
the ocean I love to show them what is
there because when you know something
they love it more and you can protect it
more

nature everything you do in life you're
kind of looking within yourself every

total wireless earphones were supposed
to be a jump to the future but we've
sacrificed a lot there have been huge
compromises on sound quality comfort
easy pairing and battery life thankfully
the long-sought solution to these
problems is about to arrive introducing
Liberty plus by Zola the world's first
zero compromise total wireless earphones
we've used state-of-the-art technology
and years of audio industry experience
to develop Liberty plus and we started
with what's most important we've
engineered a revolutionary driver using
graphene 100 times stronger than steel
with only a fraction of the weight it
vibrates and hold shape effortlessly to
make music shine with clarity and
intensity across all frequencies
liberté plus uses pioneering liquid
silicon ear tips and grip fit technology
to ensure a universal and reliable thing

battery technology with its sleek
charging case liberty plus offers an
enormous 48 hours of stunning music

the same wireless technology used in
drones and satellites creating an almost
unbreakable bluetooth link and liberty
plus has a brain as advanced as its
voice Alexa how's the weather in Seattle
it's 55 degrees with cloudy skies and we
promise not to stop here we'll put our
hearts and souls into delivering a
future with no sacrifice so support our
Kickstarter and help create liberty plus
