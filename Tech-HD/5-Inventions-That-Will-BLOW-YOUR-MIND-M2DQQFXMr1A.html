for the last year we set out to create
an electric skateboard with an authentic
long boarding experience I'm pleased to
introduce the juice board from the shape
and flex of the deck oversized
eighty-three millimeter wheels the juice
board offers of buttery school drive
while taking on elbows and cracks and
just they weren't even there we've
designed the juice boards music for
beginners to learn and powerful enough
for the seasoned rider with the remote
in your hand you can access for unique
speed modes with each mode the top speed
acceleration and braking power are
adjusted allowing you to start off easy
an adapter boards you're riding for
joining doing away with the traditional
belt type system we've sealed our motor
right inside the making it highly dust
and water resistant this also means
there are no bulbs to replace and if you
run with a battery you can free real
just like a regular longboard the juice
board is now in production we'll be
shipping early summer stoked about this
project we like you to come along for
the ride and bring your juiced boards to
the street
you

the form of a futuristic polygonal
humanoid for the last two years we've
been working through every conceivable
detail with the most qualified experts
in design and sound engineering it was
our mission to create a true
representative of the height of modern
technology integrated and what is no
doubt a show-stopping speaker but the
striking design of this piece is just
the prologue of the story you'll be
blown away by what's inside
