just upload and enjoy how well you see
that's because you I may see things from
slightly different perspective and your
brain can find them so you can see them
don't believe me well try getting a ball
when I close vilma does the same thing
it uses mirrors to record to perspective
the videos end up looking like this when
you watch them in a viewer their 3d

lenses before the campaign even
finishing we came to indy gogo to find
people who wanted to change the way that
we record so what's his Rudi story is it
