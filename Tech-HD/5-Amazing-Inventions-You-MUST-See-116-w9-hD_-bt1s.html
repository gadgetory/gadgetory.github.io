transition and transformation the floaty
suitcase is both beautiful and extremely
functional by combining superior
materials innovative features and the
unix time I don't care if it's for
business or vacation I usually put my
handbag on top of the suitcase and try
to hold it together with the suitcase
handle but it always dips down the
floaty handbag locking is designed to
carry bags and coats of any size and
shape the retractable strap and recess
top surface have to hold your items
securely no matter how you move or
toggle suitcase and this release it from
the stress of holding multiple items at
the same time I was using a four wheeled
suitcase that sometimes got pretty drag
in the road and annoys embarrass me a
lot but with the new floaty wheels
things got a lot better
floaty is the world's first suitcase
with innovative suspension system
features smooth maneuverability for both
pushing and pulling motion impacts and
vibrations are absorbed and neutralized
by custom design down offering a great
handling even on bumpy surface
I use my phone when I'm walking with my
suitcase but it can be a bit annoying
the smart handle using media has some
free access to your phone it may cause
large maps and send messages just by
tapping your suitcase happens it is
designed to help you focus or where
you're going
I travel with my laptop tablet and of
course my phone and having a way to
charge them on the go is definitely a
lifesaver the detachable laptop charger
can charge iPhone up to seven times or
netbook for 1.5 times allows you to take
all your electronics to security check
effortlessly I once left my travel
wallet in the hotel but luckily they
called me back to pick it up you will
never lose your belongings with floaty
chocolates they are designed to work
seamlessly flow Tiye providing a non
stop loss prevention overweighted yeah
that happened to me a few times and
sometimes they let you pass
helpful and understated the building
scale shows the weight of your leg I can
fasten those pouches on to the lining so
that everything in my suitcase stays
clean tidy and well organized the
concept of transition is in the variety
of materials the outer shell made by
Cote polycarbonate with recess aluminum
insert make the floaty suitcase
extremely durable and lightweight while
the genuine leather trains offer a great
sense of touch personalized handle and
time at grade meetings and identity to
your suitcase they also have your floaty
to stand out a suitcase for me
is more than just a case that carries
stuff from place to place it's pretty
like a big handbag it's very important
for me how it feels how it looks how it
smells it's part of my look and the most
important part of the suitcase
the handle because that's the part that
I touched the most
you
back pain sucks it affects 80% of
Americans at some point of their lives
if you're watching you or someone you
know has likely battled back pain you've
probably tried everything braces
medication other treatments but all
those things are passive solutions
none of them actively tackles the
underlying problem introducing core pro
an all new approach to back support the
core pro activates your core to support
your back core Pro is the brainchild of
dr. Chia for shown a physical therapist
and lifelong athlete as a new mom and
physical therapist I set out to find a
better way for women to recover core
function after delivery but this is not
just a new mom issue proper core
function is essential for stability of
the spine and limiting back pain for
anybody when your core muscles aren't
working properly your spine isn't well
supported I created core pro to work
with the natural anatomy and physiology
of the body my design was granted
multiple patents for its unique approach
it triggers your abdominal muscles to
engage while still allowing for full
range of motion it helps to stabilize
your spine and keep you moving corporal
is made of three key components a
breathable fabric sleeve made of
stretchy garment material to provide
both compression and flexibility a soft
non stretch back panel that provides an
anchor for the elastic straps in the
same way your spine is the anchor for
your abdominal muscles and two sets of
elastic straps that pull across your
stomach from opposite sides the straps
offer gentle resistance for activation
of your core muscles whether you work on
your feet all day or stuck in a desk
corporal will help your body to function
with proper form it's great for golfers
fitness buffs weekend warriors nurses
new moms desk jockeys and anyone who
struggles with their back or posture
best of all the Corporal is slim enough
to fit under clothing so that no one
needs to know you're wearing it and you
can even toss it in the washer
