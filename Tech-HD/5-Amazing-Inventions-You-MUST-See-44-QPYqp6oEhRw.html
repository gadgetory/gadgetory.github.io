living in the future right now Jennifer
here has a smartphone that enables her
to auto ride home control the
temperature turn on the lights
- face it we're living in a
technological Wonderland and yet here we
find Phil Phil's forgotten the
combination of his travel log is the
current solution to that problem we live
in an era filled with technological
marvels and yet this is what happens
when Phil forgets a lock combination is
that the best we can do no because we
live in an era where the air vault
exists the air box has a travel lock you
control it with your smartphone it's the
law the future deserves a lock with
customizable security settings this
airball opens whenever my phone is
within bluetooth right well maybe you
don't trust anyone in your life that's
fine
the settings on this airball require me
to when to a password into the app well
maybe your air bolts been stolen that's
fine too because you can sit your air
bulbs back to bed an alarm when it moves
too far away from your phones or you can
activate the alarm manually stop that
man
it's the justice the future deserves hi
Bill I tell them what happened bill I
lost my back you lost your we live in a
well where I can use my smartphone to
one of my sleeping patterns but bill
here can't find his bag if bill have
been using the air bolt instead of some
antique you could have located it using
the air box Kraus or CBS networks what
if you lose your phone
well you can still unlock your able by
logging in from another device well you
can enter our backup button code using
your hand like some kind of prehistoric
man
the air vault has a rechargeable battery
which only needs to be charged once a
year by a standard microUSB connector
it's CSA approved so F of security is
not an issue the app will record a
history of every time you've locked and
unlocked your airport you can even share
access to your vault with your friends
so you'll be able to unlock it from the
other side of the world thanks pal
you're welcome buddy and look how small
it is seriously look at it it's really
small airboat it's the travel lock we
all deserve
hey Kickstarter I'm J I'm Daniela four
years ago we started go tenant to solve
the no service problem we set out to
make it possible to use your phone even
when you don't have cell reception or
Wi-Fi after a lot of hard work we
developed this device which is the first
and only way to use your smart phone to
send text messages and GPS locations to
others over long distances even when you
don't have any service of any kind our
award-winning product has been enjoyed
by tens of thousands and used all over
the planet while adventuring outdoors
traveling abroad attending crowded
events or even during an emergency over
the last year we've been working on a
next-generation product it lays the
foundation for a kind of communications
network that has never existed before
and now we're finally ready to share
what we've been working on and invite
you to be a part of it has this ever
happened to you you're traveling with
friends and burst his garden and
everyone has a different adventure plan
for the day meaning wants to climb a
mountain and take pictures David and I
don't want to find a river and enjoy the
Sun and you you just want to find a
Reinheitsgebot because you don't go to
birches garden without trying the right
height spot the problem is my phone has
no service in French of Scotland and I
still want to know what my friends are
doing that's why in this adventure we
each brought a goat in a mesh once
paired with your phone go ten immense
generates its own radio signal so you
can send texts and GPS locations using a
simple app no towers routers or
satellites required sent and received I
can send a direct message of David a
group chat to my friends or broadcast to
any Goten in the area
go tena has great point-to-point
communication range but with this
groundbreaking mesh networking
technology it's possible to double or
triple your range for hopping through
other go tender mesh units in the area
you don't even need to know the other
users or do anything it's automatic and
privately so how I'm able to receive a
message from Ming who's on top of a
mountain because our friends and other
go 10ms users act as relay points
between us imagine using this out of
music festival or on the slopes the
possibilities are endless unlike
traditional communication networks
Goten a mesh actually gets stronger the
more users join it
we call this people power connectivity
one more to go please
you

you
my name is Ryan Howard and the founder
and CEO VIP life monitor the I beat
light monitor is a SmartWatch that can
effectively save your life it's
monitoring your heart 24/7 for
exceptions for safe parameters and to
make sure your heart's not stopping and
the case that it does it reaches up to
nine eleven eleven urgency contacts to
ensure that you're safe a good friend of
mine named Mark Dunley suddenly passed
away last Thanksgiving he was four years
old really close to me and it was
incredibly impactful to me during that
time I started thinking about how to
solve for this and how I could
effectively prevent this happening for
other people around me and that was the
genesis of the idea we started looking
at products in the marketplace we
noticed things like like alert like I've
fallen and I can't get up right and
everyone's seen this product and the
reality is is that by wearing this
product you're marking yourself as
elderly or old or sick and we noticed
that users didn't want to do that we
felt it dehumanize them so in our design
we partnered with ammunition group here
in San Francisco they've delivered
products to markets such as the Beats
headphones
the williams-sonoma connected products
we wanted to build something that
empowered the individual that looked
good felt good but also made them feel
safer the watch itself is incredibly
comfortable we made sure that people
that need to wear 24/7 ken it has a
rechargeable battery that simply clicks
on the side of it
to allow the person we're at 24/7 in
addition the styling we made sure that
an individual can wear it to the gym
with a suit and casual clothes as well
it has a touchscreen interface and then
the screens are actually interchangeable
so you can change the look and feel
based on your style and preference the
watch itself requires no phone it's
fully so there you don't have to pay for
a cell plan but also has an emergency
on-demand feature if you've fallen down
the stairs if someone's broken into your
house if you've had an accident during a
bicycle ride for example you simply
press this button for two seconds and
again your emergency contacts are
notified roughly 10 years ago I started
a company called practice Fusion and we
built that into the largest
physician-patient platform in that
States many of the team members from
practice region have come to I mean in
addition we have the CTO from sky catch
and the data scientists from phases it's
a world-class team and they're
definitely the right people to help
bring IP to market we're excited to have
dr. oz involved with the company he's a
cardiothoracic surgeon a professor at
Columbia University obviously the host
of the dr. Oz Show now he's partnered
with the company to help us bring the
product to market his background brings
expertise and heart related issues he's
a major heart awareness advocate as well
and we think he's one of the best people
to help us inform the market as well as
educate potential users and help us
reach them the campaign funds from
IndieGoGo will be used to tool our
factories so we can deliver a high
quality product to our users if you buy
now you get the product for more than
half off along with months of free
monitoring by supporting this campaign
you're helping us deliver this product
to market to have a macro impact on our
community and we feel with dr. oz
involved that we can ensure that people
with heart related issues are aware of
those in that they live a safe life
you
she's far from my final people use
cellphones to listen to music the cell
phone some quality is not perfect in
addition cell phones do not support high
res music formats for example DSD flag
wave this is why we need a high res
music player in 2008 high five man was
the first company to introduce arrest
pop music player we used the most
expensive high-end audio file components
in the player which made them sound good
but bulky and they consumed a lot of
everything only high file files and by
this niche market products in previous
couple years hyper I had always believed
we should put our audio technology into
a small and interviews music player
finally after three years of working
today we are releasing the high
technology portable music player mega
meaning
more importantly it can support all the
hi-res music romance as some quality is
phenomenal mega mini uses our newest
technology which Mary's much smaller
tripled battery life at the same time
our newest technology chips mega minutes
some quality very similar to our
previous high-end models for example the
ischium metal ones which cost fifteen
hundred US dollars it is so small and
compact battery life is about fifteen
dollars and only 249 everybody should
have one
