reinventing the basic ways of coin and
clicks with the rabbit you'll be able to
improve work performance play your games
better and all while avoiding unpleasant
feelings you would normally get from
repetitive click motions imagine
yourself coming off the computer feeling
as refreshed as the minute you first sat
down imagine owning at your favorite
games effortlessly while your opponent's
rage over your third pentakill calling
you all sorts of fancy hacker names
imagine yourself going home for the day
feeling accomplished and energized
knowing you'll be able to perform at
your very best again the following day
and every day ok so it looks like I got
some aerial footage here which is really
nice I do like the movement aspect of it
I like that it's very subtle what I
really like is that there's a nice arch
here I'm not reaching over there's no
pain there's no pinch and I would
definitely be feeling it by now
definitely better than the trackpad it's
like kind of effortless in the way
doesn't put a lot of pressure on your
wrist either it just makes it a lot
easier and a lot quicker to get the job
done I have liked some of the most like
top rated brands of Mouse's and I don't
think that they come close to like this
fast of a reaction like I just started
the game and I can already tell this is
like a lot easier like the reactions to
like the clicks in the game are really
fast and I really just like the feel of
this mouse I just feel like comfortable
usually plays Roadhog is my me this
feels more of a natural extension of a
hand than than anything I played before
I don't know how to say how to explain
it it's just like wow like I feel no
tension whatsoever in my hand right now
I mean I'm comparing it to the Razer
DeathAdder because that's what I've
played for five years it has the
mobility the accuracy of that except the
clicking is just a hundred times better
you have to you have to you have to try
it you really have to try it but first
it looked like
Mouse on steroids just kind of really
grabbed my attention because it doesn't
look like most Mouse's as as soon as I
started trying it out it first it was
weird thinking with your knuckles not
would not with your fingertips because
it's you know using the base of your
fingers feels a lot more natural when
you use his mouse it's your hand is
resting there was no discomfort and it
was it just became a natural kind of
thing to work with someone called me up
and said hey tali what's the rabbit all
about I'd say you gotta check it out I
think you'll like it it's really cool
like I really enjoy using it like I
totally use it like pull my way I really
like it I think it was really easy to
use and it was comfortable oh yeah I
would definitely use this mouse for
everyday things it seems like a natural
progression of the mouse you want to get
