iron shoes for horses have been in
existence for more than 2,000 years
multiple horses suffer or die from hoof
and leg issues
imagine trying to fit an iron plate on
the sole of your sports shoe how does
that feel horses have the same bones
tendons and ligaments as we have
introducing megasis horse runners the
world's first clippable runners for
horses
goodbye nails goodbye iron horseshoes
hello megasis horse runners hello
comfort poetry in motion just got easy
with megasis horse runners the first
shock-absorbing horse protection that
allows for natural hoof movements on all
types of terrain
here are just some advantages to megasis
horse runners our patent-pending
high-performance mega lock fastener
system makes it simple for a horse owner
and trainer to fit and take off it's a
horse lovers dream a state-of-the-art
stabilizer enhances and adjusts the
stability of the shoe to the horses
needs megasis horse runners really has
it all the mega frou tape is reflective
at night and keeps the mega lock tape
clean fitting the megasis horse runners
includes
four quick steps 1 mark the position of
the tape on the hoof and the hoof shape
on the megasis to stick mega lock tapes
on the marked hoof 3 cut the megasis
outside the marking using a jigsaw or
nipper and 4 put megasis on and clip the
side clips to the mega lock tape wow
that was simple be part of the
revolution what are the best earphones
for your game so many choices today
we're gonna try these this is gamma it's
the world's first earbuds using 3d
recutting audio technology we have four
testers
they're gonna play fortnight on
Nintendo's switch what I feel like them
good staff and explosion with said large
it's almost like someone's behind me
it's just so clear and it just sounds
like it's coming from behind you all
around Jeremy how are the earbuds used
multiple headsets in the past and it
just doesn't even come close to this I
like cliff Lestat and exploded it was
and it's just some like right into it
it's just an immersive experience when
you have these on oh no what the hell
man sorry the director wants us to plug
the products and we only have a certain
amount of time left
what's that
it's a 3d sound positioning system that
helps you locate the source of a sound
in a video game that's not new my
headset can do that too actually they're
not the same for traditional 3d sound
positioning they just separate the
master into three separate frequencies
gamo 3d recutting audio can separate
different types of key sounds footsteps
gun shops and other surrounding sounds
so you can pinpoint every sound in a 3d
space gamma has a wider range
traditional earphones with damo you're
able to hear the locations of your
enemies locate the directions where they
come from and even identify the changes
in distance and with the dual driver
system you can receive a much more
accurate sound location playback so
you'll hear every single detail about
your enemies imagine you're in a game
surrounded by danger you can easily
locate those threats and fight back or
slip away from those threats and fight
another time oh yeah so that's why it
sounded clearer than my headset
and another good feature for gaming is
the HD microphone long gone are the days
of screaming into a busted knife that is
useful but can it work on life phone too
of course
gamo is compatible with all gaming
platforms cell phone and tablet ps4
switch PC and even VR that's useful what
else can it do gamo has high five high
quality audio that lets you switch
between three different modes 3d gaming
3d movies and music well that's good to
know and it was designed to fit your
ears perfectly so you won't even feel
uncomfortable after hours of using gamo
damn off to get me some of those yo dude
what are you doing where can i buy gamma
hi I'm sorry um
and this is a traditional French press
it's been the best way to make coffee
for a really long time even though this
makes amazing coffee it has its
challenges one of the biggest problems
with French press is cleanup which is
also why most people don't use it to
solve the challenges of a traditional
French press I applied my engineering
and physics background to develop the
right press with the right press when
you press down on the plunger it forces
the grounds to our patented removable
bottom chamber it's a simple twist off
this makes cleanup really easy the right
press has other great tools built in to
ensure a consistent during ritual water
temperature is one of the most important
factors in brewing great coffee that's
why we built a thermometer right here in
the lid take it out and put it into your
water before you mix in your coffee blue
is too cold red is too hot and green is
perfect timing
is another critical part of the brewing
process we've built an hourglass into
the right press set for the exact amount
of time coffee should brew
when the hourglass is finished it's time
to plunge your perfect cup the whole
process is simple which is what your
morning ritual should be the right press
comes in stainless steel and matte black
it also comes in a half liter option
please consider adding the right press
to your morning ritual by supporting
this campaign because the most important
part of your day deserves to be
perfected</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
