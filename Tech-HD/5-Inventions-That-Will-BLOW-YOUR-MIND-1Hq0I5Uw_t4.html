on our tech every day to empower us to
make a difference but our tech relies on
us for one thing
does this look familiar forget that this
is eclipse the new neater way to charge
your devices
with its compact and round design it can
live on your nightstand desk or even
your wall eclipse is more than just a
three port USB hub it's the only
charging station that you won't want to
hide away setup is easy up to three of
your USB cables around into their own
precision-engineered channel so you
don't have to worry about them tangling
or overlapping
unlike cable boxes and charging stations
that just hide the mess
Eclipse keeps up to 24 feet of cables
neat and easy to access it comes with a
braided power cable essentially
extending each of your charging cables
by an extra four feet now you only need
one power socket to charge all of your
devices better yet you can use the
cables you already have
it doesn't just look good though unlike
lots of underpowered USB hubs out there
Eclipse intelligently ensures that your
devices are charging at their maximum
speed it uses an advanced transformer to
deliver safe and stable currents that
won't damage your precious devices
batteries and for your early adopters it
even has a USB C port now for the magic
with a single touch Eclipse Rises and
emits a subtle halo forget having to
turn on the lights to find that dreaded
cable tap it once more and it's halo
fades away along with your cable
frustration almost three years ago we
launched our first each dollar campaign
the gem cable we deliver over 10,000
units got priceless feedback from our
backers helping us bring an exciting new
product to market since then we've been
designing and producing a full line of
charging cables none of this would have
been possible without the Kickstarter
community however no matter how much
effort we put into making the best
possible charging cables there was
always one issue that wasn't addressed
we ran a survey and quickly learn from
thousands of people that this was a pain
shared by almost everyone so we got to
work we've been living in breathing
eclipses for over a year now
selecting the best materials and working
closely with industry leader to refine
every single detail after multiple
design iteration and prototypes we
finally have the solution we've been
looking for now we're back on
Kickstarter the community that helped us
change the way people think about
charging with the clips we're not
launching just another USB hub we're
trying to enhance the way people live
with their tech only you can tell us if
this is worth making are you sick of
cable clutter so are we let's make it a
thing of the past
yeah waking up is never easy
thanks to bixie one move and they can
stop their alarm and that's just the
beginning they can also control all
kinds of connected devices with simple
gestures it's very useful when Alex on
his bike and can't focus on anything but
the road or when Lisa is so busy working
doing stuff that she just can't touch
her devices just like them any time you
want to do many things at the same time
vixie can help it's smart seamless and
easy well easier than cooking apparently
no need to stop doing what you're doing
no need to reach the device you want or
interact with you can even switch from
one function to another or from one
device to another with a simple gesture
told you it was smart
and because pixie is full of surprises
it also lets you control your
environment believe me that's something
you will like
well you know almost everything now so
what are you waiting for
and no one knows a corner I know what
made me hello let me go go
my name is Peter Treadway and I am CTO
and co-founder at Acton Acton is a
company that designs and manufactures
personal transportation we are
introducing a longboard the likes of
which the world has never seen
carbon fiber pressure cast aluminum
extruded aluminum CNC cut we are using
four hub motors all wheel drive people
all wheel drive the one that will get
you up
most of the steepest hills in America
and around the world
but wait there's more if you're looking
for something a little more affordable
we got you we have two more models what
we call the blink s and the blink s -
it's a different construction than the
Quattro it's made of wood but it has
aluminum extrusion along the bottom and
an aluminum plate on top to kind of
sandwich the batteries inside of the
deck so there's actually a hole that
goes clear through it the S 2 version of
this board is a little bit longer than
the s and that's because it has the
extra motor it goes a little faster and
just needs to be a little longer for
more stability
so you get to choose from three boards
you get the cuatro or the blink guess or
the blink s2
now we're releasing three products at
the same time here so of course this is
why we're on IndieGoGo but we have
finished the development on these and we
have of course factory minimums that we
need to meet and that's why we're here
and that's why we need your help help us
out and get yourself onto an active
board and glide uphill into the future
of personal transportation thank you
you
this is the world's first lamp where you
can move the light in any direction to
place it where you really need it it is
much more than just a pendant lamp with
300 powerful LEDs it can illuminate any
part of your room in any brightness you
want and it's colored up light can
create the perfect mood for any
situation with smart lamps from Luke
Roberts you get unlimited lighting
possibilities by simply painting your
light just take out your phone and start
painting the light in the desired
direction the more light you paint the
brighter it gets and you don't have to
worry about the position of your phone
as the app rotates with your movements
the light painted on your phone is
always aligned with your lamp simply
paint and enjoy you can save your
personalized light scenes and switch
between them with a simple swipe the
lamp uses different colored LEDs so you
can choose between warm and cool whites
warm light to relax cool light for tasks
such as reading because it helps you
concentrate when you leave the room it
turns itself off to save your money and
the environment
when you enter the room the lamp uses
presence detection and smart algorithms
to predict which light scene is best
suited creating a new light scene is
easy just pick a color and start
painting your light
once you are satisfied save the setting
as a new light scene with a colored
indirect light you can create the
perfect mood for any situation where you
want a touch of color but the lamp gives
you much more than just beautiful mood

larger rooms for example if you are in a
hurry and looking for your keys get the
perfect light for any situation with
