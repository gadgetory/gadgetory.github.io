you're probably used to the compromises
that it brings
but with new microwave cookware by Maiko
you can instantly improve your meals
with our simple easy to use products
thanks to advanced heat wave technology
these delicious meals and snacks were
created using just a regular microwave
and myko microwavable cookware Marco's
heat wave technology allows you to
utilize your microwave to bake grill fry
and poach we wanted to combine the
simplicity of using a microwave with the
benefits that you get from using that
traditional appliance and this is where
marco comes into its element the three
products in the micro range are each
designed to enable you to cook the
perfect snack perfectly grilled toasted
cheese sandwiches are just as good as
those made in a sandwich maker baked
potatoes crisp on the outside fluffy on
the inside just as if they were oven
baked but cooked in a fraction of the
time in the myko potato baker eggs that
have been delicately poached or
perfectly fried the egg cooker is faster
than cooking in a pan and unlike other
microwavable products delivers delicious
runny yolks every time Maiko is ideal
for busy lifestyles working lunches and
quick tasty snacks and next to no time
and when you finish there's no hassle
the whole thing can go straight in the
dishwasher Maiko was designed by
glasshouse an innovation center of
excellence we discovered this new
technology heat wave technology the next
phase is like how do we apply that to a
product there are many many different
prototypes that we have to create to
refine the design make sure everything
works and also refine the technology so
we get the best heat transfer into the
food firstly we actually utilize the
microwaves to cook the inside potato
really quickly so in around 8 minutes
you've got the inside cut perfect
we then put the lid on top which creates
an of an environment and heat wave
technology in this case absorbs the
microwaves heat up to around 230 degrees
and then creates a really crispy outer
shell and baked potato
I've been working on the micro project
now for twelve months a lot of effort
has been put in by all the guys within
the glass house team we've proven the
principles we've got prototypes that
work and now we can't wait to get these
into eyes by backing this glass house
project on IndieGoGo you can be one of
the first to get your hands on my Co the
new method in your microwave
you
you

the amazing creation begins with the
clash of two very different elements how
is it last created how do we get to see
beautiful rainbows how do you create a
peanut butter and jelly sandwich in our

application that connects two sensors
within the suitcase
these sensors notify you if the suitcase
leaves your presence or was opened out
of eyesight our application will also
allow you to control the LED light
within the suitcase which will assist
you in the dark

hi can I show you something really cool
in this tin is liquid plastic you take
out the tube and you squeeze the tube on
this tin you can make instant liquid
plastic in four seconds this is a honey
like substance there's no solvents in it
only you determine the cure time watch
this one two three four
that's instantly hard plastic my name is
Rob and my business partner dr. Tom
Offerman in Germany invented bondic and
sadly two and a half years ago just
before we're about to press the Go
button on Kickstarter he passed away
suddenly and our priorities completely
changed
fast-forward bondic has become a hit
with the makers in the DIY community the
problem is that with the success of
bondic came all the as seen on TV
industry who in spite of our patents
basically knocked everything off and
instead of making the lawyers boats a
lot bigger we decided not to be the 38
or 39 person on the lawsuit case and
what we've done is to distinguish
ourselves from everybody that's copied
us
I took the beginning of what dr. Tom and
I were working on and finished it off
this is the bondic evo and the
difference is that now the two points in
the right direction and you don't have
to flip it so when it gets low on fluid
there's no waiting for the fluid to come
back also the LED is exactly in the same
spot right by the tip so you can drop
and you can cure and you can drop and
you can cure right away now it's easier
than ever before to change the batteries
you can pick them up at any dollar store
bondic isn't just for makers it's for
everybody's for professionals it's for
hobbyists it's for moms dads kids if
you've got something very expensive it's
made of plastic there's really no better
way to repair it we've been hard at work
and we thought this is the best time to
launch bondic pro with your help we can
determine which variations are best to
take to retail thanks for taking the
time and we appreciate your support
you
I am plumeria the fonder of we our
