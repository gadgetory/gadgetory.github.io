more and more bottled water as they
don't like the taste of tap water and
worry about the potential health impact
this year alone 480 billion bottles will
be consumed in less than 7% of these get
recycled the rest end up in landfills
nature rivers and eventually the oceans
this catastrophic for our environment
and a waste of money for consumers a tap
water we decided there has to be a
better way so we spent three years
researching existing water filtering
technologies and we came up with tap a
revolutionary water filter system for
the kitchen tap last year we launched
the first generation tap one and since
then we've been working hard to come up
with a completely redesigned tap - it
takes only 15 seconds to install and
after this you can forget about carrying
heavy expensive bottles just turn on
your tap and drink healthy great tasting
water anytime you want tap 2 uses the
latest carbon block technology made of
100% coconut shells which removes over
80 contaminants including chlorine
pesticides and heavy metals while
letting the good minerals remain it
connects with your phone to give you
updates on when the cartridges need to
be changed and how much money you've
saved and the environmental impact and
it is the first biodegradable water
filter so once the cartridge is used it
can be composted so no plastic waste
ends up in our nature and oceans during
the development of the first version tap
one we tested over 50 existing filters
and filtering technologies our goal was
to create a much better product we
succeeded and have already shipped over
5,000 filters and helping people in more
than 20 countries
but we knew we could do much better tap
- is our next generation of water
filters it's connected smarter better
filtering and sustainable so we need
your help to achieve our mission we'd
have to to reduce plastic waste by 1
billion bottles by 2020 thank you
