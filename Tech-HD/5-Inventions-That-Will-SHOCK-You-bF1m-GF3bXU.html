daily lives these digital key cards
often provide easy and convenient access
to all of the places that we frequent on
a regular basis our home office parking
structure pool etc but until now there's
been no easy way to copy these devices
leaving you vulnerable to expensive fees
should you lose one and inconveniencing
you when you need to share access with a
spouse friend housekeeper or dog walker
and having a different key card for each
location can be a hassle enter key Z a
small device that fits on your keyring
allowing you to copy up to four RFID
devices the process of copying an RFID
credential onto key Z is simple first
hold down the button you would like to
copy the RFID credential to when the LED
light turns red simply hold key Z over
the key fob or keycard the LED will
blink red while key Z is reading the
device when the process is complete the
LED will turn green to use it simply
press the button near the reader and it
will work just like the original easy
works with the most popular low
frequency RFID devices from many
manufacturers using different protocols
and if you move or no longer need access
to an RFID credential you can simply
reprogram that button to copy another
device and if you need to give access to
anyone it's as easy as holding your key
Z to theirs and holding down the button
the simplicity and convenience moves
with you GZ the RFID duplicator
hey I'm Chris founder of x-squared GoPro
accessories it's clear was born out of
it's a map a simple yet innovative GoPro
accessories all designed around our
mantra accord without limits our team
first revolutionize GoPro games after
2015 are unique and infamous
hydrophobics like this they were simple
and practical and that's what we aim to
replicate yesterday the ex-player
anti-gravity mouth isn't simply in a
decent its surfaces later millions of
Hannah's suction cups that's what makes
what are so excited its reusable it's
super strong it one collector and all
this time amount so small the inside
your wallet so what we asked of you
today is that you choose one of them
rewards and join us on this adventure
not just with this products for the
future products so together we can
create some most innovative and exciting
accessories are familiars ever seen I've
been using brains for around six months
it is so convenient I can't imagine
living without it now the greatest
feature of breeze is the fan on the side
with the filters it can effectively four
through PM 2.5 and these are still feel
nice and easy other than going to work
I'm used to wearing briefs wherever I go
but brace not only in the whole mosque
it's my face perfectly but also I can
adjust the tightness to make it as
comfortable as I want
we are always trying to fight with all
wires in this over in jungle
however pressure expression is a
universal language it's a pity to cover
it
what does it look like when you can take
your plastic water bottle grind it up
and then pour that into the Gigabyte
printhead and print something useful one
of the great projects we're working on
now is the pellet printer it's taking
the Gigabyte platform removing the
standard printhead that traditionally
uses filament and replacing that with a
new printhead that accepts plastic
pellets we think it's a super powerful
tool that will open up new and
high-growth markets around the world and
also bring down the cost so traditional
filament can be a little pricey for
plastic the plastic pellets are an order
of magnitude less in cost and there's a
greater variety of plastic pellets
available in the market at the same time
as we print from pellets we can print a
much larger bead through a larger nozzle
and allow us to create those prints
faster the idea to open into recycled
materials to me that's really cool you
could take your prints that failed grind
them up and have a almost ready to print
object as well as the cost of pellets is
so much cheaper than the cost of
filament it's a lot cheaper on one of
these printers utilizing the technology
that we actually create helps us become
very lean and very efficient in reducing
the design cycle when you run a 3d
printing company you are utilizing the
fastest way to prototype it's amazing
the power of 3d printing to shorten that
prototyping process I've worked in
traditional manufacturing all my life
anytime you come up with a new product
or you want a prototype a new idea the
lead time is terribly long but here we
can go from an idea to a CAD model to a
physical part in our hands that we can
be bolting on in a matter of hours like
in the same day which is unheard of in
the industry as we progressed we started
testing more and more
what needed to change and as we went it
just kind of evolved into what we have
now it took a lot of different shapes I
think we're on revision for now the
pellet printer is a functioning unit and
it's functioning well it's very
promising we've got some beautiful
looking prints on it and the next step
for us will be to take it from a
prototype to a finished product and that
can be quite a chasm to cross a lot of
pellet exteriors you see on the market
now still have a lot of issues we don't
want the experience using pellets to be
any different from music filament except
instead of having to buy roll film that
you have to buy a couple pounds of
pellets and just dump it in we want to
improve the print speed improve the
print quality something that rivals a
traditional filament fed printer even
though we're using a larger nozzle even
though we're using larger layer Heights
the other way we want to move forward is
using new materials right now we've
printed with PLA and pt.2 common
materials used in 3d printing we would
like to see multiple materials run on
the machine characterize the materials
and how they print developing all the
simplified 3d profiles so that a
customer is able to use just a drop-down
box pick their material pick their layer
height and say go we see that just as
the first step the second step would be
to bring in the recycled material that's
really our goal so it's innovations like
this that really keep our e 3d pushing
forward on the technology and delivering
a product that customers not only want
now but they'll have used for in the
future
imagine you're enjoying a quiet evening
at home you go and check your sleeping
baby and suddenly the baby camera turns
towards you someone else is watching
Packers are like burglars always looking
for ways to sneak in as more devices
within our homes connect to the Internet
security is now a major concern for the
everyday consumer unfortunately existing
solutions are too complex too expensive
and insufficient meat firewall er we
take the same cybersecurity technologies
used by large corporations and integrate
them into this small simple to use box
installation couldn't be easier just
plug firewall ax into your router launch
the app and you're done
there's not even a password to remember
powered by artificial intelligence
firewall ax actively identifies and
blocked cyber attacks against your
Internet connected devices for parents
firewall ax means no more unplugging of
routers to manage how kids use the
Internet a simple tap on the app
provides the ability to monitor and
control what kids are doing online on
any device away from home no worries
with a single tap firewall ax encrypts
your data and protects you remotely from
public Wi-Fi hidden dangers you wouldn't
leave your doors unlocked and invite a
burglar inside so why leave your
Internet connected devices
unprotected and hang a welcome sign for
hackers make the right choice and
support us today in building firewall
your family safety and security are
worth it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
