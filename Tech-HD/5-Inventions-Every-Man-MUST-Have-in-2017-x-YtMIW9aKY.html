the last couple of years has really been
about us just becoming obsessed with
understanding where time tracking and
recording fits within the overall space
of someone's workday what we wanted to
do with tiller was make time tracking
much more accessible and immediate to
make time tracking a better experienced
and all of the software based products
before it we really sat down and said if
we were going to start this from scratch
and really look at this problem from
first principles would you come up with
an app or a plugin to solve this or is
this something else that will make this
actually a better experience available
so our idea was what if we combined more
tactile hardware solution with software
tiller is a small USB powered device it
recognizes and something's touching it
and inside it is a bearing that turns
allowing you to turn the dial and switch
between tasks or clients it has a light
in the center of it which indicates to
you whether you're tracking or not
tracking the times we found that the
fact that it's a physical object means
that when you're engaging with it it
brings a sort of a mindfulness and a
deliberateness to the work you're doing
a lot of our process involves users
getting to test the prototype or use the
prototype versions that we have and that
feeds into the process of design and
development a lot of our early work was
fast prototyping versions of the
software and hardware to get everything
right and where it is today we're really
getting into the nitty-gritty of
interaction design when you touch this
thing how does the interface appear on
the computer when you turn it what
happens is it as fast as it need to be
and is it too intrusive or is it to hit
him and these are really small things
that we've had to tweak over and over
again even though til is designed to
work as a standalone product people are
already using lots of different time
tracking solutions in their businesses
so tiller integrates directly with a lot
of the tools that freelancers and small
businesses are accustomed to using
things like harvest and zero technology
when it's done ride should allow you to
do more of the things that you care
about and interested in and spend less
time on the things that don't really
excite you that much
and we've developed this thing for the
last couple of years and be really
pleasing to see you know this scent roll
out to teams and individuals and really
possibly in fact their work we're just
really excited to share tiller with the
whole community
you
in a perfect world every special
occasion will be spent that's special
someone happy Anniversary babe they're
beautiful I miss you so much I wish we
could be together but we know life gets
busy and fitting in time together gets
hard open it now we've made it possible
for you and your loved one to come
together it's perfect
try it on pray now yes
