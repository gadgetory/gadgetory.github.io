before I tell you what Joule is let me
tell you why jewelers like many
lightbulb moments Joule was a spark
ignited by too many repeated frustrating
situations for example how many times
does this happen to you you're at the
airport and maybe just a coffee shop and
you need to charge your laptop but all
the outlets are taken and nobody feels
like sharing what do you do or maybe
you've done something like this because
you're just fed up and tired of digging
behind the mattress or the TV stand or
crawling under your desk simply to plug
something yet well how about this you
take one power strip plug it into
another power strip because it's not
long enough or sometimes you take the
extra length because there's too long
and you have to stuff it behind this
thing or that or one of my personal
favorites how many times have you tried
to plug something in in the dark and you
can't find the power outlet and you
actually sit there and you try to find
the socket with your fingers and it's
not safe what's wrong with this why have
we accepted this as normal or maybe a
better question is why hasn't anyone
done something about it
welcome to the stagnant abyss of the
power outlet market where every one of
us needs them and uses them but nobody
in the right mind gets excited about
them but what if we get fixed up what if
we can make something that fits your
lifestyle and looks great doing it well
we can and we did
welcome to Joule
this is our inspiration we want you for
the first time to look at power outlets
and say to yourself this really
complements my life at home around town
when I travel when I work even when I
play and we would love for you to be a
part of making it all happen we've done
the engineering the prototyping even
over to get Jewel mate so if you're like
us and you get a thrill every time you
see something cool something new and
exciting some piece of gear that makes
you think where has it been all my life
then jump on board and back us here on
IndieGoGo by pre-ordering a jewel bar of
your very own with your support we can
take jewel the rest of the way and make
the whole world is that much cool
you
my name is Osso I moved to Singapore a
few years ago when the rent charging my
map I'm reminded of how bulky and
inflexible the UK type book is compared
to my old us type full of used in Japan
the same problem lies in the EU and a
you type love as well as a minimalist
and designer this is space and
efficiency and an icehole to solve this
problem a star studying clock mechanism
on how to redesign the most efficient
and elegant plug for all types after a
year of relentless prototyping extensive
testing with my engineers overcoming
extreme technical challenges while
keeping the final practice simple and
elegant
we have finally conquered the structural
issues successfully created foldable UK
even au plugs this is the total traveler
with our foldable structure the poke
space is reduced by more than 60% at the
same time it solves the every lasting
problem of pork storage - Taylor - a
better trucking experience for everyone
and not just Mac users we have designed
a cochlea charger a modular design
charger the asepsis different plug types
from the tofu traveler it becomes the
universal travel adapter with USB fast
charge for your phone and tablets
simultaneously also for your laptop and
other AC charging devices the tiny size
of Turku minimizes the leverage from the
wall to prevent inconsistent contact
with the socket the total charger is
more than just a USB charger as powerful
and adaptable to the special fuse list
design guarantees charging safety for
Kickstarter backers we have designed a
portable carry case for you to start
both the tofu charger in the tofu
traveler and for your traveling and
daily convenience we have designed a
rechargeable mini LED torch light that
fits perfectly in both turkeys
we need your support when you cook
you're like right these are available
odds
life is busy
and sometimes our best friends are the
ones that feel it the most
but how can you be there for them when
you just can't
introducing and house pet companion
