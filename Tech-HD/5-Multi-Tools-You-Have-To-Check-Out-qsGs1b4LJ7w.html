distances and the dimensions of
different objects but a measuring tape
doesn't work in every situation
why isn't there a single tool that lets
us measure everything now there is
introducing bagel the smart tape measure
bagel lets you measure just about
anything at home and at work
bagel has three different modes string
mode wheel mode and remote mode string
mode is great for measuring straight
lines curves and around corners wheel
mode lets you measure irregular or odd
shaped objects and it also makes taking
measurements with one hand much easier
remote mode lets you measure objects
that are far away and out of your reach
after you're done measuring you'll need
a way to record your measurements using
pen and paper can be a real hassle with
bagel you can quickly and easily save
your measurements with voice
descriptions just take your measurement
push the Save button and then tag a
voice memo to it dog the future ADA when
you're done bangle will send your
measurements to bagels mobile app via
Bluetooth this mobile application lets
you review your saved measurements and
share them with your friends bagel is
precise it uses our patented technology
to make sure you always get an accurate
measurement also bagel has an
easy-to-read digital display that's
viewable in most lighting conditions in
the past few years also measuring
devices have become smarter and made our
lives easier it's math skills smart
thermometers and even smart watches but
when it comes to measuring size we still
use a Cape measure which is more than a
century old
why don't you innovate the way we
measure size so we created bagel and
smart a measure we put a lot of effort
into creating a goal our team worked
night and day to make the best quality
product with this friendly design
we have our final prototype that is
ready for mass production now we need
your help to deliver this amazing
product to everyone please help us bring
this bagel to life
thank you
size matters Peggy
we decided to design an multi-tool that
combines all of our favorite features
into an ultra low-profile tool that we
called a titanium pocket this new tool
is made from aerospace grade 5 titanium
alloy
despite its minimal name and appearance
this new pocket tool is extremely
versatile and lets us do more and
careless

hey I'm Nate bar creator of the pocket
monkey here today to tell you about my
latest creation wild card the pocket
knife needs to evolve it's an essential
tool but it's bulky it's one more thing
to remember in the morning and it easily
falls out of your pocket and is lost I
wanted something better
I asked why not put a pocket knife in my
wallet it'd be easier to carry and
harder to lose so I set out to design a
knife that'd be as thin as possible and
the result is wild coming it's only two
millimeters thick
only slightly thicker than a credit card
I was able to do this by reimagining the
blade pivot most knives have a pin
pressed through a hole wildcard has a
pivot unlike anything in the world I
call it fly off technology the three
wings of the pivot allow the knife blade
to remain rigid to the body a necessity
when wielding a sharp tool for safety I
designed the blade to lock open and to
lock closed the blade tucks neatly under
two blade guards and it angles only on
one side so users can't accidentally cut
themselves when carrying a closed knife
and here's the best part about this
design the blade is detachable I
designed this with the forgetful
traveler in mind when you go through TSA
with your traditional knife on you you
lose your knife but with wild card you
only lose your blade and on our website
you can replace it for only a few
dollars with pocket monkey
I used a monkey to represent the
personality of the tool with wild card I
kept that trend going wild card as a
wolf cut out that doubles as a bottle of
them the wolf embodies the nature of the
tool agile yet powerful I wanted to pack
as much functionality as possible into
wild card
many people misuse knives in place of
other tools like screwdrivers and pry
bars harming themselves or break into
nine so I added these tools to the night
I always wanted to challenge convention
because of that I spent the last six
months trying to reinvent how this
product is manufactured every
manufacturer I talked with was hesitant
to produce such an aggressive design the
solution I kept hearing was take this to
China but that isn't something I'm
willing to do I want to create products
that embody the American spirit of
innovation in my solution was to create
a manufacturing facility
in Maine now we control every aspect of
production from laser cutting to
packaging and shipping so we can
manufacture the highest-quality product
while creating jobs in our community
help us make wild card a reality and
help us continue the American spirit of
innovation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
