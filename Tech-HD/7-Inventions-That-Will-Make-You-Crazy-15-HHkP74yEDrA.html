manufacturing but when it comes to
making durable things in your own shop
there's still no easy way to cut hard
materials as makers and engineers we
need to work with all materials so we've
built a machine that could the first
desktop water jet laser works by
combining abrasive particles with the
high-pressure water stream the mixture
exits the nozzle and cuts through the
workpiece it's great for any workshop it
cuts every material it's compact and
contains and it's digital so you can
make precise cuts that are impossible to
make any other way
as an industrial designer I've used a
variety of desktop fabrication tools but
they tend to be very limited by the
durability of the materials you can use
on those machines but it's desktop water
jet we can go from design to component
to fitting that component and testing
within couple of hours that's an
incredibly powerful tool as a jeweler
and an artist with the work I make I
spend a lot of time hand cutting so
right now I'm selling pieces sort of as
almost limited edition because I can't
physically output them not because I
want to be making in a limited edition
waser would allow me to not only make a
lot more but also to lower the price
point so they'd be available to a
broader audience I think you know people
tend to have their ideas constrained by
their tools and the things they're
capable of working with and having a
water jet cutter which has the ability
to cut a broader range of materials hard
materials like steel and glass will be
enabling and make them think in
different ways and have them build
different things they couldn't build
before the future of manufacturing is in
custom local fabrication people will be
able to make things in our own workshop
that they can use every single day and
will last a lifetime as mechanical
electrical and manufacturing engineers
we design products manufactured
components and set up assembly lines in
the past now we're preparing for
production but we need enough orders to
produce the machines cost-effectively
we've created a unique desktop tool and
we're really looking forward to all the
amazing things that people create with
her
you
meet toaster riod a new kind of toaster
that brings family and friends closer
together when was the last time you were
this excited for breakfast probably when
you were her age or probably never look
at those smiles has your breakfast ever
been so enjoyable with toaster Boyd she
can design anything she wants on her
toast while you're stuck with the same
old boring piece of block her mornings
look magical while she waits an
excitement for that golden-brown crunch
so how do we do it inside toaster or
innovative and minimal design the smart
toasting system is powered by
microfilament heating technology but it
can do so much more
let your toasts speak your mind with a
smiley face or lights send a message to
that special someone for a surprise a
superhero toast might be exactly what
you need to power through the day each
pop of toast is a surprise there's
excitement in every pop take a look at
Tom we can toast the latest weather
forecasts and other useful information
anywhere in the world whether he's in
London or Tokyo or anywhere in between
toaster Oh at him covered so he's ready
for the day's challenges
what is more exhilarating than a morning
message from your loved ones how about a
toast itch secret messages that are only
readable on toast so the secret stays
with you forever it's the perfect way to
stay connected with your loved ones
wherever they may be this is the
beginning of the toaster Royd journey
unique creative and interactive help us
kick start your mornings with toaster
wait
you
you
I'm excited to introduce to you one of
the most innovative products in the
world of watersports in a long time the
big speed jet the big speed jet is a
mini water propulsion device designed to
attach to virtually anything you want to
motorized in water attach it to your
kayak can attach to your stand-up
paddleboard and if that wasn't enough
we've developed a submersible battery
pack that you can attach to your big
speech head and at about 5 pounds you
now have the world's first and only
portable diver propulsion vehicle this
is going to change the way we interact
with our water sports
the possibilities are endless
you can mobilize virtually anything the
big speech it can push a kayak up to
about seven miles an hour you can go a
lot further
you can fight current to fight win you
can explore places that you weren't able
to before we've built in dozens of
features to make this a truly versatile
and modular product most importantly we
wanted to make sure you can use your
existing watercraft
there is no need for you to purchase a
new kayak or new stand-up paddleboard
we've spent the past 18 months working
on this amazing product we've sourced
all the parts we've tested them in every
body of water you can imagine we've been
to 11 major iterations of the Bixby jet
and at every turn you've improved it
you've made it better we've made it more
efficient and now it's ready for you
with your support we can produce 500
units which is the minimum we need to
make the big skis affordable support our
Kickstarter campaign and help us bring
this amazing product to life thank you
and see you on the water
you
hi I'm dr. diva Tomei and this is Lucy
the flagship member of our Salonika
family say hi Lucy at Salonika we
believe that if the sun is shining we
should never have to turn the lights on
day lighting is the illumination of
indoor spaces with natural light and we
want to invite you to join the day
lighting revolution
Lucy lights up your home or office with
sunshine the first ever of her kind
she is solar powered portable and
italian-designed
this is how Lucy works place Lucy in a
sunny spot indoors or outdoors point her
towards the area you want to illuminate
and turn her on
Lucy will do the rest she will find and
track the Sun for you and redirect that
sunlight back inside turn off the lights
and turn on Lucy Lucy is also urged
conscious powered by solar cells she
never needs to be plugged in and think
of how much you can save by turning off
the lights for half of your day last but
not least Lucy has been built to be
beautiful Italian designed through and
through
Lucy will never look out of place in
your home or office
besides the magic of day lighting made
simple what else makes Lucy special in
one word sunshine Wow whoa this is an
entirely different room right now I
completely changed the actual house
itself I can read you can actually see
the colour of that wall which she
couldn't do before in contact with
nature because it's the light of the Sun
Lucy is no longer just an idea born from
the dark corners of my office at
Cambridge our engineering team has
already gone through multiple designs of
Lucy and we have a fully working
prototype the one that you see in this
video we have also started testing Lucy
in the field with our beta tester
community and Telemachus head of
manufacturing is already hard at work
with a top three mass manufacturer to
bring Lucy to
market that's why we've come to
IndieGoGo we're so excited about
bringing Lucy and all the benefits of
the sunshine she provides in indoor
spaces everywhere we really hope that
you will love Lucy as much as we do and
want to join the day lighting revolution

in a world where we are constantly on
the go fueled by the caffeine we drink
why are we still wasting time in line
and settling for substandard coffee we
asked why not make coffee portable where
you could brew a delicious cup in the
palm of your hand so we did just that
this is the jolt a portable coffee
brewer that can brew anytime anywhere we
have developed the most compact and
efficient design possible pushing the
limits of current battery and heating
element technologies in addition to
convenience taste is paramount we've
modeled our device after the traditional
French press brewing for a truly
delicious cup of coffee so how does it
work
simply fill with water and within
minutes it will reach the perfect
brewing temperature load the coffee pod
with your own coffee grounds or use our
biodegradable packets wait for the green
light and your coffee is ready to drink
as a mechanical engineer with a
background in electromechanical
packaging heat transfer I've had the
opportunity to transform our concept
into a functioning prototype
incorporating feedback from friends
family and coffee lovers into every
iteration over the last three years
unlike other portable Brewers our
product utilizes the latest technology
to reach the proper correct temperature
of 200 degrees Fahrenheit so you can
brew anytime anywhere we pride ourselves
and not only our speed but also our
ability to deliver a quality great
tasting cup of coffee but the coffee pod
was equally important to us as the
device itself it's estimated that over
nine billion curing k-cups end up in
landfills every year but the jolt is
different
we've developed a biodegradable coffee
pot that brews great coffee and leaves
no impact on the environment leveraging
our team's background in mechanical and
electrical engineering we've solved some
immense challenges and after three years
of development we're finally ready to
share our product
we've come to IndieGoGo after perfecting
our technology and partnering with a
great manufacturer our goal is to raise
enough funds to meet our manufacturer's
minimum order quantity and that's where
we need your help so please join us
today and help make portable brewing
Korea
you
the most germs infested objects in your
home are your towels as we reuse them
they retain moisture allowing bacteria
to breed why not use paper towels
according to the Rainforest Action
Network that's not exactly the best
alternative how about these wait that
wouldn't work in my home unless stop
using bacteria-infested raves and help
save the environment introducing home
drug have you ever wondered why you've
never seen a hand dryer in someone's
home maybe you thought about this or
maybe it never crossed your mind a group
of people from different backgrounds
such as business design sales and
chemistry
got together to build perfect home and
dryer we've all seen them before in
public restrooms but they're bulky
they're loud and very expensive it took
dozens of concepts and prototypes
hundreds of experimental simulations
thousands of hours of craftsmanship and
an infinite amount of patience to bring
you home driving a cordless beautifully
designed compact an affordable bathroom
and kitchen home and dry
home dry is not only environmentally
friendly it has a built-in patented blue
UV light to kill bacteria that even soap
can't get to hands-free with a
rechargeable battery and wall mountable
hone dry will change your everyday life
at home home dries industrial motor
pumps out heated HEPA filtered air
at two times the speed than a
traditional hand dryer
thus we bring you an industrial products
small enough for your home that dries
your hands and 14 seconds home dries
rechargeable battery less 1920 sessions
and on the average 480 days the
removable base doubles as an extra
battery and charging port an LED battery
indicator shows you when battery needs
to be charged when mounted on the wall
simply plug in and use while charging or
remove the battery and charge separately
we are so confident about what we have
created and are excited to bring home
drive market please help us reach our
goal so we can afford to produce home
drive at an affordable price for
everyone
