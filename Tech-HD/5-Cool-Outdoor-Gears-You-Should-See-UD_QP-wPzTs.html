think adventures should be enjoyed until
the very last bite
meals are an essential part of being in
the outdoors and to us the sports on the
market have never quite measured so we
decided to create one that does
introducing morsel a versatile utensil
for cooking eating and clearing a tool
designed to rethink the way we eat on
the go
morsel has a unique rubber edge that
allows you to easily scrape every last
bit of food the ergonomic asymmetrical
shape its plates pots bags and bowls all
shapes and sizes the extended length is
perfect for digging deep without getting
your hands dirty more so also features a
full sized 4
and a safe cutting edge for slicing
through tough foods
we've spent last year designing
prototyping and testing
the result is the best camping utensil
we've ever used
if you've been hungry for a better
utensil your search is over
morsel for every last bite
you
it can happen anytime you desperately
need a fire but don't have matches or a
lighter be prepared with the emergency
fire starter from Zippo outdoor it comes
in a lightweight waterproof case in fact
it floats just Freyja tinder stick spark
it with the flint wheel and light your
fire the Zippo emergency fire starter
features a waterproof case with a flip
top lid
it holds four water-resistant
replaceable wax
Tindersticks the genuine Zippo Flint
wheel is unidirectional it only sparks
in one direction so that it throws an
increased amount of spark reliably time
after time the Flint wheel can be turned
for right or left-handed use the
emergency fire starter for warmth for
signaling for peace of mind
fishings more than a hobby for me it's
in my blood some of the best memories I
have are me and my grandfather fishing
in our favorite fishing hole all day
long trying to catch that big one now
it's me taking my daughters out trying
to give them that same experience
sometimes it doesn't matter if you catch
anything or not just being with friends
and family is all that matters
don't get me wrong like all fishermen I
love the adrenaline rush when your rod
bends and you hook up with that big one
there's nothing like it as much as I
love fishing there's one thing I can't
stand and that's cutting fish in line
the funny thing is no matter what type
of fishing you're doing you're always
gonna be cutting fishing line it seems
like your knife or Clippers are never
around or worse they're dull and rusty
or you try to cut the line with your
teeth and your hands are all smelly and
nasty with fish bait and worm dirt I
knew there had to be a better way to cut
fishing line and there is the solution I
created is so simple yet so elegant and
so easy to use
it will become one of the most valuable
assets and any fisherman's tackle box
the line cutters ring is lightweight and
adjustable the attached adjustable strap
is comfortable for any size finger strap
it on and just like that the fishing
line is cut no fumbling around no rusty
or dull knives just a clean precise cut
literally at your fingertips the line
cutters ring is precisely made with
stainless steel blades carefully
positioned and an ABS plastic to provide
ease of use with the safest results
possible the ring is sturdy and cuts
over a hundred pound braided and
monofilament fishing line like butter I
do all kinds of fishing from kayak
fishing bass fishing surf fishing
tonight fishing regardless of the
situation carrying a knife is always a
potential hazard Clippers aren't much
better they rust out they dull quickly
and it seems like you can never find
them kayak fishing is one of the
fastest-growing segments in the fishing
industry and it's easy to see why but
bringing your equipment on a kayak is
tricky I'm always looking for ways to
minimize my gear and
fumbling around for a knife or clippers
is inefficient and frustrating and night
fishing forget about it if you're lucky
enough to find your knife or clippers in
the dark you've got to try and figure
out a way to juggle everything with a
flashlight what a mess
the response for the line cutters ring
has been phenomenal
everyone I've shown it to everybody
that's seen it from fishing tackle shops
to people I fish with the response has
been the same they all walk today at
CRKT we are taking a look at the Nyad
folding climbing knife designed by man
named Hans fluorine now Hans is the
world record speed climber for a route
in Yosemite called the nose he climbed
it in two hours 23 minutes that's 2900
vertical feet here's a guy who knows how
to climb well and he knows how to design
a knife that's gonna get you there
the Nyad designed specifically as a
climbing knife it weighs point six
ounces the overall length on it is right
at four inches the blade length is one
and a half inches you can see it's got
vet flat top serrations there a tanto
tip the handle is titanium 6ao 4v
titanium it's got a frame lock on there
so to close the knife just take your
thumb push over and it closes just like
that good strong detent now this blade
also sits flush right against that
titanium so it's not gonna cut you when
it's closed
another feature there too is it has this
carabiner loop right here carabiner hole
you just take a carabiner and clip that
right on there and then this knife will
not open until you pull that carabiner
off here's a shot of it on a harness to
give you an idea of how it rides there
then you can just pull the carabiner off
and you're ready to rock and roll it
also has a lanyard loop right there
so you can hook your keys on it you
could also hook a leash on there I'm
gonna show you a size comparison next to
a house key just to give you an idea of
how small this knife really is
definitely a lightweight tool that's
going to work extremely well for cutting
nylon rope webbing that sort of thing
climbing rope it's kind of an emergency
tool definitely in that category of
tools
you can see it in my hand right there
not a ton of real estate definitely got
to keep that in mind there's an index
finger choil right there and you can see
that knife called the Nyad very cool
design by mr. Hans flooring world record
speed climber thanks for watching and
thanks for carrying CRKT</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
