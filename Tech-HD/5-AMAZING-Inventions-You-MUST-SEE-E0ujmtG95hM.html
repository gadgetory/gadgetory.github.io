this predator is the Sox worst enemy the
washing machine eats one-and-a-half
socks a month the Sox are a peculiar
species they mate for life but somehow
always get separated some hide away in a
bath some end up in a drawer some a
merely thrown away by humans introducing
the Saracens
and extraordinary species of socks they
live in packs of seven single socks
designed to mix and nudge due to their
incredible innovation they do not need
to be paired nor wasted they're native
to the urban jungle of Copenhagen
Denmark and originated from Europe they
are made of the highest quality organic
combed cotton so not only do they live
long they are also remark
last year solo socks were successfully
funded on Kickstarter now they have
evolved with more styles and better
quality exclusively for the Kickstarter
community their designs are unique and
for everyone funky classic even
invisible they have no limitations being
an invasive species seller socks
migrates to all continents in world
right before Christmas similar socks
truly are an extraordinary species sir
no socks no pairs
just since Netflix oh you want to check
Hulu sometimes I'm searching for things
longer but I'm actually watching stuff
it's a lot of like you know going down
finding the right place that was a very
hard process in trying to find this
watched broad cities season 2 episode 2
the TV's just turned on watch The
Walking Dead don't watch my scary watch
ABC watch CNN watch Vanderpump rules
watch best friends whenever it is wow
that was quick hi I'm John Hammond CEO
of Ella Comp in 2015 we announced on
Kickstarter a new product called power
pod a cycling power meter that's simple
portable accurate and affordable
thanks to your Kickstarter global
support three years later we've shipped
over 10,000 power pods to cyclists
worldwide and today I'm very excited to
announce a new product called aero pod
aero pod incorporates the latest
generation of digital sensors it also
includes a brand new wind port pitot
tube design and all of it is wrapped up
in a beautifully sleep case design so
arrow pod is a great power meter but
more than that when you use it with a
direct force power meter it also becomes
an aerodynamic CDA system instead of
spending thousands of dollars to travel
to a wind tunnel or velodrome to get
aerodynamic data attached aero pod to
your bicycle pair it to your direct
force power meter and then get out on
your roads and ride while you're on the
road you'll see power data but you'll
also see CDA hillslope wind speed
elevation and more in fact aero pod
includes a measurement called time
advantage time advantage turns your
aerodynamic sleekness into a number that
tells you how much time you
gaining or losing due to changes in your
ID position if you're a time trial is it
is a fantastic way to make sure that
you're staying on pace while you're
riding a rope I will show its data in
one of three different ways the new
every site Raptor glasses display your
Aero pod data in a head-up display in
your field of vision you'll see power
CDA time advantage without ever having
to look down at a bike computer and that
means you can focus all of your energy
maintaining your most Aero position for
Garmin owners we have a new app if you
have a connect IQ compatible Garmin
device our app will show Aero pod data
right on your Garmin screen and if you
have a Bluetooth low-energy smartphone
the powerhouse app from Bella comm will
show your Aero pod data Aero pod also
includes our power stroke method of
measuring pedal stroke efficiency and
economy in short aero pod is the best
power meter that we have ever made and
with Kickstarter support you can have it
on your bike for the 2018 cycling season
look at how well these lifting straps
work for carrying furniture appliances
and mattresses dollies can damage floors
hand trucks beat up stairs and don't
touch mattresses get ruined
you can pick items up by hand but you
have to bend down these adjustable
straps carry items inches off the floor
to avoid lifting high dollies get stuck
in thresholds these straps lift right
over door sills and not only do they
encourage proper lifting techniques but
they also employ leverage making the
pieces you carry feel lighter medically
speaking I would use the floor I'm
forklift because I think it's a safe
device I would prefer my husband to lift
furnishings with the floor on forklift
instead of by hand because
want him to protect his back when we
were moving in we had this huge
entertainment center we had it down the
stairs and in the truck in no time each
order comes with two straps instructions
in these grip gloves they're super
durable here's how easy it is to use
these adjustable lifting straps put the
straps underneath the item that you're
about to carry cross them bend with your
knees insert your arms into the desired
strap loops
place your hands flat in front of you
keep your back straight and lift I love
the fact that I can use my form
forklifts to move furniture around to
steam clean my carpets in areas that I
haven't got into your forearms are a
fulcrum of support these adjustable
straps use that fulcrum to your full
lifting advantage in fact your forearms
safely support much more weight than
your fingers which leaves your
hands-free to stabilize and maneuver the
load as a builder moving things like
bathtubs or drywall I can't think of
anything that would be easier and more
convenient to use and I think it lasts a
long time order now and we'll include
this extension for free it allows you to
add three and a half feet to your pair
so that you can even carry furnishings
as big as this over one-million patented
forum forklift lifting straps have been
sold for as much as $40</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
