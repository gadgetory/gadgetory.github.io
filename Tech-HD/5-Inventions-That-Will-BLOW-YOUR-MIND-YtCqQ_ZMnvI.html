in a bit so you might not been able to
hear that but using Ori I was able to
have a call and that's because Ori is a
voice assistant ring that turns your
finger into a smart phone all through
just a touch of the ear but why that's
because the way in which we're using our
devices is changing changing from a
world where we use screens and touch to
one where we talk now Ori uses a bone
conduction and bone conduction has been
used in many medical grade devices we
package it in a way that ascends by
brush Tunes through your finger directly
into years so only you can hear and that
allows you to hear and talk to just your
finger hey man that's music thanks to
bone conduction and the dual noise
cancelling microphone you can hear and
talk even and loud places
so check this out Oren is perfectly
private and discreet using it makes it
feel just like a secret information
Inori is more than just a neat gadget
for taking and making calls because
behind it is powerful voice artificial
intelligence our friend Siri and Google
assistant it puts them exactly where you
need them think about all the different
things that you can do and one of my
favorite translation all we have to do
is just motion upwards and you say
already how do I say where are the
burritos in Spanish understand lost
burritos and just like burritos come in
different flavors Ori comes in three
different colors I guarantee you there's
an Ori ring for every outfit and every
occasion and even better Ori is splash
proof too
look guys I know how popular you are and
that's why you have the Ori app because
it helps you filter out everything else
and there's four LED lights that tell
you what kind of messages are coming
through come on let's hit the streets to
see what people think of all really
thousands of people have tried Ori and
we're finally ready to start making and
sharing the origin room with the rest of
the world and with everything that's
happened I can't help but think of our
inspiration my dad
he also happens to be visually impaired
Ori doesn't just help the visually
impaired access something that had
difficulty before smartphones but in
turn they have inspired us to use our
devices in new natural screen freeways I
really want our venture in darkness to
power the screen free revolution thanks
