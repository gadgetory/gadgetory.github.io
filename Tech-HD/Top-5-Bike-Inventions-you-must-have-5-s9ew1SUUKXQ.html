bike travel point to 50 miles on a
single charge at all when you want said
back when you don't kill no sweat
it's 500 watts of power available at the
press of a lever easy to install and
intuitive to operate designed in
Cambridge Massachusetts and built in New
England
two years ago is watching Tron thinking
about all that empty space inside the
orbital wheel really kept me up at night
why don't we put a motor where we put a
battery in that spin I managed to make a
mini prototype but I basically have two
left thumb and a limited knowledge of
engineering 18 months ago I was working
as a propulsion development engineer at
SpaceX when I met Mike and saw the Geo
orbital wheel prototype I loved the
concept and one of the help make it a
reality
since then we've created five
generations of prototypes given hundreds
of test rides and logged thousands of
miles from all that user feedback we've
integrated all sorts of features into
the wheel installation takes only 60
seconds and requires no tools the
battery is easily removable even the
tire is a made of high-density foam they
ride just like a normal tire but they'll
never go flat the motor will take you
zero to 20 miles an hour in six seconds
the feature set goes on and on we've
only just got rolling many years I work
driven and rode at ridiculous first at
Ford and then by bike store involved and
I first saw the gerbil wheel I was
hooked we've got this advanced design
sleek an iminium frame and simple
operation
you just pump on the wheel clip on the
throttle and go it's Bradley brilliant
wouldn't it be great you could use your
bike whenever you want it to without
sweating all the engineering is done
another great product that a great team
but we need your help we really want to
keep these built in the United States
but we need to order a batch large
enough to keep the cost up please
support our project in any way that you
can

founding team have been looking for an
effortless way to get door-to-door
without breaking a sweat
being avid cyclists we saw that the only
way to introduce it accessible high
quality and great looking electric bike
into the world was to build it ourselves
by using premium parts and fitting the
battery into the frame we've come up
with a great-looking and lightweight
commuter bike that's tons of fun to ride
with all of our bikes are hand assembled
in Europe and thanks to an already
established supply chain they will be
delivered on time
blaze began right here on Kickstarter
three years ago back then we launched
what is now the world-famous laser light
the safest bike light on the road now
not only shipping to 52 countries but
our innovative tech has recently been
built into a trial of santander cycles
here in London it's been an incredible
journey thank you to our amazing
community they're getting us this far
our backers are a huge part of our
culture providing critical feedback and
becoming real friends at the blaze team
so we're coming back to you here with
the first look at our very next product
the burner with the same obsessive
attention to detail the result of three
years development we worked really hard
to make you something as simple and
elegant as riding your bike we started
with performance and safety we wanted
the best light output for the best
all-round visibility it is so bright an
impressive 100 lumen providing an
unmatched spread of red light ensuring
you'll be seen from every angle not from
one retina searing LEDs lining the guy
in your back wheel but from a bank of 27
the bracket is a thing of beauty
it allows fair adjustment as a highly
localized magnetic attachment providing
heroic hold for the most adventurous
rider yet easy removal snap in snap out
either horizontal or vertical without
even looking keeping things simple it's
got a light sensor rising either manual
or auto the light comes on as soon as it
gets dark I'm gonna stop and faff or
wonder if your back light is on the
light has many more subtle features it
is fully waterproof ip7 certified which
means it can get really really wet it
has a simple magnetic USB charge but the
same kick-ass battery that will last a
month under normal use we know what
we're doing this time it's been a lot to
learn so we now have our suppliers
manufacturing form
and support three years ago there was
any service and there's now a few more
we believe we thought of everything with
this light get obsessed to keep things
simple
it's a no-fuss beautifully elegant
backlight for every cyclist everywhere
in these lights they can trust their
essential but good lights are
immeasurably safer than lousy ones we've
come back onto Kickstarter to give our
community the first look at our next
product to receive it a lower price than
retail and critically to feedback into
its final product features we're on a
mission to get the very best lights on
bikes everywhere to make more people
safe to get more people cycling come
join our ride laser trail
you
and no key we thought the lock industry
could use a little shaking up so we
created the no keypad lock the world's
first smart padlock no key is won
numerous awards and has been recognized
as a game-changing innovation however
some people need an extra level of
protection so we created the no key you
lock
incorporating all the cutting-edge
technology used in the original Nokia
into a practically indestructible
hardened steel body
the Nokia lock will protect your bicycle
or motorbike in the toughest
environments while also giving you easy
access using only your smartphone
available with an app for iOS Android
and Windows phones the Nokia lock uses
wireless Bluetooth technology when
clicked it automatically looks for a
phone with a compatible key and unlocks
you don't even need to remove your phone
from your pocket or purse just click and
go no more worrying about lost keys or
forgotten combinations sharing your bike
with others is easy with just a couple
taps you can quickly and securely share
your bike with your friends even better
you can revoke access automatically
without needing to track down keys the
no key you lock incorporates a long-life
rechargeable battery that will last
several years between charges but we
wanted the no key ulong to do even more
so we added an alarm after locking no
key hold down the button to arm the
alarm function if someone tampers with
your no key for more than three seconds
a loud alarm will shriek for 30 seconds
drawing attention and likely scaring off
the intruder the alarm function resets
every time you open no key the history
function in the app shows you who when
and where no key was used what if your
phone dies or is lost not a problem
just key in your custom quick click code
this ensures that you'll never be left
stranded in the unlikely event that you
ignore the warning in the app and let
your battery die you can always give
Nokia a jump start with an external
battery finally maybe you don't have a
smartphone or prefer to bike without it
we've got you covered just add the
optional key fob to your order and
you'll be able to access no key with or
without your smartphone
nokey no problem
do you remember the first time you rode
a bike the places you would go on your
new wheels the fast-forward a few years
and somewhere between your first date
traffic jams and global warming bikes
just don't feel the same anymore
this is flux electric bike we started
plugs because we found one of the
ultimate joys of our childhood at times
just felt like a grind
we're on a mission to put the fun back
into cycling and more happy riders onto
cycles
flux is simple just turn it on and go in
pedal assist mode flux is exactly like
riding a normal bike just easier and
faster don't want to pedal you don't
have to to push the throttle and you'll
speed through the city with no effort at
all the location of the motor is a key
factor in making this bike so special
unlike most electric bikes in the market
which other motor in the hub ours is
located in between the pedals this takes
mechanical advantage of the bike Shimano
mind speed gears meaning you can climb
Hills easier and hit top speeds quicker
couple this efficient drivetrain with an
industry crushing 17 amp hour lithium
battery and you can flux for 46 miles on
full power the battery has a key lock
for security and can be removed in a
second take it with you and recharge
wherever you want it even features a USB
port so you can charge all of your
devices on the go behind us in advanced
technology and elegant design flux bikes
of your wheels for the modern world
giving you the power to zip past traffic
explore further and climb higher than
ever before we put these bikes through
their paces on the most challenging
courses we could find their battle
tested and designed to take a beating
stay in control with powerful hydraulic
disc brakes and stunt or suspension when
you get to the bottom you can just power
back up in record time ready to go again
and again
we've got three exciting models ready
for production we need your help to
build critical mass and bring the cost
of production down with your backing and
our expertise we're going to bring you a
bike that will change the way you think
about riding forever so stop wasting
