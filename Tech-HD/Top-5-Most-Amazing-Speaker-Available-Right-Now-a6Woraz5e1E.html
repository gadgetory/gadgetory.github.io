music and so do we
that's why we want to make it easy for
people to come you sit at home no matter
where you store your music today this
speaker will make it a really great
sound quality and it's wireless while
creating something this new and
visionary it has taken us on journey all
around the world we have been asking the
best people in the industry to create
prototypes that we can evaluate
production and audio experience but we
also evaluated things like labor rights
and environmental management we learned
so much during this journey but the most
important thing is that we now have a
solid confidence that we can deliver a
great product we decided to make a
speaker that in a way will last forever
the owner of this product will not just
have to throw it away if one part
becomes out there with grapes on the
speaker that part can just be replaced
and of course recycled
thanks to the modularity of the speaker
you can receive it in two different
works first one you receive it
unassembled without glass in a very
small flat package and this is great
because you will bring down the
environmental impact from shipping you
then assemble it at home with glass that
you bought somewhere that is closer to
where you live if you prefer to receive
a fully assembled that is also possible
whatever suits your needs we believe big
change always starts with a small group
of very passionate people if you choose
to support this cause not only will you
receive a great product you will also be
part of creating the next generation of
home photonics
