waterproof housing and a heap of diving
equipment to get into the water but with
no vadik's Mito underwater scenes reveal
themselves at a click of a button so
here comes Nevada ex Mito an underwater
ROV that provides professional level

improve my teaching experiences a lot I
can use it to watch to my students
better and provide my feedback to them
using the latest stabilization algorithm

strong current or surge and if for any
reason it slips out of position Nevada
ex Mito will instantly correct itself
