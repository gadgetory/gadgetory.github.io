at the beauty of the ocean and bringing
back memories of our underwater
adventures if you are like us you know
how cool it is to share your diving
experiences with people on land you also
know how filming gets in the way of
simply enjoying the moments which is why
we dive in the first place that's why a

an autonomous underwater drone that's
follows you during your dies lets you
capture beautiful footage hands-free so
you can focus on the diving now I will
always in pass of becoming a reality

localization technology it enables
ibubble

your surroundings in the frame now you

carefully designed camera movements all
you have to do is choose your shot from

wonder how I bubble performs when you
have let's say a specific close-up to
shoot good question you just call I

button for a few seconds and ibubble
will recognize the shape it needs to
follow release it and watch as it glides
