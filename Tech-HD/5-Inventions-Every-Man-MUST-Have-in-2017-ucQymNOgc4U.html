elio is an ultra efficient source of
light and power it's a solar lamp in a
power bank based on two simple ideas
it's really useful on adventures but for
the people who need it most
they can use it every day Pet makers for
good we believe that everyone should
have access to safe light and power so a
hundred percent of our profits go to
providing it for people with limited
access to electricity there are a
billion people worldwide who burn
candles kerosene or wood for heat and
light these fuels are expensive
dangerous unhealthy and make it almost
impossible for children to study and
achieve their full potential we can use
the sun's power to bring light and power
to homes without reliable energy sources
solar power is less costly than
combustible fuels it's more healthy it's
safer and it improves educational
outcomes our nonprofit partners provide
solar light and energy through a variety
of solar solutions to those in need
these nonprofit partners together with
you and helio can help bring safe light
and power right where it's needed most
