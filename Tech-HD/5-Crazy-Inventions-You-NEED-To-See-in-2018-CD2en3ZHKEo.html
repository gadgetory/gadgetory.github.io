to fly not only through the invention of
planes balloons then rockets but
figuratively through philosophy poetry
and art
so we wondered how could we get off the
ground in both a metaphorical in a
literal way
first was the idea to create an electric
bike that would be characterized by
unique and beautiful form
Oh inspiration dates back to the most
amazing times of motorisation full bloom
the first glance brings to mind the past
days of the thirties and forties and
those times things were designed to be
beautiful functional and everlasting
avionics v1 is a raw Spartan piece of
equipment its main task is to bring joy
the one has a rich set easy to ride
classic design and modern edition
b1 is the quintessence of the retro
future mission
Electrical revolution has begun avionics
is a part of it
let's fly together
you
my name is Bruce Kidman and I am Stephen
Atkinson and we are the creators of the
cradle tree staking system
this product has a few key features that
really differentiate it from anything
else on the market and that would be
that it supports your tree without
possibly ever having to touch your tree
this is just simple and fast with a
click extend the poles to the right
height and you're set I don't know of
any other product that has a tripod
system that doesn't have to even touch
your tree it's only there for a backup
so this creates a healthier tree a tree
isn't meant to be tied that it's got to
be able to move so it can develop its
spine or backbone whereas you buy a tree
and maybe a retail store they'll have a
stake in it if you get home you take
that stake out the tree will fall over
and with the this one where it's got the
ring and lets it move no matter which
way the winds blowing and develops
itself this is where he needs you we are
at the point that we've got the design
we've got the manufacturers we've got
everything in line to do this but we've
got to get this into production we need
your help to cover those manufacturing
costs to get this initial order so that
we can begin production we're excited
about the product we hope you are too
and we appreciate your support and your
backup in this Kickstarter
my name is James Amburgey I'm marketing
director at bio today we believe water
does it better and are confident after
meeting us and the products we offer
you'll agree people come across the word
the day and they tend to roll their eyes
like they're for wealthy people to
privilege to wipe their own butts but
it's time to take a look at the days
under a different light
when you step into something gross you
don't wipe your shoe you wash it off
with water why is it any different with
your body
we're not just talking about getting rid
of toilet paper we're talking about a
healthier lifestyle as the popularity
for smart toilet seats have grown in the
u.s. so of we we're celebrating over 10
years of innovation and helping people

bringing all the features you'd expect
to see on high-end products down to an
affordable level we're talking heated

best part it's all customizable

nozzle position can have a wide clean

really really excited about this it's
simple and easy to understand but packed
full of features

production costs will be able to
permanently add to slim to you to our
product line we have the design we have

push to make it happen from all of us at

hi I'm Chelsea and I'm Leanne and were
the founders of lolli where edible
bioplastics
three years ago we launched the world's
first edible drinking cup as an
alternative to plastic and since then
we've replaced over 136,000 plastic cups
who is ready to try the cup of the
future got a try
done yeah who's coming in I'm in we have
become experts in edible hyper
compostable materials and we've now
developed what is the next generation of
lollies we're and we're super excited to
share today what's next in lolly wares
innovation pipeline introducing lolly
straw the world's first edible hyper
compostable drinking straw lolly straw
is made from the next generation of our
edible patent-pending material
technology lolly zero
it's made from seaweed and it's a
hundred percent of marine degradable
hyper compostable
non-toxic and non-gmo and can even be
embedded with super fun flavors and
nutritional benefit let us share with
you why it's so critical to replace
something so
500 million plastic straws are discarded
every day in the US which is just a
fraction of the billions used globally
plastic straws cannot be captured by the
plastic recycling stream because they
are too small so in the best case
scenario they are piling up in landfills
and too often they are contributing to
the 80 million tons of plastic bound for
our oceans each year at the current rate
of pollution there will be more plastic
in the ocean than fish by 2050 plastic
straws are clogging our landfills and
killing our precious sea life where
plastic straws are simply taking up more
and more space in our landfills lollies
straw creates new value after it's used
in three key ways by transforming into
flat fuel through composting machine
fuel through anaerobic digestion or
human fuel through eating now more than
ever before we need a solution
the world needs lollies strong because
lollies straw is the straw of the future
goal is to replace plastic straws at
high-waist venues like stadiums fast
casual restaurants and of course coffee
shops we are ready to save the world
from plastic straws and we have our team
of experts ready to go Chelsea and I are
industrial designers we have two senior
food scientists a process engineer
operations advisors and sustainability
experts supporting our endeavor but we
need your support in order to change the
world to replace plastic straws forever
be the first to try lollies straw by
donating today for as little as $10
noodle plastic free and be sipping on
lollies jobs by next summer mini Lords
and your partnership in saying goodbye
to the six billion toxic straws and
hello to lolly straw
you
yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
