backers right here on IndieGoGo we
launched and delivered hero clip the
first of its kind hybrid clip that can
hold just about anything just about
anywhere
our philosophy for hero clip is simple
our hands have better things to do than
just hold stuff the response we got was
extremely positive
but you told us we have two things left
to do we love talking to our community
we are a crowdfunded company and we've
been receiving a lot of feedback and the
number one request has been for
additional sizes that have the same
functionality as the original hero club
the first is is small which works really
well in daily life to hold things like
computer bags purses and camera and gear
bags then we have the mini a truly
compact hero clip that's perfect for
smaller items like toiletry and makeup
bags water bottles and for travel
I'm happy to say they've become a big
hit already with our testers
here Oh clip is a hybrid clip with a
fully functional carabiner on one end
and a hook with a rubber tip for grip on
the other and in between a 360-degree
rotating swivel that makes the gear you
hang infinitely more accessible it even
folds compact when you're not using it
what's exciting about these new clips is
they enable a lot of expression we are a
creative brand and we've got this
creative community and it's great that
we can take some of that vision and
finally get it onto the clip itself
hi i'm dr. jason wars 'land founder and
head of performance development at the
aragon the theron is for chiropractors
physical therapists trainers and
athletes and anyone that's active the
benefits of the fair gun is it increases
blood flow decreases lactic acid and
interrupts the pain cycle in the brain
I've seen the most success with the
Thera Gong in athletes within minutes
loosen up their muscles and go out and
perform the way they need to we all have
our own routines what we like to eat -
how we work out and the best addition to
my routine has been the Thera gonji one
whether it's a pre-workout or after a
long trip on the road and I'm just
unwinding at home the g1 is unmatched
when it comes to recovery its aggressive
but it's not painful and I feel as soon
as when I use it or dr. Jason used it on
me I mean it's it's immediate results
and it's easy to use it's not heavy its
lightweight you can travel with it so I
like that they're going a lot better
the t1 is absolutely the real deal I
used on my quads calves hip flexor I use
it everywhere it helps create blood flow
where you have knots or scar tissue the
ther gun is better than anything
currently in the market because it's
lightweight easy to use battery-operated
handheld mobile you can go anywhere with
you
with a really strong amplitude which is
the distance the head travels the
feedback on the ther gun has been
unanimously positive period sometimes we
all need to get away but the further
your adventure takes you the less you
can rely on cell coverage what if you're
separated from your group using the
somewhere mobile app the hotspot
supports text messages weather reports
local alerts and location sharing with
many more features to come and if things
get really rough somewhere I'll even
help calling for a rescue never before
has the power of satellite
connectivities been in your fingertips
hey Kickstarter I'm James CEO and
co-founder at somewhere we're here on
the roof of our offices in beautiful San
Francisco and we're actually up here all
the time because this is where we test
the product so we come up here and we
get clear line-of-sight of the sky now
we've taken this product all over the
world testing it in all sorts of
conditions to make sure that's gonna be
ready for you what's up Jeremy Jones
here to tell you about the somewhere
device it's a key new addition to my
backcountry kit what I love about the
somewhere device is it's small and light
weights big issue and just to have more
columns than just hitting an SOS button
which is what I used to have out there
communication is key and there's just no
reason not to have this on you at all
times we want to hear why you're excited
about someone and once you get your
product this summer we want to hear
about their stories you want to
understand what type of ventures are
going on and how we can make the
experience even better we see
communication is something so
fundamental that we can't believe there
are still places and people without
access to that I can't tell you how much
time and blood and sweat tears we've put
into this and I'm just so excited to
bring this product to you guys and so
let's do it
a router a device that lies forgotten
somewhere in a tangle of cables on the
floor or in a cupboard working hard 24/7
we at c-- zednik are no newcomers to IT
we can make an awesome router like no
other and I mean it when I say awesome a
while ago we managed to raise 1.2
million u.s. dollars through IndieGoGo
and to deliver powerful secure open
source router called Taurus omnia more
than just irrelevant after our journey
with omnia which you can buy in retail
now we realized not everyone needs its
full performance or functionality
yeah we could take omnia and chop it
down to its bare bones but you can't
please everyone that's why we said
enough you will be able to choose the
paths you actually want it is so easy
but do you like em or cheese hate mail
ok do it because wait a second because
our a must it's great to build your
sandwich the way you like it wouldn't it
be great to do the same thing with a
router absolutely that's why we
developed marks
mock's is the first models more outer
you can put together according to your
expectations
plus it's powered by a secure self
updating operating system from omnia
your perfect router can consist of these
modules basic extension Ethernet and SFP
the basic module is powered by a passive
cooled marvel armada processor has a
micro SD card slot USB 3 and a gigabit
WAN port with the Wi-Fi card alone it
can serve as a pocket ready router or
you can connect it to your router for
example omnia as an access point if you
need faster wireless speed just connect
the extension module with a 5 gigahertz
Wi-Fi card connected to the M PCI
Express slot or you can switch the Wi-Fi
card with an SSD to make an ass or you
can insert a SIM card to the slot
connect an LTE modem and use this module
as a backup connectivity solution
you can also connect the ethernet module
with four gigabit ports
maybe you are lucky enough to have fiber
connectivity so you will find use for
the SFP module we are constantly
developing so you can look forward to
other modules that will be available in
the future I would like one Knox with
Ethernet and 5 gigahertz Wi-Fi please do
one - no thank you okay here we go thank
you very much
