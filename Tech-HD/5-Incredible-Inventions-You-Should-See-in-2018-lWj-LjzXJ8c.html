productivity we work from everywhere on
small mobile devices but our desks still
haven't evolved they're big cluttered
and uncomfortable until now the edge
desk system is your solution to the way
we work today it's the world's first
integrated desk and chair set that
combines the comfort and focused posture
of a kneeling chair with the versatility
of an adjustable desk surface
it sets up anywhere in less than 10
seconds and folds down to less than 6
inches to allow for easy storage in an
office corner or studio apartment it's
designed to be a single piece right out
of the box and adjusts in five different
ways to fit all body shapes and sizes
sitting at the edge will put you right
into productivity mode improving your
posture and keeping you focused I work
myself so a lot of the times I'll be
going to coffee shops your co-learning
spaces simply because my desk at home is
a little messy and cluttered I tend to
sit slouched over on a regular desk and
with this I feel like my posture is
amazing as an artist this is kind of a
game changer you know it's an easel it
could be a table and it's totally
portable so I could take it apart - mark
came to us with the coolest idea and a
really tough challenge we needed to
create something as comfortable as a
kneeling chair that would take up less
space and a standard desk and chair it's
very important to keep the desktop clear
so we created this edge all the way
around the desk to hold all the
accessories I'm Mark creator of the edge
I see people working everywhere I go
libraries coffee shops my daughter and
her friends work anywhere they can on
campus because their room is so small
people are uncomfortable and they can't
focus
we knew there had to be a better way
we've tested the desk with hundreds of
people to make a comfortable productive
and versatile it's amazing to see
people's response the first time they
sit
now we want to bring the age to your
studio dorm room home or office over the
past 25 years our team has been lucky
enough to bring to market hundreds of
your favorite products you've changed
