making food with nice fresh ingredients
you
but we think foodini could be a kitchen
revolution similar to how microwaves did
it back in the 70s
Houdini ships with empty food capsules
meaning that you as the user actually
buy fresh ingredients you prepare the
fresh ingredients for food you need and
Houdini prints it out with foodini
you can do sweet foods savory things
we don't have the six hours a day that
people used to have 50 years ago to make
all our meals and snacks homemade
it was really going back to making
homemade fresh food with fresh
ingredients
the natural machines is a young company
we have a lot of enthusiastic passionate
people on board people passionate about
technology passionate about food and
combining that together
they wanted to add that to the design
element to make it stand out to make it
special but at the same point to make it
fit into your kitchen the appliance that
you would be proud to have on your
kitchen at all times and shows other
people
and at the end of the day that's what
it's all about is helping people eat
healthier more nutritious meals using
fresh ingredients
when we started working on this project
there were a handful of food 3d printers
on the market none of them focusing on
confectionary and all of them costing
thousands of dollars we wanted to change
that revolutionize the to 3d printing
industry by developing a premium product
and selling it with a great price candy
was the result
Kandee can print using any semi-solid
foodstuff simply fill up the disk answer
with a filling of your choice select the
design you require from the supplied SD
card and print
you can design on your computer or
choose one of the preset designs that
the SD card comes loaded with our
evolutionary plug-and-play
electric is true derp allow you to bring
with any semi-solid foodstuff or you can
order the extruder alone and use it with
your current 3d printer candy looks
great on your countertop and comes in a
range of exciting colors to match your
tastes
3d printing confectionary put the fun
back into cooking it's a great way to
spend time with family with candy you
know exactly what's going into your food
and you can make it look any way you
like candy is also ideal for
professional confectioner's looking at
speed and consistency to the production
of your cakes and candies with candy you
can even start their own cake decorating
business at home while your customers by
giving the users creative in ways
they've never seen before whether it's
writing on cakes making cookies printing
the scope chocolates for a loved one or
even making custom decorations Kenda
magic cover
candy was born out of a desire to make
an affordable confectionery oriented
food 3d printer
our team of engineers designers and
foodies works tirelessly to build the
best and most affordable product
possible we went through many versions
before arriving at what we have today
candy also allows experienced 3d
printing enthusiasts to make the machine
their own choose your own extruder and
feelings for total customization we've
come a long way but this is just the
beginning
help us make accessible confectionary 3d
printing a reality by backing candy
