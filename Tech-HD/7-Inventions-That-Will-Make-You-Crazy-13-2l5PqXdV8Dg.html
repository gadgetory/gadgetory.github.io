gun you must always be prepared have to
be trained you are your gun safe
when it's not on you you want to know
it's secure and accessible safes are not
always accessible or easy to open
especially in the dark and locks are
nuisance to operate as for smart guns
while smart guns are a dangerous concept
taking an unreliable technology and
embedding it into your gun is not a
smart decision our mission is to bring
you the perfect solution introducing
sorex the new generation of gun stone
zorax is caliber specific and has two
modes the first mode is awareness if
someone tries to tamper with your gun
you're immediately alerted and when you
need your gun charging it will eject
sorex and chamber a fresh round the
second mode is when your gun is locked
when Zoras locked
no one can charge your gun if someone
tries to charge your gun
the locking mechanism will immediately
expand preventing the gun from being
loaded special polymers in the locking
mechanism prevent any damage to the
barrel szura's developed a revolutionary
unlocking mechanism rapid dial rapid
dial is a simple mechanism which counts
clicks while you turn it you don't need
to start from a specific point even the
direction that you turn the lock doesn't
matter these two factors allow you to
unlock your weapon without looking at it
even in the dark you can choose a simple
code or any length code you wish you
won't believe how fast and simple it is
until you try it you can also open zorax
from your phone but you can only lock it
by physically pressing the lock button
zorax normally communicates with your
phone directly through bluetooth it also
comes with a zorb bridge a Bluetooth to
Wi-Fi router when plugged into the wall
near your gun you'll be made aware from
anywhere in the world if your gun is
being tampered with now if your home is
your safe and you don't lock your gun
but you still want alerts we have a
solution the zone watchdog the zuhr
watchdog is not a lock but rather a
notification device its sole purpose is
to notify you if your weapon is tampered
with
saw Rex was invented by veterans of
elite IDF technological in combat units
we worked on it for two years bringing
it to perfection
zorax allows you to be ready aware and
safe more than ever before
join the zuhr revolution own your gun
we're in the wireless future Wi-Fi
bluetooth LTE so why don't we charge our
tech the same way we use it charging has
been left behind this is fly charge
other wireless charging systems
typically require proper orientation
specific device compatibility and
usually don't charge as fast as standard
outlets plus they definitely don't look
as cool a charge fly charge is wireless
charging done right it uses conductive
technology which means it charges on
contact
this means it works with virtually any
device and you don't have to worry about
device orientation it emits no
additional radiation and is safe to
touch the Flyway 40 is a 40 watt
high-speed charging pad that can
simultaneously charge all of your
devices at the same speed as a regular
outlet the fly case seamlessly
integrates with your smartphone take the
fly cue for the fly coin plug it into
your device place it on the fly way and
charge away the fly cube gives you the
flexibility to charge your device while
in use and the fly coin lets you charge
any USB powered device connected to it
fly charge is awesome
you don't have to worry about placement
or any of that stuff you simply take it
out put it down and charge up it's that
easy
I have flied charge everywhere I've got
in my home and in my office and so does
Martha keep crushing to Martha
it's common for people to put their
phones down on whatever surface they're
in front of so why not be charging it at
the same time fly charge can charge your
devices your friends devices
that guy's device is all at the same
time without losing charging speed clean
up your space and have easy access to
charge all your stuff no more cord
searching wire tripping or outlet
thievery use fly charge join our
movement and together we can change the
way we power our lives

Oh
you
Oh
hi i'm tony gonzalez and i'm excited to
introduce to you today fabulous new
product the wine squirrel decanter the
special decanter allows you to have a
glass or two of your favorite wine and
enjoy the rest of the bottle days or
even weeks later the wine squirrel story
began after a conversation with my
brother we both experienced the
frustration of wanting to open a bottle
of wine and having just a glass but not
wasting the rest of the bottle problem
is the once you open the bottle it gets
exposed to air and continuous exposure
to air causes the wine to oxidize and go
bad right there at dinner I grabbed a
pen and a napkin and started to draw a
conceptual sketch of a product to solve
this problem
now there were some products that tried
to solve the problem by inserting a
device into the wine bottle itself
problem is that was trapped there and
oxidation still occurred I thought why
not tackle this problem a bit
differently and decant the wine bottle
into a special container that completely
avoided any contact with air this avoids
not only having trapped air but also
avoids any kind of consumables like gas
canisters to take my napkin sketch and
turn it into a product we teamed up with
Australian designer 5 solarian and we're
now proud to present the wine squirrel
decanter
this unique product can completely
change the way you drink wine I can now
enjoy a glass wine with dinner and not
worry about the waste so how does this
product work well it consists of this
lead-free crystal decanter and a seal
after you pour the wine into the
decanter you simply insert the seal at
the level of the wine and turn you've
now formed a completely airtight seal
the seal you've just created is so
effective that you can even turn your
decanter upside down no wine will come
out when you're ready to drink the wine
simply disengage the seal then remove
that's it your wine will now be
beautifully preserved for days or even
weeks
we're here in Sonoma County California
with vineyard owner Jennifer crane who's
been using our wine squirrel I opened up
a bottle of my whoa Farms crane vineyard
designated poured it into the wine
squirrel
after a weak flavor was perfect it was
like I just opened the bottle resealed
it with the wine squirrel
two weeks later opened it again tasted
it again just as if I'd opened up the
bottle this product works
it looks fantastic you can put this
right onto the table every wine lover

works we need your help to get this
product out there we thank you in
advance for your support and I can't
