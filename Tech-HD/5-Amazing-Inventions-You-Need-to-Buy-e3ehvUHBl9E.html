the outdoors from insects and we want to
do that in a different way
mosquitoes are actually a growing
problem there's new diseases there's
Zika there's dengue there's West Nile
the season for mosquitoes is getting
longer and longer and they just get in a
way of spending time outdoors enjoying
the activities that each of us love and
spending time with friends and family in
our backyard sprays and repellents that
you put on your skin just get in the way
of outdoor fun so radius is a new and
better way to fight mosquitoes you just
turn it on and mosquitoes are gone the
radius of ice is so easy to use it's
push-button simple literally one button
on the front of the vice you push that
to turn it on you instantly see the
light come on and that lets you know
that the device is active and working
radius uses an EPA approved active
ingredient that is based on a naturally
occurring repellent found in the
chrysanthemum flower and our scientists
have worked on a formula that can be
activated at a lower temperature which
enables us to use a rechargeable
lithium-ion battery in order to heat and
activate the repellent creating the zone
of protection this is the first time
that battery power technology has been
combined with this active ingredient
I love the refill of the system to
deliver a simple refill system it had to
last a long time
and any of the products that are out
there what we deliberated was an
incredibly easy to use easy to replace
refill process it was definitely a great
moment for us when we were first able to
put the product out in the field and see
that everything that we knew on paper
hypothetically was supposed to work
actually did work seeing that yes this
in fact was working and delivering the
type of mosquito protection that we not
only held ourselves to but also that we
knew consumers would expect from us the
first time they tried the product we've
been through several rounds of prototype
testing on radius and we do that before
we even begin to think about mass
production our test facility in Georgia
has put radius through its paces and in
fact they're seeing reductions in
mosquito pressure amongst the best
they've ever seen we think radius is a
perfect fit for Kickstarter it's a novel
new and different way to fight
mosquitoes and it's really a blend of
the most advanced digital technology
with cutting edge repellent formulation
pair together that gives you a solution
the fighting mosquitoes that simply
hasn't existed before we're really close
to development we have everything about
the product designed we have the
approval from the EPA now we just need
some help with funds to do our first
production run so to our Kickstarter
backers we can promise on-time delivery
of an area miscue repellant solution
that actually works radius is convenient
it's portable you can take it with you
anywhere and because it's lithium-ion
powered you can even take it on a plane
so your next trip or adventure
destination you can take radius with you
so we really think the Kickstarter
community is going to embrace radius
because it's innovative it's new it's
different and it's effective it really
really works
Chargers have been the same for a long
time you run out of battery you find a
plug and you get your mobile recharging

designers and electronic engineers and
