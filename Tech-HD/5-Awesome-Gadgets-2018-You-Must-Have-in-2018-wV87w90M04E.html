combine your phone and wallet is over
no more clumsy money clips bulky
traditional wallet cases or case pouches
that leave your credit cards and cash
exposed what if I told you it's possible
for your cards and cash to be completely
secure while having the industry's best
phone protection
let's face it dropping your phone is
inevitable in the fast-paced world we
live in whether you're running around
trying to carry too much but the phone
just simply slips out of your hand
why not being completely covered for
this very reason the commute offers
MATLAB certified military-grade drought
protection the met transit drop test is
a rigorous test where an iphone 7 and 7
plus were each dropped 26 times on each
corner face and edge of the phones
the phones were dropped from 4 feet high
onto two inch thick plywood over
concrete floor the B commute passed all
tests meaning the phones were undamaged
and the V commute itself showed no signs
of damage or deterioration all features
of the phones were thoroughly tested and
both phones proved to be 100% functional
still not convinced well we weren't even
so we conducted our own test we dropped
an iPhone 10 five times from over 4 feet
high onto a sport not only did it
survive the iPhone 10 was in perfect
condition and fully functional so you
can have peace of mind
thanks to V commutes exceptional
protection you will also more than
likely make several transactions a day
at the drive-thru at the store online or
the coffee shop the V commute gives you
quick and easy access to cash credit
cards and ID's which are perfectly
secure and out of sight thanks to its
discreet magnetic flap the same magnetic
flap you have a multi aimed state which
allows you to enjoy Netflix Amazon Prime
video Hulu and YouTube hands
all while maintaining a slim and sleek
profile that easily fits into any pocket
Norbert the V commute is also compatible
with magnetic car mounts so there's no
need for any metal plates on your phone
or in your case the V commutes patented
design gives you three useful features
all in one phone case this is V commute

when we first created the tofu traveler
people loved it
we felt the enthusiasm from all around
the world people excited and they wanted
more then more jaques the team that
invents at Dolan and beigel came to us
with a collaboration plan they explained
to us that they wanted to incorporate
the type-c without any corresponding
size increment and they wanted an
adapter for people to use when they are
not traveling it turned out the missing
puzzle is to--they we have the same
vision that era of type C is coming with
more Jaques license we wanted to combine
the best of both designs with that we
like to announce around sofa Maru it is
designed for all travelers needs it is
an all-in-one solution combining the
modular design adapter for all kinds of
sockets with a 85 slim LAN cable Meru
still in the universal sockets serves
all types of sockets
we compare the two type C power into a
small space to trash chute the laptop
and mobile devices also there are two
additional regular USB type a ports for
your devices such as another phone or an
LED light sofa Maru is an AC power strip

know that size matters prescribe an
ultimate performance within the
perfectly sized TOEFL Mario for your

recessing fuse this means that even when
you overload the TOEFL Morrow and
excited me he will not face any problems
with the fuse in the photo plots with
all system compacts and perfects

go

and work easy
simplifying complexity this is my room
the TOEFL power station
introducing masa the best companion of
Maru we know the type C is coming not
only for the new line of mobile phones
to new tablets and gaming devices but
also for almost all new laptops masa is
the same as the laptop charger he uses
the type C port and only difference is
masa is self power

you can hand Harry Massa into the plane
with a proof lithium power ratings we
will have enough power during your
international and domestic flights the
18,000 micro ampere battery is
sufficient for 2 to 3 days of travel
black compla Massa also supports 7.5
wireless charging with Qi sender and
this brings about great convenience for

experience while you are cooking or
study participant better is that your
