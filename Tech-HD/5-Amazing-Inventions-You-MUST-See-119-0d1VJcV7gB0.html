well the thing I love most about this is
the fact that I can grab these three
tiny lenses throw them in my like tiny
messenger bag and just run out and go
one name system unlimited possibilities
meet the Neptune convertible Heartland
system it's got three fixed focal
lengths and the dual aperture system in
one compact design it's everything you
need
attach the 35 millimeter to the lens
base to shoot street scene architecture
and rifle - switch to 50 millimeters the
fashion editorial or the daily grind and
use the 80 millimeter for people sport
and the great outdoors rather than
having to invest thousands of dollars in
all different types of lenses you have
one kit that's ready to go with this art
lens system you can nail the frame every
single time one thing that's really cool
about this is that I can kind of twitch
really quickly between the lenses and be
able to switch between film and digital
and also get a different variety of
focal length for my couple expect razor
sharp focus strong saturated colors and
smooth Bakke at larger apertures the
matching convertible art lens system
works simultaneously with a stop lift
diaphragm aperture and special drop in
place that pepper your frame with
delicate Aussie
well the Neptune system is I think is an
interesting lens kit I think that the
glass is beautiful it's super sharp and
it's something fun to play with
inspired by the world's first
convertible end invented by Charles
Chevalier in 1840 we've reimagined this
original concept small and please if
everything you need in your bag no
matter where your adventures taking size
of it is great being able to have three
lenses in my pocket the durability and
the size that's really I like that a lot
as this Artland system is expandable the
journey has only just begun with more
lenses plans for future and possible
focal lengths ranging from 15 to 400
millimeters the potential of the
matching convertible Artland system is
unlimited life is unpredictable with the
Neptune convertible Artland system
you'll be ready for anything

the Greve is the company's new new
generation of Hiva thermometer measures
continuously the body temperature and
gives you the whole fever curve and not
only a one spot measurement my name is
Lisa I am your hundred fear pounder of
coordinates and parents are free very
cute children as parents we know how
difficult it is to know what the right
thing is to do when children have the
temperature for example should I try to
keep my child warm or try to cool it
down in this very moment and how
effective was my treatments excuse
engineers and a parent we put our
passion for perfection to the test and
trace it this revolutionary innovative
device which brings demo methods to the
highest degree it's quite small I think
it's not very heavy if it's light and
very flexible I think it doesn't disturb
the babies or the children I would
recommend the degree for parents because
it's very minimal in business
possibility to check the temperature so
you don't have to wake up the baby for
temperature control for especially
during the night the advantage of degree
is that you can have a curve of the
temperature so that you can see if the
temperature is fallen or if the
temperature is increasing degrees
measuring continuously the body
temperature and sense this curve to
receiving you life like a smartphone so
that for example in the night you don't
have to wake up every hour and also wake
up the child to take the temperature
because degree is simply doing it
continuously you can define thresholds
at which you want to get a warning you
also get a warning if the temperature is
too high or right into that the app also
shows you physicians and pharmacy near
to you and how to contact them we did a
lot of research of the size of the year
with small children with all the
children so we found a solution where we
have a adaption of the device and
and also a very flexible design so it
can be adapted to nearly every year it's
very comfortable and convenient so the
children don't feel the device degree is
the biggest invention in the history of
coordinates we developed this device
because our daughter and I had a
fibrillation these ages are due to very
fast rise in temperature so you just
can't see it coming when you take the
body temperature once in a while you
need a continuous temperature curve to
see such a failure coming so we decided
or we start thinking about developing a
creature ever continuously fever
centimeter and now here's degree the
next generation thermometer continues
convenient and accurate
