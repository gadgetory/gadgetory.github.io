morning for swimmers on both coasts in
Southern California a middle-aged man
was found facedown in the water off
Malibu lifeguards and other surfers
tried to save him but he later died it's
one of the oceans most deadly threats
more deadly than lightning hurricanes
and tornadoes combined in an average
year rip film our lifeguards this
morning prepared for swimmers who are
willing to brave the ocean despite
warnings of dangerous rip currents
channels of water that can drag the
unwitting far out to sea big nine other
group ed akan welcome to project Riptide
for the past couple months we've become
aware that tens of thousands of swimmers
in the United States were caught in rip
tides last year currently the only
solution to this problem is another
human being for skiing their life to
venture into the Riptide to save the
swimmer in crisis we plan to use drone
technology to add to the arsenal of the
lifeguard our mission here caught
Riptide is to save lives and the best
most efficient way possible
so here we've got all these waves
breaking all that white water coming in
it piles up along the beach and then it
comes along and it goes out right behind
us and that green gap see behind me is
your return
blowing up everywhere there's about a
million on the air today
Ronna robotics class our teacher
introduced us to our mentor Phil Pietra
they told us that the primary use for
drones is photography he then posed the
question what if they give you something
more
riptide is a drone accessory that can
carry an automatically inflating
life-form to a swimmer in trouble in
just a few seconds
Riptide isn't a drum it's an accessory
designed to attach to existing drums in
just a few seconds the device is super
simple to operate and can be deployed in
less than a minute
Riptide isn't meant to replace
lifeguards or other life-saving
equipment but we think you can be used
to augment the other life-saving tools
that are already in use now anyone with
a drone can be like our team is
comprised of several high school seniors
in one successful business owner and
entrepreneur we the students are in
charge of programming developing and
producing the solution while the
business owner provides advice and
guidance we are proud to say we can make
a difference in the world at this young
age we use 3d printed parts to carry a
depleted life ring that can be folded
into a package that weighs 385 grams
this package carries a co2 canister that
will cause the ring to inflate as soon
as it makes contact with the water there
are multiple ways progr grips I could be
used water rescue ice rescue voting
rescue or any other activity on the
water Riptide can also be used to save
your drone when flying over water the
Reptoid device will imply automatically
and save your drone in the event of an
unscheduled water land
we thought that combining a compact life
raft like this with a common drone like
this we could save someone's life
there's a half a million of these drums
in the year today and that means that's
a half a million potential life cards
right so it's got these little holes in
it and when though when it fills with
water that green tablet that you see in
there is made out of salt and it
instantly dissolves and it when it
dissolves it fires a little spring that
pokes a hole in this gas cartridge and
boot inflates the life raft in five
seconds even if you don't own a drone
when you back our project you can help
save a life
piloting drones is a relatively new
activity that most people are starting
to explore we wanted to design a drone
that introduced as many people as
possible to the first person view drone
experience without breaking the bank
introducing a whole new flight
experience the pole is an innovative and
versatile first person view drone
available at a radical price it's a
complete ready to fly out-of-the-box
solution that's easy and safe to pilot
the drone for everyone there are three
ways to fly first for beginners to start
flying simply turn on the drone and turn
on the controller the two will sync up
and pair and you can take off the drone
features altitude stabilization and a
beginner's mode that makes picking up
the basics of breeze learn how to safely
and confidently maneuver and control
your drone next for those ready to
expand their horizons attach the screen
to the controller and start piloting the
drone further away simply turn on the
drone in the screen the camera on the
drone will automatically sync and
broadcast a live high-definition feed
mount the screen on the controller and
you're ready to go finally for those
ready for the whole first person view
experience swap the screen into the
goggles and prepare for a whole new
flight experience immerse yourself into
the world of fpv piloting and cruise
around high in the sky or try your hand
at fpv drone racing and experience the
incredible excitement from every twist
and turn drone racing is a new and
exciting sport that is quickly growing
around the world using fpv goggles
pilots race their drones around courses
to compete for the fastest times it is
truly the sport of the future the bolt
can be used to experience drone racing
at a fraction of the current price it's
an exciting virtual reality flying
experience
the vault drone was designed and tested
in Los Angeles by a team of expert
product designers aerospace engineers
and drone enthusiasts it's built on a
carbon fiber frame that offers unmatched
performance and durability the HD camera
provides crystal-clear video and photos
and the battery easily slides in and out
for quick swapping the drone design is
modular so that individual parts can be
replaced the result is a highly
maneuverable lightweight and aerodynamic
drone the bolt features a unique and
innovative fpv viewing system that
allows seamless transition from
traditional viewing on the controller to
fpv viewing using goggles we're excited
to offer the bolt drone and a radical
price traditionally consumers purchase
their drones at a high price point since
importers wholesalers and retailers mark
up the price of a drone up to five
hundred percent by cutting out the
middleman we are able to sell directly
to you and pass on the savings the bolt
drone was designed to introduce as many
people as possible to first-person view
piloting and racing without breaking the
bank with our finished prototypes ready
for production we're here on Kickstarter
to raise the money we need for our first
batch with bald drones we want to make
first person view piloting and raising
accessible to everyone with your support
this can be the start of something big
thanks for watching
small UAVs or drones are very popular
today and they are used for an
increasing number of personal and
commercial applications consumer level
drones have two things in common
relatively short flight times and they
can't lift much more than a GoPro camera
that is why we is the aerial design the
easy drone Excel pro the latest addition
to our family of modular drones we
optimized the props the motors the frame
the batteries we use until we reached
not twenty or thirty percent but two and
three times more flight time than anyone
else easy drone Excel pro can fly up to
45 minutes with just a gopro or it can
carry a professional camera with a good
lens on a stabilized gimbal this
officially makes it the longest flying
have a live drone at a consumer price it
is also the most durable drone with
frame built entirely from carbon fiber
and aluminum easy drone XL pro Spencer
open 28 inches from order to motor and
spins 15 inch props however it still
fits in the same small backpack it
weighs only a little over three pounds
so it's perfect for travel
easy John Excel Pro has all the advanced
features like the smaller drones and the
Follow Me feature autonomous way point
flight using the GPS they can be
controlled from a phone or a tablet
automatic return to launch and other
failsafe options to create a virtual
wall around the flight zone in each
direction easy drone Excel pro has a
built in video transmitter so you can
see the video on the ground it also has
a camera shutter control on the remote
and it works with both brushless and
servo cables it takes literally one
minute to put an easy drone XL pro
together without any tools in ball and
camera attachments are all snap on quick
mount solutions and it's ready to fly
hello again we're back on Kickstarter
last time when we launched our easy
drone series we gained a lot of happy
customers worldwide
and they helped us tremendously improve
the platform however we always heard the
same feedback people wanted more flight
time they wanted more cargo capacity so
we decided to do something about it
now we need your help to get these a
drone XL pro into the world and an
amazing Kickstarter only price if you
think that 45 minutes of flight time is
incredible please share this on your
Facebook and Twitter and invite your
friends to watch the video on behalf of
everyone at ez aerial I thank you for
your support
