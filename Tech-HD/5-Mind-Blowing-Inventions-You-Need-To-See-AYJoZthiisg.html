since we started rano six years ago
we've been dreaming of creating films on
our iPhones so we started developing row
of two years ago and it almost broke us
the first version was noisy flimsy and
vibrated like mad which he doesn't make
for good iPhone footage so we scrapped
it and started over again turns out that
creating an integrated piece of hardware
and software is extremely expensive so
we almost went bankrupt twice but we
found a way through the late nights
early mornings tension-filled build ups
for family filled meetings we were
thinking of you
you see we care deeply about empowering
the average Joe that tell their story in
a compelling way with beautiful movement
there's something about it when you
watch it it's hard to describe but it
moves you so whether your own an iPhone
or DSLR we want you to have the tools to
tell your story if you're a YouTube
content creator and Instagram adventurer
or you just want to step up your game
with cinematic motion we may drove for
you
we found our story it's time to go find
yours
you
life puts us every day in stressful
situations no matter how hard we try to
relax
taking a break from it all is becoming
increasingly difficult
unfortunately this Restless rhythm takes
a toll on our well-being that's why we
created ostrich pillow luma the ultimate
eye pillow it provides a cocoon to rest
where you want when you want it's smart
design allows you to put it on easily
and catch some good recovering snooze in
total blackout isolation and absolute
comfort and once you're done you can
conveniently carry with you
unlike conventional I masks ostrich
pillow Luke delivers a unique comfort
experience thanks to its ergonomic form
microbeads filling smooth external
fabric and elastic closure which adapts
to all head sizes hi
we're studio banana since 2012 we've
helped the world sleep better naps

called the ostrich pillow the off strip
called the ostrich pillow the ostrich
pillow ostrich NAP pillow
our awesome team of designers have
worked very hard to ensure ostrich
pillow loop not only caters for your
well-being needs but is also super
attracted to the eye the blueprint is
ready to manufacture and in order to
make this idea a reality we need your
support now it's your chance to
participate in this story thank you for
backing this project
the world demands cleaner low-cost
alternatives to fossil fuels while teros
energies is answering that call with a
high altitude wind turbine the bat for
the first time affordable wind energy
can be delivered to the furthest points
of the earth
powering remote communities off-grid
industries and disaster relief
the Altera's bat furnaces stronger more
consistent winds found at higher
altitudes at these Heights it produces
twice the energy of an ordinary wind
turbine the reason high altitude wind is
so exciting and worth going out this is
really very simple there's just a lot
more reimagining proven aerospace
technology the bat uses an inflatable
helium shed to lift a lightweight
turbine into the air power is sent to
the ground using high-strength
conductive tethers the bat also offers a
unique platform to expand Internet and
phone services weather monitoring and
much more designed to be rapidly
deployed anywhere the bat significantly
reduces human and Wildlife impact when
compared to ordinary wind turbines I
think it offers a breakthrough formed
out of MIT melt arrows is working with
the Alaska Energy Authority to launch
the first commercial high altitude wind
turbine
less expensive more flexible and
significantly more efficient the bat is
the next generation of wind power
you
think about it what is the most boring
daily action we perform since childhood
experts recommend washing teeth after
each mill and brushing for at least
three minutes but honestly who really
doesn't and who bothers always
performing the right movements both
manual and electric toothbrushes have
been the same for decades often in a
hurry we brush our teeth mistakenly
which overtime forces us to turn towards
expensive and painful visits to the
dentist have you ever thought you could
brush your teeth perfectly in just three
seconds it's time to change your habits
for the better with you Nico
here we go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
