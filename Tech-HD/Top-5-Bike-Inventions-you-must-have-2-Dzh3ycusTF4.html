step that isolates your body from bumps
shocks and road buzz compared to a
regular step the shock stop dramatically
reduces impact forces on your hands and
wrists
we designed the stem from the ground up
specifically for road riding and it's
available in a variety of lengths and
angles with adjustable stiffness so
everyone from performance cyclists to
recreational riders and commuters can
find the perfect fit the shops top stem
has an integrated pivot joint with twin
adjustable elastomers that smooth out
the road letting you relax and enjoy the
ride instead of dodging every little
bump and crack you can focus on the road
ahead
every shock your body absorbs actually
slows you down the shock stop lets you
ride faster at the same energy level and
it also reduces fatigue so you feel
fresher at the end of every ride at the
end of the day the shock stop just makes
every part of your riot feel better
installing the shop stop on your bike is
incredibly easy and you can choose from
different stiffness elastomers to get
the precise feel you want
we designed the shock stop to be
lightweight torsionally rigid and
completely maintenance-free our pivot
design uses the same fully sealed
cartridge bearings that are used in full
suspension mountain bikes and we chose
the highest quality components and
materials to ensure that the shocks top
would stand up to even the roughest
roads
if I could create a helmet that could
fold flat then I might save lives
so more than two and a half years have
passed since that time and I've hit and
overcome some major obstacles and with
your help more fur will soon rise This
Is It this is more fun because
completely flat as you can see fits into
any small laptop case fits into a
backpack or a pocket and yet when it
opens up if the force is set to the same
protection
you
I grew the small device you put on your
handle bar to affirm your ban cyclists
like us a simple and safe way to access
all the information we need while riding
speed time the also directions and
gentle notification of your calls and
messages we all have a smartphone but
it's so annoying to use it by writing to
use a you just plug it on its dock on
your handlebar it's magnetic comes on
automatically and connects with your
smartphone without you doing anything
iq is a new kind of by computer that
display the data come in from the GPS of
your smartphone if you launch a
navigational before starting your ride
you receive clear subtitle indications
you can also access your write
information just by waving your hand I
call so notified you if someone is
trying to reach you if you want you can
access messages and call notifications
but to stay safe you decide when to do
it just wave your hand
this is the experience we provide with
eggs you stay in control and receive
clear information
no more smartphones stop when you write
your way in the city when you arrive
just unplug a coupe it's that easy and
all your data are saved in the cloud
hi I'm Adrienne soulguard Janssen and
this is the interlock the biggest bike
lock innovations since sorry what ever
most bike locks suck so I decided to
invent a new one
last summer my bike got stolen so what's
the final product well it's a seat post
with a bike lock inside of it here's how
it works there's a few ways to use the
interlock by putting the cable through
the frame it ensures that the bike is
secure even if someone tries to remove
the seat another way it can be used is
in combination with a u-lock use the you
lock to lock the frame and front wheel
to a bike rack and then use the
interlocked to secure your seat in the
rear wheel to the frame ensuring they
won't be stolen so to install the
interlock the first thing you do is
remove your old seat post and throw it
away
plug the new cable and see post pin to
your frame tighten it up actually wait
do you still have your old seat post
yeah you still need the seat put your
seat on the new seat post tada you're
done</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
