more than any other object or person for
most of us it's the first thing we wake
up to and the last we look at so why not
make your day that a little bit easier
that's why we've invented a SAP X
connect to improve the way you interact
with your phone and USB devices forever
please help support our IndieGoGo
campaign and take a step towards making
your day easier
tres is an action sports tracker it's a
small little device the size of a
Reese's Peanut Butter Cup and you mount
your snowboard your surfboard your
wakeboard whatever and tells you how
fast you're going and how many waves
you've cut how many calories you burn
for skiing and snowboarding it'll tell
you things like air time how high you're
jumping which lifts you were on a bunch
of other things but basically it
measures your activity
tres will also Auto edit video footage
for you so if you're taking video with a
GoPro or a Sony or Canon you can
actually put the video into our auto
editor and it'll edit out all the
highlights for you as well as color
correct and overlay your stats all
automatically
definitely some of the differences
between you know some of the other
gadgets that are out there would be that
it's physically mounted all your
surfboards there's nothing that's on
your arm or you know any kind of odd you
know stat that can be thrown there it's
something that's going to be as close to
the water as possible and so you're
going to get you know the closest
results and it's so easy just kind of
stick it on your board and I just like
to paste it and you're good to go
you
we live on a planet that's 71% water yet
we've only explored 10% of it we're
about to change that the fathom one is
an easy-to-use underwater drone that you
control with your smartphone or tablet
we designed it to be the most affordable
most versatile underwater drone ever
made and after two full years of
prototyping and development were finally
ready to bring underwater exploration
and education to the masses I'm John I'm
Matt and I'm Dani we're a team of
outdoor enthusiasts scuba divers
engineers and travelers they had an idea
for an underwater drone that we could
take anywhere and use in any environment
I grew up spending summers on Lake
Louise in northern Michigan where a lot
of large logging operations took place
in the 1800s
jump forward 200 years and now every
cottage has artifacts and pieces of
history on their walls that washed up on
the beach but there are still legends of
horse-drawn sleds that fell through the
ice and got stuck at the bottom just
waiting to be explored I thought if I
could control an aerial drone from a
mobile app to explore from above why
couldn't I do the same thing from
underwater
that's when fathom was born
underwater remotely operated vehicles or
ROV zev been around for a while but
they're mainly large expensive
industrial devices tethered to big ships
and early consumer RVs inspired by their
big brothers cost well over $1000 with
no mobile app for piloting and you may
be a pretty good hacker to put them
together we knew we wanted an underwater
drone that anyone could drop into any
body of water and pilot easily using an
app on their smart device and it had to
be small and light enough to carry
around meaning a completely new compact
design it had to come fully assembled
out of the box including an onboard
1080p HD camera and built in high
intensity LED headlights for clear
viewing and it had to be as affordable
as lower cost flying drones with
comparable equipment so that every
modern day Explorer could have one we
built the fathom one with all of those
features and thanks to custom components
in a streamlined design now you can have
it for under $600 that's less than half
the price of the closest competition
above all we made the fathom one super
easy to use but that doesn't mean it's
limited this thing is fully modular our
patent-pending thruster attachment
system allows you to easily remove all
three thrusters for packing but it also
enables customization and upgrades to
specialized thrusters such as these ones
with larger fins for stabilization and
we're hoping our backer community will
create and share their own ideas for
customization feather one also features
an integrated rail system that makes
adding accessories like action cameras
and additional lights or other sensors a
breeze just slide it on click it in and
you're ready to go we put everything
that we have into making underwater
exploration and education more
accessible to the masses we've built the
prototypes validated our designs and now
ready to go on a full-scale
manufacturing all that's left is for you
the Kickstarter community to show us
that you want an underwater drone that's
affordable portable modular and
completely easy to use right out of the
box fathom is your chance to go deep and
see the world in an entirely new way the
possibilities are truly endless
what can you fathom
this is Eva Eva is the first smart
shower that saves water to use Eva all
you do is take a normal shower you turn
on your water and Eva instantly powers
up and begins working Eva uses its
internal heat sensor to track the moment
the water hits your desired temperature
and cuts the water flow no more wasted
water while you're away from your shower
when you're ready to get in just press
the button and the water flow returns at
the perfect temperature using a unique
sensor system Eva adjust the water flow
based off of what you are doing and
where you are in your shower Eva is
smart it knows when you need water and
when you don't when you are directly
underneath the showerhead perhaps
rinsing your hair
Eva sets your water flow to 100% giving
you a strong flowing shower right when
you need it when you step away from the
shower to apply soap or shampoo Eva
lowers the flow while still keeping you
comfortable and warm Eva also senses
when you are furthest away from your
shower doing things like shaving your
legs and reduces the water flow even
more it's simple and automatic Eva's
universal design is easily installed
between your shower and the wall
allowing you to continue to use your
favorite showerhead with the Eva mobile
app you are able to set goals for shower
lengths and Eva reminds you when you are
getting close or taking too long giving
you even more ways to reduce your water
usage the app even tracks your water
usage so that you can compare with
others learn trends and adjust your
habits Eva a smarter way to shower
thanks for checking out the Eva smart
shower we have been working around the
clock to make this vision into a reality
because we know just how much of an
impact this can have on the world now
more than ever we need to be conserving
our resources and reducing our waste
even makes that easy and helps us stop
all that senseless water wasting in our
showers if everyone had an eva in their
shower we would be able to save 3
billion gallons of water each day and
that's just in the u.s you can be a part
of that difference by being one of the
first in the world to own an eva smart
shower if you believe in our cause and
love Eva like we do please take a moment
to share our campaign with your friends
and family we'd really appreciate the
support thanks again and I hope you'll
join our Eva family a smarter way to
shower
