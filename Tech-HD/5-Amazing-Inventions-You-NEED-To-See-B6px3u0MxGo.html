hello Kickstarter my name is Nils three
years ago my team and I came to you with
an idea we wanted to let you know your
home was safe without invasive cameras
or complex security systems that's why
we designed point thanks to you the
point is now used by thousands of people
across the world today we're launching
the next generation we've learned from
our community and we've seen of families
and neighbors come together when the
unexpected happens that's why the new
point is full home alone sign for
collaboration we think you'll love it
meet Susan Bob and Judy Anderson and
their neighbor Alex this is their home
would point point consent smoke
point can sense noise point can sense
movement
traditional alarm systems rely on many
individual devices are senseless the
point combines sound motion and
environmental sensors in one device
through machine learning it identifies
what's happening in the environment much
like a brain when point detects
something important a message is sent to
a group of people chosen by you so you
can help each other out when needed
point is now serious business and the
team behind it is growing after more
than a year of hard work with just a few
months away from shipping the new point
will come with a subscription when it
hits retail but we want to offer you
something special
all Kickstarter backers new and old will
get free lifetime service so please
support us and join us on our journey
