we felt there had to be a better way to
handle these short trips our goal at
Marvel was to create the lightest
electric vehicle in the world but also
with an amazing user experience we have
spent the last two years dedicated to
crafting and refining our marble
electric skateboard the lightest
electric skateboard in the world with an
amazing team
it's modern technology and support from
our community we built the marble board
to be simple to use efficient and of
course exhilarating to ride the marble
electric skateboard is the lightest
electric skateboard in the world it
weighs only nine point nine pounds with
one full charge the board goes ten miles
that's not ten testing the lab miles its
real-world conditions most of our test
riders are actually getting over ten
miles per charge the question we get
most is how fast does it go well it is
one of the fastest electric skateboards
it has over 2,000 watts of power and
will hit speeds of up to 20 miles an
hour it could actually hit 20 miles an
hour even going uphill we realize that
20 miles an hour is pretty quick so we
have designed the board settings to be
completely customizable through a
smartphone app our app that we call the
dashboard lets you set exactly what you
want your top speed to be and determine
the level of acceleration that best
suits your riding side this allows you
to perfectly tune the board to your
needs if you want you can even directly
control the throttle of the board from
our dashboard app which will allow you
to leave the wireless handheld
controller at home we were able to
achieve all of this by using
state-of-the-art carbon fiber and Kevlar
composites to create the deck design
that completely encases and protects
every bit of the electronics as well as
the battery cells on top of that we're
using incredibly efficient three-phase
DC motor
battery technology very similar to what
you would find in a Tesla Model S our
custom electronics are being
manufactured for us right here in the
United States and finally everything is
assembled tested oil controlled and
shipped from our facility here in Tampa
Florida
hey there I'm Beth I'm Jeff
three years ago we set out to design the
Seaboard the world's first weight
sensing collective scheme since then
we've worked to improve the board in
every imaginable way today we're excited
to announce seaboard to best weight
sensing electric skateboard we've ever
made
the Z board is a portable easy to use
weight sensing electrics capable to ride
you simply lean forward to go and lean
back to stop speed is totally variable
so you lean forward a little bit to go
walking speed then you can lean forward
a little bit more to accelerate up to
the top speed the Z board is great for
all the in-between commutes that all of
us face each and every day since you can
just grab it and go it's really perfect
for any trip that's too far to walk but
you short to drive
we've improved upon our one-of-a-kind
weights into control by incorporating
foot pads that are larger and more
sensitive the result is a board that's
easier to ride in a lot more fun our new
lithium battery is lighter and slimmer
greatly reducing the weight while
simultaneously improving range and
cutting charge time in half
our brushless motor is more efficient
and faster than ever finally our new
motor controller is rugged and splash
proof and powers features like
headlights taillights and regenerative
braking our designers and engineers have
worked tirelessly over the last two
years to make the Z board - the best
electric skateboard on the market and
it's almost ready three years ago you
helped us take the Z border from a
project in the garage to a real product
now we're taking it to the next level
this is the lightest electric skateboard
in the world sorry
you can use it as transportation print
along onto subways buses or even car
trunks to a further distance you can
write it to get breakfast or cursory of
heat blocks away never need to worry
about parking or lacking when entering a
restaurant with your board in fact you
can print to anywhere what we want is a
revolution of electron skateboards so we
smashed two boxes through batteries away
who bails out it's called on motors and
redesign a brand new ultra light
electricity board which is stirring to
achieve the same inning impossible task
we had to redesign the motor to had it
inside wheels as well as putting gearbox
and sensor inside we designed many
versions of remote-control running for a
better user experience instead of the
short-lived belt we use the planetary
gears to provide unbelief blaze jump our
story has perfect power system to
support high speed up to 20 miles power
and going up here on a 30-degree slope
with a small remote in hand anyone even
with no experience can easily control
the board using our braking and
accelerating features staring is safe
and smooth to write for all users from
beginners to experts
you
hi sport filet I'm in Venice Beach today
to tell you about the unique ego
electric skateboard the ego intuition
light at thirteen point nine pounds is
really easy to carry around wherever you
need to go with the wireless remote you
can switch from turtle to rabbit to
increase your speed and eco support to
increase your torque when you push the
slider forward on the remote you will go
faster and to stop or slow down pull
back
an LED light indicator on the remote
shows you your for charge status and
remote chart status it will also vibrate
when the board gets to 25% charge in the
smartphone app in computer speed and
odometer to see your total distance
sound when you slow down to regenerated
braking system charges the battery
there's a USB port to charge your remote
or phone wherever you go
the rubber-mounted flexible battery deck
allows for classic long boarding field
large 90 millimeter wheels provide
maximum traction even on rough surfaces
it's so fun the way people look and
wonder how you're skating so easily</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
