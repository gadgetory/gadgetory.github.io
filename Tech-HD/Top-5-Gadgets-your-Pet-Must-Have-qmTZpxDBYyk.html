selfie is a smartphone attachment which
harnesses your dog's natural draw and
focus to a tennis ball and uses its
magical powers to help you take better
pictures and selfies with your pet
whether you're taking a picture of your
pup or one with a few lose friends couch
Sophie will help you NAB those moments
with far better results than ever before
I created put selfie to be simple and
effective it was designed for both
iphones and androids however works
universally with most smartphones and
tablets to install pooch selfie simply
slide the plastic component onto your
smartphone and place the ball into the
class new device you'll notice there are
clearances for both front and rear
facing cameras this allows you to toggle
between portrait style pics and selfies
without having to remove the device our
pets are quite unpredictable and even
with the sorcery that these tennis balls
hold their interest begins to fade each
boo selfie comes with a squeak and oil
to grab that extra ounce of attention
from our pets and perk them up for
additional glamour shots need even more
incentive not to worry pooch selfies
ball disengages from the classy
mechanism and you can regain your pups
focus with a couple rounds of fetch this
is particularly useful when you need two
additional time to edit the photos you
took to ensure one of them has your
smile on fleek
you
buddy is a fully integrated LED dog
collar pack with Wi-Fi Bluetooth and GPS
technology that's connecting humans to
their dogs like never before because we
believe dog ownership is all about
enjoying quality time with your pet but
it needed to be practical and easy to
use that's why buddy is completely
autonomous when you spend less time
playing on your phone so you can enjoy
more time with your dog but it takes
care of the rest pet safety is paramount
that's why keeping them visible at night
is so important we give pet owners the
ability to express the unique character
using light
but he has an almost infinite amount of
beautiful lighting effects in color
combos which can be preset or manually
adjusted on the fly we've built in some
really cool innovations say you're at
work and you want to know what your
dog's up to at home buddy tracks
activity via Wi-Fi
you set up an area within the app called
a geofence and if they happen to escape
or get stolen you'll get a notification
on your phone so you can track them in
real time via GPS but eman it is their
activity using a built-in 3-axis
accelerometer displayed right on the
collar how about a light sensor that
turns the collar on and off and adjusts
the brightness automatically to keep
them nice and visible
there's an ambient temperature sensor
and buddy can connect to stuff around
the home like you're smart locks
thermostats and lighting set the
temperature or create zone areas around
the house set activity goals by
offsetting their food intake against
their daily exercise to get a clear
picture of your dog's health and receive
notifications and alerts when it's time
to feed them go for a walk or take them
to the vet but he also lets you know
when your friends are in the area so you
can meet up the local dog park or just
compare stats when designing buddy it
had to look special but it also had to
function and look like a regular column
one of the biggest problems with
existing smart collars is a lack of a
traditional d-ring so we added one in
even though buddy is a sophisticated
piece of kit it doesn't require you to
be tax over to use it that's why buddy
can be operated with a single press of a
button you can scroll through vital
information at a glance and once your
preferences have been set you never have
to think about it a game just enjoy time
with your buddy
this is our working prototype and we're
ready to push squeaker to the next level
and we can't wait for you to be a part
of it but to get there we need your help
you
we're here to tell you about Oh be a
smart laser toy for pets we both love
our pets and we know that keeping them
active is important for their health and
well-being which is why we made obie
obie is a simple and beautiful device
that sits on a shelf or mantle in your
home when activated it shoots a laser
something most cats and dogs go wild for
to say the least using your iPhone you
can control the laser manually or set it
up in automatic mode which is perfect
for entertaining or distracting your pet
when needed you can also schedule OB to
turn on when you are not around and
program it to make a sound to let your
pet know it's time to play and because
all pets are different you can customize
how the laser behaves to best suit your
pin you can even set a boundary to limit
where the laser goes we like to spoil
our pets with toys but one thing we've
noticed about the pet toy market is the
vast majority of them are well under
design to put it kindly we wanted to
make something that you'd be happy to
invite into your home Obi comes in two
versions light the dark and is
purposefully designed to have a neutral
tone that will fit with any style
although OB might seem simple from the
outside it's actually our most complex
project yet involving both software and
electronics

you
