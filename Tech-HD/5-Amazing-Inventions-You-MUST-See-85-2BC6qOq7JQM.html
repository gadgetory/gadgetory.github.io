there's something about how things were
made a while back it's like magic having
a certain feeling to it it was an error
when people had time to pay attention to
every detail and things were made to
last inspired by the Bulls headlights
we've collected over the years we
combined our skills to create something
useful really amazing we would be proud
of having around
we wanted it to have a personality the
stance had to inspire confidence just
like a superhero strength the footprint
is large enough to keep it balanced
besides was chosen so it will be tall
enough to provide light for the entire
office that has boutiques in any
direction and at any angle even large
enough to be used at the headphones game
we fitted it with LED light sources to
have the perfect light for hanging
situation a career one for reading but
you could easily turn on or off and set
the intensity just by touch and an RGB
controlled by mobile turn it on or off
chose the color or attention locket and
comfortably on the couch this why can
even be state to music so it will flash
to the beat when you're having a party
looks and functionality weren't enough
the materials had to be top notch as
well the head is made out of old tractor
headlight it's all metal and glass so it
would last even in the toughest
conditions the neck
the only exposed part is made from
aluminium so it won't rust bodies made
from recycled polyurethane it's not the
environment a bit we wanted everyone to
be able to add a personal touch to it so
starting from day one you can choose a
color to match your room by altmetric
personality to have full body coverage
each lamp so we'll have two layers of
non-toxic water-based paint and to
basically as a clear coat to protect the
paint job from wear and scratch over
time we put our heart and soul into
design in the land there and making the
first prototype to be able to produce it
and make it available we'll need your
support together we can make this happen
