winter is coming
what if there was a video game
controller that could replace all the
video game controllers in your
collection right now controllers like
this and this one that one of course
this that this and even one of these ok
maybe not that but how about these two
well we've made something that can do
everything these controls can do and a
little bit more and what would we call
control that can replace all the
controllers in your collection well you
would call it the all controller for the
past two years we've been designing this
controller by creating a bunch of
different models coming up with
different internal components and
external pieces to really get the best
features we could possibly fit in a tiny
package right out of the box our
controller has a bunch of different
drivers built into it so that you can
connect to virtually any operating
system on any computer you own and not
only that you'll be able to play any
video game ever made and when we say any
video game we literally mean that if the
game didn't have controller support
initially you'll be able to control your
mouse and keyboard directly from the
controller itself the old controller can
connect to Windows Mac and Linux and it
also has the ability to connect to iOS
and Android just use the built-in screen
on the controller to select the device
you want to connect to and then connect
it's just that easy and that built-in
screen isn't just for connecting to
different devices you're also able to
customize the controller and a bunch of
different ways remap every single button
every single joystick invert them adjust
their dead zones adjust their
sensitivity and adjust the trigger
sensitivity whatever you want to do
you're capable of doing it with our
built-in operating system within the
controller itself if you want you can
even set up the entire controller to
just do macros or set up macros on the
fly whatever game you're playing however
you want to play it this controller will
give you more options than any other
controller ever made we're adding new
support for devices all the time through
software updates for our controller and
those software updates are totally free
once you've gotten the controller we'll
be adding new features as time goes on
alongside the old controller we'll also
be releasing the dongle allows you to
connect to the Xbox 360 Xbox one
PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 and all
the features have seen all the
customizability also works on those
systems as well everything you've seen
in this video is based off of a real
controller that already works but what
we need your help to do is raise enough
money so that we can produce these
things on a larger scale and start send
them out to people so if you want to
help us check out our Kickstarter page
