together
you show your lives you share everything
that's how it should be with your best
buddy the idea came to me while riding
the gym trail near Zion National Park I
was getting off my bike five or six
times to hydrate my dog pulling a bowl
out of my pack or squirting water into
his mouth
it was time-consuming inconvenient and a
waste of precious water I realized that
I've seen so many people experience the
same dilemma with their buddies almost
everywhere carrying extra bowls and
extra bottles or just using their hands
on trails around town and parks and even
on road trips all trying to hydrate
their dogs in ways that are ineffective
frustrating and wasteful I also
remembered learning the dogs don't drink
like humans they curl their tongues
backward into a scoop and pull water up
into their mouths
I wondered why we all try to make our
dogs drink like us
and I laughed myself as I thought how
would I feel if my dog tried to make me
drink like him I looked down on my empty
water bottle cage and the idea for the
drinking buddy came to me I raced home
and ordered a dozen different bottles
online that I could deconstruct and use
to build a prototype a prototype that my
dog and I have used successfully up
until now a few months later I filed a
full utility patent and assembled a
small but very talented engineering and
development team we immediately began
designing the perfect sharing bottle the
drinking buddy we paid meticulous
attention to organized physical user
interface and aesthetics ensuring the
best experience in every way you can use
the drinking buddy in two ways
fill it completely with 24 ounces of
water you drink from the top and your
buddy drinks from a food-grade
retractable silicone dish on the bottom
a one-way check valve in the bottom lid
prohibits backwash from coming back into
the bottle keeping the water inside
fresh and clean or remove the bottom
straw insert the supplied inner bladder
fill the bladder with 10 ounces of water
for your buddy
and fill the top side with 14 ounces of
whatever you would like to drink the
check valve which is still on the bottom
lid prohibits air from entering the
bladder so water for your buddy is
always available with the first squeeze
the bite valve moves with you and
includes a bite Ridge for improved hold
the drinkin buddy can be completely
disassembled and comes with a dishwasher
safe mesh bag for washing the smaller
parts
it is easy and comfortable to carry fits
and cup holders and water bottle cages
and is BPA free and completely leak
proof now you can drink like a person
and your buddy can still drink like a
dog both from the same bottle no more
carrying extra bowls or extra bottles no
more wasting precious water while you
hydrate your buddy
what do you say old buddy should we have
a drink thank you Richard I'm not saying

phone a blend of the spinner stand and
ornament Szanto the world's most chic
