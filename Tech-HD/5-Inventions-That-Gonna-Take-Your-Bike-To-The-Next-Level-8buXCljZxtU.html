laser optics it's a more efficient than
any we've used before
resulting and the clearest laser beam
we've ever created I've seen on the
streets of London every day
it also helps give pedestrian in their
heads up prevents them flipping out into
the bike lane
the white light through design was 2d
riding in mind and the peak strength
facilitative join you can see
amount to the simple
for the one-handed click on and click
off mechanism they incorporate to the
lighter battery which doesn't compromise
performance you can rise up to 41 hours
