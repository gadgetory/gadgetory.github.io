and here finally we see its completion
crystal Rove putting the last touches on
the design that was found and lost and
then found again in the early 1960s
notable celebrity optometrist Edwin roll
discovered himself in a peculiar
predicament he lived in the world that
wanted to grow bigger while all he could
think about was making things smaller
determined to create high where that
would stun the world he spent a decade
studying the most incredible wonders of
design and beauty until his design was
perfected however the glasses were never
made lost 12,000 feet under the sea the
plans were not recovered for nearly half
a century delivered to Crystal the last
remaining role she was determined to
complete her grandfather's invention and
so with the plans in hand she made them
small dynamic fast smooth dashing secure
active bold compact durable pocketable
perpetual oasis and this is how a
timeless design became a timeless design
