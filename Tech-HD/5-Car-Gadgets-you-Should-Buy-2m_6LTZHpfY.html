you
from the beginning the challenge was to
make a simple elegant protective case
for your phone that encapsulates
mounting capabilities without
sacrificing any thickness or way mag
back case accomplishes we also design
mag stick an ultra-thin minimalist
magnetic stick that can be adhered to
any surface to mount your phone because
the case and Mac stick are aligned
perfectly with each other mounting your
phone feels magical the small profile
and beautiful finish allow maxik to
blend into the background when you bring
the phone close the magnets pull and
secure the phone in place and it's just
as easy to take off but what we really
love about it is that it's so simple and
the complex layers are invisible Magda
is the world's thinnest mounting
solution for your iphone
so how do we accomplish this to make mac
back extremely thin we design custom
shaped magnets we place them so that
they do not interfere with any of the
functions of the phone LTE compass gps
and Wi-Fi work with no issues the case
itself is made out of three layers that
deliver great protection in case of a
drop yet it is just over 1 millimeter
thin and of course it comes in a variety
of beautiful colors the mastic has an
elegant metallic finish that will look
great on any surface it has three rare
earth magnets that are super strong and
allow your phone to mount portrait or
landscape I've been using a prototype
for several months now in a work school
rate our previous project Mac back for
iPad was a great success and our backers
loved it we also learned a lot or
working on it we took all those
learnings and apply them here we
finalize our designs and have vendors
ready to experiment production
