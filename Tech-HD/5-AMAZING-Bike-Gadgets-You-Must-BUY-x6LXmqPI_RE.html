flying over smooth pavement gliding from
curve to curve unfortunately for most of
us the reality is not so smooth at
redshifts sports we want every road to
feel like the perfect road which is why
we're so excited to be back here on
Kickstarter to introduce the Shox top
suspension step the shock stop is a
pivoting suspension step that isolates
your body from bumps shocks and road
buzz compared to a regular step the
shock stop dramatically reduces impact
forces on your hands and wrists we
designed the stem from the ground up
specifically for road riding and it's
available in a variety of lengths and
angles with adjustable stiffness so
everyone from performance cyclists to
recreational riders and commuters can
find the perfect fit I love riding my
road bike but it's really stiff and it
tends to transmit every little bump
straight to my hands and arms I use
gloves extra bar tape and I even
upgraded to a carbon-fiber frame but in
reality those changes only added a tiny
amount of cushioning you've probably
felt fatigue numbness or even pain in
your hands after a long ride and usually
it's just annoying but the vibrations
and impacts actually slowed you down and
caused a loss of control and over time
they can even lead to long-term injury
the Shox top stem has an integrated
pivot joint with twin adjustable
elastomers that smooth out the road
letting you relax and enjoy the ride
instead of dodging every little bump and
crack you can focus on the road ahead
every shock your body absorbs actually
slows you down the shop stop lets you
ride faster at the same energy level and
it also reduces fatigue so you feel
fresher at the end of every ride at the
end of the day the shock stop just makes
every part of your ride feel better
installing the shock stop on your bike
is incredibly easy and you can choose
from different stiffness elastomers to
get the precise feel you want we design
the shop stop to be lightweight
torsionally rigid and completely
maintenance-free our pivot design uses
the same fully sealed cartridge bearings
that are used in full suspension
mountain bikes and we chose the highest
quality components and materials to
ensure that the shocks top would stand
up to even the roughest road
let's be honest the suspension stems of
the past were a bit of an eyesore and
they definitely weren't optimized for a
road riding we tuned the travel feel and
aesthetics of the shocks top to
perfectly compliment modern road bikes
and the roads we ride on
two years ago we launched the switch
arrow system here on Kickstarter and we
were amazed at the response today there
are thousands of people all over the
world
riding with red ship components on their
bikes the support we received let us
turn an idea into a sustainable company
we built redshift on a foundation of
delivering the highest quality products
we have existing relationships with
suppliers and manufacturers a realistic
timeframe for production and a proven
track record of delivering products that
our backers love we think the shock stop
will let people read further faster and
more comfortably now help us turn every
road into a perfect Road
smartphone is becoming more and more an
essential part of everyday life and
using it during a bicycle ride is not an
exception
recently cyclists use their own
smartphones for GPS tracking listening
to music getting calls and so on while
riding bicycles however its limited
battery life has always been the biggest
concern for reliable outdoor use worry
no more our battery stem features an
integrated 10,000 milliamp ayres battery
pack and this will keep you connected
all day long without worrying about the
battery life it's three times larger
than your smartphone battery and at
least two times larger than a typical
product on the market another advantage
of this product is that it is also the
first battery integrated bicycle stem
that is made of carbon fiber carbon
fiber stem will protect the battery from
external shock for your safe riding our
team consists of engineers and designers
we've been working on this project since
March of last year we are still
developing and improving of at our stem
we're making it look nicer lighter
stiffer and safer we want to bring this
product to you as soon as possible
and for that we need your help invest in
us and I promise our very stem will keep
you connected all day long
one of my favorite things to do is to
get out and ride my bike but the
combination of rough roads and stiff
bike frames means riding can be really
tough on your body in 2016 we launched
the shock stop suspension step-dad
cushioning to the front end of the bike
the stem changed the way people thought
about suspension but the front of the
bike is only half the equation that's
why we're so excited to introduce the
shock stop seat post a revolutionary
short travel suspension seatpost
that will completely change your riding
experience no matter what kind of bike
you ride maybe you're out for an epic
gravel adventure or just dealing with
potholes on your daily commute you're
gonna find rough roads wherever you ride
modern bikes are designed for speed and
efficiency not for comfort this means
bumps and impacts pass straight into
your body which leads to fatigue pain or
even injury
we designed the shock stop seat post to
suspend your body and isolate you from
the shocks and vibrations of the road we
optimize the travel and suspension
kinematics to provide a super plush
bottomless suspension feeling we
designed the seat post to integrate
seamlessly with the styling of modern
bikes you can change the spring rate and
preload to match your specific riding
style
and it's compatible with all types of
writing gravel ebike commuter road and
mountain
studies show fatigue reduces riding
efficiency by up to 20%
typically adding comfort to your bike
meant sacrificing performance the shock
stop seat post lets you ride faster and
more efficiently because instead of
bracing yourself against impacts you can
stay seated and keep pedaling over rough
surfaces it reduces the accumulated
effects of bumps and vibrations allowing
you to ride further faster and more
comfortable the shocks top seat post is
the rare product that increases comfort
and performance riding the shocks top
seat post is truly transformative we
launched redshift sports in 2013 with
the help of the Kickstarter community
it's amazing to think that today
thousands of cyclists all over the world
are riding with redshift components we
can't thank you enough for your support
and enthusiasm we think this is our best
product yet and we can't wait for you to
experience what it feels like to ride
