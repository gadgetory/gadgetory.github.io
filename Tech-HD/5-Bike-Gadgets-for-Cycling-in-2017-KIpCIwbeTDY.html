Viserys superclamp 2-bike is the easiest
most secure way to transport two bikes

totally bike friendly at the heart of it
all is our design philosophy to create a
rack that is lightweight yet durable a
little something we call simple strong

thanks the two bikes sharing a single
horizontal bar this long bar design
yielded a rack that way significantly
less and sports a smaller footprint

our lifetime warranty the super clamp to
buy it comes with universal wheel trays
to fit a wide variety of bikes and wheel
sizes and wheel straps are provided for
use with ebikes bikes offenders or bikes
that weigh more than 50 pounds when not
in use the rack folds up and out of the
way the super clamp can also tilt down
for easy hatch access even when fully
loaded with bikes the dual Shepherd's
hooks hold the bike by the top of its
wheels which is the most secure way to
transport a bicycle plus it'll keep your
bike's paint scratch free as a super
clamp will never come into contact with
the frame of your bike locking cables
provide peace of mind that bikes are
securely locked to the rack and a
locking hitch pin lets you know that the
rack is securely locked to the car the

inch and a quarter and two inch hitch
receivers which makes for a smooth
transition from car to car with
different hitch sizes plus the super
clamp features universal adjustability
