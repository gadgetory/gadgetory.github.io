getting a whole new perspective from the
palm of your hand
picture soaring to incredible heights of
the waves and float out of a hot air
balloon sharing breathtaking medals
this is micro drug whether you fly micro
drone in extreme conditions like on a
windy beach or in delicate ones like
inside your home with its precision
control flexibility and durability you
can fly it anywhere no matter your age
or flying experience there's no other
drone like micro drone 3.0 is designed
with drone enthusiasts and excellent
engineers from around the world
components are easily expandable
upgradable and replaceable it's also the
smallest drone to currently carry a
mechanical gimbal the HD camera streams
live footage to your smartphone
the batteries slide in and out for quick
hot swapping and the plug and play smart
module simply snap on with magnets since
everything either snaps or slides in the
structure is sleek aerodynamic and
beautiful so now it's possible using a
3d printer technology like the old tea
maker - you can print out your own
custom frame similar to the dragon or
the wasp I was super excited when the
when the micro drone team reached out
and wanted to make a first person view
drone technology using the DODOcase VR
viewers very few people could use
first-person view
drone technology even a year ago I mean
the fact that the micro drone
team is making this technology available
is really a revolutionary idea
we want to make the quintessential drone
the drone market is evolving and
together we can drive the technology
forward we need your support so no
matter who you are we're making sure
that whoever of the Box finds a simple
reliable affordable durable and fun
drone thank you and we look forward to
making with you the next one and only
micro drone
you
introducing the redesigned nano drone
from morrison innovations we took the
world's smallest quadcopter and made it
even easier and fun for beginners to fly
our new patent-pending design provides a
more forgiving flight process while
protecting the blades and motors at the
same time there will be three
introductory colors to choose from on
IndieGoGo all nano drones will now come
with our new packaging that also doubles
as a protective storage case the all-new
three speed calibration system provides
smoother lift and maneuverability
reducing the pogo stick effect that new
Flyers experience with the previous
design we have also improved the six
axis stabilization which allows nano
drone to hover remarkably well it can
now hover less than an inch off of the
surface below in addition to higher
altitudes our patent-pending blade guard
design allows the new nano journey to
lightly bump ceilings and walls without
causing the blades to fly off which
previously resulted in short flight
times devastating crashes and the need
for repairs while not indestructible the
new design is certainly more forgiving
software upgrades provides smoother 360
degree rotation also referred to as
y'all allowing you to easily adjust the
orientation of your drone mid-flight we
have designed what we believe to be the
perfect learner drone that will save you
thousands of dollars while you protect
the mechanics of quadcopter flight
before moving on to larger and more
expensive
hey my name is Robert Morrison and I am
the founder of axis drones and today I
have with me the wallet drone
while it drone is the world's smallest
quadcopter it fits inside of the
controller itself which is the size of a
wallet fits perfectly into your pocket
not only does the quadcopter fit inside
of the remote control but it actually
uses the remote controls batteries to
charge itself while not in use making it
go virtually anywhere that you can this
is the most portable compact quadcopter
on the market so we've had probably
about five or six different remote
control planes but the wallet drone
seems to last forever and maybe it's the
size the small size er but it flew
longer than just about any other copter
whatever you
you
you
what is elf elf is tiny elf is
sophisticated elf deliver selfies of
different perspectives a spy pro flying
camera special moments -
you
by owning well this is the prototype the
egg is a portable charger you can charge
a bird in less than 12 minutes Bionic
body is only eight point five grams in
hazard electric motor of 0.8 watts
rotation speed of 55,000 fpm fan
aluminum heatsink
and a lithium polymer battery it also
has a great design inspired by nature
plus we can fly as high as 100 yard
finally I add my friend up
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
