was working on my PhD project coffee
would sit on my desk while I was busy
working and it would get cold so quickly
I just couldn't enjoy it MIDI know is
the powerful smart mug the world has
been waiting for it keeps your drink at
the ideal temperature while
simultaneously charging its own battery
makino is your copy companion and also
your beer buddy configure both hot and
cold settings using the McGee no app on
your smart phone MIDI nose clever
technology remembers your temperature
settings just tap twice to use hot mode
or tap three times for cold ensuring
your drink stays at the perfect
temperature for hours did you know that
around one third of the energy spent to
heating up a beverage is then lost
through the wall of the container every
day around four billion cups of hot
drinks are consumed around the globe the
wasted heat from those hot beverages
could provide electricity for six
million people
McGee knows energy harvesting technology
is the way forward for a smarter greener
future for our planet if you haven't
consumed quite enough drinks to charge
the battery simply place your makino on
the muggy pad and let it charge why not
install muggy pads on your boardroom
table so your staff can keep their
drinks hot during long meetings
makino is perfect for use in the great
outdoors take it safely in your car take
it camping or take it to the ballgame my
dedicated team and I have invested years
our own time and money but we need your
help to get the Makino to the
manufacturing stage your contribution is
vital in bringing Martino to the role so
everyone can enjoy the perfect ring
every day
thank you for interest in Modena
sell me this pencil a rebar cane
we have successfully are identified and
solved a number of issues with existing
pencils it's a pleasure to introduce to
you magna as design engineers is in our
nature to challenge and innovates
products we use every day
other products use a full release or
incremental option which dictates the
lead position our patent-pending
magnetic propulsion technology offers
finite controllability unlike other
pencils the secret to our revolutionary
invention is concealed within the core
of the pencil the outer sleeve
synchronizes its position to the inner
magnet shielded within the premium grade
aluminium body it works like magic
every detail has been considered whilst
it may not be visible to the naked eye
the ends of the pencil are slightly
larger in diameter to prevent the sleeve
from falling off
we have sourced our manufacturers paid
for tooling and have received our final
prototypes so now we need your help to
raise the funds and hits and minimum
order quantities it really is the last
piece of the puzzle we want to make our
dream a reality and start shipping these
fantastic new products to your door we
strongly believe that making profits
should come second great design
therefore we price these pencils an
extremely affordable rate to make them
accessible to the wider Kickstarter
community a product with this level of
consideration really is a tool for life
and perfect as a gift for your family
and friends so now it's up to you to
help us bring the pencil into the 21st
century thank you for watching
you
this is control the robot it has the
same DNA as sophisticated hundred
thousand dollar industrial robot arms
elegantly reduced down to desktop size
and made as affordable as a coffee
machine now anyone can own their own
robot just plug in a laptop and take
control with a full range of
articulation through six axes Controls
uses are as unlimited as your
imagination from teaching your children
to code through play to clever
applications for small business to
science and education uses control the
robot provides endless opportunities it
works right out of the box and the
completely open source interface means
you can control it with your favorite
programming language or simple
conversation or text commands or use
physical manipulation to teach it
repeatable tasks you can also connect
multiple arms to work together end of
arm tools are easy to change and will be
available for endless uses including
grips laser engravers suction pads spray
nozzles 3d printing and more with a
camera control can also find and
recognize all users will be able to
write their own application and share
the code globally creating your database
of control the robot programs from
creating a miniature factory for your
business to raising the next generation
of genius inventors control the robot
means anyone can now control a robot
all over the world the dresser is
basically the uniform of successful men
and you wear to work when you have a
important interview even at your own
wedding left press is using smart
textiles to make your life easier
our research shows that men basically
prefer to have three purposes in a dress
shirt no stains no smell and as little
irony as possible we found a way to
offer that in a fabric that's also soft
and breathable we get a lot of questions
about how it's possible for sure to have
such magic properties and still feel
natural well it implies working on every
aspect of the fabric from the cotton
selected to the way the yarns are spun
and then woven our carbon is also
treated so that the fibers are
transformed that they're very cold this
allows the shirt to block out all fluids
and bacteria before them sister fabric
which is unlike other existing
technologies where it's only added to
the surface and can be washed off so
together with our designer we created a
great fit we did it in a minimalistic
design so it will never go out of style
that first is more about just making
life easier for busy men we also care
about changing irresponsible consumption
patterns true sustainability is when you
wear the same shirt for years instead of
buying new stuff all the time
the biggest hassle of wearing a shirt is
not buying it but keeping it fresh
when napkin when you eat bike slower so
you don't sweat maybe even do laundry on
a Tuesday a leopard shirt can be worn
for many days in a row and you still
don't have to wonder if your date can
smell how long a day you have well it
took us quite some time to create our
day jumps but we're really excited that
we're going to go all in on bringing
this technology to market we believe
this is the next generation of shirts
with our background in sourcing and
fashion we think we are the right
founders to create this unique program
that will be worn for years to come
now all we need is your help please back
our campaign today and help us create
the next generation of shirts</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
