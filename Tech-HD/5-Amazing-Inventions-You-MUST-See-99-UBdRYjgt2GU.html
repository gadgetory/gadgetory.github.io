future of furniture because it makes
living a connected life more convenient
please back us today and help make this

this is John he is an experienced
motorcycle rider John knows that safety
is important which is why he at least
wears this and this and of course this
but what if you could prevent an accent
altogether
well that's Jane hi Jane and this is
break free
just like John she too is an experienced
rider and she's all about safety
she knows that being visible at all
times is the key it's a smart LED light
that does sophisticated things unlike
your motorcycle taillight break free is
at eye level so while drivers can finish
it'll grow brighter to alert drivers
around you when you're slowing down no
matter how breaking down shifting or
engine brake turn it on and it stays on
no need to connect it with wires or use
an app and that's what Jane and riders
really care about being seen to prevent
an accident in the first place whether
you're this this this or even this kind
of rider you'll still want this this
bridges the gap between safety and style
this is break free a smarter way to be
seen I've been writing for the past 10
years
and I loved every second of it I also
have a wife and two beautiful daughters
so my safety is always my top priority
shortly after I graduated college I got
the opportunity to apprentice under a
successful Silicon Valley entrepreneur
while working on one of his new ideas
and autonomous brake light cars I
quickly realized this is the perfect
product for motorcycle riders so break
free we're trying to use advanced
manufacturing techniques from companies
like Audi and BMW and bring those to the
consumer market to deliver a safety
product that is like no other one of the
biggest hurdles for the design process
was trying to make our unit fit on as
many how much as possible
and the way we did this is we took
as we could get and we 3d scan the back
of them and what we're trying to get at
is a shape that's going to work for as
many hands as possible and also maximize
the surface area of the lights because
the surface area life is obviously
important and how much you can see them
products that have been on the market
already are all mounted sticks on a
vehicle that works well and can detect
acceleration but as soon as that the
head of the rider starts moving a lot of
these devices give false readings what's
special about the break free device is
that we can detect deceleration in the
direction of travel even though the head
of the writer where the light is mounted
may move sideways and tilt forward the
end goal at break free is to increase
safety cover riders we do that in two
ways first create a device that people
will want to wear and the second make
something that works one of the most
important aspects of our safety is our
visibility and it's also one of those
things that's most neglected currently
in the market there's some high vis gear
that's neither in the helmet or a vest
or in pants and to me I mean it's
definitely a step in the right direction
but they're a static piece they're not
going to really get the attention
they're not going to really capture kind
of a semi glazed driver if you will
what's nice about this product is it
illuminates and flashes so it's
something that is dynamic it definitely
can make a different screen saving a
life break free is something that's
really unique never seen anything like
it before
cars have a triangle of life these days
modern cars the two taillights the light
that's up in the back window
motorcyclists taillights are generally
small and they're designing them to look
even cooler and smaller and they become
even harder to see the break3 brings a
light that is going to be noticeable by
drivers up into their basic field of
vision this is why break Fate needs to
break free is bridging the gap between
style and safety I dedicated the last
two years of my life
get break free to wear it is my dad and
this is where we need your help now we
need the tooling to manufacture our
first large quarters we get break free
into the hands of writers everywhere
thank you
my name is Scott boggy and I'm the
inventor of the goateesaver I wanted to
do a demonstration video for you today
to show you how guys around the world
are using the product to make their
goatee or VanDyke look even better I
wanted to first take and show you how to
adjust the goateesaver
to make it fit your size and your style
of goatee as you can see on the front of
the goateesaver there are three
different adjustments that you can take
and make there is an adjustment that you
can make for the top part closer to your
to the top part of your face and then
there's a little adjustment that you can
make which will be closer to your mouth
or the bottom this will allow you to be
able to get the size and style of goatee
that you would like to have before I
actually shave with the goateesaver I
also wanted to show you that there's an
adjustment on the back for the
mouthpiece I will tell you that most
people will need to use the mouthpiece
in the default position but you can take
and twist and move the mouthpiece up
higher if you wanted to adjust it on a
different part of your face before you
take and shave with the goateesaver it's
important to use a trimmer to get your
goatee or VanDyke to the links that you
want to have it before shaving with the
goateesaver on the top of the
goateesaver there is a place that will
allow you to line the product up with
the center of your nose that way you
know that the goateesaver is straight on
your face once you have the goateesaver
placed on your face and you begin to
shave it isn't very important not to
move the goateesaver until you're
finished shaving after I get through
shaving with the goateesaver I'll remove
it and then take the straight edge of
the razor
and uses to shave right underneath my
nose when you shave with the goateesaver
one of the things that you'll notice is
they're still about an eighth of an inch
of hair that will stick out beyond the
goateesaver if you look at the bottom of
the razor you can see that the reason
this is the case is because how the
razor was designed there's about an
eighth of an inch between the edge of
the razor and the razor as you can see
it's very simple to shave with the
goateesaver as with anything new it may
take a few times of trying before you
get it down just perfect thanks for
watching the goateesaver and learning
more about it
