everywhere we go but we can't bring it
on our swing the Dolphins ultimate
earbuds for water sports and fitness

totally waterproof uncomfortable and
fall out easily with this in mind we had
an idea

kayaking kite surfing or any other water
sport and enjoy your music without
worrying about damaging or losing your
image our teams lots of experience with
designing economic devices developed new
earbuds to be small minimalist and
comfortable while also being totally
waterproof we make sure the dolphins
will never fall out by designing and
patenting the world's first detachable
hooks just attach them to the earbuds
before swimming to ensure they fit
perfectly and will stay in your ear
whether you're swimming surfing or
running using Bluetooth 5 the Dolphins
gives you more range speed and data
the ip68 rating guarantees the earbuds
are totally waterproof so you can stay
in the water for as long as you want
taking into account every shape of the
ear we designed an earbud that is
comfortable for everyone you can answer
the call
change the song or control the volume
with just a touch or spike to change the
song just swipe up or down your right
headphone to control the volume swipe
the left one and to enter the phone just

share phone calls by pairing your
