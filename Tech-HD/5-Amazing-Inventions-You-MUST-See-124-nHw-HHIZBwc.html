of motivate my team and I would go to

change the way the world travels so
here's scenario just right at the
airport you need to make your flight you
want to walk or do you want to ride and
here we go today we have the motor back

FAA compliant so you can actually fly

to charge your devices you have an
optional GPRS GSM tracking mechanism so
you can keep track of your login to
wherever it is and never have to worry
about losing it again it really changes
your experience at an airport what do
you think for next fifth oh wow yeah
it all started a few years back after
like this little family of breakdancers
we're going to the airport we load it up
with backpacks and all the different
gear and laser taking turns as I'm
pulling my carry-on right and on top of
all so they got the idea you know what
I'm at motor riding what a better way to
get around well I was gonna need some
help and the first person I thought of
with my buddy boy we just got back from
state those 200 we won and having came
with this idea about the motor back so I
looked at it I thought wow this is a
great idea
and I said we could motorized it so
immediately we went out and started
getting some parts one of the biggest
hurdles was fitting all of this into a
carry-on size fact we wanted to retain
at least 85 percent of the interior
we've got CNC machine steering column
telescoping aluminum bars okay that pop
up we've got a lot of stuff that's
sitting on anything that's currently on
the market like 7.3 air with
motor banks deviled egg hey there we
were just a motor back whoa
rocking it it's so much fun it's amazing
just had a great opportunity to
accessorize the Moto back is great piece
of technology I'm really excited about
it you imagine that riding around on a
suitcase this thing is awesome it
handles great I can't even believe I'm
saying it like it I think looks great
oh they're cool they're really cool
they're fast - and you can charge on the
go
this is fantastic everyone should have a
moto back to the best I guess see where
I ready to be immediately and I really
have to be running and sweating in here

response cookies be unanimously positive
now you put on the bag once if you hit
the pegs or they hit the throttle just a
smile I don't is it super functional an
incredible amount of fun so after two
years are really hard work we're finally
ready to streamline our manufacturing
