the technology to transmit data
wirelessly also called RFID is
everywhere nowadays it offers
contactless data transmission with
rfid-enabled credit and debit cards
passport driving license store cards and
more providing amazing convenience and
time-saving for both consumers and
businesses alike but there is also a big
problem with RFID technology your data
can be stolen contactless to write from
your wallet so how is this possible
fraudsters and thieves can easily
acquire equipment that can access the
data stored on your cards from up to
several meters away so they can clone
your credit card take money from your
bank or use your identity for a host of
criminal activities and it's getting
worse in 2014 alone 31 million US
consumers had their credit cards hacked
over three times the number affected in
2013 so there has not been an RFID
security system that can truly keep your
card data safe until now hi my name is
Thomas and I would like to present you
the most advanced data protection for
your contactless credit cards and
rfid-enabled documents both card
combining cutting-edge technology with
massive R&amp;amp;D and developed on the same
principles as military jamming systems
vault card is the most advanced RFID
protection solution ever designed it
virtually ensures absolute safety of
your cards other products have tried to
protect your cards by covering them in
metal foil unfortunately it doesn't work
with high-powered scanning devices and
so how does this work are more
adjust over one millimeter thick you
simply place a single world card in the
middle of your wallet like so now all
your rfid-enabled cards are protected
within one and a half inches on either
side your wallet can be up to three
inches thick which as you can see is
more than adequate vault card which is
on automatically when it senses the
electromagnetic signal emitted by
hackers RFID scanner the stronger the
signal from the fifth scanner the
stronger jamming port card will generate
so your rfid-enabled cards will remain
protected even against the most powerful
scanning devices and rfid scheme
existence when you use your cards as
usual just make sure to hold them at
least eight inches away from vault card
what's more volt cart harnesses energy
extremely efficiently and doesn't
require a battery for its operation well
it doesn't mean that wall card actually
lasts and protects forever that's right
join our community so everyone can enjoy
a future of unmatched arif ID security
with a world card in your wallet
