team worked for Bremen car brands and we
develop visionary strategies for
connected car
whenever I look down at my handlebars it
seems that there's something a by
computer my iPhone the light and the Fox
switcher it wasn't an integrated and
connected experience it wasn't beautiful
so far we haven't seen an interface that
matches the needs of the modern cyclist
so we started from scratch

can think of into somewhere your bike
can live we faced a problem here at
hurdler studios every day we'd come in
to work with our bikes but we had no
good place to store them when we got
here with problem in hand we set out
designing the details to get a shape
that feels effortless to clog your bike
into place we've gone through a pile of
iterations tested to the point of
breaking and kept designing until we got

bike accessory in fact it's not meant to
be removed after each ride it installs
permanently on handlebar and pairs with
your smartphone to turn your bike into a
smart bunch and provide a biking

Nature can throw it be it rain dirt or

hi i'm kingsley fiat and i'm andrew
hagen we're the founders of cycling
company focused on developing high
definition camera and lighting
technology for cyclists technology is
great isn't it as cyclists we have
access to all kinds of high powered
lights and action cameras the problem
becomes when we try to fit them all on
our bike becomes a little awkward and
there's another challenge when cyclists
capture amazing videos we think it
should be easy to share the footage with
their mates from anywhere our solution
to these problems is fly 12 an
integrated high powered safety light and
HD action camera built into a single
compact device with Bluetooth and Wi-Fi
capability it connects to your smart
phone making video sharing a snap let's
take a closer look at 5 12
flashbulb puts out a massive 400
learners which lights up the road in the
dark and alerts motorists to your
presence to the daylight the light has a
constant anjo or flashing hope at three
different brightness settings
flight 12 captures full HD video in
1080p recorded in mp4 format onto a
removable and microSD card
unlike most action camera zone you never
have to worry about the memory card on
by 12 filling up it records in a
continuous loop so you won't need to
download any footage unless there's
something you really want to say while
flight 12 is perfect for recording
footage of an epic ride or race it's not
just an ordinary action camera it's
perfect for recording the action on all
your eyes just in case there's an
incident with a motorist a small running
time stamp is overlaid on all footage so
that the exact time and date of an
incident is recorded you never know what
you'll capture on your flight 12 and you
shouldn't have to wait until your
baggage computer to share it that's why
we're building Wi-Fi Bluetooth
connectivity into flights well just pair
it with your smartphone of the coffee
shop start sharing once connected to
your smartphone and companion app you
can access all the footage on your
flight 12 simply select the footage you
want save at your camera roll share it
with the world
the flight 12 app can synchronize the
video footage with Strava data it's
already on your phone allowing overlays
of bright statistics such as speed power
and heart rate you can even add virtual
tram lines to the video to show drivers
observing 350 safety laws the companion
also makes it easy to configure flash
drive using friendly touch interface of
your phone flight 12 packs a whopping
5,200 milliamp hours
providing up to 10 hours use and camera
only mode three times longer and other
top action camera brands as you can see
we've brought together interviewed
cycling technologies into a single
compact connected device without
compromising last year you helped us
deliver fly seek an integrated HD camera
to tail life as promised we're delivered
on time to nearly 2,000 backers around
the world
you've now asked us for a front-facing
device help us to deliver by 12:00 you
