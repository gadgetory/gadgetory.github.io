taste of cold brewed coffee that's why I
invented the great way to make it at
home the brew filter patent-pending cold
brew coffee is the kind of coffee of you
making cold water instead of hot water
and so that doesn't extract the acids
from a coffee bean so it's really smooth
really sweet and it's an amazing cup of
coffee so the first step is to take a
mason jar like this with coffee grounds
and you add some water to it awesome now
we just put the lid on and now this is
going to sit in the fridge for about 24
hours
next take the brew filter and put it
straw side down into your coffee
then you take an empty mason jar and you
put it on top now all you got to do is
flip it and give it a nice shake
tallip when you roll by lemon uses
bluetooth pain with their smartphone to
activate the voice recognition feature
what will the weather be like today
California will see some sunshine today
with the touch of a button
California roll can manage and send text
messages answer questions tell Peter
I'll be picking him and Sarah up in five
minutes
California roll by lemon produces a
virtually play sound in a
three-dimensional space thanks to NASA
solar technology California roll by
lemon is completely self sustainable
California roll is waterproof shockproof
and temperature proof
allowing your music to follow you from
the beach to the water put pairing
capabilities your smartphone can
wirelessly connect to multiple speakers
to pump up the volume and with our multi
hose feature music can be controlled by
up to three smartphones but of course
don't abuse this feature
limit elephant changing away you listen
to music and VR kit is the first only
one universal virtual reality kit in
addition to a hat set you also get a gun
or a joystick or even a lightsaber a
standard controller or a steering wheel
no problem hi I'm ginger I'm a sci-fi
fan I love virtual reality at maker Auto
bring any idea into reality I hope you
research on virtual reality for years
last year I quit my PhD and devoting
myself into the development of and VR
kids the Hat set allows you to have 360
degrees immersive experience the field
of view is 100 degrees diagonal it's
like having the bath seat in an IMAX
theatre NVR kit uses a full HD screen
each half of the screen is close to
square however our unique a spherical
lens ensures that you'll always see
things in standard ratio
with the a spherical lens there will be
no more aberration and we are kid works
in all of these platforms it has to lie
axis IMU sensors and the saver groups of
customizable buttons you can play any
game you like however you lack the
inertial navigation algorithm how do we
trust the motion of your head but also
the position of your body our one step
control mode allows you to control the
action of the character in the game with
one simple movement how about throwing a
grenade fire a whole OC pattern and
since their interfaces are open and
available to any developer for example
with an independent account because

doesn't matter if you wear glasses or

great option for people looking for a
wireless solution to experience virtual
reality

designed transformable bag you can use
it as a vest or pack up your entire kit
