taste of cold brewed coffee that's why I
invented the great way to make it at
home the brew filter patent-pending cold
brew coffee is the kind of coffee of you
making cold water instead of hot water
and so that doesn't extract the acids
from a coffee bean so it's really smooth
really sweet and it's an amazing cup of
coffee so the first step is to take a
mason jar like this with coffee grounds
and you add some water to it awesome now
we just put the lid on and now this is
going to sit in the fridge for about 24
hours
next take the brew filter and put it
straw side down into your coffee
then you take an empty mason jar and you
put it on top now all you got to do is
flip it and give it a nice shake
tallip when you roll by lemon uses
bluetooth pain with their smartphone to
activate the voice recognition feature
what will the weather be like today
California will see some sunshine today
with the touch of a button
California roll can manage and send text
messages answer questions tell Peter
I'll be picking him and Sarah up in five
minutes
California roll by lemon produces a
virtually play sound in a
three-dimensional space thanks to NASA
solar technology California roll by
lemon is completely self sustainable
California roll is waterproof shockproof
and temperature proof
allowing your music to follow you from
the beach to the water put pairing
capabilities your smartphone can
wirelessly connect to multiple speakers
to pump up the volume and with our multi
hose feature music can be controlled by
up to three smartphones but of course
don't abuse this feature
limit elephant changing away you listen
to music and VR kit is the first only
one universal virtual reality kit in
addition to a hat set you also get a gun
or a joystick or even a lightsaber a
standard controller or a steering wheel
no problem hi I'm ginger I'm a sci-fi
fan I love virtual reality at maker Auto
bring any idea into reality I hope you
research on virtual reality for years
last year I quit my PhD and devoting
myself into the development of and VR
kids the Hat set allows you to have 360
degrees immersive experience the field
of view is 100 degrees diagonal it's
like having the bath seat in an IMAX
theatre NVR kit uses a full HD screen
each half of the screen is close to
square however our unique a spherical
lens ensures that you'll always see
things in standard ratio
with the a spherical lens there will be
no more aberration and we are kid works
in all of these platforms it has to lie
axis IMU sensors and the saver groups of
customizable buttons you can play any
game you like however you lack the
inertial navigation algorithm how do we
trust the motion of your head but also
the position of your body our one step
control mode allows you to control the
action of the character in the game with
one simple movement how about throwing a
grenade fire a whole OC pattern and
since their interfaces are open and
available to any developer for example
with an independent account because
shoots anywhere you want our hashtag
will never make your eyes uncomfortable
the pupil distance is adjustable and it
doesn't matter if you wear glasses or
not just put on the headset there is
enough space for your glasses of course
using your own glasses is the best way
for you to see to ensure your safety you
can open the window now you can see
outside you can combat your friends and
conquer them with your strength and
agility this is the entry our kit
standard you can also try the wireless
version I just tried out the end VR
headset very interesting very happy to
see more headsets coming to market and I
think the end VR headset is certainly a
great option for people looking for a
wireless solution to experience virtual
reality
take out the battery reload and resume
your battle this is our originally
designed transformable bag you can use
it as a vest or pack up your entire kit
and take it anywhere of course we will
mail you the kid with this bag now in
Minnesota we will do best and for that
all you're gonna receive and to be our
kid hometown if you have any ideas
please don't has they're not house so
that we can make the end of your kid
better together thanks for giving into
this demo it's a really really great
experience I love I love VR I love the
category of VR so I'm really wishing you
luck with your Kickstarter we're based
in Beijing
we'll have fantastic production
resources our collaborator lkk is one of
the best industrial design companies in
China who have already finished the
development and design along with your
support that we can get the production
process begin our aim is for in virtual
reality before ball for everyone because
it's really fascinating</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
