to life pack the anti-theft
solar-powered backpack that keeps your
phone charged and your stuff safe let's
check it out the 21st century has
redefined the way that we live our lives
you're no longer tied to an office 37
percent of US workers say they work from
home in the past month that's up over
400 percent since 1995 I'm pretty sure
that your phone's been upgraded since
then and it's time that your bag was too
good life pack we've reinvented the
mobile office
does your phone battery ever die are you
ever worried about your bag getting
stolen or broken into do you have a hard
time keeping organized well lucky for
you life hacks here to save the day
let's start with why you're never gonna
have to deal with a dead phone again the
solar bank is a removable unit which has
a solar panel and battery with enough
power to charge an iPhone 6 up to 12
times you can charge the solar bank via
USB then when you're out and about the
solar panel keeps the power topped up
the solar bank also has built-in
Bluetooth speakers so you have great
sounding audio with you when you're on
the go
life pack has an integrated lock this
means you can lock the zipper shut when
you're on the go and what's really cool
about this lock is that you can actually
unlock the bag to something when you're
sitting still because of the unique
design of the zippers you can also lock
the zipper shut while locking it to a
fixed point the bottom of the cable
cannot be removed and the exit point is
reinforced so it's super strong also the
end of the lock works is a bottle opens
cheers salud so on things go the work
zone is incredibly organized is a
separate section for your laptop iPad
there's a space for your wallet there's
a key hook business cards pens there's
also a section for loose papers and a
separate pocket so you don't lose
receipts
in the light zone is a protected pocket
for your sunglasses as room for clothes
and end of your non-work stuff because
you don't want your undies falling out
in the work waiting because we all know
that that is that just me that's
happened to there are 4 hidden
compartments on this bag on your
shoulder straps or two pockets
these are big enough for credit cards
travel cards for the subway or Metro
cash loose change or even your
headphones pressed up to your back or
two more hidden pockets these are ideal
for your passport and boarding card when
traveling these pockets are even big
enough for an iPhone 6 plus and on one
side there's a USB plug that connects to
the solar mass so you can charge your
phone up while you're on the go we have
the vision in the plan to make this
happen but we need your pre-orders in

hey Kickstarter oh hey I don't know what
those last guys were talking about
because life since our last Kickstarter
project has been pretty sweet first we
went to not one but two genuine concerts
then thousands of you from around the
world started sending us photos of the
bag you helped create and most exciting
you told us that you wanted more more
more MORE it's a bag the daily is the
newest addition to our family the same
manal mix of rugged outdoor technology
and clean design but compact meaning you
stay professional and efficient all day
a day the daily comes with our custom
seam sealed rain cover fully tuck away
straps and a bunch of organization for
your essentials again we prioritize easy
access and the bags compact size enabled
a full lie flat laptop compartment
meaning and even smoother path through
security and last but not least the
daily fits inside the carry-on laptop
compartment did someone say carry-on I
think yeah I know you said carry-on
now we love our firstborn dearly but
after thousands of hours of real-world
testing and feedback we knew it was time
for some genetic engineering
the internal pockets are now 3d meaning
like a million times more space for your
stuff
the new site hook system makes it even
easier to get inside the bag adds a
secure mode option and increases
compression the shoulder stabilizer
clips are now magnets
we gave the backpack straps their kepada
ng for extra comfort re-engineered the
carry handles for a smoother feel and a
less decayed at the drink cord for
quicker access and a better whole
something something amazing laptop
system your electronics are safer than
