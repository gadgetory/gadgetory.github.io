I've always loved writing that feeling
of being one with the road till your
headphones Bob
I see deal with this all the time I'd be
riding earbuds on in the zone and then
all of a sudden it was like somebody
turned up the wind noise 211 when Eman
told me about this I knew exactly what
he was going through there were so many
times when my earbuds would fall out I'd
miss a call while riding but I couldn't
hear anything while I was on highway I
knew there had to be a better product
out there for riders so we looked and
looked and looked nothing we immediately
decided to solve this problem once and
for all we wanted to create the best set
of earbuds for riders what we came up
with is one of the most unique designs
this space has ever seen introducing
slim buds slim bots are earbuds designed
with the rider in mind sitting flush
with the ear you'll never have to worry
about your helmet interfering with your
listening experience ever again and with
strategic microphone placement your
calls will always be crystal clear
without having to worry about windows
we've built slim BOTS with passive noise
isolation technology allowing for the
most immersive audio experience you've
ever had while writing at us safety is
very important to us as good as our slim
but sound we are equally focused on
keeping you safe while riding inside the
chin mic there's a secondary microphone
dedicated to picking up and relaying
environmental noise this means that
you'll hear horns sirens and anything
else you need to hear while riding if
riding in a pack is more your speed we
know how important communication can be
use the eos app to add your friends to
your chat now you can talk to them with
just the push of a button using the slim
remote our Wireless handlebar controller
the slim remote connects via bluetooth
and allows you to control your audio
make phone calls and activate voice
commands all while riding
are you ready for the best audio
experience you've ever had while riding
pledge today and help us bring slim
butts to the market thank you
once the head is seated completely
repeat the lashing process two to three
more times working your way up the spear
head and locking the spear head in using
the remaining 550 cord tie a series of
overhand knots to connect the two
remaining tag ends together if you are
mounting the four prong spear begin by
quartering the end of the pole wedge the
large fork in the pole first partially
seat the fork the same as earlier once
the fork is seated create the first
group of lashing to ensure your pole
does not split further read the small
fork into the large fork be sure to line
up the fork with the quartered opening
completely seat the spear heads up to
the base of the prongs create the final
groups of lashing and tie the remaining
ends together
people try to lose fat in different ways
some exercise some diet and some do
nothing
but are they happy with the results yeah
except for these thunder thighs
well this mommy told me is impossible
these handles don't get much love let's
face it we all have those stubborn areas
of fat we just can't get rid of meat
silicon lipo the first targeted fat
reduction device for home use that
really works no diet no exercise simply
use Silk'n lipo for just 15 minutes a
day and get results no diet no exercise
only 15 minutes a day that's right just
eight weeks targeting stubborn areas
will reduce fat and strengthen
underlying muscles so you can give your
body the shape you've always wanted
I don't know Silk'n lipo really works
Silk'n lipo uses the same proven
technology found in a large professional
light therapy machines found in the
world's most advanced and expensive
beauty clinics we've simply shrunk that
same technology into the first-ever
affordable easy-to-use home device to
make it even better we've combined the
low-level light therapy with electrical
muscle stimulation technologies EMS to
optimize the fat reduction and
strengthen underlying muscles
low level light therapy is a proven
technology for the permanent reduction
of fat with years of clinical experience
in my own clinic low level light therapy
is one of the most popular it can
permanently slim firm and shape areas
without downtime without pain without
discomfort without the side effects
associated with traditional surgical
treatments when I first heard that
they've been able to compact lower light
therapy into a simple little home device
I was understandably skeptical but when
I reviewed the basic science and the
results I've come to realize the Silk'n
lipo is as effective as some of my large
body contouring low light therapy
systems I use in the office that the
patient can use 15 minutes a day and
over the same kind of permanent fat
contouring and body slimming results
I've been able to achieve within office
treatments how does it work that is
accumulated by your body and stored in
fat cells under your skin Silk'n lipo
uses specifically calibrated frequencies
of light to perforate fat cell walls
releasing their fatty contents and
harmlessly causing shrinkage in the
region once outside the cell your body's
natural processes flush the fatty acids
out of your system in the same natural
way regular dietary fibers expelled to
accelerate this process and to help
build strength and muscle tone so can
added EMS technology this stimulates
muscle activity and circulation in the
treated area speeding up the rate at
which the excess fat is flushed out of
your system leaving your body looking at
silk'n the pioneers of permanent hair
removal technology shrunk down for home
use now brings you clinically proven
non-invasive fat reduction technology to
let you target those stubborn areas and
give your body the shape you want one
