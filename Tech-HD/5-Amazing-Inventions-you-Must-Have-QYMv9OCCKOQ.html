I really love it when people get
together five years ago I built a
wood-fired oven in my garden everybody
thought I was mad until they tried my
pizza we live in an age where people are
just so glued to their smartphones in
social networks building an oven in my
garden really changed the way I
socialize it had such an impact on my
life that I just had to share what I
found this is how what box was born
what boxes are compact insulated stone
floor oven that gets up to temperatures
of 500 degrees in less than 10 minutes
Rock box was designed to bring would
fight cooking to everybody
yes it cooks amazing heater in 90
seconds but what box is so much more
than that it roasts bakes hot smokes
cold smokes and on top of that it's
portable and right way
it's taken three years of development
and engineering because I haven't
compromised on any aspect of the wotwots
design
I've given everything I have to get what
box to the line pitch to rich will
really help me cross that
