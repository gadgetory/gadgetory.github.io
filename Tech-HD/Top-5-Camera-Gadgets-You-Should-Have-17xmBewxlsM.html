years we've kick-started for products
that expand your camera's capabilities
and now we've built the best remote
trigger we can imagine this is pulse the
most powerful way to control your camera
from your smile
pulse lets you take a photo without
having to touch or shake your camera so
you can get sharp images in any
conditions or capture moments where you
can't be next to your camera the pulse
isn't just a trigger it gives you all
the functionality you expect from
shooting with your DSLR or mirrorless
camera but remotely from your smartphone
you can change all of your camera
settings through the app or just check
your histogram and make sure everything
is looking good
unlike other triggers pulse lets you
start and stop video too and because you
can control up to 3 cameras at once you
can get all the right angles for your
shot even if you are just a team of one
pulse is also the most powerful
time-lapse trigger on the market so if
you are taking your very first time
lapse or getting the holy grail of time
lapses a day to night transition we've
designed pulse to give you maximum
control we started alpine labs because
Kickstarter backers like you believed in
our ideas initially we were inspired to
make better tools for time-lapse and
this year we started focusing on camera
control and remote triggers the products
out there were either cheap or lacked
functionality and some solutions just
wouldn't fit in our camera bags we
wanted a product that was sleek fit
beautifully with your camera and gave
you complete control wherever you were
shooting so we got to work and design
pulse your support gives us the ability
to build the best products we can
imagine and to continue to work on new
ideas from all of us at alpine labs
thank you
you
the Hercules
Hercules is the world's smallest motion
control camera system and allows anyone
to capture stunning cinematic video
footage with virtually any camera
conventional motion control systems
create beautiful shots but they're huge
bulky expensive difficult to use what if
there was a way to have a device that
captured the same type of footage as
those enormous expensive rigs that was
small enough and light enough to fit in
your pocket and take with you anywhere
just like your smartphone what if it was
easy enough to use that anyone from a
professional photographer or
videographer all the way down to someone
whose only experience with photography
is their smartphone who learn to use it
easily and intuitively we took all those
what if questions and answer them with
the Hercules
the Hercules easily gets traditional
slider moves
curve moves
motorized dolly shots motion control
time lapses automated panoramas
all in the palm of your hand Hercules is
incredibly tough
the hercules is durable and living up to
its name the hercules is strong able to
support pretty much any camera out there
from the smallest actioncam smartphone
DSLR all the way up to a full-size
motion picture camera the hercules can
go from being in your pocket to being
assembled programmed and shooting within
30 seconds the hercules on its own is
incredibly versatile and can be used
almost anywhere with the optional rail
you can use it as a traditional slider
or elevated shots
or for even more dynamic moves
it's easily programmable with a single
button we won't have the Hercules to be
small and we also wanted to make sure
that it wouldn't require some
specialized rechargeable battery that
would be difficult to find in a pinch so
it runs off of a single triple-a battery
the Hercules was designed through the
collaboration of electrical engineers
robotics designers software developers
and filmmakers the hercules is
manufactured using the highest quality
materials and state-of-the-art equipment
the hercules is not vaporware this is
not something that has yet to be
designed or tested or built it's here
today ready to go

distinctive look of these photos is near
impossible to achieve using Photoshop
system tests so why we're bringing the
lens back two centuries after it was
first created well the original Petzval
lens was designed in order to work with
cameras manufactured in the 19th century
it's extremely hard to find a Petzval
length today which works well with
smaller format cameras and produces the
same unique effect and the Petzval
lenses you do find are usually defective
because of their age that's why we set
ourselves the exciting challenge to
produce a brand new Petzval lens with
21st century the lenses are crafted from
brass just like the original Petzval
lens was and they look amazing when
connected to your SLR camera each lens
is produced in Russia by ZENIT's a
company steeped in tradition and famed
for their skill in developing high
quality optical equipment the team at
Zenit have redrawn recalculated and
Ramesh's the original 1840 pets our lens
to make it work with a whole host of
modern cameras in reinventing the pet
file we have had to re-engineer the
optics of the original lens and make
them work with modern SLR cameras while
still retaining the effects that have
made the original pet sloppiness
hi Kickstarter I'm Oliver and I'm
Richard we are the creators of Eiffel Oh
a portable dolly for professional and
amatuer needs we quickly realized there
was a lot of professional equipment
accessories that had not yet been made
accessible to the public
limiting video possibilities up until
now mostly all accessories were too
heavy and bulky restricting filming and
making long shots impossible for any
spontaneous or solo filmmaking I flow
opens up a whole new range of video
possibilities for any kind of filmmaker
Ifill stabilizes camera movements
enabling a fluid professional-quality
shot no matter where you're filming
lightweight powerful and easy to use the
I flow is designed for compact cameras
SLR cameras and smartphones so when it's
time to film simply attach your smart
phone or any other device swing up to
two pounds and latch your I flow to any
flat surface around you it's that simple
made with premium reinforced plastic
materials the eyeful is less than eight
inches long and weighs less than 1 pound
it's soft polyurethane wheels add
smoothness to your movements and absorbs
any vibrations created by the surface
the I flow can be used both horizontally
and vertically of even incline
perspective bring I flow anywhere and
everywhere and I flow will bring your
video to higher levels
it's heavy-duty clamp structure
surrounds the surface and stabilizes the
dolly as a set of two springs secures
the I float tightly to any surface
ranging from 1/4 inch to 2 inches wide
you need a wider angle you simply have
to pull the wheels and change the angle
to the wide surface position if you
prefer to use I flow on a flat surface
open the clamp system to its maximum and
the lock system will automatically keep
I flow in position
my name is serious and then the founder
of cool I founded the company three
years ago to bring 3d photography to
anyone we are here on Kickstarter so you
can use your own camera to take 3d
pictures we have developed two different
devices to take 3d pictures and videos
hoola deeper this for your SLR cooler
Peppa is going smartphone our aim it's
processing software cooler code can
transform the images and videos to
basically any 3d formats available now
you will be able to use your own camera
to take 3d pictures and videos
that's where new person
hula hoops on the lover
every time
- we are going to use the funding from
Kickstarter for production of Kula
deeper and cooler bed please let us
bring 3d photography to your memories
and plans for a project thank you very
much
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
