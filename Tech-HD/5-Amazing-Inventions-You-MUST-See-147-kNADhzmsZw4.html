the
act as a creation story a legend so to
speak about how things came to me this
story is one of rebirth the first thing
I say when people ask I'm signing
overboard is no it will not catch on
fire
one family saying the hoverboard they
bought for their son ignite any
youngsters this year want a hoverboard
exploding up some say a big recall kebab
so why would anyone in their right mind
make another hoverboard well came to
life when this aerospace engineer and
this electric vehicle engineer were
hand-picked by this entrepreneur to
believe they could do something better
so their journey began with the question
how did everyone get it wrong to think
of that up he's got leaked to the source
the boards that were coming out of China
shocked us the necessary steps to
produce a skateboard distinct exist in
his assembly line it was how fast and
how cheap can be produced and sell to
America who were unsafe we visited those
factories we saw bad conditions of not
only the workers but of manufacturing
techniques we came back here and sided
to make you better
and they did just that sleeves rolled up
this team hit the reset button
determined to avoid mistakes of the past
blazed a new path to the future so from
the ground up
they built move from scratch right here
in the good ol US of A everything is
custom designed to make not only a
unique ride but completely safe product
traditional hoverboards really seem like
toys we wanted something more robust
more sturdy something that you know felt
solid underneath her feet you heard him
right
this board is no toy it's a machine
built to be ridden with a solid platform
and larger wheels move is ready to hit
the trail
and when you need a break it's easy to
safely hop off and carry they keep
traveling with move a breeze you might
wonder if it suits all types of riders
well Goldilocks they thought of that too
one issue that we saw with traditional
hoverboards was new riders seem to
struggle to to learn to ride the board
what we developed was custom ride
profiles that would help the new riders
learn but yet gave the advanced riders
the nimbleness and quick ride that
they're looking carving with move feels
different intelligent ride sensors help
the board view like you're skiing
skateboarding or even surfing just wind
out the waves this board is really fun
to ride it's not just getting you from
point A to point B it's allowing you to
have fun while you're getting being
outside just beyond the open roads
there's not much like that so this is
radical move smarter stronger better and
unlike 271 Ford Pinto this pony won't
blow up the future is here and it's on
the move
