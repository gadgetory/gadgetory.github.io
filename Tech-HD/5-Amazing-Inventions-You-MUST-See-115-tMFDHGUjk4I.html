we need your help we've already designed

affordable price we need to make a large
investments like purchasing molds and
finalizing the firmware please support
us by backing this Kickstarter sharing
with your friends and giving us feedback
on what you think would make this
product awesome
you
before we became parents in 2011 we
really didn't think about toys and what
they were made of every birthday party
we go to we receive these cheap plastic
toys and they sort of litter our house
and your kids find them in the trash and
they're like why why did you ruin my
life now we really care about what toys
our kids play with and the materials
that they're made from we started
designing and making our own wooden toys
in our garage
what's that Vivian we're doing our video
honey
we started designing and making our own
toys in our garage and I had no
woodworking experience prior to this so
I'm pretty happy that I still have all
ten of my fingers earth tiles are wooden
shapes that have magnets embedded safely
inside they snap together to make
buildings rockets dodecahedron
whatever your kids have the imagination
for the key is it doesn't matter which
way you orient them they always snap
together so kids don't get frustrated
open-ended toys spark imagination
creativity and problem-solving skills
kids learn to understand spatial
relationships and even the fundamentals
of geometry there's also something about
wood that makes Earth tiles really
comforting for kids to touch and hold
our kids love building with their tiles
you leave them with a pile and they'll
keep themselves busy for hours we all
love our kids and it didn't make much
sense to us to make toys that actually
harm the environment in which they live
for the rest of their lives we make
Earth tiles from sustainable hardwoods
and we use kid and earth friendly
finishes so you don't have to freak out
when your kid picks one up and starts
licking it we wanted to make sure Earth
tiles were safe for our kids so we put
them through strict third-party testing
and made sure that they met all safety
standards so you can rest easy when your
kids are playing with them
this Kickstarter will allow us to place
an initial order with our manufacturer
and allow us to get the toys out to you
you can help launch earth tiles by
becoming a backer and supporting our
campaign your kid will get a set before
anyone else and you'll be helping the
toy industry for good Kickstarter is all
or nothing so we need to raise 100% of
our goal if we don't then all the money
will be returned and we'll all be sad
while the toy industry continues to make
crappy toys thanks for supporting our
project and please tell your friends and
your enemies yes
tell your enemies to we'll take their
money
I just had everything bagel anything see
you have a poppy seed in your teeth are
you looking at my nose
oh we're looking at your face earth
tiles are magnetic building tiles made
from sustainably source What's Wrong
