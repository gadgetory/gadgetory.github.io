is very easy to use bling check will
connect to both your phone and bling
helmet so you can use it to control the
lights on the helmet use the walkie
talkie take incoming calls or play your

contains a battery so it can also be

the best part of the live all products
is the live all writing app it's

devices to measure and display different
parameters of your body or your eye it
measures slope rate gradient altitude

this is the Copenhagen wheel it turns
your ordinary bicycle into a smart
electric hybrid by simply replacing your
back wheel connected to your smartphone
download the app and you're ready to go
bicycles are a great way to move around
it sometimes distances are too long
phil's can get in the way and hard
journeys to work may leave you covered
in sweat the Copenhagen wheel is here to
change all of that
Copenhagen wheel learns how you pedal
and integrates seamlessly with your
motion it captures your energy when you
break or go downhill and gives you a
push when you need it with three to ten
times your regular foot power it's easy

is contained within the red casing
including motor removable batteries

your bike and transform the city the
Copenhagen wheel
you
and no key we thought the lock industry
could use a little shaking up so we
created the no keypad lock the world's
first smart padlock no key is won
numerous awards and has been recognized
as a game-changing innovation however
some people need an extra level of
protection so we created the no PU lock
incorporating all the cutting-edge
technology used in the original no key
into a practically indestructible
hardened steel body the no key you lock
will protect your bicycle or motorbike
in the toughest environments while also
giving you easy access using only your
smartphone available with an app for iOS
Android and Windows phones the no key
you lock uses wireless Bluetooth
technology when clicked it automatically
looks for a phone with a compatible key
and unlocks you don't even need to
remove your phone from your pocket or
purse just click and go no more worrying
about lost keys or forgotten
combinations sharing your bike with
others is easy with just a couple taps
you can quickly and securely share your
bike with your friends even better you
can revoke access automatically without
needing to track down keys the no key
you lock incorporates a long-life
rechargeable battery that will last
several years between charges but we
wanted the no key you lock to do even
more so we added an alarm after locking
no key pull down the button to arm the
alarm function if someone tampers with
your no key for more than three seconds
a loud alarm will shriek for 30 seconds
trying attention and likely scaring off
the intruder the alarm function resets
every time you open no key the history
function in the app shows you who when
and where no key was used what if your
phone dies or is lost not a problem just
key in your custom quick click code this
ensures that you'll never be left
stranded
in the unlikely event that you ignore
the warning in the app and let your
battery die you can always give Nokia a
jump start with an external battery
finally maybe you don't have a
smartphone or prefer to bike without it
we've got you covered just add the
optional key fob to your order and
you'll be able to access no key with or
without your smart phone no key no
problem
I inherited my love of the outdoors from
my dad being outside made him feel alive
unfortunately it also killed him
my father lost his life to skin cancer
which is why I've created the blue clear
visor
I began looking for a bike helmet that
protected my face from the Sun and found
aerodynamic cool and fashionable helmets
but I couldn't find one that protected
my entire face often I see people
wearing baseball caps under the helmets
so I knew I wasn't the only one who
wanted protection
I spoke with dermatologists and worked
with the team of industrial designers
and product engineers who hailed from
renowned silicon valley design firms
together we developed a visor that
blocks 98% of UV rays it's simple to
install and it's super easy to put on
and take off it has peripheral vision
and lets you choose a degree of coverage
skin cancer is the most diagnosed cancer
in the US with 5 million people treated
each year but with skin cancer
protection can mean prevention and that
means the world to me because bike
riding and sunshine are supposed to make
us healthy not sick but making a
reliable quality product is expensive to
be cost effective the durable UV
blocking polycarbonate can only be
purchased in extremely large quantities
also the rubber edging and helmet mounts
require tooling which is why I need your
help starting my project
