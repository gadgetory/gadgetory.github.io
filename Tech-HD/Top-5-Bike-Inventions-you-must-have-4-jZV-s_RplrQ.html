original this new version of Revo lights
will provide unprecedented 360-degree
visibility with a functional headlight
that allows you to see where you're
going in a smart taillight that can
sense your speed and will flash when
slowing down
we're on IndieGoGo to add the next level
of function into our newest version of
lights
we want to add in the ability to connect
our already smart lights to your phone
to provide a number of awesome features
for starters real time battery life so
you can make sure your lights are always
ready for your next ride with Eclipse
the battery now snaps directly into the
ring making it much more accessible
while removing any need for cables or
parts near the hub and making
installation a snap we want our lights
to work with any riding style so this
new version will include a feature that
recognizes the time of day and turns the
lights on for you if it senses you're
about to ride to achieve the lighting
effect Revo lights calculate your speed
and for the first time we'll be able to
give you this data so you can accurately
track your speed and distance and work
towards writing goals when developing
Revo lights we focused on creating
innovative essential tools for commuters
like handlebar activated turn signals to
make it easier to grab a drivers
attention when turning we also plan to
add features for any commuter like
weather alerts letting you know ahead of
time what to expect and ensuring you
never get caught without your jacket but
with all these added functions we wanted
to make sure your lights are secure so
just like with the previous version of
our lights they are designed to be
locked up along with your wheels so if
you do have to leave your bike on the
street you don't have to worry about
removing them or having them stolen
beeline cycling the
that will change the way you think about
city navigation putting the fun and
adventure back into your rhyme with
beeline simply pick a destination and
you're good to go the device shows you
the distance in the direction to head in
the rest is up to you know turn left
turn right no route you choose your
turns based on the direction of the
arrow you're quite used to being told go
this way go that way go this way go that
way
and you actually don't enjoy the journey
you're just trying to get to where
you're going
whereas I think when you just know the
bearing and you're just cycling you
actually think oh that rose more
interesting I'm gonna go down here or I
fancy weaving through these roads it
just makes it a bit more relaxing but
more of an adventure so I like the fact
that you're sort of involved in the
navigation and you're actually trying to
align you know the route you're taking
exactly with the b-line arrow and when
you get that sort of spot time it's
actually quite fun you never feel like
you missed a turn if it's dangerous you
don't have to take that turn it just
takes the stress out situation having
lived in London for four years I was
very fixed on set routes in and out of
work
beeline has opened up the city for me
let me discover new areas a new path I
would have used before this morning I
knew once you come over London Bridge I
like the fact that I can add that as a
waypoint on the app this didn't even
start as an idea for a product we were
just getting lost and thought we'd stick
some compasses on our bikes to help that
then we thought we made that better
obviously this compass idea is a little
bit different to conventional navigation
so we weren't sure if it would work we
made an app to test that and we were
just like whoa this is way better than
we thought it would be we thought we
might get stuck down little streets
whatever just didn't happen everywhere
we went it just seamlessly got you
through there in a really nice fun way
where you were exploring the city we had
this idea about a year ago and since
then we've brought into the team all the
expertise that we've needed to get
beeline to where it is today we made
beeline visible under any conditions by
giving any paper screen and a backlight
its shockproof it's rain proof another
normal usage is battery should last
around four weeks the next step is to go
into full production and that's why
we're here on Kickstarter we may be like
hi y'all I'm Jeremy wolf passionate
cyclist casual runner designer and
founder of luminous a brand creating
next-generation intelligent clothing and
accessories designed to save lives after
graduating from NC State in textile
fashion product development I
successfully got my brand seated and
chased my dream out to California where
we've been hard at work bringing
luminous to life I couldn't be more
excited to share with the world and
Kickstarter what we have been working on
and why we think you should be brighter
being seen as essential and fashionable
tech laced apparel to prevent accidents
from ever occurring is our solution our
patent-pending software controls via
Bluetooth Low Energy what the lights do
when they do it and even the color in
which they do it that's what makes
luminous the safest solution ever
developed we also know people want to
look good I did study fashion design so
making our line something you're proud
to wear irrespective of the safety
benefits was a priority now kick back
for a second and let us show you some of
the coolest features of the app light
interaction
after you enter your destination to the
Luminess app it knows where you're going
and where you should be turning and so
it automatically engages turn signals
and universally recognized amber color
for maximum visibility getting
rear-ended running and walking or went
on a bike or motorcycle is one of the
most severe impacts and because we were
able to determine when you're
decelerating we display a red brake
light to bring additional attention to
you at that critical moment over one
third of serious accidents occur
intersections and because we're pulling
our data from Google Maps we know
exactly when you're approaching and have
created an optimal strobe flash sequence
to maximize visibility in this danger
zone because you're likely competitive
as well as concerned with your safety we
integrated a performance meter that
allows you to input your desired pace
and get immediate visual feedback
telling you if you're below on or even
above pace
you
at relight we are designing the future
of bike battery-free
near six neodymium magnets are powered
by magnetic fields generated by the
rotating aluminum rim on your bike
when driving two high-powered LEDs light
up the road
when stopping the backup systems
low-power LEDs keep you safe from
traffic
this advanced friction-free technology
is wrapped in a bold design enabling
easy mount and adjustment we are ready
to bring this iconic new typology to
market securing your future visibility
on wheels
you only need one more light neo
we set out to bring a new level of
engineering and craftsmanship to the
bicycle bell our goal was simple create
a compact versatile Bell with powerful
sound the bowel design process started
crafting the perfect dome for this we
worked with Bevan Brothers in
Connecticut a company with over a
hundred years experience in the art of
crafting bells together we've developed
a dome that is compact but with an
unexpectedly loud and lasting ring
you
no bail is complete without a proper
hammer we've crafted an elegantly simple
wire lever
we wanted a bell that would mount any
handlebar this meant engineering an
entirely new mounting system
all components come together to create a
thoroughly better Bell</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
