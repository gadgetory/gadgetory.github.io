it up but we're tired of lighters that
blow out in the wind and run out of fuel
introducing two new ways to light it up
spark your flip and sparker with
sparkler flip is the rechargeable
solution for disposable lighters it's
slim teardrop design fits easily into
your pocket or bag with a simple button
push the powerful electric arcs are
revealed and packed a punch sparkler
flips secondary bottom button makes
lighting up those hard-to-reach places
comfortable and easy
sparker wick lets you reach even further
designed with an extendable six inch
neck tilted head and cross pattern spark
the wick easily takes on candles
barbecues and more USB rechargeable and
windproof bulb sparkers give you the
flexibility to reach further and light
more join us as we ditch the disposable
lighter and start sparking please back
or share our project how much time do
you spend sitting on a chair at your
workplace 1012 hours a day or even 20
like I do hello I'm Steve and I have
created brand new wheels for the office
chairs
really cool ones well sliding and strong
they will easily roll overlying cords
without damaging both them and your
floor they are silent below in the dark
and were designed to increase your
comfort and get rid of that common
fatigue you get so used to by the end of
every working day
exploring office chairs I realized that
wills so are as much important for them
as they are for the cars for example the
chair with the bad wheels will break
much faster won't it Jess
starting to create the super wheel I
went through all the existing problems
and took up solving them today we can
find only standard plastic wheels and a
couple of alternatives standard plastic
wheels damaged floor coverings and make
us spend money on the plastic mats they
cut the chords of the office equipment
and increase your exhaust 'men during
the day making you carry the chair again
and again moreover they are very fragile
collect tear and trash so summarizing
all that regular small plastic wheels
are actually a big evil should be fought
immediately it will like this seems an
alternative to a standard one but in
fact they create their own useless
troubles they increase the height of the
seat which will make your legs swell due
to weak construction the bearings often
fall out of it and the cross piece of
the chair itself quickly breaks down
this is the sound camp we use it to make
sound visible the system is simple
lightweight portable and robust there
are 64 microphones here that record
acoustical data the sound can then
evaluates the data it analyzes how long
the different sounds have traveled then
calculates the exact positions of their
sources and displays the information
visually it's kind of like GPS there's a
touchscreen on the back that makes the
system easy to operate we can use
various different filters for example a
frequency filter that hones in on
whichever specific sound source we are
interested in and displays it
specifically the possibilities are
virtually unlimited from household
appliances to electronic devices to
straight traffic or building noise the
potential uses are multifaceted and
basically endless this system makes
sounds and noise
concretely visible so we can understand
not only why an object is loud we can
also see exactly where the sound is
coming from then we can take conclusive
measures to improve the situation
at SIA he we develop all the software
for our projects completely in-house and
that means from the fpga and it's
algorithms right down to the user
interface
speaking of which we place a priority on
making the user interface easy to
operate that means that anyone can use
the software and the product the program
also features an expert mode for
scientists and engineers
this mode enables more precise settings
as well as high resolution algorithms to
help solve complex tasks we started
working on these acoustic cameras 15
years ago at the time they were just
independent systems each of which was an
extremely complex project of its own
sometimes it took us two hours to set up
before we could start recording data but
thanks to the rapid pace of
digitalization in recent years along
with the development of high-performance
smartphones and other devices there are
now electronic components available that
are both low in price and high in
quality as a result it's now possible to
offer the sound cam as a single unit we
do all the hardware development
ourselves in-house that's extremely
important because we bring together a
large number of different components
there are they 64 microphones and the
camera then there's the power management
for the rechargeable batteries and the
charging circuit all that had to be
combined on a printed circuit board then
everything is configured using an FPGA
we have extremely high data rates the
sixty four microphones alone is like
capturing 64 CD players simultaneously
the data has to be processed online and
then displayed on the screen the only
way we can do all that in this compact
size is by developing all the software
and hardware in one place here at our
company
is lankan the sound king will help a lot
of people with their work their hobbies
and in ways that we can't even foresee
today it will help make the world a
little quieter now we need to set up an
efficient production process to
manufacture the sound cam and series at
a low price that's why we are asking for
your help on Kickstarter
let's have a bit of fun
my love if you feel like I do right now
don't say your honor
to the other side
but you know
really
but you know</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
