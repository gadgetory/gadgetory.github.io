keeping you awake no that's it that's
the sound of knowing you won't sleep
tonight you are not a born snore it can
develop at any time up to 64 percent of
couples have a snoring partner and it
makes 25% of couples sleep apart and
it's not just your relationship that's
in danger
your health is - when you fall asleep
your jaw relaxes and drops back closing
down your airway to the point where it
vibrates as you breathe this doesn't
just keep the whole house awake it also
stops you from getting the deep
refreshing sleep you need and that can
have serious implications for in your
life such as fatigue irritability
headaches restlessness poor
concentration diminished productivity
and adverse effects on your heart and
brain you could spend hundreds of
dollars on quick fix solutions with bold
claims and disappointing results
you could just grin and bear it or you
can try Snorlax these super simple
strips are easy to apply and comfortable
to wear and they're quick and painless
to remove 100% cotton and fully
biodegradable Snorlax keeps your jaw in
its normal position and your airway open
stopping your snore in its tracks our
prototypes have already rescued
countless relationships restoring health
and harmony but we need your support to
get Snorlax into full production back us
on Kickstarter and help us ensure
Snorlax isn't just the best solution on
the market it's the most affordable - we
can't fix everything but a good night
sleeps a great place to start
sleep soundly with Snorlax
here it goes son we believe the son is
capable of powering our lives so we
create solar powered devices to feel the
world today we're excited to release the
go son go
a solar stove that roasts a meal in
minutes can be taken anywhere works any
day it remains cool to touch no matter
how hot just like it's named the go son
go comes in a bomb-proof package ready
for outdoor adventure or relaxing at
home with friends if you're craving a
hot drink or need to sterilize water
flip the adjustable stand and use it
vertically to boil 14 ounces are ready
in as little as 30 minutes the secret to
our breakthrough technology is the solar
vacuum tube which acts as a perfect
insulator trapping your food's moisture
and flavor cooking made us human and it
continues to bring us together
it's an international language and an
art as a kid I was encouraged to explore
and pretty much do whatever I wanted and
I was really attracted to cooking
because of the creative process involved
it's like my creative outlet even to
this day and I love gathering friends
and family together and serving up a hot
plate of food
I'm Patrick Sherwin and I'm a solar
energy guy I've been working with
renewable energy for a long time and I
came up with go Sun five years ago and
we rotation a big dream trying to fit
fuel free cooking into the bellies of
people around the world it's clean easy
and healthy and for some people this may
be the only alternative where they're
not burning something for dinner tonight
most people think that Solar is too
expensive or that it doesn't work so go
Sun has made an affordable solution
that's four times more efficient than
solar panels and works its magic
whenever needed packed with power and
free from batteries the gosun go is
something you can take anywhere to cook
up a hot meal or drink with a no effort
no gas no fire no safety hazard and no
mess to clean up
the gosun go is like a ticket to an
adventure with no strings attached
there's no fuel to burn there's no mess
to clean up it's in this tiny little
case that you can take anywhere you cook
just about anything through the clouds
through the freezing cold all just with
the power of the sunlight now what more
could you want
when it comes to outdoor cooking we're
just getting better at burning and
smoking meat that's the same thing we've
been doing for 350,000 years go son
invites you to join the 21st century
solar revolution we want you to
experience the magic of the Sun and
share its goodness stored space should
never get in your way that's why we made
go space a portable wireless hub that
frees up space on your devices upload
directly to cloud services or swap out
as d cards for unlimited storage a 5g
wireless connection ensures fast
transfer speeds between up to 8 devices
for secure transfer between friends and
with wireless charging you'll always
have the power to stay connected free
