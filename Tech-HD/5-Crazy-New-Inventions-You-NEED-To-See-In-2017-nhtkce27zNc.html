you
you
does this situation look familiar you're
flipping your pillow at night
desperately trying to fall asleep Munna
is a unique device that understands your
sleeping pattern and regulates your head
temperature to help you get the best
possible seat Munna will help you to
start your day feeling fully recovered
and energetic sleep well live well hi
I'm David and this is Colleen and we're
the founders of Munna for years it took
me hours every night to fall asleep so
we decided to do something about it
together we developed a product that not
only gets you to sleep faster but also
helps you get the best sleep until it's
time for you to wake up so how do we do
that with temperature
temperature is the key to good sleep to
fall asleep our body needs to cool down
and lower temperatures help us get a
better sleep quality when we wake up it
is the opposite our body needs to warm
up and our head plays a critical role in
this temperature regulation that's why
munna improves your sleep by regulating
your pillow temperature simply place the
device on your bedside table insert the
pad into your pillowcase and use the app
to set the wakeup time the temperature
of the pad is regulated through a water
circulation system which cools down as
you lay in bed to help you fall asleep
faster sleep and environment sensors
combined with machine learning help
understand your perfect sleeping pattern
and regulate the temperature accordingly
when it's time Munna will gently warm up
and wakey of naturally with the app you
will get key insights on your sleep and
how to improve it further
we believe that is not about how long
you sleep but how well you sleep so by
improving your night munna also improve
your day body temperature is very
important for sleep quality Simona is
one of the best sleep technology to
improve sleep we've done more than 200
user tests and have an ongoing clinical
study we have spent the last four months
in Shenzhen China working closely with
manufacturers to make sure we have a
great design and can ship a quality
product on time to our backers we've
been working on this project for nearly
two years now
and we're finally ready for production
we want to bring you better sleep now
all we need is your supports thank you
hi I'm chef Kerry with the Food Channel
do you shy away from marinating meat
because of the mess there's a better way
this ingenious gadget from chefs planet
it's called the flavor enhancer it
allows you to safely tenderize and
flavor eyes all of your favorite meats
let me show you you can see the
stainless steel blades tenderizing the
meat and injecting just the right amount
of flavor and look how versatile it is I
can use it with any type or cut of meat
with it's fast and delicious results the
flavor enhancer from chefs planet is the
perfect way to bring out the best in
your cooking Oh flavor out of this world
now get in the kitchen
3d audio is a complete immersive
experience sounds above you sounds below
you really imagine yourself in a big
balloon or a big bubble where a sound
can occur anywhere at any distance and
at any angle yeah sound is so subtle it
can be so moving it can be the key to a
flood of memories for me it's the
perfect marriage of science art and
human experience
essentially what Yara does is you hear a
lot of vividness in in the sound field
you hear depth you hear height and that
produces this profound impression of 3d
audio we think that we have a technology
that's versatile enough to play in a lot
of different field for people who are
interested in movies in cinema but also
a serious music listeners can really get
a lot out of this technology and so
we're kind of closing that gap between
what you hear in the studio and what's
being played in the home traditionally
with surround sound there's a money
scene and unfortunately that's only for
one person with Yara several people can
be in the money see because we can tell
you are where the money seats are
several people can still experience that
very intimate very precise 3d sound
phenomena in the gaming world we've
often heard that that people don't like
to be isolated from their environment
for hours hours on end we might have a
multi-user game in which each person has
their own sweet spot they have
it's just more natural to not have
something attached to your head when
you're listening to media of various
kind very often our ears lead our eyes
we are multi sensing beings we verify
our take on reality by comparing what we
see with what we hear if what we hear is
vivid enough we can navigate in that
environment even from a young age I've
always enjoyed video games so over time
just try to discover a way that I could
play those games as sighted people still
enjoy I don't think I've ever done that
that quick like he builds a whole model
of an environment based entirely on
audible views on 3d audio
and I'm so excited that he responded so
positively to the 3d immersive
experience that he had with URI we feel
that the my beam technology that's at
the core of yarra is gonna go a long
ways it's going to be in your phone it's
going to be in your car it's going to be
in communication systems this will be
available q1 next year and we're
inviting you to be part of the community
that brings this technology to the next
level</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
