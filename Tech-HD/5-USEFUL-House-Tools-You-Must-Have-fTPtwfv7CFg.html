there's a powerful new tool that
combines 48 tools into one introducing
it the Tiger Reggie by simply clicking
between the different sizes you
instantly have the tool you need for the
job think about all the time you've
wasted in the past fishing around for
the right size tool with just a few
clicks of the tiger wrench you'll have
the right tool for the job
every time the Tiger inches fast look
how quickly the Tiger wrench can go from
one size to the next as fast as you can
click the tool you've got a new size and
because of the unique revolutionary
tooth design you can do both standard
and metric sizes simply flip the tool
around and you have more sizes ordinary
wrenches slip on rounded corners not the
tiger rich it's specially designed teeth
won't slip like ordinary wrenches
ordinary wrenches can't do 45-degree
angles with the tiger wrench you could
easily do 45-degree angles no problem
it's one tool you can tackle all your
projects around the house or on the job
the tiger wrench is well built and
extremely durable it's a heavy-duty
professional tool that's designed to
handle up to 300 pounds
doesn't demonstrate some of the features
of the four point four meter extending
time Pro starting down here at the base
you've got a stabilizer bar which when
she descended this makes around a very
sturdy and maybe stable when you're
climbing it she's simply just telescope
those out those you can see at the
moment they're not in the locked
position
but as soon as we start to open the
ladder they will lock solo the ladder
all the way up now it's four point four
meter height so I'm just going to remove
that velcro strap and just simply a rung
at a time until we get it all the way to
this fully extended height you notice
that those stabilizers are bars are in
the lock position on the front of here
we've got some green tabs just make sure
they're all engaged if any of them are
red you've not fully extended the ladder
to disengage two very simple mechanisms
here you just twist do them one at a
time she always in control of the ladder
and it comes all the way back down to
his closed position now once it's closed
again obviously these can move she could
fold them away and they're just going to
partially extend the ladder so I'm just
going to say maybe five or six runs so I
just leave the big chunk here at the top
the gain going all the way up quickly
checking our tabs a green quickly
checking our stabilizer is still not
bringing it back down again when that
two latches all the way back down to
this closed position knocking in our
stabilizers befitting our velcro strap
that's the full point for me to extend
and climb Pro</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
