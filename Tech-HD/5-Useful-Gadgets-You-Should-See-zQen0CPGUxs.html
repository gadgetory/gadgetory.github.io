world's first variable graduated neutral
density filter the Aurora aperture power
GX nd is a hard transition graduated
neutral density filter with continuously
variable range up to five stops using
the or aperture power GX nd we can
maintain proper exposure of the shadows
without blowing out the highlights the
beauty of the power GX ND filter is that
one can dial in a proper exposure for
both highlights and shadows
graduate neutral density filters have
fixed values and how much light that can
stop and they typically only come in
single stop values with no fractional
values in between stops with a power of
GX ND filter all you need to do is to
rotate the filter until you get your
desired result it is as simple as that
we include a slimmed after for directly
mounting the power GX ND filter on
lenses which allows for rotation and
single axis movement between the filter
and the lens we also provide adapter
plate to use a power GX ND filter play
square filter system the power GX nd is
based on our innovative power ax ND
filters that we introduced in 2016 the
power GX in de features the same
multi-layer nano coatings from the power
x and d mm these coatings are able to
repel oil water dust and dirt from the
surface of the filter we have added
heart stomps to power G X and D to limit
rotation this was a highly demanded
feature especially for video usage
the power G X and D also features a
brand new director eating scale another
highly demanded feature the power G X
and D features Sean B to Sydney glass
for today's modern high-density sensors
and 4k video requirements the power G X
and D filters are offered in three sizes
for a multitude of lens coverage
requirements we believe the power G X ND
is an innovative and valuable tool for
both videographers and photographers
with through support we can bring it to
life
first there was a light it witnesses
evolution the acquit nurses workmanship
we have tried to control and harness its
power but this was never easy
until today
and now the power of light serves your
creativity
I love my kids I love spending time with
them
our lives are so busy the time I get to
spend with my kids it's precious that
time you have with them it just can't be
replaced they grew up too quick I want
to enjoy those moments we have together
I want it to be fun for them that's why
we love our saddle baby
it's a hands-free shoulder carrier it's
for parents who want to make the most of
the time they get to spend with their
children it can go places that a
stroller can't your hands are free you
can take a picture
it's compact easy to use the contoured
shape and mold of the phone makes it
comfortable for my kid to sit on and for
me to wear
as a parent it's my job to keep them
safe to keep them out of harm's way and
there are times I don't want to worry
about them letting go of my hand
we're running off
it just makes life more enjoyable and
they love it they feel like they're on
top of the world and that's what I want
for them with saddle baby that's what we
get

webcam for video calling or taking
pictures other people might have far
worse intentions for using your camera

devices get hacked each day and for all
you know someone might be looking at you

with your loved ones discuss
confidential information with business
partners or even when you're playing
with your kids in the confines of your
own home this might be your initial
reaction and understandably so
however solutions such as plaster
stickers or post-its are ugly and
temporary that is why we developed the

thin elegant and extremely durable the
canach fits your laptop tablet and phone

sounds complicated well good news can
match is super easy to install each cam
edge comes with an application card that
ensures that your webcam cover is
applied perfectly and stays there for
however long you want so who are the
people behind the cam at I we've been
developing the connections early 2014 to
ensure that you get the best webcam
cover out there
the camera is no longer a prototype but
an actual working product that is ready
for shipping
this is why we need your help to scale
up our production to have more people
all around the world we've used their
own savings to create 4,000 pieces to
make sure that our first backers will
receive the chemic immediately after our
goal is achieved so say goodbye to
hackers that goes on Kickstarter and to
all your friends and family luck so that
everyone can enjoy their online privacy
