is my hogs Clovis's but should we start
again as a dog owner your dog safety is
your number one concern and that's why
we created the pub copy the
award-winning portable monitor to always
know your dog is safe in all environment
Clovis and I love going hiking in our
beautiful mountains here in Colorado but
I sometimes worry about having to stop
somewhere on the way home we'd have to
wait for me in the car whether it's a
gas station a grocery store or a
sandwich shop the pub calm is a
palm-sized device that includes all of
the features that you need for your
peace of mind it monitors the
temperature and humidity around your dog
and it also has a microphone so you can
notice your dog is barking whining or
otherwise in this dress the pub comm
transmits all of this data directly to
an app on your smartphone so you can
check on your dog and get alerts about
any changes long before they become
problems our app will alert you about
any changes to your dog's environment 10
degrees before it actually gets to a
temperature that's dangerous so that you
have plenty of time to get back before
your dog is actually in any danger if
you need to leave your dog in your
vehicle the pub comm comes with our
unique system so that anyone who's
walking by and sees your dog in the car
and check on them and know they're safe
without smashing your car's windows by
banging our campaign you'll have the
peace of mind to always know that your
dog is safe and comfortable no matter
where life's adventures together may
take you
we're tailfin and this is the arrow
patch super light super stable zero fuss
but first let's go back a bit
two years ago we launched our first
product on Kickstarter we want some
awards with reviews from these guys and
literally hundreds of reviews from you
this is Ben he's an ultra endurance
racer and last year he raced this been
emailed us nine months ago he said I
love your t1 rack but I also love seat
packs can he make something that's the
best of both worlds this is Nick
he's the tailfin engineer and he thought
Ben had a point so we got to work
what we developed isn't just for Ben or
even road cyclists it's the best way to
carry gear on any bike introducing the
tailfin arrow
it's a product family with three
different models for all types of
writing each model shares the same
waterproof roll top pack but blends it
with a different wrap
the arrow pack carbon and alloy are
all-in-one solution
permanently integrates the rack to the
bag and connect seamlessly to your bike
without tools in seconds
arrow pack trunk is designed to work
with the original t1 rack and side bags
so you can carry a lot or a little
whichever model you choose the arrow
pack is a total GameChanger
at its heart lights unmatched ride
quality in a super light package it's
easy to fit and once you switch your
axle there's a model to fit virtually
any bike
it works brilliantly with full
suspension mountain bikes
and even knows with dropper posts
accessing your gear was a major priority
especially when it's on your bike an
arrow pack is as good in the great
outdoors as it is in the city
the arrow pack isn't just a name though
it's been engineered for aerodynamic
performance this includes the carefully
designed twin stacking straps let you
move your gear behind the wind shadow of
the rider to carry almost anything
all of this is topped off with
thoughtful details to make the arrow
pack truly awesome
- with a very simple Eclipse design and
engineer incredible products so that you
the customer can engineer your own
incredible adventures
but has no and help us bring the arrow
pack product family to life</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
