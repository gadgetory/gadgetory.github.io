from straight lines to curves
compound surfaces and everything in
between that's why we created rollover
the world's first compact digital
rolling ruler we are introducing a new
way to measure by removing the
complexities of a traditional ruler the
rollover is compact and simple to use
just press and hold the button on the
back and roll it across a surface it
creates and saves accurate measurements
you can count on in the unit of your
choice whether you're a designer or a
tech lover rollover is for everyone the
rolling ruler is designed to fit
seamlessly into your lifestyle rollover
comes with a genuine leather case that
fits onto your keychain in a second
embrace this winning combination of high
quality materials precision machines
stainless steel frame and a stunning
minimalistic design rollover provides
measuring capabilities in a range of
Units using a revolutionary user
interface by supporting this campaign
you can join us and make this epitome of
convenience a reality we are ready to
change the future with you by our side
you must be a scheme professional I wish
but the truth is I'm just not good at
skiing at all I am constantly afraid
that I'll fall down and hurt myself or
something then why not try Stocki
controls with stachy controls you'll
have absolutely nothing to fear
Stocki controls yes stachy controls
they're incredibly safe and stable skis
what makes taki controls so special is
the tail end design which help the skier
not to cling to an uneven surface
instead the ski
we'll be brought back to a balanced
position this is why sake controls are
not only suitable for beginners but also
for experienced skiers who like to ski
off piste Wow and best of all they
easily fit into the trunk of your car
way that's amazing
I know right because the skis come in a
very short design they're also very easy
to carry thanks to how incredibly
lightweight they are that's so cool
stachy controls are suitable for both
beginner skiers and adrenaline junkies
alike they were truly made for everyone
that's right hi Kickstarter my name is
David Rubik and I am head of Stocki team
here at Stuckey we spent over a year
developing a new model of safe and
stable skis Stuckey controls and I'm
proud to say that this model is the
ultimate one we've managed to create
smart construction skis that provide
beginners with safety and improve the
performance for advanced skiers right
now our goal is actually start producing
Stuckey controls and for dead we will
need your help this new model is
equipped with a more specific binding
from tyrolia which is movable and also a
new and improved stabilizing tail which
no longer just sits on the ski but is
actually more naturally connected to the
ski this innovation not only adds to the
aesthetic value but also to the
functionality of the skis themselves
people are always surprised by Stuckey's
high effectiveness finally that we'll be
able to enjoy skiing completely
worry-free stachy skis I designed it to
make skiing and more pleasant and
confirm table experience unlike you have
ever experienced before
thank you for a support and we wish you
a good ride hi we're Kerry and Brian
founders of Volvo and creators of the
original babywearing shirts
today we're thrilled to announce our
newest innovation in simple baby rain
we're abou is the first-ever baby
wearing romper this patent-pending
invention is the only baby carrier that
has been thoughtfully designed into a
piece of gear your baby wears this
completely simplifies the baby wearing
experience by allowing you to wear your
baby on your front or your back simply
pick your baby up and put them on it's
that easy
we're abou makes baby wearing as
intuitive as putting on a backpack it's
flexible breathable and lightweight in
fact it's half the weight of a
traditional soft structured carrier we
worked hard to make this something that
your baby can comfortably wear
throughout the day even while playing
well everybody knows babies want to be
held all the time and there's good
reason for it physical touch is critical
to their development they feel most safe
and secure up against mom or dad and if
even jump starts they're learning as
they watch their parent interact with
the world with wear vu we've simplified
baby wearing so the more parents and
babies can experience all this goodness
there's no extra care to keep up with
we're not in use and no bulky straps we
leverage the latest and outdoor gear to
create a contoured strap that provides
comfort without bulk this also allows
parents to easily wear another pack
purse or jacket over their shoulders
while wearing a baby we've taken safety
to a whole new level
unlike common carriers where boo allows
you to secure your baby in the carrier
prior to ever putting them on since
they're already safe and they're rare
boo you don't have to worry about them
falling to the ground while you're
putting them on your back our integrated
hip straps put the baby's legs in the
proper position while wearing and
release to allow free range of motion
while playing we're Brewer is going to
bring baby wearing the parents and
babies that would have never experienced
its countless benefits otherwise please
help us make this new innovation a
reality we've completed design and
development and need your backing to
place our first quarter report our
campaign right now let's do this and
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
