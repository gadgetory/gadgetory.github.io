problem one of the greatest fears that I
hear about during my support groups with
blind people is that they're not gonna
be able to do the normal things like get
on Facebook do texting and get messages
and make phone calls there are 285
million visually impaired people
worldwide while we enjoying all the
technological advance that we have right
now for the communications line people
get even more cut off for 20 years there
was almost no innovation existing
Braille devices are pokey and expensive
two years ago we set out to change this
with dot the first small watch for the
vision of your people dot is an active
Braille device
it is connected to the smartphone via
bluetooth and can receive any text
information from any app or service
for input there's a crown in two buttons
comes with full watch functionality that
is made from super light durable
aluminium and the battery lasts for
seven days
but most importantly is supportable at
just $290 I have this real Smart Watch
which is a huge life-changing technology
for me it behaves as a navigation
notification and a remote system if you
get a call it vibrates then you can
check who is calling to you
you can get on Google Maps and find the
nearest Starbucks boom there it is
literally at your fingertips young
children who are blind and visually
impaired can learn at an earlier age how
to read Braille dot is an open system
anyone can write programs for all kinds
of apps are early in development

sleep mask can be
through careful control of light and
sound we aim to bring a more restful
sleep to aid sleep internal lights leads
you to doctor developed breathing
exercises melatonin regulating green

reality the gup-e from CRKT was designed
by Lance Barbara and Tom Stokes it's a
hard working multi-tool with dozens of
everyday uses the adjustable wrench
opens to a half-inch for light repair
and assembly jobs a high-carbon 2 inch
stainless steel blade can be opened and
closed easily using the blade slot the
removable bit carrier is a high
intensity LED light and has two locator
posts and strong magnets to hold it
securely to the gup-e side the removable
