Braille device
it is connected to the smartphone via
bluetooth and can receive any text
information from any app or service

comes with full watch functionality that
is made from super light durable
aluminium and the battery lasts for
seven days
but most importantly is supportable at
just $290 I have this real Smart Watch
which is a huge life-changing technology

notification and a remote system if you
get a call it vibrates then you can
check who is calling to you
