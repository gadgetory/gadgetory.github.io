you
flying on a paper airplane must be so
magical with your help
magical is about to become
un-freakin'-believable
this is shy a pilot an industrial
designer and an inventor he is a world
loan expert in cool stuff that flies two
years ago Shai was challenged by his
friend to create a smartphone controlled
paper airplane
thanks to 21,000 backers on Kickstarter
he made it happen people all over the
world are now controlling paper planes
from their smartphones with power of
three I proudly came back to his friend
and his friend said wow that is magical
but you can't put a live streaming
camera on a paper airplane shy thought
for a minute and said challenge accepted
now after two years of testing and
prototyping meet size new on freaking
believable invention power up fpv the
first-ever paper airplane drone with a
live streaming camera using
state-of-the-art technology power up fpv
lets you see what your plane sees put it
in different words you feel as if you
are flying through the air riding a
paper airplane yes
power up fpv makes your regular paper
plane look like a kitty next to a lion
riding a t-rex just take a piece of
paper fold it into a plane and attach
the module put your phone in the
cardboard viewer and you're ready to fly
the camera screams live video through an
app on your very own smartphone sitting
in the head mounted goggles to control
your plane just tilt your head light and
there's also a gamepad mode for when you
feel like handheld control powerup FTB's
camera can swivel around that's how you
also get winged view and back view so
you can see this defining moment in your
life look it's you flying a powerup fpv
so i wanted to create the most immersive
real-time experience that's why he
partnered with a good folks in parrot
world experts in wireless streaming and
creators of the AR Drone
with their help power up fpv streams
live video over Wi-Fi
from over 300 feet to make the
experience really smooth power up FTP
has a ton of sensors and an on-board
computer with real-world autopilot mode
making it nearly uncrashable nearly
power up fpv is ready for production so
if you'll have flying and want to write
a paper airplane back power up fpv and
help make what was once magical on
freaking believable
my name is Lois Noah I'm co-founder of
fly I'm really passionate about new
technologies and I naturally fell in
love with drones when I first met them a
few years ago I'm convinced that in the
future we'll have flying robots around
us helping us in our daily lives but
before that we must overcome a few
challenges in particular with respect to
safety and usability so what we did at
fly is to go back to the drawing board
and invent the flying robot of the
future it had to be safe robust and with
a great user experience we've been
hanging around in my attic for about a
year building prototypes out of balsa
wood and DIY electronics and after many
many trials fly eventually stayed in the
air and proved to us that it was all
possible so based on this we managed to
convince PLoS twist a famous Belgian
entrepreneur also a talented drone pilot
he became really enthusiastic about the
project and decided to invest consider
para poner a fly to fit completes
pasando Sutro shoes become a descender
windshield spielberg soprano really
didn't wanna fly oh man el compadre
pourquoi je de Sevilla mystery ah so
cool
what makes fine designs for innovative
it's made of a single shaded popular for
control vehicle stability it has the
same size and weight of a soccer ball
it's black with sensor a powerful
onboard computer the HD camera and a
Wi-Fi connection we want to try to be
smart and autonomous so you don't have
to be always piloting it you can select
a simple mission to the mobile app and
just enjoy the live streaming
what do you think it takes to get
high-quality drone footage like this a
professional drone operator a cameraman
expensive equipment or simply this
introducing the sci-fi level one drone a
drone that lets absolutely anyone
capture footage like never before
Syfy's level up technology is the real
breakthrough by using six rotors the
drone can fly without tilting making it
simple and intuitive enough for anyone
to fly plus you get professional stable
footage without an exposed gimbal
because level up gets rid of the usual
multi rotor while tilting the interface
can be simplified to fly just swipe
swiping is a superior interface that
allows you to see what you're capturing
while flying
unlike tilting or joystick only
navigation our flying interface can be
downloaded as an app on your smartphone
it's simple accurate and fun because
drone flying is better when it's shared
the level one can post shots and video
real-time to your social network of
choice and with the new geofence
technology you can define the area in
which you want to fly your drone will
stay within your boundaries of choice
allowing everyone from beginners to
experts to practice their piloting
skills with confidence so far sci-fi
Works has been building drones for
industrial application but we want to
bring our drone inventions to everyone
at consumer friendly prices
plus we just love robots so really we
put our full technological expertise
into designing a drone for the consumer
that gives professional video quality
and stability but doesn't require
professional knowledge to fly our drone
will come with a 1080p high quality
camera and it will be ready out of the
box for everything from videos to action
filming to home inspection
so why Kickstarter sci-fi is made up of
a small passionate group of robot
enthusiasts that wants to make this
breakthrough technology available to
everyone and to make the leap from
commercial to consumer drones we need
your support to keep the price low
compared to other available drones
thanks to the sci-fi level ones
capabilities instead of worrying about
the drone itself you can focus on the
experience the sci-fi level one is
simple to fly captures exactly what you
want and shares it in real time this is
the first drone for absolutely everyone
