really uneasy about but you really need
to make it to that meeting with a client
where's your car is it on 6th Street

that sign
yeah that sign there's a lot of
unexpected things that can happen to you
and your vehicle so don't you wish there
was a way to record 24/7 and be alerted
when the incident occurs Whalen's
introduces the secure 360 a camera that
can monitor and record a full 360 degree
field of view so you know what's
happening in and around your vehicle no
matter where you are when the cameras
sensors detect motion impact or even a
change in GPS coordinates secure 360
will immediately notify you through the
mobile app and simultaneously record
video to the cloud so here's how it
works
the camera system actively scans the
perimeter of your vehicle using a suite
of advanced low-power sensors
we've combined radar a three axis
accelerometer as well as three axis gyro
four weeks of non-stop event detection
without draining your car battery the
secure 360 is designed for any vehicle
and every driver from the daily commuter
to rideshare services or families with
young drivers
you can locate your car quickly for the
GPS map check in with an elderly driver
protect your driving record or catch a
thief in the act so even if this happens
you'll have evidence to provide
authorities and your insurance company

affordable wireless and simple to
install welcome to club hey what's
cooking I'd like to boil eggs do you
want it hard-boiled or soft-boiled I'd
like them hard-boiled based on your
input it will take six minutes to boil
eggs shall I remind you after six
minutes this is the close intelligence
knob it's a smart knob that helps you
cook boil try and grow on the cooktop or
in the oven from the moment you turn on
the knob close starts to pay attention
asks for a few details and sets the
ideal cooking time or your preferred
time with its built-in sensor it detects
the knobs position on or off or simmer
or hide so it can calibrate the cooking
time clove works with Amazon Alexa and
Google home and set your hands-free for
cooking just top the clothes and cook
like a pro let's take something you've
cooked a million times a pan-seared
salmon and let's see how our chef enjoys
cooking it with globe how to cook
pan-seared salmon cool let's get started
I have sent the ingredients to your
phone please check and confirm if you
have the ingredients

skillet over medium heat for 3 minutes
place the salmon and skillet and
increase heats are high and cook for 3
minutes what's next
sprinkle with capers and salt and pepper
done turn salmon over and cook for 5
minutes or until brown what's next
well the salmon is being cooked you can
select lemon for garnishing tans for
salmon 2 individual plates and garnish
with lemon slices what's next pan-seared
salmon is ready hope you love it
Bon Appetit wow it's amazing I love it
what makes the clove knob special is
that it learns how you cook and what you
like do you like your eggs runny or firm
how well do you like your beef to be
cooked before you turn off the stove as
opposed to when the timer goes off as
per the recipe clove learns your spice
and dietary needs it will catch on after
a few days and start to personalize the
recipes for you installing the clove
knob is really simple use the knob
insert kit and follow the visuals and
voice guided assistance and you'll be
done in no time if you love food

that fancy glass if it's just going to
be stuck in your back
you
starter this is team neck 'some a year
ago we created aqua which was
successfully funded with the amazing
backers on kickstarter besides receiving
positive feedback we also learned the
need for a wireless listening experience
we believe music can be easily enjoyed
across devices with lossless sound
quality therefore we created aqua plus
the world's lightest wireless headphone
amplifier
applying our latest chip integration
technology Aquaplus redefines wireless
audio and achieves beyond the original
sound resolution for the best
performance bringing you low noise low
jitter and clock accuracy to hear the
difference optimizing all audio codecs
for level deaf audio quality and
amazingly intricate details and music
actually I'm really surprised because
Tucson is very nice and clear and I used
to have similar products but I wasn't
satisfied with the quality of the sound
I think this will come very handy
because these days like everything is
saying to wireless you I'm using iPhone
7 he doesn't have the as one giant the
powerful beast and integrate details I
think Apple plus helps me convey what I
want to present to my listeners and make
them fear what I hear in the studio
