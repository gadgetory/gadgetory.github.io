we're here to talk to you about coffee
you know that magical dark bean juice
that keeps us going every day coffee is
a helping hand guiding us through all of
life's ups and downs early mornings late
nights hinder dates and visits tall
people coffee is your very own guardian
angel in a cup or a jars that's what
you're into coffee is great and there
are so many different ways to make it
and we would like to introduce yet
another one this is sleep shop and it's
super simple let me show you how to use
it with a little help from my friend Tim
Tim likes coffee Tim really likes coffee
this is how much Tim likes coffee Tim is
here to show you the beauty of oh wait
he's done already hi Tim could you do
that again
thank you sure under nice and slow this
time please first of all you need
freshly ground coffee
and then I'll change water put the lid
on turn the broom around and let the
coffee steep how long well that depends
oh how far you wanna go before you open
the love to enjoy a freshly brewed shot
see how simple that is but then you're
not going to drink all that coffee by
yourself are you sharing is caring them
and look the inventor of steep shot just
happens to be sitting right next to here
so Ari what was your inspiration for
this burying device my wife wouldn't
make herself coffee now she does so
simple so sleek so gorgeous this deep
shot I mean now let me tell you about
how this thing works the process of
making coffee boils down to separating
the magical bean juice from the bean
bits the steaming water makes the air
expand underneath delete doesn't give it
anywhere to go so pressure happens this
allows the coffee to go faster when you
turn steep shot on its head and open the
valve the pressure is released and
coffee shoots out like a sigh of relief
simple sleek and gorgeous it doesn't
have lots of pipes just the cup and the
lip it's pretty much zero waste super
portable and most importantly it makes a
really good cup coffee and there you
have it yet another coffee Kickstarter
but you can't have too much of a good
thing can you we need your help to
further caffeinate the world you know
what to do
because
there are two main things that make
fiddlestick different and in my opinion
better than all the other frigate toys
one and the most important being the
loop-the-loop opens up possibilities
that no other frigate toy has where you
can actually turn this into a
skill-based toy or just flick it around
like you would your keys I love flicking
my keys around when I create in my
office when I'm coming up with ideas or
I'm sitting down for a creative jam
session I found that the number one
thing I would do is twist my keys around
my finger there was something
therapeutic almost hypnotic about it
my name is Adam Wilber I'm an inventor
and a creator but I'm also a magician I
use my hands is my livelihood it's how I
feed my children so I really do have
something in my hands about 23 hours out
of every day and and that really pushed
me to realize I'm a fidgeter I think in
reality most people off
the fiddlestick is very much a fidget
toy it has all the fun buttons and dials
and tactile fixation tools that you
would want out of your fidget toy but it
does have a few added bonuses which
really takes it to another level right
up top the joystick in a perfect organic
position got a tactile surface that just
feels great on the thumb light switch
for clicky buttons pinball wheel and two
gears on the right side the worry stone
and last but not least is your slider
which is set to the perfect tension the
other differentiator of the fiddlestick
is that it is a bit modulate and what I
mean by that is that you can take it as
a very slim minimalistic I'm going out
and about and I want to keep kind of a
low-key fidget or you can say look I'm
gonna party I want to be the center of
attention and you add on our led
attachment when you get a little bit of
work into this you go to a party it's
light or it's dark outside and you start
fiddling you will be the center of
attention whether you like it or not
with one successful Kickstarter already
under our belt we know we can make this
happen for the holidays the only thing
missing is you we would love to bring
the Kickstarter community into the final
stages of manufacturing let's have some
fun learn some moves give a gift or two
and join the fidgets revolution choose a
tier below and let's go
hello my name is Andrew Paris I'm with
Alia life technology we create assistive
products for people who are blind or
have a visual impairment my grandmother
started to lose her vision due to
macular degeneration when she found out
that she would lose her vision she
decided to learn Braille but she
couldn't she could finish in New York
Times crossword puzzle but she couldn't
learn Braille and we found out that she
wasn't alone that 99% of people who have
a visual impairment can't read Braille
so Elia frames as a standard alphabet
font customized for tactile reading and
because it's a standard alphabet font it
can be shared between the sight and hand
people have a visual impairment
helliya frames is based on the roman
alphabet we used the major
characteristics of each letter and
enclosed them in a frame so it's
building on a Razors existing knowledge
the frame tells a person where one
letter ends and the next letter begins
and enables them to systematically
explore each letter with the same finger
movement and it also tells them where
that letter is in the alphabet
currently we can print one page at a
time we use a printer from the 1990s
that we've hacked to create tactile
output basically you ask how do you make
a new tactile font you have Andrew who
has all of the innovative awesome ideas
and all the research experience in
background and then you need someone to
kind of bring certain assets together to
actually move things along the printing
process is essentially me and the piece
of hardware called the Tektronix fazer
it was an outdated printer that has
definitely been hacked to provide us the
tactile output that we need and as
efficient as it can give us that
efficiency is one page about every 30
seconds it breaks down in each
troubleshooting when it works it works
and it has been useful for the pilot
program but there's a better and a more
efficient way we're coming to
Kickstarter to ramp up production and
bring this to a much larger audience one
of the challenges with Braille is that
it only comes in one font size because
the space between the dots has meaning
our alphabet can be scaled so it can be
in any font size you need another
challenge like Braille is that it really
takes an extraordinary person to learn
it after the age of 21 they need to be
highly motivated they need to be
extremely intelligent and they need to
have super tactile acuity Elya frames
because it's just the standard alphabet
customized for touch it can be learned
in an afternoon a sighted family member
could learn this in a matter of minutes
the same thing with a classmate or a
co-worker
whereas Braille takes months or years to
learn Kickstarter for us is a great way
to build our community and introduce
this system this will be the first time
that backers can get their hands on
helia frame
we hope you help us bring Education
Employment literacy and independence</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
