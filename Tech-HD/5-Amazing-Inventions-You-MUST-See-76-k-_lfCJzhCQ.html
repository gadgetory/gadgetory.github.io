love my gear I love the scratches
bruises and stories my gear carries I
love knowing how many clicks I need from
each lens for the perfect exposure my
gear is irreplaceable that's why I
created er I see I had a nightmare shoot
where it didn't take my macro lens and
ended up losing a memory card full of
great pictures I'll never capture again
that's when I realized there had to be a
better way to manage my gear I partnered
up with yuliya she's a super smart
engineer together we create a gear I
your gears commander-in-chief gear is a
small device that stays in your back
uses RFID to scan your bag from inside
and make sure all your gear is there
dear I tells you if all your gears with
you and if not what's missing okay
something is missing here I helps you
locate it and it's not just about what's
missing it's also about packing light
and only taking what you really need and
the gear I app you can create lists with
equipment you need for different types
of shooting dates and gear I will also
tell you if there's something in your
bag you won't be using today we chose to
use RFID stickers and tags because
there's no need to charge them in they
last for years they're also super
affordable and come in many shapes and
sizes so you can tag all of your gear
all of it gear i comes in two forms
either as a standalone device which you
just leave in your bag or as a phone
cover which doubles as a charger we've
created gear I for photographers but
it's really for anyone who cares about
their equipment from sound engineers to
make up artist and even travelers or
parents gear eyes the solution for any
worried mind pack light keep track of
your gear don't spend money on rhe
buying it and don't worry that's what
key arise about
so if you care for your gear as much as
we do help us fund gira let's take care
of our gear as much as our gear takes
care of us gear I
we didn't think throwing away food
mattered until we learn families throw
away on average over 400 pounds of food
to the landfill every year the new zero
food recycler from W labs automatically
recycles ninety-five percent of
household food waste into ready to use
homemade fertilizer start with a0
additive pack then continue to add food
daily until full with the help of a
plant-based additive the Zira device
reduces your food waste by over
two-thirds of its original volume the 0
device breaks down the food so the Zira
system can quickly recycle it over 24
hours into ready to use homemade
fertilizer
turning food scraps today and to
fertilizer tomorrow making it easy and
convenient in your home to feed less to
the landfill and more to your land the
new Zira food recycler turning waste
into wonderful

present audio reproduction in its purest
form to others they're nostalgic

sound connect your favorite wireless
speakers or headphones with its built-in
Bluetooth this is what it is this is all
it does mrs. Rock block
you
well my grandfather not founded the
Tiffin company his philosophy was simple
find out what the customer wants and
give it to them two years ago we asked
our engineers at steadicam headquarters
in Burbank to create the best electronic
handheld stabilizer with no limitations
we took our Steadicam technology that's
been used in Hollywood for the last 40
years and coupled it with Steve Wagner's
genius software design and by partnering
with aerial drone manufacturer unique it
allowed us to create the Steadicam vault
the best electronic handheld stabilizer
with no limitations the study can vote
like all its predecessors is a expanded
system with the center of gravity right
at a gimbal it accepts any phone any
case that allows you to walk around
precisely frame the things that you want
to see and move the camera in the way
that we're used to seeing on a feature
film
it's an electronically gyro augmented
study can for smartphones that weighs
one pound with the inertia and the feel
of a big 40 pound rate
3-axis gimbal they're not terrific at
following action one two three one two
three oops little lag there the study
chem volt gives you stability and
agility and that's the key the Volt
effectively puts study chem technology
in the palm of your hand our mission has
always been to help people create the
world's greatest images
so back us today we can't wait to see
what you guys are going to create
you
you
you
do you know that seventy percent of
women are doing their makeup under the
wrong lighting ever put your makeup on
thinking that it looks good but once you
step outside it really doesn't this is
why we created the Juno mirror a mirror
and to solve some of our biggest makeup
problems the juno mirror app uses your
thumb sensor to detect the lightning in
the surrounding environment outside of
your home we designed it with Bluetooth
technology that can auto adjust to
Ramirez light temperature and find the
best light setting to apply your makeup
you can even put your phone on to the
mirror for a professional-looking
hands-free picture you spent the last
six months collecting feedback for
campaign effectiveness and sourcing
materials to bring this concept to life
we sent out prototypes to beauty
bloggers and BTW enthusiasts to get
their feedback I think the type of
makeup here that you use while you're
doing your makeup is going to make all
the difference and I saw this one and I
was so so interested I thought it looked
so cool and had so many cool features
and that has this little stand at the
bottom that you can use for storage for
like earrings jewelry your phone things
that you need to quickly grab on the go
and I am a part of this you know test
their community and that basically means
they sent me a prototype and I was just
like super super floor with its amazing
selfies it just like doubles and a ring
light it's like the most amazing mirror
ever
by backing us up not only will you bring
the junior mayor to life but you'll be
joined the revolution to create more
life-changing makeup products that will
blow your mind we really need your
support please back us and share our
campaign</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
