SOLAS are providing some amazing
information to us in a way that is
completely different
as an eyewear the soleus is absolutely
revolutionary
I know a lot of cyclists get really into
that gear and into that technology and
how to improve and this is definitely a
tool to use to help you improve
we've been honored to be working with
USA Cycling for over a year now
developing this product there's no other
competitor out there that it started
working with Olympic team and a national
team from the ground up what do the top
level athletes what are they looking for
what's comfortable it's even before we
had anything even for the the athletes
to grab and look at and I think that the
project is turned out to check all those
boxes and even be better than
expectations the question that they
asked was what do you want in order to
win us goal of her USA in Rio the
mission of solos is to really empower
the athlete with the critical data that
they need to perform at their peak and
this is accomplished through
state-of-the-art heads-up display and
audio technologies that will enable the
athlete to have access in real-time to
the data that they're actually tracking
with our team as we prepare for Rio the
solos is getting feedback to the riders
instantaneously it's cool to have a dual
purpose like sunglasses and a pound
meter all in one you see it immediately
right that as you're riding along and
compare it through the a piece you have
anything you want on there your speed of
time anything you'd think it looks
really small but it's actually quite a
large display so it's like this entire
upper right quadrant but if you just
like look beyond it you don't even
notice it
SOLAS is perfect for the casual commuter
or the weekend warrior now you don't
have to worry about dropping your phone
or looking down at your bike computer
screen because her virtual display is
three times larger than your typical
bike on there you want something that
that has that technology and conveys
that information but also it needs to be
a cool pair of sunglasses to for myself
the biggest thing I think is safety you
can fully turn-by-turn directions or
talk on the phone hands-free and for the
hardcore cyclist or triathlete you will
never have to leave the air position
because all the data that you need is
right there in front of your eyes it
goes along with an app that's really
easy to setup and
and super easy to use with our app you
use that to connect to the headset over
Bluetooth and then you compare it to all
of the sensors you already have heart
rate speed cadence power all of that can
easily connect to the Internet and push
things up to Strava
we already have a GPS on the phone and
you're good to go with the solos you
have the ability to change the focus in
place that exactly where you want to see
that information for the solos you know
it's like they weigh nothing especially
compared to the other options out there
and what's so cool about these glasses I
mean you can change the lenses it's
super awesome there's very very few
companies out there that can say that
they've actually paid the price that
they're on the ground with the athletes
that that they're doing everything
possible and following this journey with
the athletes you know for both the ups
and the downs and I think that's
ultimately why we've had such a
fantastic product come out of that
journey
today you can be one of the first people
in the world to purchase the soleus for
yourself on Kickstarter souls will help
you improve the performance of your ride
train smarter and safer we are providing
