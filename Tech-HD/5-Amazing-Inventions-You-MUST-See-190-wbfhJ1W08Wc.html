think clearer I feel more energetic and
look better but the traffic cold
warnings and same boring exercises at
the gym make it easy to hit the snooze
button and push that workout permanently
to swara my name is Jason I'm a trainer
fitness junkie and loved creating stuff
calisthenics have always been a staple
in my training regimen for the past year
I've been working with an amazing design
team and experienced manufacturers to
build a product I could use in my
apartment at the beach or Park to
perform full-body workouts we're finally
ready to introduce you to the base
blocks its patent-pending design allows
you to perform over 50 body rate
exercises for your upper body core and
lower body the adjustable uprights allow
you to change the height changing the
leverage to make the exercise more
difficult or easier depending on your
training level it's assembled in seconds
and slides on the event to storage tips
levers handstands
l-sits they all sound that look pretty
cool but to perform these exercises you
need a strong foundation our system
categorizes exercises as beginner
intermediate or advanced
mostly existing training improvement is
either bulky or requires attachments to
external features when we came over the
design we made a practicality checklist
we asked ourselves three questions
could it fit in the trunk of the car
could it slide under a bench at storage
and could it be carried into the outdoor
workouts the uprights can be attached or
lose simple clip
they then slide through a set of
holsters allowed into storage and
there's a handle in the base allowing
you to carry it in the outdoor workouts
the base box is gone through extensive
prototyping
to make it strong lightweight a most
importantly look cool we use birch
plywood for the basic plants the base
measures 34 inches by 19 inches
the uprights are made from a high-grade
steel when compact they measure 18
inches extensive 35 inches depending on
exercise you've actually all the
designers willing has been done we are
now making the final revisions to our
fifth prototype to make sure we deliver
you something awesome we'll be launching

hey Kickstarter's my name is Alex and
one of the founders our trip in
Stockholm and Shanghai base startup
working on redefining the wireless
speaker
so me and Eric have known each other
since a long time back I'm working in
management consulting in Shanghai and
Eric is working in a law firm in
Stockholm as you understand we needed a
fun project to work on we wanted to
create a social speaker allowing more
interaction around the speaker and we
wanted to improve this and package it in
a very sleek Scandinavian design okay

real
we got great ambition and we want to
take this global as you can see people
already talks about us online but now we
need your help

see that's there
this December 11th a rebirth of a dying
Chinese Asian craft which has been
existent for more than 1,000 years
it is now an elegant and modern lighting
the fits in an deliveries base and can
create the perfect atmosphere for you
Chinese or umbrella
this is the prototype of the other level
we're three designers based in China
very coincidentally we touched this
industry because of academic studies and
we soon found is dying because the lack
of modern values and yon inheritance
then the first thought that occurred was
was we have to do something for it
after learning and communicating with
artisans we decided to redesign the
umbrella by retaining the core parts of
the tradition and adding modern elements
to create new possibilities and meet new
demands we wanted to revitalize this
ancient craft and to discover its
ination values
we managed to adopt to the lamp the
bamboo rips oil paper cover straining
and the collapsible umbrella structure
that have been using in traditional
umbrellas the brass as decoration are
added to provide modern aesthetic we
stick to hen making to ensure every lamp
is unique and to bring about named
possibilities to the industrial hi guys
this is Dan Breeland and it's a story
about the preservation of an ancient
traditional craft we hope that you guys
will like it because really need your
help to make this happen if you're
interested in the product or even
working together on something please do
not hesitate just contact us via the
email below or follow us on social media
or sign up our website to get it first
would also appreciate it if you could
share this video with your friends and
tell them about us
thanks for watching
Vito tanka for vodka day yeah they were
due for a so at the height of law ever
since the domestication of animals in
early agricultural history man has tried
to control and limit their motion range
from manual herding to building fences
fences require considerable maintenance
and construction is driven by high cost
this material and time-consuming process
has left vast areas with potential
pastures overgrown and untouched what if
we can utilize this natural resource for
future food production let nature decide
where animals can graze
we started 10 years ago as a group of
farmers and engineers with a simple idea
bringing modern technology and
traditional farming together what we
created is the world's first virtual
fence system for grazing animals
improving agriculture animal welfare and
the environment all at once no fence is
an innovative and cost efficient system
enabling farmers use the full potential
of their land and animals our grazing
technology consists of a solar-powered
GPS collar and a digital boundary that
is transferred to the animals collar the
collar uses the mobile phone network to
communicate with our web portal an
easy-to-use mobile application simply
define the area and build your virtual
fence the fence can easily be adjusted
or moved giving animals access to new
areas and healthy pastures whenever you
decide
if an animal should wander off a beeping
Sun will start warning the animal it's
moving out of its grazing area should it
ignore the beeping sound a weak but
effective electric shock will be given
as a last resort
our technology also enables farmers to
follow their animals movements and
receive notifications if anything
unexpected should occur through our
revolutionary approach farmers can now
save time energy and money and give
animals access to healthy and varied
pastures with over two years of
large-scale testing we have successfully
proved function along with good animal
welfare now we've begun to develop our
solution for the cattle industry we're
just getting started
and we want you to join our journey
allowing animals to use their full
potential so we can move forward to a
profitable and sustainable industry
