9:00 to 5:00 work is part of our lives
we don't need an office to do it what we
do need is the freedom and flexibility
to do our best work wherever life takes
us that's why we developed alcove to
stylish first-of-its-kind laptop case
that unfolds into a mobile workstation
to enhance privacy when working in open
spaces noise distraction is a big issue
so we've made noise control high
priority we've consulted with the
brightest PhDs an acoustic engineering
to develop alcoves patent-pending side
panels so you can create your best work
wherever inspiration strikes
alcove had rechargeable backlighting to
make reading and writing and low
lighting spaces easier finding flow
getting in the zone whatever you call it
it's easier without code when you're
done just fold it up and go
we've spent the last year observing
people their work in different locations
and we are ready for the first
production run of alcove but we need
your help
join our mission as we create the first
of its kind laptop case by supporting
our campaign today log on to get alko
comm so you could get the latest updates
on our launch thank you for your support
in the alcove
I spent years searching for a tripod I
could anchor adjust and aim while
holding my breath in deep water couldn't
find it so I designed it brought it to
Kickstarter
now I'm bringing it to you you should be
able to put your camera where you want
without fear and without lugging a lot
of gear with deployable stakes and
multiple rigging points you can connect
PAC pod in ways that let you get great
shots from almost any angle it's quick
to set up easy to stow compact
lightweight waterproof
built for adventure whether you shoot
time-lapse still photos or video tak pod
expands your creative possibilities
there's a lot to be said for traveling
light and there's lots of heavy tripods
out there but when you're out for the
whole day who wants to carry extra
weight when you can use what's around
you to steady the shot gear keeps
getting smaller and better
why weigh yourself down pack pod lets
you grab life's best moments fast while
you're having fun you don't have to
travel heavy to capture a life moment

feet feet
how often they say fleas in good weather
or in bed especially when the storm
starts they help us our feet was where
we need to go
obeying our commands they're Russians
but the bad weather starts
or o'clock
our feet leading this facility
it's time to set your feet Kittinger
smart insulin step foot massage using
thigh medicine is a secret to longevity
and youth your feet will be grateful
these smart insoles that can give you
the thigh massage were invented and
created by I impose muscle electronic
engineer with 20 years of experience he
loves his wife and daughter so much he
left work constant time massage saved
his family welcomed everything started
with an idea then together with fans we
perform tests research of
and newest materials the creation of a
vault took us a long time after which
the test prototypes were created of
course we had to modify some features
and again produce test instance this one
we controlled the production of the
insults electronics above is the
assembly shop do you see when America
what we do requires absolute purity and
responsibility electronics aren't hard
to consumes my colleagues like
everything in hardened professional
equipment performed tasks well all the
tests showed great results our team
spent a lot of time it took us long to
choose the best materials in a
specialized company we created a test
batch without losing time we started
with the tests
we started experimenting the insults
with marathon runs we gave them maximum
load tests on sharp rocks went well
with the step Jian soles frost and
humidity paramount concern even the
critical folding was no problem for the
smart missiles we even tried this and
now we are contact you can do any
activity with the step Jian sauce you
can take them to work
you can run in any weather they're ready
to go on an adventure with you they're
composed of infrared heating element
made of carbon fiber vaporized aluminum
memory powered by the flexible battery
activated carbon cloth layer carbon
fiber adds durability
Micropulse membrane gel flex foam Maddox
great insulation distinguishes the

haier amp hour battery along the range
the nuts and bolts of the ruble these
are fully electric rumble ebike
basically we have everything you can
have on a normal electrified with the
low beam high beam corn manometer and
the display you can actually see a how
many percentage of the battery you have
left and the voltage of the battery one
of the unique designs of the bike that
is pretty obvious is the front then if
you're sitting on a regular scooter if
you're gonna make a left turn basically
just turn your steering wheel all the
way to the left are you going right to
turn right but with this design you're
using more of your body weight while
you're doing the turn so you just turn a
little bit lean a little bit and you're
making sharp turns
the coolest part of the rumble bike is
actually added an engine sound you just
press the button
there is no delays on the throttle and
the sound is super
if I just touch a little head you can
hear the Sun goes on
the love we share for cafe racer bikes
goes way back to 1977 when we bought our
first bike our idea and vision was to
mix the past with the future and rumble
was the perfect name of the scooter we
wanted to share with the world our
background in engineering and passion
for bikes has been the key to create the
perfect electric cafe racer scooter
after many months of research we noticed
that electric scooter owners around the
world was saying the same thing they
missed the engine sound of a electric
scooter we noticed that the sound was a
big issue so we wanted to fill that gap
so we added some great engine sound that
has zero delay when you touch the
throttle this is something unique in a
great function from Rumble you can
easily turn on and off the engine sound
with the touch of a button
