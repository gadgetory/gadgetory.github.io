the world's smartest jet black
you
this is Luksa for an open-source LED
indicator that works with a USB or
battery it shows your colleagues when
you are available for conversation and
when you're busy and shouldn't be
disturbed do you know that feeling when
you're trying to work and suddenly
everybody in the office feels they must
ask you something well we were so
familiar with this kind of situation
because we worked in an open office it
was really disturbing and as usually it
took time to get back to work before the
laksa for we used to have flax cardboard
signs etc to make it clear to others
that it's no time for conversations but
it's the 21st century so we came up with
the idea of an electronic indicator the
laksa for works in two modes you can
connect it to your productivity app and
it will show your availability
automatically or you can set up the
active mode which won't let you miss an
important message or email all these
activities will be displayed by the
indicator for user convenience we've
created two versions of the laksa for
regular with the USB and Wireless with a
rechargeable battery in Bluetooth for
both devices include magnets which make
them easy to attach to your computer or
any other surface
there's nothing better than a hot meal
in the great outdoors
however creating a good meal from a
portable grill can be difficult and
time-consuming problems range from not
enough heat from a gas grill or
controlling the heat of charcoal
neither system is a great solution we
want the temperature control you get
from a gas grill but the superior heat
of charcoal we have the solution the
velocity grill if you're into camping
tailgating boating RVing picnicking or
just want to prepare for an emergency
you're gonna love this grill the
velocity grill uses just a few pieces of
flavored hardwoods to generate
temperatures up to a thousand degrees in
minutes
unlike other grills the velocity grill
uses a small yet powerful fan the fan is
encased in our stay cool non-slip base
the secret to the power is in our
specially designed reverse fan blade
that allows maximum airflow with very
little noise the fan is powered by three
D batteries plugging into the wall
outlet or cigarette lighter it also has
an optional solar-powered battery pack
which allows the grill to be a great
emergency cooking source our heat
diffuser plate spreads heat evenly
across the cooking surface dramatically
reducing cold spots you get with other
grills this plate also preserves heat in
windy conditions by removing the
diffuser plate the grill becomes a
boiler that can heat water or hot
chocolate in no time winter camping or
high elevation won't hinder the velocity
grills performance want to give the kids
an at home adventure they'll love gather
the family and friends for an evening of
hot dogs and s'mores to create fun
memories the grill heats up and cools
down quickly
making it the perfect tailgating and
picnicking grill
wherever your adventurous side takes you
the velocity grill will make it a tasty
trip we've done a lot of field testing
and we are confident the grill is ready
to go into production
our team of engineers and designers have
created what we feel is the most
personal portable grill design on the
market the velocity grill is lightweight
and incredibly powerful the secret is in
the wood the smoke flavor you get with
the wood is the same smoke flavor that
makes bacon taste so good but to make
this a reality we need your help to meet
our manufacturers tooling cost and the
minimum order we've created some great
rewards and hope that you'll share this
link with your family and friends and
hope to hear about your adventures with
the velocity grill
we all have a freezer at home right it's
a household appliance that never gets a
break and we keep it running day and
night why not use all that surplus
energy to keep yourself cool geyser is
an eco-friendly ice powered cooling
system that uses a special cooling gel
that has amazing running costs just
under one cent a day even the casing is
eco-friendly geyser is made of good old
high-grade insulating wood this means
that the ice pack dee Frost's at a
snail's pace lengthening the operation
time greatly it's ventilated all round
giving 360 degrees of cooling power it's
small - which means it's portable and
can be used wherever you need it
it's powered by a limo battery and can
be charged via microUSB geyser has no on
off switches and only works if the two
parts are connected this makes it safer
for children and pets Damiano and
Ferdinando are two young architects with
a passion for 3d design and
experimentation this is the result of a
lot of hard work on their part they
opened their firm two years ago I
couldn't afford an air conditioner
that's when they came up with the idea
of making a system which had lower
running costs than an air conditioner
and which works better than a fan
the first plans were drawn on paper and
then turned into 3d models
the first prototypes were made using a
3d printer after an in-depth study
regarding possible materials Wood was
chosen for its outstanding insulation
qualities then the best components for
long service life and performance were
chosen the cone-shaped ice pack acts as
a diffuser defrosting itself over a time
scale of 5 hours there's even an insert
for an air freshener just insert it into
the base to turn on geysers fan just
line up the two blue dots and pop the
lid on geyser is available in natural
wood finish or paint finish with two
different ventilation grids
like it why not show your support and
take one home today might be nice to
cool off a bit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
