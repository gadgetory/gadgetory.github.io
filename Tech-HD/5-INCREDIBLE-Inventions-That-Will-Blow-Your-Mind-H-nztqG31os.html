you for your interest our campaign let
me tell you about a product that's gonna
make both parents and children happy one
of the things that we've thought about
it is all the issues we've had with our
kids playing soccer in our backyards the
ball is going over the fence the ball is
breaking the fence the balls breaking
windows the balls breaking neighbors
flowers in fact my neighbor even got so
upset with me give us the code to the
gate to actually retrieve the balls
ourselves we'd stop knocking at the door
what open goal does is allow you to do
just that
keep those neighbors happy and allow
your childhood finest skills let me show
you
as you can see coops sexy practicing
it's rebounding the shots that are
missed each and every time allowing him
to define his skills and get repetitions
each and every day while having fun and
not having to chase those balls the
balls that made your neighbors upset the
balls that broke those windows the balls
that went over the fence the balls that
broke those flowers during this campaign
really focusing our open goal jr. but
we've also got a standard a large if you
look at the website you'll see those and
the big differences is really just the
size so again thank you for just our
campaign we appreciate it have a good
day can please stick around to watch
more shots of open goal in action
introducing the broaden tailor knife
sharpener the broaden tailor knife
sharpener quickly sharpens and hones any
metal knife even serrated if your knife
is very dull restore the bevel with
coarse sharpening by pulling the knife
through with a tip down three to four
pulls through the precision tungsten
carbide sharpeners is usually enough to
restore a bevel a light downward
pressure will create a finer and sharper
edge while heavier pressure will create
a sturdier chopping edge for most knives
press down enough to move the sharpener
bars about halfway through their range
once your knife is sharp you'll rarely
have to coarse sharpen if you hone your
knife regularly hone the edge by pulling
through with the tip up until the knife
pulls through smoothly the number of
pulls may vary normally about 6 to 12
this can be done every time you use your
knife because no metal is removed honing
the knife straightens and realigns the
cutting edge in the same way as a chef's
steel but the broaden tailor sharpener
provides a more precise and even result
that anyone can do easily if you need
that extra degree of sharpness polish
the edge with a few strokes back and
forth hold the sharpener bars fully
apart let the sharp edge glide across
the smooth flat surfaces of the
sharpener with no more downward pressure
than the weight of the knife
now look carefully at your serrated
knife the scalloped bevels are formed
into one side only usually the
right-hand side with the knife blade
parallel to the counter surface move the
handle of your knife to the right 45
degrees and draw the knife toward you
the tungsten carbide sharpener will only
contact the serrations on the right side
of the blade the broaden tailor
sharpener is able to hone the entire
serrated knife edge because the
spring-loaded sharpening surface hugs
the contour of each serration both curve
and tip if you have a knife with
serrations on the Left use the same
technique but angle the blade to the
left if you need a reminder on any of
these techniques the directions are
conveniently located on the bottom of
the sharpener after sharpening wipe the
blade clean with a damp cloth and get
ready to enjoy using a truly sharp knife
the broaden tailor knife sharpener sharp
made simple
hi I'm Shireen co-founder and CEO of
NEMA at NEMA we enable people with food
sensitivities and allergies to live
their life to the fullest I am so
excited to introduce you to our second
product the NEMA peanut sensor every
NEMA capsule contains the power of an
entire chemistry lab your NEMA sensor
mixes and analyzes what's in the test
capsule to produce an accurate result
NEMA users check to see if their food is
peanut free at restaurants on packaged
foods at catered events and while
traveling NEMA can test for solids
liquids and almost any other type of
food today we're testing this plate of
cookies that we got from a bakery down
the street we've already called the
bakery ahead of time to make sure their
peanut free
but because of cross-contamination we're
gonna be using me months to be sure
first take your NEMA touch capsule then
take a small sample of food a pea-sized
amount and place it in the capsule you
can use your fingers or a utensil and
you can take a sample from different
parts of the plate to make sure you get
a little bit of everything
now close the capsule the next step
dries the food keep twisting until it's
closed now insert the capsule in taneema
press Start NEMA does the rest the test
will take a few minutes you'll see the
screen thinking and you might hear it
working you'll see a smiley face if it's
peanut free you'll see a peanut icon if
peanut was detected in the sample look I
got a smiley NEMA is one additional tool
in your tool kit to supplement
everything you're already doing to live
your healthiest self the power of this
one data point enables me to make a more
informed decision about what I'm eating
