when I was a kid during the 90s
water guns used to be a lot bigger and a
lot meaner than they are now
and for some reason they haven't changed
in like twenty years and everyone
wonders why we thought it was time for a
new water gun there is a lot better than
anything you have ever seen you have all
the water guns in the world and then you
have the spyro one is something else
entirely what it does it shoots
individual bullets of water they're
completely harmless but they fly really
fast and really far and you can hit
someone precisely from the distance once
you run dry and you have zero shots left
you just dip the sparrow one into water
and refill xandrie pressurizes itself no
more screwing no more pumping or nothing
of that old stuff it's really cool the
spyro one has a display that tells you
how many shots you have left to go and
when you have to recharge obviously once
you recharge the display goes up to 25
again with the spyro one and a couple of
friends you'll have a great time and
intense action-packed water fights but
you could also bring it to barbecue or a
party or a boat trip there will be so
much fun everywhere now we believe that
it is time for water gun revolution and
the only thing is missing to make that
vision a reality
is your support
only the best water gun in the world was
a huge challenge until we created over
six innovations of prototypes with our
team finding creative solutions to
perfect the performance I would say that
there's probably a good amount of
craziness involved in the making of this
product is it fun to shoot um I don't
know but I would say it's probably great
fun building the best water gun in the
world sounds like a lot of fun but on
the other side is also serious business
the Spiro one is nearly complete we did
our part no it's up to you back us and
have fun
what makes a great picture some people
think it's the camera how many
megapixels does it have but AI does it
use you know technical stuff but a great
picture isn't the camera it's the person
holding it a great photographer sees all
the details in a frame it knows exactly
how to create an EM captivating
composition and what to focus on
this is OCO a phone camera enhancer that
will let you become a great photographer
by immersing you in the photo when
taking a picture with your phone you're
using a tiny fraction of what your eyes
see to capture everything your eyes see
you'd have to stick your phone to your
face yeah Koko's innovative lenses
enable you to see what both of your eyes
see but much bigger with no pixel loss
that's how it immerses you in the photo
now you can really play with composition
and focus look at these two pictures
they look similar but it's the
composition the details that make the
difference and that's what makes a
photographer the way you hold OCO
provides much more stability than just
holding the phone that improves every
shot and becomes even extra important
when shooting videos now penning around
is smooth and tilting up is enhanced
especially when zoomed in to prevent
glares OCO is completely closed on three
sides so no Sun can come in and you
always have shade to create an exam in
the perfect picture with the optional
lenses OCO enhances your shots even more
and maximizes your photography potential
use the wide-angle to capture an entire
scene the macro to capture tiny objects
or fisheye for unique angle OCO works
with almost any phone and any phone case
to provide ease of use taking a picture
is with an outer shutter release button
and to complete the professional feel
OCO comes with a strap so you can wear
it like a camera and the entire thing
easily folds into a back
ok√∂ is created by shy goatee creator of
power up who kick-started and delivered
to tens of thousands of supporters so
you can be sure he worked on the fine
details and knows how to deliver our
final product so stop taking pictures
and start immersing yourself in game get
