you
once upon a time we were natural to make
it then the world got sealed up billions
of screens one size fits all then came a
challenge would you support we came out
with a simple kit a computer anyone can
do Wow could you just feel happy now
we're back with three new tips to make
encode the physical world cameras pixels
speakers and sensors this is a camera
follow the story make it yourself snap a
picture code your own flashes and silky
add a tripwire and you can trigger shop
make a pixel grid learn its logic make
it spark show sound display data code
your own game add a tilt sensor and take
control make a speaker an electronic
instrument code your own music loops and
beef add a gesture sensor and burn
mix and match to make thousands of
powerful projects we copy you down eagle
join a world curious people of all age
but I'm feeling it when the cameras can
be attached to teachers that make guys
like that they'll remember that opening
up this kid making a camera it just felt
really empowered useful innovative great
product my little camera took really
good pictures somebody took my code and
use it to on their own space yet I feel
so proud it uses your whole mind like
the creative side the analytical side it
uses everything this is something I
actually feel I could do my software we
could do it together and I could feel
kind of a pause well I think it's a nice
thing you have to control it so it's
like you know you can really make it
here and really get significance aside
play with these kids
learn how the world around you work and
make it through something you
you
every once in a while a revolutionary
product comes along that changes
everything
I'd like you to make the bubble here
it all started five years ago when I was
working for a company called immersive
media at that time they were working
with Google to create what is now known
as Street View a problem the market that
I saw was that spherical technology was
only being used for mapping you can
probably use it for some other things
like panoramic photos and filmmaking
interactive videos we decided the part
of cells to make something special the
bubble cam doesn't just capture photos
or videos but also streamed live videos
we want to make this technology portable
small so portable and available to
everything people are accustomed to
shooting panoramas with their mobile
phone there's a problem with that it's
inherently at a sync with the bubble cam
you press the button once and boom
you've got your photos your video and
you pop it in our software you can look
all around it's amazing
we've designed the camera in a
tetrahedral orientation Center there are
no blind spots because each camera
overlaps the joining campus no other
camera that we've seen on the market is
able to handle that as well as put it in
their form factor that's the size of a
baseball that's light portable and easy
to move around a few in any environment
that you want to record with bubbles
patent-pending tetrahedral design you'll
get 14 megapixel photos h.264 video
capturing 1080p at 15 frames per second
and 720p at 30 frames per second Wi-Fi
live-streaming
a microSD slot and USB streaming I
really think people are going to want to
buy the bubble camera just because of
the ability to shoot in many different
direction the fact is it takes in all
views in real time whether it be
security and surveillance action sports
gaming real estate teleconferencing I
really do think the opportunities are
was with bubbles SDK API our goal is to
allow people to experiment and explore
with this new technology and we've seen
it used in music videos before with the
Black Eyed Peas back we've seen the
commercial used for IKEA and Budweiser
one of the most exciting things that I'm
looking forward to is seeing how
filmmakers are going to be using 360
video it's a whole new way to shoot
things and create interactive
experiences and a new way of telling
story body-mind change is a
co-production between tip and the CFC
media lab we can start to figure out
what we can do it and I'm really excited
about the insulation work the video work
the interactive work is that you can do
a technology like this we've designed
the bubble cam to be ready and available
to everyone
you don't have to make a choice
sometimes you want that straight on shot
that one angle but they're going to be
moments where you want to see everything
with your help we're going to make 360
degrees of your world available at
anytime
