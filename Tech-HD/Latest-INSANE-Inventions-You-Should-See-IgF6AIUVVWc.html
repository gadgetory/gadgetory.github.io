boxes say hello to Footloose the amazing
automatic litter box and feline health
tracker its rotating chamber gently sift
cell clubs preventing them from clogging
or breaking off into debris once all the
droppings are gone the unused litter is
cycled back into the chamber ready for
next time this whole process takes just
90 seconds and as for the odor
what odor the waste receptacle is
airtight and equipped with internal
filters I control the snow
smells like world domination and when
the waste receptacle is full footloose
even send you an alert just remove the
bag throw it away and that's it cleaning
all the devilish droppings delicately
dedicated by your cat is now easier than
ever no more searching shoveling or
sifting what used to be a 10 minute
daily chore now takes 2 minutes a week
but footloose is more than just a litter
box it can also be a lifesaver cats
often hide their pain making it
difficult to detect health problems
luckily for you potty behavior is a
telltale sign that something's wrong
Footloose uses weight sensor to detect
which cat is using it it collects
important data like when it happened how
long it took and how much holy moley mr.
noodles 10 visits at the box and no
urine time for the vet
ever since I upgraded the footloose I've
got so much free time I can finally
finish my album to tell you the truth I
put the foot in the loose now when your
kid he goes poop
you can just watch it go poof easy to
change out the bag ain't gotta worry
about smell send an alerts to my app
stay up to date with the health that's
where I've got so much free time I'm so
on love of my meat time I'm giving the
scoop is the peace sign I'm doing it all
for the felines
the nicest box I've ever used Headroom
and privacy for days you know what's my
favorite litter definitely corner the
butler's work with any type motion
detection to keep cats and children safe
how thoughtful so if you love your cat
but hate shoveling poop
back is today and you'll be the first to
receive the Footloose and exclusive
discounted price but this deal were any
better it'd be a steal but seriously
it's a great product
the proliferation of cheap and easy to
fly drones has triggered a rise in the
number of incidents where the safety and
security of individuals and facilities
has been compromised drones have
infiltrated the security of heads of
state delivered contraband into prisons
photographed private film sets and the
property of celebrities attempts to
protect using conventional weapons have
failed sky wall 100 has the ability to
quickly and easily neutralize a drone
threat by physically capturing a drone
in a net and controlling its descent to
the ground it combines a compressed gas
powered launcher with an intelligent
projectile this portable system provides
a highly mobile and cost-effective
method of dealing with drone threats the
launcher is equipped with a smart scope
to assist in precise targeting the
operator acquires a target while
receiving constant feedback from the
smart scope the on-board computer tracks
the targets flight path and calculates
the required projectile trajectory to
intercept a hovering or moving drone the
smart scope responds forcing the
operator to adjust their aim vertical
adjustments account for range while
lateral adjustments allow the operator
to accurately lead a moving target when
the smart scope is locked on to the
target a solid tone indicates the system
is ready to launch
the only way to completely neutralize a
drone whether it's being flown manually
or autonomous Lee is to physically
intercept it the system can be rapidly
reloaded allowing multiple drone threats
to be quickly engaged by a single
operator sky wall projectiles can carry
a range of countermeasures the sv40
includes a parachute which controls the
descent of a captured drone this
minimizes the risk of any collateral
damage and keeps the drone intact
allowing for forensic investigation and
identification of the perpetrator if the
operator misses the parachute will still
deploy and safely return the tethered
components for reuse other features can
also be included such as audible and
visual alarms and tamper proof marking
systems the system is de-energized when
not in use so it is safe to handle and
transport skywarp captures drones

master is proud to present control pad
the world's first keypad with
pressure-sensitive control designed for
gamers creative professionals and
everyone in between control pad comes
with 24 mechanical switches full RGB
backlighting magnetic wrist rest and
more but what really sets control pad
apart from all other keypads is the
revolutionary aim pad technology that
gives you unprecedented control aim pad
the brainchild of Lance Matson lead
engineer behind aim pad technology so an
aim pad switch is different from a
normal mechanical switch and that a
normal mechanical switch is just on or
off similar to like how you're using a
light switch everyone's turn a light
switch on and they know that the lights
on your aim pad is different and that
it's similar to using a dimmer switch
based off of wherever you move that
switch up and down is how bright the
lights are and aim pad works in the same
type of technology that it can sense how
far down a key is being pressed based
off of how much light is being reflected
back to the sensor Coolermaster teamed
up with Lance in a bid to change how we
use keyboards both in gaming and
professional applications control pad
takes that tech and combines it with 24
mechanical switches of your choice
Cherry MX or gatherin play games the way
they were meant to be played maneuver
turns seamlessly switch from run to walk
to creep just like when using a
controller without sacrificing your aim
with a mouse control that doesn't need
to be limited to gaming it has the
potential to be used with professional
applications and that's where you come
in we worked on the product now it's
time to develop the software with your
help
we want to work with the community to
see which functions you'd like to have 4
control pad we're sure control pad can
be used in ways we haven't even thought
of yet and with your backing we hope to
produce an analog keypad that meets your
needs
make it yours and let's bring this
project to life together</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
