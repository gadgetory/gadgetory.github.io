out of town for a few days before we're
just having guests over we like to keep
our valuables hidden unsecure smart
saves our line of products designed to
look like everyday household objects but
are actually in hidden compartments we
tried other safes and they were either
way too big and bulky or they just took
way too long to get into which can be a
problem when storing objects you need
daily access to like jewelry or
prescription medication the vent fits
between two studs which makes it easy
for anyone to install smart safes use
your phone to open up and they give you
a variety of ways to access your safe
different open options allow me to
customize my level of security
oh and if you don't have a smartphone or
you just don't want to use one you can
always use your RFID card to open up the
app keeps track every time you're smart
safes used now you know who opens your
safe and when the shelves come in a
variety of colors and styles which makes
the easy to find the ones that matches
your home now your valuables are locked
and secured well conveniently accessible
hidden in plain sight hi I'm Luke and
this is my dad Mike and we are the
creators of smart safes we know everyone
has valuables that they want to lock up
so we've created safes that are
affordable convenient and practical in
the past you may have seen our safes
that use RFID keys only we now want to
start using our smartphones and utilize
the technology that comes with them
please back us today to help us complete
this project thank you for your support
and be safe as the Sun sets on planet
Earth
some species sleep better than others
like these kittens or this cute puppy
but you're not a cute puppy you are a
person so when you try to sleep this
happens instead
you've been there and so of we this is
dream on dream on is a natural drug-free
way to con your mind
fall asleep and stay asleep first you
simply put it on and get into bed next
dream on emits a soothing ultra-low
frequency pulse focusing on this pulse
cues relaxation clearing your mind and
easing you into a more relaxed state
then as your brain frequency continues
to lower you'll gently fall into a deep
natural sleep a full night's rest is
invigorating it'll give you the natural
energy boost and clear-headedness you
need for the rest of the day dream on is
safe and non-invasive so there are no
side effects like drowsiness or brain
fog well it sounds like magic our
technology is based on decades of
research on the neuroscience and brain
rhythms and sleep we tested it on real
people and the results speak for
themselves one amazing thing just
happened which is that I had the
opportunity to take a nap in the morning
while my baby slept it took me two
cycles but I just woke up from a crazy
nap like a two-hour daytime nap it does
help go to sleep it just helps you focus
on something else beside your thoughts I
didn't even really have to focus on the
sensation it just kind of was I think
something my mind focused on I would
honestly say I fell asleep much faster
than usual dream on is small and
discreet not only does that make it
comfortable to wear in the bedroom but
you could take it anywhere it can track
your sleep data and generate
personalized insights to improve your
sleep it can also work as a powerful
meditation aid our guided meditations
can specifically help with night wakings
common insomnia and other aspects of
sleep the science behind it is simple
and Trainmen is when our internal
frequencies copy or in train themselves
to the pattern of an external signal so
if the goal is to induce sleep all we
need is a low frequency signal for your
brain to lock onto and copy
I've watched family members suffer from
sleep issues firsthand and I've seen how
dream on can help them makes me feel
safe it makes me feel secure and it just
relaxes my whole body if I wake up in
the middle of the night I just reach for
it right away and I've been falling back
asleep pretty quickly I would love to
buy this for other people in my life
that I know have the same issue as me
that just can't fall asleep I'm eight
we're very close and we just need your
support to help us get through full
production please back and share this
project thank you
don't you just wish you could power all
your devices on the go at all times with
this you can introducing hyper juice the
world's most powerful USBC battery pack
hyper juice has not one but two USB C
port scapel of 60 watt and 100 watt
power delivery there is also an 18 watt
quick charge 3.0 USB port for mobile
devices
this means hyper juice can power a large
laptop like the 15-inch MacBook Pro and
a mid-sized laptop like the 13-inch
MacBook Pro 12 inch macbook or iPad pro
as well as a smart phone all at once
providing maximum power to each of the
devices making hyper juice great for
cameras GoPros Nintendo switch speakers
headphones VR headsets drones you name
it say goodbye to underpowered battery
packs or the closest bulky competition
that can only deliver up to 60 watt USB
C power although hyper juice is a
high-capacity battery it will only take
an hour to fully charge from empty with
the Apple 87 watt USB C power adapter
you can even recharge hyper juice while
charging your device's all at the same
time how about that hyper juice has a
battery capacity of 100 watt hour or
27,000 milliampere hour which is the
maximum capacity allowed on airplanes
hyper juice doubles the battery life of
a 15-inch MacBook Pro so you can stay
powered on the go yet it is compact and
light enough to bring wherever you need
power whether you're traveling on the go
or you just need some juice stay powered
with hyper juice the only USB C battery
pack you'll ever need
