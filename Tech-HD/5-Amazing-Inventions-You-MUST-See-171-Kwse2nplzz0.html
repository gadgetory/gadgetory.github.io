there's a new way to inflate tires
sporting equipment and more it's called
the air hawk and it's revolutionary the
air Hawk is an amazing new cordless
handheld air compressor that pulls in
the outside air and then compresses it
into the tire it's fast easy to use and
extremely convenient you no longer need
to drive to the gas station for air you
no longer need to pull out the large
bulky air compressor you no longer need
to buy those messy expensive cans of air
the air Hawk is the most convenient
time-saving way to fill up your tires
not only that the air Hawk digitally
reads the pressure and can be set to
stop automatically when it gets to the
correct tire pressure the air Hawk can
help you out of a bad situation
traditional hand pumps are difficult to
use and clumsy the air Hawk is easier
faster and far more efficient the air
Hawk comes with several air nozzles for
a wide variety of uses you know how
frustrating it is when you have a flat
ball but with the air Hawk flat balls
are no longer a problem in the past
blowing up inflatables such as pool toys
and camping air mattresses was a hassle
with the air Hawk that job just became
much easier
the air Hawk is no cheap disposable
gadget the air hog is a solid durable
tool that you'll use all the time other
cordless rechargeable tools can easily
cost over $100
