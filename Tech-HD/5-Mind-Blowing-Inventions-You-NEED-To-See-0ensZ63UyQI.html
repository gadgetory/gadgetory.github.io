almost half your tooth surfaces most of
it is between your teeth we're told to
floss but who likes flossing anyone

here's the real kicker it's not even the
most effective way to clean between your
teeth according to a recent Associated
Press report there has to be a better
way
until now water flossers have been one
of the only players in the game their

end up stuffed under a cabinet somewhere
toothed shower is next level water
flossing and so much more it's a
complete oral hygiene experience from
the comfort of your shower
simply attach it to your shower wall and
hook it up to the water source tooth
shower uses water pressure so no
annoying plugs or batteries are needed
it's got three different attachments for
a triple threat approach to all care
first there's the dual headed toothbrush
which it's the front back and chewing
sides of your teeth for comprehensive
surface coverage then there's the
irrigating tip it reaches where the
toothbrush is handled it's like a water
flosser only it's in the shower so it's
no mess no fuss because it's in the

historically we've made speakers and
headphones and made a very big business
out of making products that delight
customers we're gonna now help people
live more fulfilling lives with audio
products that are focused on wellness
rather than just entertainment so there
are three pillars of general health and
wellness some nutrition exercise and
sleep and most people go through life
thinking they can cheat sleep but they
can burn the candle at both ends there
are significant health implications for
not sleeping enough and not sleeping
well things like cardiovascular disease
type 2 diabetes obesity cancer
Alzheimer's are all medically
statistically linked to poor and
insufficient sleep this product is
designed to protect people sleep from
unwanted disruptive noises if the
honking of taxicabs people talking loud
neighbors a dog barking in a hotel
environment that you're just not
uncustomed to the snoring person right
next to your head I mean we've been
learning about ears at Bo's for a very
long time and we've been able to
leverage a lot of that knowledge be
combined boses noise-isolating stay here
plus tips with soothing sounds that are
optimally tuned for masking noises so
sound masking works on this basic
principle that if you have this
disturbing sound that's going on let's
say like a low rumble of a snore and you
play another sound that's close to it in
frequency so let's say a low like
thunder storm that thunder storm is
actually going to help to cover the
original snoring sound what makes it
special is our ability to do that in a
form factor that is tiny comfortable and
stable so many people sleep with the ear
pressing into a pillow so the stay here
plus tips are incredibly soft and you'll
see when you touch them and feel them
how comfortable they really are and how
you'll like having them in your ear Bose
has never made a product that's this
small before we sort of debated and
fought over every millimeter that that
we could gain to make the products
smaller it's actually very easy to use
so you download
the Bose sleep app insert the sleep buds
into your ears select which noise
masking sound you prefer schedule a wake
up alarm and you're good to go
the charging case is actually very cool
you get two nights of sleep on a single
charge to the sleep buds themselves and
then the charging case provide one
additional full charge while you're on
the go we want to bring customers in
earlier than we have traditionally done
it Bose to help us validate the product
vision I think one of the elements that
I'm most interested in hearing feedback
on is just the idea of the product
becoming part of your nightly routine
for me I want to know everything with
this solution to this really massive
problem that matters tremendously to
people we're going to change millions of
people's lives
it's that simple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
