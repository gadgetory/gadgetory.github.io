is not really my name but always for
real and I don't really live in this
fancy apartment it was found by the real
team from instruments these guys you're
probably wondering why I'm sitting here
in a dark alley let me up a little
brighter please yes it's a lab that
thinks voice command Ollie what's the
weather like outside it's 15 degrees
outside bundle up you can set it up with
Alexa Oh Google for your liking
we hate clutter that instruments so we
built in a wireless charger into this
little guy it has more than one trick up
its sleeve
silence camera rolling
I could easily set it up to wake me
gently in the morning 7:35 ollie lights
up such a cool lamp I gotta get myself
on one of these you could get one too
oh maybe five - let me at a time
okay so we're done right right
lubitz magnetic lacing solution makes
your own shoes incredibly easy to put on
and take off tens of thousands of people
have loved their Zubaz because they no
longer have to fuss with tying laces
squeezing into shoes double knots ugly
floppy bows or laces coming undone with
xue bits your shoe is wide open so you
can easily slip in without squeezing as
if you had no laces at all then just
pull the magnets together and that's it
now go for a run or play sports lubitz
magnets are incredibly strong we've
taken the strongest neodymium magnets
and made them even stronger with our
patent-pending magnetic array technology
to prove how strong they are we gave
some Zubaz to our parkour friends and
bay area movement and they really put
them to the test
in two days of running and jumping off
buildings trees and playgrounds the
magnets only separated once so yuzu bits
on your daily run triathlons dance class
your gym class if you triple unders at
CrossFit go mountain biking quickly put
on golf shoes play basketball your
hiking shoes can double as slippers
around the campsite clean up casual
shoes use the magnetic force show off
your Zubaz hang shoes on your locker or
conveniently organize the whole family's
shoes
with zu bits closures you can
magnetically pair up your shoes and
organize them in new places
this really encourages kids to put shoes
away and helps define them and zubats
are not just for athletic shoes but
perfect for casual shoes and they even
make boots a lot easier to put on
because you don't have to reverse the
laces to squeeze in so in winter time
you can even put boots on with mittens
there are other elastic shoelace
solutions but they stretch out in weeks
Lubitz can be used over and over again
on new pairs of shoes
with this 2.0 version we are offering
six new colors to match your shoes or
make them stand out or even mix two
pairs to support your favorite sports
team to install Zubaz closures onto your
own shoes unlace the top three rows then
relays through the Zubaz next attach our
securing clips and lock your laces for a
secure hold
then you can cut off the excess lace
because you don't need it anymore and
with soo bits 2.0 if you ever want to
adjust the fit tighter or looser just
quickly slide the clip as needed you can
also wrap your lace around the clip for
the most secure hold
so get Zubaz closures for your shoes and
never tie laces again
