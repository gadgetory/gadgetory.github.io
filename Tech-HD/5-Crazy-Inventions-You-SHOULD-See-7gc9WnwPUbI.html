every single day and because of the way
we're doing it 90% of us will get back
pain in our lives seriously when we
hunch and slump it affects our mood our
happiness even how optimistic we feel
look at yourself right now
how are you sitting how's your back and
your neck probably not too great huh hi
my name is Catherine and I started
working on my posture two and a half
years ago when I started having terrible
sciatica pain I have spent so much time
and money on doctors visits therapies
special pillows and all these ridiculous
products but I couldn't find anything
that just worked so for the past year
I've been creating a real solution with
the most amazing designers and
prototypers and dozens and dozens of
people with really bad backs it was
important to create something small
enough I could fit in my purse and
something effortless so I could just
count on it working in five seconds flat
something reliable and something that
would help me improve my posture even
when I wasn't wearing it this is better
back it allows you to effortlessly sit
in perfect posture easing back pain and
training yourself how to sit use it when
you're sitting at your desk on an
airplane watching a game or even when
you meditate basically use it anytime
you have to sit you don't have to go far
to find people with bad posture or back
pain a friend a parent someone you work
with or even people you meet product
testing around San Francisco every
Friday here's what people think about
better back
Oh so let's kind of elaborate I feel da
honey feels awesome it's so easy to just
sit up straight this could sound weird
back and like feel my my body you know I
can feel my hey my organs not being
squished I can feel that it's right here
but it's not like oh I have all this on
me it's just like I am just like
relieved pain-free I'm sitting straight
up right there's like it forces your
torso to stay upright where can I get
one of these can I have this one simple
it's easy I put it on and I feel
immediate relief so that's how it feels
and this is how it's actually helping
betterback gives you better posture it
allows you to not fatigue the muscles
that you use when you're sitting down so
when you do stand up your posture is
literally changed good posture can
change who you are it affects your
attitude it affects your decision making
good posture changes who you are
literally sitting correctly over time
does more than stop slumping stress on
your spine
it also retrains your body's natural
default posture so whether you're
standing or sitting without better back
your posture is greatly improved let me
show you how it works better bag zips
itself into a portable case throw it in
your bag and unpack it when you're ready
to sit wrap the back pad around your
back and the knee straps around your
knees all there's left to do is to pull
on the adjustable leg straps to stack
your spine into perfect posture so if
you're going to spend nine hours of your
day sitting you might as well be doing
it right when you're pain free and your
body is perfectly aligned you feel
happier more confident and you regain
your ability to focus on whatever it is
you want out of life

my name is viktoria who I just graduated
from UC Berkeley and I am the co-founder
of accent accent where is a company that
makes innovative headphones that you
haven't seen before I came up with idea
wild goat but I was never able to turn
it into a reality
fortunately I met my best friend
Victoria and she was able to help me
with a lot of the things that I could
accomplish by myself so we came up with
the idea for the name for accent where
when we were actually just on Facebook
and we were chatting with a bunch of our
friends and we were like hey guys let's
think of a good name that would be
fitting for this new company and we're
just throwing ideas back and forth and
finally someone said oh you know what
what about accent way and we're like you
know what sounds pretty good first I
came up with a few sketches I drew them
on people's head to a good idea of how
they were looked I tried all different
colors different designs there's a great
lab at UC Berkeley and we just got a
fellowship at the Innovation Lab and we
would go in every week and we would take
around and we just put things online
finally got a design that I'm happy with
I started doing a 3d model of it I have
a physical model to try on people one of
the things that we ended up changing
through feedback from our our fans on
Facebook was that they wanted bigger
cans they wanted it over the year
instead of on the year so we changed
that because a lot of people are
requesting that each new prototype the
headphones get closer and closer to what
we envision so these are the headphones
accent or accent and the headband and
all the plastic parts are made of ABS
which is a recyclable material so it is
environmentally friendly that way these
are the LED lights that are that show up
to be the color that you choose I'm
going to have a couple of options these
are the external speakers so you can
share music with your friends we're
really excited to make these a reality
and to take these from the prototyping
stage to the final product we really
hope that you'll support us and our
endeavor please back us up on our
campaign
to help us turn this into a reality
thank you
you
towels are one of those things that we
use every single day
unfortunately towels get wet and hang in
warm steamy bathrooms which turns out is
the ideal breeding ground for bacteria
and fungus but why are we cleaning up
just to dry off with a musty towel that
hasn't been washed in days introducing
Silvan towels so on towels combined soft
absorbent organic cotton with pure
silver to naturally eliminate bacterial
growth on your entire towel the result a
towel that never gets musty requires
less laundry and can provide critical
benefits to your skin and health
silver is one of our planet's most
remarkable materials it naturally
carries a positive charge that has
attracted bacteria destroying it before
it has the chance to reproduce so we
thought why not use silver to improve
something we all use every day our
microfibers are carefully coated with
pure silver and proven to eliminate up
to 99% of bacteria these silver fibers
are then twisted with the softest
organic cotton we could find to create a
super plush self-cleaning - home from
beautiful design to material sourcing we
set out to create a towel that looks and
feels as great as it performs our
organic cotton is soft absorbent and the
perfect fit for sensitive skin unlike
similar products all of our designs rely
entirely on natural materials we don't
use any harsh chemicals or treatments
and because the silver is woven right
into our fabrics the antimicrobial
properties will last a lifetime
last year Kickstarter help bring Silvan
bedsheets to life so we're super excited
to expand our products into something
else that we all use every day all we
need is your help to bring this product
to life so stop drying off with dirty
towels and make the switch to Sivan the
only towels that stay clean thanks to
pure natural silver</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
