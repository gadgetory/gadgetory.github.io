Oh
we started continue with the ambition of
defining the future of fashion because
we feel that the future of fashion is
going to be about how to use emerging
technologies that are becoming more and
more readily accessible our design in 12
is the world's first right where article
completely 3d printed clothing for one
thing is named in 12 after the materials
made out of which is nylon 12 melon 12
is created directly by the 3d printing
process which is SLS or selective laser
sintering literally a laser melts the
plastic into the geometry of your design
and so it's possible to create this like
almost fabric like material by doing a
geometry that involves lots of
interlocking pieces connected by spring
at leave we make custom 3d printed by on
a year that you capture from a
smartphone throughout the day your arch
is going to go unsupported and why that
matters is the muscles are actually
going to collapse and that leads to foot
fatigue what we do is we offer custom
arch support which is going to lessen
that foot fatigue you can't get that off
the shelf because every arch is
completely different left to right
person to person customization engine at
Louisville really it's allowing the use
of a pervasive platform today which is
the mobile phone it allows us to take
theta about the human body from a phone
that everyone has in their home so that
secret sauce that magic of taking that
data turning that into geometry and then
manufacturing it it's really the kind of
magical weave there's a range of
different 3d printing approaches what we
use is something called SLS selective
laser sintering roller spreads of fine
layer of powder into a really flat layer
and then it's passed over with a laser
selectively you can see it melting the
layers of plastic in a slice of the
three-dimensional object until you end
up with a 3d object embedded in a block
of powder that you then need to exhume
ultimate goal is to add ten active years
to people's lives and that's predicated
on people being able to be active that
starts at the feet we know the pursuit
we're taking on is not easy to build
software a adaptive manufacturing
platform and a physical product you just
have to have that much more of a belief
in why this is important you know for us
these words keep going represent a
culture and a lifestyle we want all our
customers to embrace get out there live
enjoy the world and when you're done
something you're proud of then keep
going
you
