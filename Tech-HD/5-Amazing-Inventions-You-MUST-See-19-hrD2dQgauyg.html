home and couldn't enter your house or if
you couldn't find your phone and you're
late for a meeting losing your keys
sucks you never plan on losing but it
happens to everyone check out this baby
it's the new pebble be finder to prevent
you from losing things with the pebble
be finder you can find your keys in two
easy steps all you have to do press the
app hit find and and look how small it
is you can attach it to your keys bag or
anything to track it with a simple app
and it has a range of up to 200 feet
that's over half the length of a soccer
field the app is always tracking even
when it's closed so it shows you on the
map exactly where you last left them see
here's another great perk the pebble V
finder works both ways push the button
and instantly find your film she made me
do it very good my lipstick baby the
Finder has a one-year replaceable
battery and a precision machine
stainless steel ring for strength and
durability Oh pebble be finders come in
pretty handy huh who'd you say made it
again just some nerds in Seattle thank
you so much for helping pebble be get to
where we are today for the last three
years we've been creating products to
help save you time and live a happier
life we've coupled our beautifully
engineered hardware with a brand-new
simple and easy-to-use app you're gonna
love it so please pledge your support
for the pebble V finder and from all of
us at pebble beach thank you
Oh
you
this used to be me starting another day
with the same for wireless connection we
all experience for Wi-Fi day and night
and never found a good solution this has
been my problem for the last 10 years in
probably yours too hi I'm David I want
to introduce you to disable the word
first don't electric our family farm
with sous Pro you can easily double and
even triple your Wi-Fi range and also
maximize your Wi-Fi quality just by
mounting it on your router antenna seuss
pro focuses the Wi-Fi frequency to 180
degrees instead of 360 degrees most
Wi-Fi routers nowadays have two or even
more antennas so when installing Zeus
pro you still can get 360 degrees Wi-Fi
connection but now with three times the
range and that's not all
it could be your old neighbor surfing on
your Wi-Fi 53 days but it can be an
unwanted guest Wi-Fi is highly easily
hackable by turning Zeus pro and aim it
to your private area you can secure your
wireless network from unwanted guests
Zeus Pro also increases your Wi-Fi
connection speed by reducing
interferences that block the Wi-Fi
signal and for the gamers between us it
reduces lags and disconnections
your bio light and we're on a mission to
bring energy everywhere in 2014 you our
community helped us make the BioLite
base camp one of the most successful
Kickstarter campaigns of all time you
know us for fire now get to know us for
light introducing the BioLite based
Lantern the world's first flat pack
Lantern that creates your own personal
smart grid completely off grid hi i'm
anton and I'm bike and where the lead
designers on the base Lantern when
you're away from an outlet lighting
large spaces generally means turning to
some form of lantern to get the job done
and it turns out most lanterns out there
could really use an upgrade with that in
mind we designed the base Lantern to
meet three core energy needs big light
without any bulk shareable power so you
choose what gets a charge and smarter
control giving you real-time feedback on
how to make your energy last longer
here's a closer look at the base Lantern
in action utilizing advanced edge light
technology the base Lantern maximizes
brightness while minimizing space
fitting 500 lumens of light into a
compact packable form and unlike old
single-function lanterns as a hub this
can extend even more light with the
integration of bio light site lights
creating easy overhead lighting to light
large spaces or create multiple websites
with the use of phones and other digital
tools playing more and more of a role in
off-grid life we need energy to keep
them going the baseline turns internal
rechargeable battery is paired with two
USB ports so you can power your weekend
with up to 50 hours of light or for
phone charges depending on what you need
grab the base lantern XL and add even
more power to your system when energy is
scarce making it easy to monitor and
adjust your usage is critical so we're
bringing the controls and analytics
right to your pocket turn on/off and dim
and if you've got site lights hooked up
you can control those two full color
spectrum control allows you to engage
night vision calibrate the warmth of
your light or even have a little fun
with your surroundings set sleep timers
or alarms to wrap up your night or start
an early day without fumbling in the
dark enable proximity activation and the
base Lantern will automatically turn
itself on
off based on your location so you can
find your way back home safely and
easily oh and the app itself it barely
uses any battery from your phone thanks
to low-energy Bluetooth settings we've
spent the last two years researching the
intersection of light energy and
off-grid needs both in the outdoors end
in homes where access to an outlet isn't
so easy with your support you're not
only helping us create lighting that can
change your experience outdoors you're
creating the foundation for energy
solutions that will change the way
families live after dark worldwide we've
got some great award lined up including
special kits that include some familiar
faces from the BioLite family of
products it's time to reimagine the way
we look at what a landrum can be and
where it can fit into everyday life back
us today and experience the power of a
personal energy hub that's designed to
keep up with your life outside and off
the grid wherever you are from all of us

bring energy everywhere

or tack up a family by company for the
last seven years we've been creating
bike strollers that are loved and
enjoyed all around the globe this is our
latest project we do not hesitate when
we say this is the next step in the
evolution of family bikes see three
years ago we searched for our next
project we turn to a lot of people and
ask them what they would want in a
family life some answers were strange
and you make it fly somewhere
eye-opening young babies should be
facing their parents and some were just
little we listen and set out to create
the ultimate family bike for two years
we made sketches prototypes studied
materials carried out experiments and
explored every aspect of family bike
should have basically we reinvented the
family bike this is autauga to point all
the most comfortable safe easy to ride
practical and just all around coolest
family like you couldn't possibly
imagine watauga to has everything our
customers wanted and much more safety
first tonga has three wheels so it's
inherently stable the cargo box
materials are super-strong plastics with
a metal frame inside that makes the
seating area durable and resistant to
impact the child seats themselves have
endless features and options
tonga can take one or two kids facing
forwards backwards or replacing each
other or a boatload of laps to keep it
versatile in seconds toggle to turns
from a family bike into a lockable cargo
bike with extra load space on top we use
disc brakes and a Shimano gear and you
can always easily turn it into an
electric light for effortless
long-distance rides now for the fun part
apart from the wind in their hair we
wanted the kids to have a truly
enjoyable adventure on our bikes so we
added the accessory line to which you
can attach a variety of fun add-ons yes
there's also a water gun and when it
rains or if the kids just want some
privacy there's the royal canopy let's
see what else no it can't fly yet but it
can all be taken apart to fit in your
car truck oh and the seats come in a
variety of colors because you know the
personal touch transforms our own
ultimate bike into your own ultimate
fighter last but certainly not least the
price while creating the target ooh we
never forgot the one thing everyone
asked make it affordable make it
affordable for them so we did because to
turn the family bike trend into a real
revolution we had to make it accessible
for everyone whether you use it for a
weekend trip drop off
for shopping or to carry your loyal
friends autauga two is an ideal solution
our company has a proven track record so
this is one of those projects you can
back safe we need your help to make this
piece of family on a reality so back
Tyga and help us make the ultimate
family one tag</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
