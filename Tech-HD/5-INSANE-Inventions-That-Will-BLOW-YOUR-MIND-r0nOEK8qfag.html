the only spill-proof smart bottle you
can use from any angle designed to fit
into your active life lid knows when
you're taking a sip and opens and closes
automatically the secret lies in lids
battery-powered touch sensor that
detects the presence of your lips when
you want to drink in order to control
the flow of liquids from the bottle to
your mouth through a built-in automatic
stopper when you place your lips on lid
it opens and lets you drink normally as
soon as your lips come off the stopper
inside closes the feel no more hot
spills are constantly unscrewing caps of
two hands now you can keep your focus on
the day ahead thanks to the lids
proprietary 360 degree opening you can
drink from any angle just like a glass
no more looking for straws or
inconvenient openers while driving and
when you get to your next stop just grab
the lid and go because it won't open
unless it detects your mouth perfect for
preventing embarrassing spills and doors
lid is also strong enough for the
rough-and-tumble of the great outdoors
and can be quickly washed with soap and
water now available in an array of eye
popping colors you can order your lid
today to ship with a 13 or 17 fluid
ounce container the container stainless
steel insulation combined with the
sealed chamber will keep your beverages
at the right temperature throughout your
day and every couple of weeks just take
off the top to wirelessly recharge the
1600 milliamp battery by placing it on
any Qi enabled charger through dozens of
prototypes blitz design is polished and
the technology is primed for shipping we
have been working for the past two years
to perfect the technology inside lid and
now with our veteran team with decades
of manufacturing experience our
suppliers and factory locked in we are
ready for production by ordering lists
for your friends family and yourself we
will be able to reach our minimum four
in order and together we look forward to
creating the world's smartest bottle
thank you for your support
lid won't spill because it only opens
when you drink what does it mean to
redefine an industry building on
tradition
it means pressing on through endless
design challenges sleepless nights and
engineering the impossible so we went
back we went way back picked up a pencil
sharpened it and hit the drawing board
to create something groundbreaking
introducing the maxim 9 the world's
first integrally suppressed 9-millimeter
handgun that is holds durable and
hearing safe with all 9-millimeter
ammunition in its factory configuration
no more choosing between keeping your
pistol is short as possible and adding a
silencer now you can have the best of
all worlds the maxim 9 represents great
strides and pistol design and suppressor
technology shipped in its full length
configuration the user can shorten the
maxim 9 by over 1 inch in the short
configuration the maxim 9 remains
hearing safe with subsonic ammunition
left or right-handed it doesn't matter
the maxim nines ambidextrous design
allows you to shoot how you want the
maxim 9 is purpose-built enabling you to
shoot in the most adverse conditions as
firearm enthusiasts ourselves we know
you demand the best that's why we won't
settle for anything less than perfection
okay so this is the fur right that we
ever made this is how it works all you
do is pull the trigger back that's
completely cool hi my name is Carl's
dealer I live here in Columbus Ohio and
I've been selling toys for the last 13
years so I started out as a carny
literally going from flea market to flea
market I remember actually like sleeping
in my car at flea markets to save money
and then I graduated to the state fairs
and state fairs of selling on national
TV and I started out selling these
formal so I still even jumped from a cup
the cup so this is my next big hit in
the toy industry it was called bright
bucks you grab the light you can make it
go through your head I'm getting
lightheaded and this is my new item it's
called second Soaker it's the world's
first water gun that fills in one second
so the one-second soaker fills in one
second other guns would you have to do
you four run over to the hose fill it
these are just dunk full dunk pull don't
pull don't pull that's how easy it is
okay so let's talk about the technology
behind our 1 second film imagine you
have a straw I remember doing this as a
kid put it into a cup put your finger
over the top same thing with the gun
bigger straw the front has a magnetic
one-way flap that goes back when you're
pulling the trigger back it opens the
back valve let go of the trigger it's
now shut full in one second there hasn't
been innovation in water guns in 20
years I remember as a kid having one of
the famous soakers that came out the 90s
and unscrewing the bottle running into
the house filling it and then dripping
on the way out this one you just dump so
if you have a pool a bucket of water
don't get completely full in one second
so now that the fun stuff let me show
you how this thing works
so this thing can hold almost two litres
of water and check this out this is how
it works pull the trigger back dump
completely full check this out
the distance is amazing dunk pull so
this is the spread function this is to
get your opponent drink and drenched
fast
he starts running click it over you now
have the distance and look how much
water is still left pretty amazing
calculator is a must for lots of people
existing calculators lack design and a
responsive typing experience at low free
we felt like a change needed to be made
introducing the digit calculator the
first mechanical switch calculator with
a vibrant retro design with the digit
calculator you can workout all your
daily calculation efficiently and
comfortably it has the classic low free
design with its retro body frame
circular key caps and gatherin blue
switches to offer you the best typing
experience
with its highly efficient design it also
can continue to work for 500 hours with
just a 700 triple-a milliampere hour
battery designed for students
accountants
and office staffs it's time to calculate
in style with the digit calculator the
digit calculator your first mechanical
switch calculator</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
