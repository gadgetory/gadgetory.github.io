the octane K 45 and Osprey K 45 were
designed at the request of leading
handgun manufacturers for submission to
the US Army's modular handgun system
competition a program intended to select
the next standard issue sidearm from
multiple branches of the US military
engineered for those interested in the
shortest hearing safe version of both
the Osprey 45 and the octane 45 these
suppressors also feature a dark grey
seracote finish to reduce their visual
signature compared to traditional black
anodizing
hi my name is Spencer Taylor co-founder
of fennec in the summer we're not
working we like to be outside whether
it's camping glamping climbing fishing
road trip hunt
being hunted anytime you're out there
keeping food fresh can be tough the
cooler as most people's go to solution
but once the ice melts it's pretty much
useless and direct exposure to water of
frost can reduce the shelf life and
flavor of fruits and vegetables looking
beyond the cooler and your options are
pretty limited you can set up a fridge
at your campsite but they're heavy
expensive and are going to require you
to carry in a constant supply of fuel or
plug it in or buy the freeze-dried food
wrap which let's be honest just isn't as
tasty and fennec we've been working with
the last four years to develop a
lightweight low cost food preservation
system that never needs electricity or
ice we call it the Yuma six DL it weighs
less than 5 pounds packs flat and is
easy to take anywhere can be assembled
in under 30 seconds and is powered
exclusively by water or river water and
in hot and dry conditions can preserve
food at the five days without needing a
refill
the secret is patent-pending smart
fabric technology and our team is
inspired by humanity's first cooling
system honed over ten million years of
evolution sweating we've developed a
smart material which mimics the
properties of human skin called face
deck the flexible walls are made of a
sandwich of food safe plastic on the
inside and phase deck on the outside
water is stored in between the two and
as water absorbs heat from the food it
becomes vapor this vapor passes through
the specialized pores in the face Tec
taking heat and energy with it in hot
and dry conditions the interior can be
up to 35 degrees Fahrenheit or 20
degrees Celsius colder inside than the
ambient air temperature around it this
cooler temperature greatly extends the
shelf life of perishable food tomatoes
kept inside can last up to five times
longer than those
left out in the open it's ideal for
fruits and vegetables that are best kept
in a stable room-temperature you can use
it on extended trips living off-grid
trying to reduce your carbon footprint
or you just need a place to store some
extra perishable food it has straps for
easy carrying and can be stacked to save
space everything from the truck to an
extra room can be turned in and
temperature stable storage fennec was
founded with the social mission at our
core around 20% of the world does not
have access to refrigeration this means
that more than half of the fruits and
vegetables grow in sub-saharan Africa
spoiled before anyone can eat them not
only does this reduce 3.3 billion tons
of carbon in the atmosphere and every
year it dramatically impacts the incomes
and habits of the rural families we've
had versions in the field in North
Africa for more than 30 years these
studies have allowed us to refine an
iterator design in that time our users
have saved up to ten percent of their
income as a result of less trips of the
market and less wasted food global food
spoilage affects everything and a fennec
needs our help to fight it we want to
make this product available to some of
the most vulnerable populations on earth
new people making as little as five
hundred dollars a year by buying one
you're enabling us to distribute it to
these markets at reduced cost the fennec
team has spent years of our lives and
Rowin money developing this tech now we
need your help to turn this amazing
product into a powerful tool for change
that you can take in your next outdoor
adventure join us
and of course thanks for backing us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
