now have new colors that match your gear
we have these black bodies and the
colored knobs and we're also offering a
new light gray color another new feature
of these lunch shifters is the Kevlar
belt this is an upgrade over the
previous fiberglass belt and it's much
stronger and also less flexible so it's
easier to put on to your lens the new
lens chapter was inspired by the
feedback from all our photography and
videography customers based all over the
world take a look at what some of them
have to say hey guys it's Jerry with
tech toy TV my name is Jeremy Utley with
Antley production hi my name is jason
with MDI and this is how we use the Lind
shifter what I like about the lens
shifter is just one slight move and
you've made the same move as if you've
twisted your Witt wrist all the way
around in our productions we use
multiple prime lenses and every time we
switch out the lens we have to readjust
the follow focus wheel and that takes
time from our production so instead get
yourself a set of lens shifters equipped
each prime lens with a lens shifter and
therefore all you have to do is switch
out the lens and you're ready to pull
focus right away from behind the camera
you can see which one you're focusing so
you don't have to fill around or move
your camera a lot to get to it now what
I use it for the most is macro
photography now when you shoot macro
most of the time you're shooting on a
tripod and what you're having to do is
you're having to reach your hand around
and use your wrist to turn the whole
thing and after a while that gets tiring
especially if you're using it for a long
time now because of its bright color
scheme it allows you to have a visual
cue as to where your focus points are
while keeping your eyes on the monitor
especially in those bright and dark
situations so that's our look at Lin
shifter it's an inexpensive yet very
useful tool for your DSLR camera
car-washing was a big trouble for many
people it is time-consuming labor
consuming and it cost money actually
that is not true
once you have no sure at hand nor shirt
maybe the world's first smart
multifunctional car washing kit making
car washing easy fast and free of charge
the water source could be directly from
a water bottle or external sources such
as our foldable water bucket it takes
only 15 seconds to set up and ten
minutes to complete the car washing
saving 80 percent of the time the
cleaning process is neat and easy
without making a mess Moisture is very
compact in size but can be kept in the
trunk for everyday use
no matter how wild you a trip is your
car will always remain tidy nor sure
requires no external power get fully
charged within three hours through USB
charging port nor sure could serve as a
portable jump starter it's also a power
bank for your outdoor usage it can also
be used as a warning sign nor sure has
three preset modes for various
situations you can easily switch from
the water spray gun to spray brush not
just for the car washing
it's a multifunctional must-have kit for
every car owners with Norcia
you can save those money for an exotic
trip that you well-deserved nor sure one
kit for every car owner
when we started Wado we only had one
goal in mind to make you effortlessly
shift your lifestyle towards a more
sustainable one to help make that change
we offer you fashion products you don't
have to pay more for and what's more
important that you don't have to
compromise on design the sneaker who
have design are based on three simple
principles they follow real and current
fashion trends they are affordable and
they are sustainable in addition they
are very comfortable and made with
high-quality materials which are two
essential requirements for us our shoes
are made out of a chromium free leather
helping to avoid the land-use effects of
this toxic product on the shoe makers
and also on the environment we realized
that the sustainable fashion products
that are cruelly traded in the market
rarely follow the through criteria most
of the times they are much more
expensive than non-sustainable ones or
they do not follow fashion trends
whether we believe in you to the actions
we carry out and we firmly believe that
you can also play green if you act with
us for each pair of shoes that we sell
we will plan to threesome applied
northeast India the collaboration with
the NGO we first at the beginning and to
make a bigger impact will focus our
efforts and one single area but in the
future when we get significant relevance
we will take action in more countries by
planting trees we are not only referring
every Sydney but we are also providing
employment as well as wood and food
resources to local communities we also
wanted to be green in the production
process
that's why we have unceasingly looked
for a supplier capable of meeting our
values after many tries we spotted a
very small factory in figueres
for the one well known for its footwear
production where artisans thrill of the
world
for you
Kickstarter backers we have designed
exclusive ruger but you will be able to
get the shoes add up to 40% discount far
before they are lands to the market in
addition for each other our reusable
100% cotton bag will be added for free
this pack is ideal for daily use and
matches our playground values perfectly
this project has been our life for over
a year and honestly it hasn't been easy
an industry fashion related project
requires a great effort to come up with
a product with an exceptional design and
different values compared to other
brands however I believe we have
achieved a great result and we are
really grateful to all the people who
made it possible for us to get here oh
and by the way whadda means thank you in
the Cherokee language
introducing inb arrow to the world's
first designer oxygen purifier it's your
personal portable oxygen friend we've
all been there a productive morning
smashing tasks and fighting the urge to
snapchat your coworkers while while
we're busy working we're also busy
creating carbon dioxide as the day goes
on oxygen levels in the air can fall
from a healthy 21 percent to a
sleep-inducing 17 percent and we are hit
with the dreaded two o'clock slump we
overdose on coffee and hit the vending
machine in search of a sugar boost
nothing works we might as well just shut
the blinds tick back and call it a day
until now now you have a choice co2 or
Oh to the inb our o2 is the most
portable and user-friendly oxygen
purifier ever made it is also extremely
good-looking simply put on the headset
breathe deep and feel good just 30
minutes a day is all you need for a
healthy wake-up call it can be powered
with a 12-volt battery pack or by the DC
jack in your car take oxygen on the road
and be on your a-game when you get there
this bits important so listen up folks
the inb arrow 2 is not I repeat NOT a
medical oxygen concentrator and should
not be purchased binding when needing
oxygen for medical conditions if you
have a medical condition you should
consult your doctor before use
stop being an oxymoron now you can top
up on oxygen
anytime inb arrow to feed your brain and
be an oxy genius
