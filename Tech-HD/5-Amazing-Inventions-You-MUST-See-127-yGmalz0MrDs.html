and founder of vinyl luxe vintage vinyl
design and have been making products and
recycled records for almost 15 years
I first partnered up with uncommon good
in late 2002 and I had designed a couple
of bowls made out of vinyl records one
of the kind of funny questions that I
frequently get asked is yeah I like the
bowl can you still play it so I kind of
felt like it was an interesting
challenge to come up with a way to
actually play the record again
Kickstarter offers us a really nice
platform to present this brand new
product delivering contemporary sound
through a vintage format by partnering
with Jeff we could bring his design and
craft know-how to our production
experience and use the Kickstarter
community to get this product to market
that we could really never do any other
way when I first began the design work
for the Bluetooth speaker I was looking
at a number of different sources for
inspiration one was aesthetics of
gramophone
the other was the aesthetics of old
radios with the help of feedback from
the development team that uncommon good
the record is really celebrated as the
main design feature in addition to
making this thing look really cool we
also wanted to sound really good so we
partnered with a leading audio component
supplier and listened to a lot of
components before we were really sure
this thing was going to sound here's a
box so behind that middle record is a
four inch driver connected to an app and
a Bluetooth board this makes really
great mono sound coming out of the
middle and really fixing the design as
an independent design and manufacturing
company it's often difficult to launch a
brand-new product and be able to pay for
all of the tooling up costs and the
ramped up cost to make ten thousand
20,000 units of something we're coming
to the Kickstarter community because we
need you to pledge so we can get the
electronics and get Jeff to work making
these requests to genre you pick one of
the genres we have listed and we'll find
a record 480 folks Rd divas show tunes
jazz crooners disco classical opera and
classic country above death we have

one of four custom design formats or
submit your own artwork if you already
have a record you really like send it in

vinyl wizard speaker and our highest

how many times have you experienced
frustration having those uninvited
mosquitos during your outdoor adventures
in certain areas of the world
mosquitoes are well known for bringing
infectious diseases like malaria or
dying peeper which can be fatal to
people and children at an eco at the
center and people others we have decided
to stop at once and for all this is why
we want to present to you the new
mosquitoes that were mentioned it is a
compact and portable lanterns but don't
let its small size trick you it is very
powerful the lantern is easy to use
controlled by only two buses featuring
two main functions your Eno pillar and
lighting noise as I told you don't let
it start confuse you the anti mosquito
lanterns comes with two thousand
milliamp hours which translates up to 20
hours of non-stop uses wall charts so
how does it attract the mosquitoes it's
very simple the lantern uses ultraviolet
lights to attract them and then
electronically zap them with the wires
in the upper section and if you want to
use the lantern in the outdoors you can
easily hang it on trees or inside pens
by using the hidden hook on top as you
can see you just unfold it and it's
ready to become or the second feature
the lantern itself has three modes up to
200 lumens to regulate the amount of
light you will need in different
scenarios and just in case you're
wondering yes you can use both at the
same time the chilling mode and the
lighting
whenever the lanterns becomes dirty and
you need to remove the set insect you
can just use a small brush and simply
brush them off or you can use water the
zapper Magnum is highly water resistant
or the eyepiece excreting therefore you
can think it without damaging the
lantern once you take it out of the
water you can immediately turn it on and
as you can see it works impeccable to
ensure that the lantern works perfectly
we've tested it in many different
scenarios until we have come up with a
file
Rebekah's urgent as the one you can see
in this video the lantern uses a USB
port charge
allowing you to charge it and use it as
a same time for extra convenience we
want to get rid of mosquitoes and for
that we're asking for your help and your
support the lower house with the
mosquitoes that where we turn this is
finally only good lighting and set aside</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
