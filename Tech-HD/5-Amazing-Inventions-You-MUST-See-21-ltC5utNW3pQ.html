want high-quality recordings but still
be able to be present in the dive and
not fumble with filters and buttons so
we set out to make the world's best
action camera for diving octo spot is
the first camera that is able to log
your dive it's also the first to
automatically correct the white balance
to match your depth in records and high
quality and is intuitive to use it has a
long battery life even in cold water
we've designed everything to be operated
while using gloves and it can be mounted
vast and easy the octo spot is made for
divers you feel when it starts recording
and sharing your videos is easy all you
have to do is enjoy the dive
with the T rail click mount you can
mount and amount in a matter of seconds
it's rock solid there's also an adapter
mount so you can use other accessories
you may already have with a third-person
viewer you can put yourself in the shot
a great learning tool for all new divers
the ergonomic mask mount it's almost any
mask and records everything you see the
third-person viewer is the first of its
kind it's so compact it fits in a pocket
on your BC and can give you a whole new
perspective on your dive the octo spot
knows exactly how deep down you are and
make sure your recordings and pictures
are not tainted green or blue it's the
first camera in the world that can
automatically correct the white balance
to match the depth you're at it also has
electronic image stabilization this
removes shakes and creates a steady and
smooth video to avoid endless gigabytes
of data and make sharing easy we
invented snap record press wants to take
a picture and hold to record easy
makeup connect to the octal spot by
Wi-Fi or Bluetooth and immediately view
your videos pictures or snaps depth
temperature and time can be displayed in
the video the clips are ready to share
or you can choose to edit
we need your help to make this happen
baggers on Kickstarter become part of
the 18 to test and develop this camera
and future products let's make it easy
for everyone to share the deep
the brand new macbook one of the many
new devices featuring the powerful new
USB type-c port your entire computer's
power data transfer and output through a
single port it's the heights of
technological simplicity but what about
your stuff and when you need to
multitask how do you fit it all into a
single port your stuff needs marble the
first integrated system designed to work
with a USBC port
the marble offers a single compact way
to connect your many devices to your new
macbook it's got two USB ports two USB
seaports and HDMI type ape or a micro SD
card reader and a 60 watt AC inlet to
power it all it's the only system made

powering all of your devices
think of marble as your new supercharger
it gives you all the functionality of
having your device's nearby and
connected as though they were still
plugged straight into your computer and
just like the new math book marble is
easy to take with you no need to bring
your mac adapter with you on the road
bring marble and you'll be able to power
your devices and your computer while
you're on the go marble was designed to
be relatively the same size as your
computer standard power adapter and when
you consider the other mess that marble
enables you to leave at home marble
makes a whole lot of sense if you
constantly find yourself on the move
marble saves you space saves you weight
and has the ease-of-use you need easily
switch from working at the office to
home to your favorite cafe around the
corner use the micro SD card port to get
access to your videos and photos

versatility and portability you need to
work from anywhere and while you work
charge your phone your tablet and your
computer in the same place and have
access to all your files at once while

your entire office fit neatly in your
pocket
depending on your needs marble comes in
two powerful options the dcs one which
features 2 USB 3 points to USB sea ports
one hdmi type a port and the microsd
reader while the dcs two switches the
hdmi type a for an hdmi type deport and
throws in a mini DisplayPort for your
heavy duty needs like connecting
multiple external monitors when it's
time to get some serious work done at
the office there's no need to sacrifice
simplicity for the sake of extra power
run your monitors your hard drives even
your printers through the marble and
save yourself a headache or two marble

importantly it's got the energy you need
to get the job done and remember marble
works with any computer that supports
USB see technology systems like the Dell
XPS 13 9350 and the huawei mate book
among others the potential of using the
marble for us be supported devices is
continuing to grow every day get marble

introducing the matrix powerful and
beautifully designed 15 sensors and one
little device an amazing platform to
build endless IOT applications first you
have the internet then you had mobile
and outs Internet of Things is the most
important revolution in technology
anything the physical environment can be
connected to the online grid now how do
you do that in a way that is really
intuitive what the smartphone did for
mobile matrix would do for Internet of
Things it's really simple to be part of
this revolution you get your matrix you
pair your smartphone you log in and add
apps empowered with 15 sensors capable
of processing audio detecting human
emotions and responding to environmental
stimuli the matrix is breaking new
ground on the convergence of the
physical and online worlds as an
engineer this product really pushed me
to my limits we had to take into
consideration heat power tolerance
package size component sizes and getting
everything to work simultaneously and
flawlessly it is the perfect marriage of
form and function one unifying platform
powered by global creators what we
wanted to do is create a platform that
allowed one powerful little device with
15 sensors which gives 32,000 possible
sensor combinations and allow developers
around the globe to create hundreds of
thousands of applications for users it's
the simplicity of one device able to do
hundreds of things at the same time
for developers it's the ability to
create and share inventions like never
before as a developer it's interesting
to leverage of 15 sensors basically for
existing IT products I don't have the
capabilities to build apps that leverage
all these sensors very easily so having
all these sensors together in one place
from the beginning with an app ecosystem
makes the product really easy to use
it's really easy to get started a few
lines of typing and you've already have
an app it's all JavaScript once you
leverage our libraries like computer
vision like the sensor libraries you can
then push the data in real time to our
dashboards which are completely
configurable it's entirely an open
platform we're not walling you in
anything you can imagine you can do with
our device your matrix in your home can
become the monitoring device it can
become the computer vision a device that
recognizes you when you get home welcome
back would you like me to set the air to
your preferred temperature and play your
favorite playlist yes knows it's you
pushes a message to your stereo and
place your favorite movie it's a really
striking object even sitting on a table
mounted against a wall it has a lot of
presents one beautiful device endless
possibilities

a delightful family but they have one
problem their air conditioner is not so
delightful in the summer months when it
is hot and humid outside it takes 15
minutes for the AC to cool the room in
only another 15 minutes the a/c makes
things way too cold and James is forced
to find other ways to stay comfortable
this frustration continues throughout
the day and into the night as outdoor
temperatures fall conditions indoors

temperatures but not so great for Emily

the remote itself is a problem until one
day Emily finds out about ambi climate
