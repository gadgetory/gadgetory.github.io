useful and importantly how do we make it
affordable for as many people as

for the past 30 years technology a
scanner has changed small it is still
slow and hard to use imagine one true
smart scanner which is fast connected to
Wi-Fi and easy operated what's more it
can scan books this is caesar the
redesign the structure of scanner we
hope that our product can have more
people walk easier and that's the most
important reason to motivate us everyday
scanning speed is so important for
everyone to make this reality a lot of
new technologies have been used on
Caesar for the first time
we creatively yields 32-bit mix cpu for
power scanner through just young image
processing and computing ability we
improve the speed for about 20 times
compared with the traditional standard
most difficult problem have been solved
including flattening curve everything
fingerprint and smart edge cocky and so
on all of this can be done automatically
we believe that technology shouldn't be
minorities privilege new technology and
algorithm can lower the cost of the
hardware so after testing image
algorithm for hundreds of times Caesar
will be the first affordable book
scanner for everyone using see the
scanner you can scan the items that you
want to save they can be documents
bulges files contracts and the even
solid objects using Caesar cloud you
don't need to install any software or
driver and you can check it out from
your laptop I've had io smartphone
equipped with 16 million pixels camera
Cesar can make sure the clarity of every
scanning and OCR function can also make
digital copy editable Caesar is also a
visual projector with 1080p video have
we together can change three of scanning
