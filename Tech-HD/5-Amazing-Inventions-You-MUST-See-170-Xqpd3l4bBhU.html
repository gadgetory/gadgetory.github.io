the team behind sonic soak sonic soak is
a smartphone sized device that uses
ultrasound technology to clean almost
anything in ways never before possible
it cleans to the microscopic level
beyond what any laundry machine or
cleaning spray can do the inspiration
for this device came from the fact that
we were frequent travelers and cleaning
our clothes while on the go was always a
hassle so we had to set out to find a
good solution
it's also quiet and can be used to clean
more than clothes it can clean glasses
jewelry fruits razors baby bottles the
products that are tough to clean using
sponges or rags or your hands or soap
and water I think they get the idea is
ok I just want to be clear this is the
best way to clean pretty much anything
sonic soak works by generating
ultrasonic sound waves that create
microscopic high pressure bubbles to
wash away dirt grime and oils we had no
idea at the time that we come up with
was a device that had so many benefits
outside of travellers wanting an easy
way to wash clothes while on the go
it's also simple to use you simply place
it water add some soap turn on the
built-in timer and walk away minutes
later your clothes are cleaner than ever
before sonic soak is designed for
travelers moms neat freaks looking for a
thorough cleanse and not just on clothes
by the way but on fruits and vegetables
to folks with small loads of laundry
fashionistas that eat a better solution
for their gentle cycle or hand wash only
clothes folks that don't have the space
for a full sized laundry machine really
it's for anyone who wants a cleaner will
almost anything because sonic soak is
more than a great way to clean your
laundry it can clean just about anything
you can stick in the water with it so if
you like things clean free from all
those nasty things you can only see up
close
sonic soak is your solution sonic soap
is ready to be shipped just after our
campaign ends we just need you to help
make it happen which means you can have
a cleaner almost anything and
practically no time once we end this
campaign successfully so please help us
bring sonic soap to mass production and
experience clean like never before now
you can enjoy a cleaner lifestyle
wherever you go
you
what is this
tell us god damn it is it dangerous
it's a chair is this supposed to be a
chair do I look stupid
it's too light to be a chair this is it
yeah we've found your secrets you mean
my bag you're not being straight with us
look at all these mechanical parts they
do not belong in a chair Kevlar strap
ballistic nylon seat the core is made of
carbon fiber but why
these are Special Forces materials to
make the slimmest and lightest portable
seat in the world we have to push the
materials and the technology to the
limit everything down to the smallest
screw is made to measure it's this
anodized aluminum great ice and it's
corrosion free as well as strong as it
gets
what's next you're gonna tell me that
thing can hold a grown man
300 pounds not a problem just try to
unfold
actually really comfortable is designed
to strengthen your core and to avoid
back problems you can adjust the height
so it matches your specific needs so
you're telling me these are in foreign
spies using a cylinder to communicate of
course not
the sit back is simply perfect for
multiple everyday normal occasions
hanging around golfing hunting just make
life so much easier and more convenient
it really is something special I mean
such craftsmanship only premium
materials how can we get it you can be
the first one to get the Sen if you
support our Kickstarter campaign every
dollar counts
the pact one is designed to be the
ultimate travel bag for those that know
the benefits of traveling light and
avoiding airline headaches the design
combines the casual versatility of a
duffel with the organization of a
suitcase
the jet-setting sidekick features a dual
compartment design that allows you to
easily pack and neatly organize your
belongings each side has a zip around
divider to keep things in place one side
is mesh while the other is quilted with
a computer pocket there are top access
zippers to get to the contents of each
side quickly without opening the entire
bag the padded laptop pocket is located
in the center so your bag remains well
balanced and your clothing adds further
protection from bumps quickly access
your laptop from the top zipper and
remove it for security there are four
mesh pockets to hold the included
laundry and tote bag as well as your
chargers vitamins or any other small
item the interior zipper pockets on each
side are a great place to tuck receipts
or personal items you want to stash out
of sight and we're out of the way once
you've got everything packed zip up your
well-organized bag like a suitcase on
the front of the bag there are two
zippered pockets to stow away things you
want to easily access while on the go on
the back there's a magazine pocket in
the newly added TSA pocket rather than
using the plastic bins to pass your
personal items through security simply
pull out the mesh TSA pocket and stow
them away once through security rather
than join the scramble of travelers
collecting their different belongings
simply grab your bag and head to a
comfortable spot to reorganize the red
label serves as a reminder to grab your
laptop or anything else that you had to
send through the x-ray separately we
also added several accessory loops on
the outside of the bag to clip your
water bottle or other travel items these
will also serve as attachment points for
future accessories from packed true to
our ethos and approach to design you
won't find any logos on the exterior of
the bag and those are the ins and outs
of the pack to one pack it like a
suitcase carry it like a duffel and
stash it in the last remaining overhead
space
you
I love to study but doing homework is a
different story
so I soon find myself on my longboard
luckily I was able to grab a scan marker
it's the digital highlighter that lets
you scan printed material anywhere
anytime scan marker is an incredible
productivity tool and it lets you
accelerate to summarize it in typing
process transfer it to any of your
devices and share it with your friends
it saves so much time and it's easy to
use awesome
Skien mercury take notes and create
separates
have you ever seen a lamp that's able to
create a lampshade by itself in the air
ciao my name is Leo I'm a product
designer and today I want to show you
something truly special I'm happy to be
able to present to you the first more 3d
pendant lamp in the world from today
onwards light becomes three-dimensional
we pop and you can have interactive
design life is poor from a given
frequency on our eyes get sluggish and
connect the signal stimuli automatically
but flim makes use of this effect in
order to reach a new dimension in the
world of lighting a visual effect which
nowadays can mainly be found in cheap
LED toys is perfectly United with
elegance quality design and durability
let's assume you are the owner of a bar
and you want to impress your guests this
is where puff lamp comes in it consists
of two independent smart dimmable lights
once access ambient light the other one
is a functional LED light and don't
worry the motor is completely quiet and
I promise you my friend the ticking wall
clock in your kitchen will get much more
on your nerves now you will ask yourself
ok Leo thank you very much
cool lamp but how much power does this
baby drain if you use the puff lamp at
the maximum power you will consume about
34 Watts the power LED light has three
cold temperatures and three teeming
ranges depending on where you use it you
can configure the lamp as desired the
aluminum housing cools down itself
the airflow of 2 3 D lampshade this
increases the service life to the
maximum our two guests new Bart's is not
impressed okay
we exchanged light guides with LED
sticks that consists of many small color
pixels with the net you can send images
to the lampshade
you can program photos logos and text
for promotional swish and entertain you
guests with it in just the way you want
no matter if to perform just create
simple colorful lampshades or projects
even pictures and animations the visual
effect the D creates is truly and really
impossible we illustrate truthfully even
