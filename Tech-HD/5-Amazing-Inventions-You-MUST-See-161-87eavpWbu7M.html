out the car mounted erupt your flow
on
100 times a day technology is amazing
but we formed a dependence on it it can
make us feel stressed isolated and
distracted that's why we created Colby a
beautiful life that includes a speech
interface and an open-source hub it's
the perfect balance of interior design
and smart home technology a lot of
products are designed for stickiness and
we just don't think that's the right
approach we care about how products can
affect you positively your creativity
your relationships and your life with
Kobe you can use speech services like
Alexa instead of pausing to look
something up just ask a question without

our winners are getting warmer and
wetter which means that insects like
disease-carrying mosquitoes and annoying
garden pests are coming out earlier and
in greater numbers the only solutions
available in the market are unnatural
chemicals and pesticides that burn our
skin and endanger local wildlife the
solution that a common bat can eat up to
a thousand kita size insect and garden
pests in a single hour making vaping be
home to one of nature's greatest forms
of pest control hi I'm Harrison and I'm
Chris we're here in Lexington Kentucky
and we've been developing that vnb for
over a year now our mission is simple we
want to help get bat houses into
people's yards to keep families safer
from the futile tests and in turn offers
safe homes the bats to raise the pups
one of my favorite word's as a
conservationist is symbiosis humans and
plants and animals can live together
with mutual benefit when bats got on my
radar or my sonar my echolocation I got
really excited because you know what
where my mom lives in Long Island
there's a big mosquito problem so I'm
going to get one of these bat houses so
that they can live with us and help us
reduce our mosquitoes whoa whoa hold on
just a sec aren't that scary and
dangerous well they're not and here's
why there are hundreds of thousands of
bats already living in American bat
houses and there isn't a single record
of a bat house owner having been harmed
by a bat in fact if you treat bats with
respect
they'll keep to themselves and reward
you by eating lots of harmful insects
it's so important to get along with bats
now more than ever because they need our
help
that's were dying due to the spread of
white nose syndrome disrupting their
hibernation wind turbines causing
bleeding in their lungs and
deforestation which is destroying their
habitat you're really back to help is
out safely to raise the baby
so there's more do the things we rented
our bat B&amp;amp;B because we had a bit of a
bug problem but honestly it was a little
more than that our children became
scared of bat watching them on cartoons
they just get a really bad reputation we
wanted to teach them the best or an
important part of the ecosystem to help
control the bugs and they're really good
for our yard all of our product
specifications are based on decades of
scientific research into the most
successful bat houses as well as on
cutting-edge input from researchers and
fields hi I'm Merlin zone I've studied
Vance for more
fifty years and I've been involved in
development of the Batman V product line
