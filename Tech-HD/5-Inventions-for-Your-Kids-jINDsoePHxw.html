grab and go booster seat this is a
regular car booster seat and this is my
fold my fold is the most advanced
compact and portable booster seat in the
world it's more than ten times smaller
than a regular booster and it's just as
safe how's that possible well a regular
booster seat lifts a child to be in the
position of an adult my fold does the
exact opposite instead of lifting the
child up it holds the seat belt down
it's that simple my fold is engineered
to protect children from the age of four
all the way up to twelve the patented
design takes the seatbelt off the
stomach and the neck making it
comfortable safe and easy to use
car loads of kids and parents already
tried and they love it when it comes to
car seats for children safety is the
number one priority it's crucial for us
to meet the highest regulatory standards
and we've crash tested prototypes
successfully in testing facilities all
around the world now people often ask me
John where did the idea come from so let
me tell you some stories about when my
four kids were little guys come on when
you were little thank you carpooling was
a big part of our lives we always had
boosters for our own kids but not for
the extras that came along my fold is so
small that kids can keep one with them
all the time when my parents visiting we
always had to juggle bulky booster seats
from car to car my fold is so compact
you can store one almost anywhere and my
fold is narrow so you can easily put
three in a row even in the smallest cars
do you live in a big city how often do
you jump in a taxi they never have a
booster seat and that's not safe and hey
by the way that is not a taxi thank you
last time you rented a car you probably
paid an additional $40 to rent the
booster that's more than my fault cost
and ours isn't covered in another kids
dinner or worse my fault easy to keep
clean you can even put it in the
dishwasher so I thought if I could make
a booster that's mighty small and mighty
strong when you could take with you
everywhere then children could always be
safe no matter whose car they're in
using super tough plastic polymers an
aircraft grade aluminium top designers
engineers and industry experts together
we've created my fold the most advanced
compact and portable safety seats ever
invented and we can't wait to start
getting my fold into the hands and the
bags of children all over the world
pre-order your my fold now at my fold
calm soon we'll all be ready to grab and
go thank you
you
kids these days are always out and about
and we as parents need a reliable way to
make sure our kids are safe at all times

big solutions in one small device
the most important thing to parents is
their children's health and today we
have so much access to information
parents can track their children's
health and lost different ways from lots
errant devices but the question is how
do you really hone in on what's most
important beaver smart is a real-time
smart thermometer that allows parents to
track their children's temperature using
their smartphone our team ascends a lot
of research and studied what's currently
available on the market and there's
number of key problems with the current
solution conventional thermometers can
be difficult to use uncomfortable for
children and most concerning they only
provide a one time temperature reading
there have been so many technological
advancements but thermometer technology
hasn't changed hundreds of years which
is crazy considering that it's the most
basic indicator of health we identified
this huge problem and knew that there
had to be a better solution so we
created fever smart fever smart has some
amazing features it's wireless
continuous cloud connected and most
importantly notifies parents through our
alert system fever smart is a preventive
solution it allows you to be proactive
and track your child's temperature as it
starts to rise so you can intervene
before there's a serious health problem
throughout the development process we
had children help us design the device
whenever we had a new generation of the
prototype developed we would send it out
to actual parents to see how feasible it
was in the real world when we came away
from our drawings with fever smart we
knew that it had to be non-invasive very
accurate and provide immediate real-time
data to the parents to provide them
peace of mind and to give them the
comfort that they needed here's how it
works
the fever smart system has three
components the reusable device the
disposable patch and the relay you the
parent applies the device to the child's
underarm using a disposable patch next
the temperature data is transmitted via
bluetooth to the relay unit the relay
unit then forwards the data onto the
cloud now your child's temperature can
be accessed from anywhere around the
world using your smart device fever
smart is really great because it's so
easy to use right as you take it out of
the box it's ready to go
you just pop in the battery and connect
it to your smartphone not only can you
constantly monitor your children's
temperature
we can also track trends over time as
you track the data with fever smart you
can send the information directly to
your pediatrician which means that they
could help you create better
personalized health care solutions for
your children a device is finalized and
ready to go after two years of hard work
of all the necessary safety
certifications and we have a beautiful
user interface on our app with your help
we can fund the first round of
manufacturing and bring the first
products to market by the end of 2014 so
join us join us join us join us and help
fever smart bring peace of mind to
millions of parents around the world
