this is the Merc ooh em to hive the
ultimate Wi-Fi system see these cute
little guys they're called bees plug
them in and they form a powerful mesh
network
you guys have signal over there yeah
cool we set out to build a Wi-Fi system
for the connected home
because if it isn't already your house
is about to be full of things that use
the Internet speakers thermostats lamps
cameras assistants they spin so you can
see why the m2 supports up to 60 devices
and gives you a high bandwidth
connection anywhere in your home but
your home has walls and that's where
Wi-Fi hits the wall not the m2 its
signal is so strong that it bounces off
of walls and can even go through them
together with the bees this forms a
strong mesh network so you get coverage
and all those hard-to-reach places in
your house the bees are flexible and you
can easily rearrange them for even
stronger signal in areas you need it the
m2 is also fast
oh yeah it's 20% faster than the next
best router out there around double the
speed of the industry average it can
even handle multiple streams of 8k video
that's twice the resolution you have now
actually it's four times more seriously
whoa
our easy-to-use mobile app puts you in
control of the entire network so you can
manage users and get a full view of the
speeds across the system to avoid
bottlenecks like if someone leaves the
TV streaming you're always doing that
Soho builds this thing Burcu based
outside Toronto Canada our technology
has been used by some of the world's
largest telecom and internet companies
but this new generation is even more
powerful if you guys on your team we've
got a world-class team one of our lead
engineers created the technology behind
all modern smartphone antennas another
developed signal technology for
satellites collectively our team has
over 500 patents and has won numerous
design and engineer
boards together we're committed to
building the very best Wi-Fi hardware to
power the future of connected technology
and we want you to join us in building
that future us definitely back us and
get an end to fast future proof Wi-Fi
from Mirko
hi my name is Daniel and I'm the father
of thunder blame
I built countless prototypes to get
where we are today back when I was a
teenager I used to skate everywhere in
the city and wanted to go fast now a
user a given but I wanted more speed to
go anywhere I wanted that was when I
first thought about water I'd inline
skates but at that time the technology
didn't exist yet
a few years ago I searched for electric
skates but no one had made them yet so I
decided to build them myself
Thunder blade is a frame system it's
compatible with ufs and 165 millimeter
mounts Thunder blade has swappable
battery but if you want to just skate
like you would on normal inline skates
our partner - come on fibers builds our
carbon frames with state-of-the-art
construction technology our electronics
it's also our partner so we will have
high quality electronics part on a blade
how do you have come a long way to
develop our prototypes we need your help
to kick-start our production and bring
Thunder blade to reality
please make us to make this dream come
true and join us for the ride and let's
storm the streets
and John Glenn launched into space
millions of people like watching it had
to be on this timeline backup clock is
started that to me is a really beautiful
moment if you mark something maybe it
gives it a little bit more permanence as
opposed to just letting it whiz by can
you make timekeeping devices that alter
your relationship to time
one two three hi hi I'm Taylor I'm
sailing
we're CWM tea and this is time since
lunch
it's a single-use long scale launch
clock pull the pin and it starts
counting up for two thousand seven
hundred and thirty-eight years that's a
long time really long time
yeah yeah and this is a this is but
people can use this for all different
types of things some might launch it on
their wedding day some might launch it
when a baby's born other people might
for example stop eating meat or honking
oh yeah I don't know if you have one uh
start a road trip or move into a new
apartment a new house or you could just
pick a regular Wednesday morning which
is kind of our favorite scenario of how
this works
yeah just nobody's to do it is if you
just randomly pick a moment you're like
ah today seems like a good day and then
you just pull the pan and by doing that
you make that moment yours nobody else's
that now belongs to you and you have a
little marker that's gonna tell you
exactly how many days hours minutes and
seconds it's been that special moment
where nothing else was happening
it wasn't someone's wedding nobody was
being born well someone was firing
points somewhere like but in your world
it's just special T because you pulled
the pin
yeah but of course you can pull the pin
at any any special moment also which is
pretty cool too okay this is very dream
project
you can tell we live look-ins project so
much mostly because it started as a
conceptual art project like this you
know I've made lots of timekeeping
devices this is one of many conceptual
timekeeping devices I've made but this
is the only one that's ever made it to
this level like we are ready to
manufacture this in the hundreds in the
thousands or ten thousands how are you
we've worked very hard to make this
produced manufacturable product and in
in that sense it's a dream project of
ours you know it's easy to make one one
offs of any kind of conceptual timepiece
but this is like we we actually see this
being in lots of people's lives
and lasting for an extremely long time
which you can read all about that stuff
is yeah yes if you get it awesome please
help us make it yeah you know it it's
we've been working on this for a really
long time since 2015 making all kinds of
prototypes first thinking about it just
as a conceptual piece but now it's like
now it's real yeah and part of the
inspiration for this too is I don't know
we're used to having things like watches
and clocks and calendars on a daily
basis to interface with time but this is
something that integrates with your
everyday life but it's an everyday
reminder of a scale of time that's
completely outside of your normal
ability to perceive time or did you
think about the world and and it works
yeah which is it you could even I just
think it uses on its own to use it to
mark like a news event to like there's
something special that happened that you
read in the news and your lack I gotta
remember this moment
and so then you pull the pin here I'll
just pull one and then and then you know
you have this sitting on yourself and
then
for the rest of your life you have a
little thing that'll tell you exactly
how many days hours minutes and seconds
it's been since that news event that was
so life-changing to you yeah you
finished the book you like the last
sentence and your luck ah yeah in any
case we love this project we hope you
love it too please please help us make
this thing real that's it yeah yeah
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
