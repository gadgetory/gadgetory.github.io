medium-duty stair climber and can move
almost anything however let's say you
primarily install bottom heavy loads
like boilers for geothermal units the
power mate le one is designed
specifically to address these types of
challenging loads the challenge with
bottom heavy loads is achieving the
right balance with the le one the load
center of gravity can be placed close to
the pivot point making the job of stair
climbing easier the additional drive
screw on the le one controls the toe
plate allowing the operator to position
the load anywhere along the frame this
small boiler is now perfectly balanced
the le one is also the only stair
climber that can dynamically adjust the
load while climbing stairs the le one is
the most advanced powered hand truck on
the market and also the most versatile
the le one comes standard with two strap
bars and hand operated wheel brakes both
the l1 and le one have a narrow profile
which is ideal for residential
installations if you're concerned of
both safety if you're interested in
labor-saving if you're looking for a way
to generate more income for your
business then you need the power mate

hi my name is Troy Lowe I'm here to talk
to you about an innovative new security
product that I have developed to secure
vertical doors in an emergency situation
like all Americans it saddens me each
time we hear reports of or need to
respond to another active shooter
situation as a SWAT team medic I've been
working to prevent these tragedies in my
community through active shooter
response training programs over the past
few years
I've instructed thousands of people on
how to react during this type of
emergency lockdown situation I've seen
firsthand how quickly they panic and
lose their fine motor skills during
these simple training exercises this
typical reaction made me realize that
there was a need for a security product
that is simply used strong and highly
effective in the event of an actual
emergency or lockdown situation the
products that you are seen can be easily
installed to secure a classroom or
virtually any commercial door in an
emergency situation as shown the
baracuda intruder defense system it's
available for both outward and inward
swinging doors it can be deployed in a
matter of seconds these products are
being utilized in our current active
shooter response training programs and
the positive reaction has been
overwhelming
remove device from holder lay device on
floor behind closed door and slide
plates under door push handles outward
to engage plates on exterior door jamb
locate hole in bar by sliding the bar as
required
you can insert the pin to secure the
device remove device from holder
position hook over door handle so that
it is facing downward as shown position
bar so that foot pads rest against the
face of the door jamb spin handle until
device is tight against the door handle
to secure the door door closers are
available in different sizes when your
device arrives adjust the bolt location
to ensure a snug fit on your door closer
to install simply slide the device over
the door closer to secure the door
I'm proud to say these products are
american-made that is my personal goal
to protect everyone across the country
from these senseless tragedies
