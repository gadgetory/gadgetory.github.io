with an active lifestyle those who carry
a backpack those who ride subway those
who ride their bike commuting to work
those who are adventurous growing up in
Colorado I found a real passion for the
natural world I want to live healthy I
want to eat healthy I want to have that
food with me all the time we've made a
reusable container that you can take
everywhere with you it's super
convenient it's wonderful to have and
it's worth its weight when you carry
around the majority of trash that I
create is from food waste wax cardboard
styrofoam plastic things that get thrown
away it's all packaging I want to do
everything I can to prevent the natural
world from being stuffed with trash what
does it mean to live in a world where
we're conscious about the way we create
waste there are ways to reduce it we
developed a product that doesn't break
easily is dishwasher safe and food safe
is approved by all the science
foundations for food and it can clip
easily to your backpack so it makes it
highly portable it holds 33 ounces
that's a big enough meal for any size
and shape I look forward to how
convenient it can be to have home-cooked
food anywhere
I tried at first carrying food in for
instance Tupperware I constantly look
around for a container that won't leak
and none of them fit that bill they
always have some amount of liquid coming
out of them the green traveler allows
you to carry delicious healthy food with
you
you can pack any food you want or
non-food items it won't leak it will
keep water out and you have four
compartments to choose from you get to
experience home-cooked food from
anywhere anyone who packs lunch for the
day needs a way to do that without
creating waste the green traveller is
food safe dishwasher safe liquid tight
and you can clip it to your backpack we
see this as the most convenient way to
carry food with you students can take it
to college
adults can take it to work it can be
used for food it can be used for other
items as well first aid supplies mothers
can pack all the things their baby might
need go to a food truck or hot bar
without generating any more wasteful
packaging we're providing a solution for
healthy and sustainable lifestyles we
are a team of engineers and MBAs we have
experience taking businesses out into
production so we're confident if you
fund this that we can watch it we can
help change the culture in the way we
consume food we want you to have a
healthy waste free meal anywhere you are
help us raise the capital for injection
molding so we can get the green Traveler
out to everyone join our campaign to
show how much you care about having a
convenient reduced waste lifestyle
you
introducing flow bro once the first
universal portable water filter for
travelers with flow bruh one you can
turn any freshwater source into safe
drinking water wherever your journey
takes you the game is not over when you
run out of water no matter if you are
indoors or outdoors flow bro one be
covered connect it to the add-on hose to
filter water from the tap
simply attach an empty plastic bottle
and let the filter do the rest thanks to
the universal screw thread you can also
attach it to any shower hose in the
world stop being dependent on bottled
water from the store and easily prepare
safe drinking water for your friends
want to take flow bro one outdoors no
problem the lightweight and compact size

water from a river or lake in an empty
plastic bottle and screw it on to flow
bro 1 attach a clean bottle to the
outlet and squeeze to collect purified
water no need for specialized parts or
expert skills that is the spirit of flow
bruh 1 and easy to use universal water
filter for travelers I traveled a lot in
countries where that water is not safe
to drink because I had no alternative I
had to buy bottled water this is not
only expensive but it's also polluting
the environment with flow bro 1 you can
filter your own water save money and
prevent plastic bottle pollution as a
membrane engineer with experience in
water filtration I was surprised by the
fact that there isn't an easy to use
portable and durable water tools
available on the market during my
journey in Southeast Asia I was struck
by the amount of plastic bottles
polluting the environment that motivated
me to come up with a solution the unique
membrane testing and flushing technology
makes expensive replaceable cartridges a
thing of the past and brings reusability
to the present with the core of flow
bruh 1 you can filter any water from
outdoors indoors and effectively filter
viruses bacteria and
additionally you can use the add-on
carbon and zeolite capsule to reduce
heavy metals and chemicals after one
year of lab and field testings
we are ready to bring floberg onto the
market support us on Kickstarter and
help us make traveling more sustainable
meet this guy and this guy him too now
this is the other shape another and
another
we made a travel pillow that fits every
sleeping position we wanted something
new something different
cozy hugging and comforting your actual
travel pillow
it hasn't changed shape in years
this this is better it no longer makes
you sleep in weird positions
it fits you right in as massage
therapist fitness trainers and designers
we came up with the solution tested a
zillion times on the pickiest candidate
whether it's on a plane in the train on
the road at the office or between
activities
this design kicks ass
the material holds it tight everything
is just cool perfecting a sleeping tool
ain't easy but nothing special is easy

pillow on your next travel bring us with
