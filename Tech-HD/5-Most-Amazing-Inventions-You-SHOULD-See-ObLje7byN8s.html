thirsty
think twice before you reach for that
single-use bottle that's a lot of
plastic you're using how about a more
sustainable choice hmm doesn't exactly
smell of Meadows right how long is it
since you washed that bottle these are
the germs in your unwashed bottle
bacteria can double every 20 minutes
leaving it dirtier than your dog ball or
your Lucy perhaps you'd like to wash
that bottle before you use it there you
go
just get right on in there how's that
handy ogre working out go on go ahead
give it a sniff so you want clean
perfectly fresh tasting water how about
a bottle that cleans itself we've
created the quartz bottle the world's
first self-cleaning bottle with
on-the-go water purification all its
uses UV light to break up the DNA of
harmful odor causing bacteria hospitals
have been using the same UV light to
quickly and safely sterilize operating
rooms for the past decade we've scaled
this LED technology to fit inside this
cap imagine a picture of questionable
water quartz begins working at the touch
of a button and in 60 seconds we've got
pristine drinking water quartz works
automatically in the background six
times a day to keep your bottle and
water crystal clean and quartz is 100%
BPA free stainless steel it's vacuum
sealed and double insulated so it stays
cold for 24 hours and hot for 12 hours
and never breaks a sweat
ah there's no hydro challenge quartz
can't handle whether you're bopping
around town
training for your next triathlon or on
an expedition to the summit quartz is
always working hard so you don't have to
keeping your water fresh and your bottle
clean and stink free so help make the
perfect water bottle a reality and never
ever worry about that stinky bottle
again
it's Thursday tradition here at home
biogas that means banana pancakes
a 2015 we launched the first IndieGoGo
campaign showing the world how to turn
this into this an idea of a backyard
appliance returns organic food scraps
into cooking gas is first of its kind we
were so excited to see all these people
from all over the world enjoying the
system the first campaign enabled us to
get home bogus to the heart of remote
communities in need people who have been
cooking over fire would suddenly had
clean free energy it was a huge step in
fulfilling our vision the amazing
support inspired us to think forward
what if we could take the humble gas
appliance make it even better and reduce
its overall cost it took us over a year
home bogus 2.0 is an advanced appliance
that produces green renewable energy
installation is now simpler just for the
digester with water
mount the gas container using the
supplied sandbags and you're ready to go
the 2.0 version is 50 percent more
productive easier to maintain and super
durable we've also added a home ba gas
stove to give you the perfect solution
an average family produces about two
liters of waste a day
why should organic waste go into giant
polluting landfills when it can go back
into nature home biogas 2.0 can now
produce up to three hours of cooking gas
per day more than enough for an average
family plus a top quality completely
organic fertilizer that goes back into
the soil your own backyard eco cycle
once food waste goes in the bacteria
digests the organic material and
released bogus and fertilizer no
electricity is required it is completely
safe to use order lists and can digest
anything from fruits and veggies to meat
and dairy home bar gas 2.0 is now ready
for mass production we need your help to
start the manufacturing process if you
believe in our cause we invite you to
back our campaign and share it with your
friends and family thank you
more and more people are beginning to
reduce reuse and recycle as a way of
life Nature has given us so much now
it's time to give back

Oh
de lui stands through the highways
through my shadow through the sun rays
and
the way melodies we haven't played know
go in around these walls to create a
song
go through the wastelands through the
highways through my shadow through the
sunrays
we'll go
since we started rano six years ago
we've been dreaming of creating films on
our iPhones so we started developing row
of two years ago and it almost broke us
the first version was noisy flimsy and
vibrated like mad which he doesn't make
for good I phone footage so we scrapped
it and started over again turns out that
creating an integrated piece of hardware
and software is extremely expensive so
we almost went bankrupt twice but we
found a way through the late nights
early mornings tension-filled buildups
profanely filled meetings we were
thinking of you
you see we care deeply about empowering
the average Joe that tell their story in
a compelling way with beautiful movement
there's something about it when you
watch it it's hard to describe but it
moves you so whether your own an iPhone
or DSLR we want you to have the tools to
tell your story if you're a YouTube
content creator and Instagram adventurer
or you just want to step up your game
with cinematic motion we may drove for
you
we found our story it's time to go find
yours
you
for many space is out of premium English
studios and shops higher performing CNC
machines are generally limited to larger
form factors
although smaller machines exist they
lack the power and position that many
individuals need
introducing the router kit m-series the
new router kitang series has all the
perks of larger CNC machine in a
fraction of the size it stands a little
under two feet in height and is an easy
fit for smaller workstations
although the router kit M is the
smallest CNC machine in our collection
it offers the same lovely performances
or other modes we've worked hard to make
sure that the M series does not
compromise power for Sons the M series
is able to house heavy-duty spindles up
to three kilowatts in power in order to
accommodate this the entire framework
that your machine is constructed out of
high-strength aluminum metal this keeps
the machine relatively light and
transport while maintaining high
rigidity as the machine is being use
making movements extremely precise and
accurate using industrial grade ball
screws on all three Axel's in
conjunction with an optional production
drive the router kit M can deliver
ultrafine incremental movements as small
as one one hundred thousandths of an
inch that is over three hundred and
fifty times thinner than a human hair
this makes it great for adding fine
detail to jewelry or etching on circuit
boards the radicand M series comes in
two models the ya and the Emperor Liam
Pro offers a greater cutting area and an
optional rotary offices in making 3d
products
now whether you're new to CNC machines
or your young one we are confident that
our new router two time series will help
take your projects to the next level</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
