ingredients techniques and tastes and
for every batch the skill is added new
elements recognized reacted on and not
necessarily improved but understood we
wanted to understand the process in
detail that's why we develop Plato Plato
is a reinvented airline it's a tool for
beer brewers the tool that continuously
monitors the ongoing fermentation
process
it measures the beers gravity and
temperature gives you a unique insight
in the fermentation activities at any
given point and calculates the alcohol
content without touching the beer -
whatsoever knowing the amount of co2
generated during the fermentation allows
us to calculate these key parameters
Plato is designed to optically measure
the co2 flow through the glass clears
frightened airlock making a truly
non-invasive data is gathered calculated
and sent to the online clouds using
Wi-Fi Plato gives you more than just
instant and historical data it analyzes
the ongoing fermentation and generates a
report unique for every single batch
share discuss and analyze the data to
increase the understanding of how
temperature changes massing techniques
or strains of leaf effects the
fermentation contagious Plato doesn't
make clear for you left you understand
you
your scope is a smart solution that
provides accurate diagnosis of ear
problems this lightweight device is the
ultimate diagnostic companion it is the
first low-cost user-friendly device
that's compatible with a smartphone its
innovative camera and optics have been
designed to allow the highest quality
video and image footage of the eardrums
ear scope is fitted with an adjustable
LED light and a 200 times variable focal
distance so automated diagnosis system
uses artificial intelligence and machine
learning to diagnose images of the
eardrum acts taken by the year scope
once an image is captured it gets
uploaded to our servers the diagnosis
has been sent back to the mobile
application the artificial intelligence
can diagnose a number of metal ear
infections based on learning abilities
once trained it is able to diagnose
youths in panic membrane images
introducing the Roby the ruler that
allows to measure both straight line and
curves by simply rolling for point to
point measure any line any curve made
out of stainless steel that is designed
in four versions for measuring and
centimeters or inches the row before
inch and the Robie ten centimeters are
keychain science rules that come with
genuine leather pouches in black or
brown this is the most compact group
it's no larger than a coin it always
fits in your pocket no matter where you
go the larger versions such as the row
v8 engine 20 centimeters still are very
portable and would be handy at any time
now we need to measure things all the
tongue with the Robie you can measure
any object with a square or round along
any line or curve measuring if you
simply place the ruler on any surface or
line roll and count full rotations then
add remaining units and you don't have
your measure drafting layouts and
templates measuring curves and specific
design details is highly necessary for
professionals like tailors architects
designers carpenters and many others the
Robie allows you to do it in a
convenient way
designed for everyone whether you're a
professional or just find this idea of a
compact ruler as awesome as we do the
rope thanks for watching
this is the trade scx for tom aha
a versatile instrument useful in a range
of applications including rescue
survival tactical and everyday outdoor
adventures the SC axe for tomahawk
delivers chopping cutting and
penetration power in a lightweight
package the SC axe for Zach's head is

I love doing pull-ups and yet I had
nowhere to pull apart after I was
finished sometimes I try and just shove
it under the bed or I leave it on the
bedroom floor or on the apartment floor
somewhere just look terrible and took up
a lot of space
ask any personal trainer and they'll
tell you how important Colts are to a
good fitness routine and yet the
equipment you used to do pull-ups at
home hasn't been improved in years hi my
name is Derrick what I really wanted was
a full bar that's easy to store that's a
piece of cake sit sit up and one that I
can carry with me when I go traveling so
that I don't have to break my routine
and start all over every time much of a
trip nothing like it existed so I
decided to create it I'm thrilled to
introduce you to flexor the world's
first foldable pull apart to use the
flexor just hook the top into the
doorway and you're ready for your
workout the bar folds and unfolds in
under three seconds and takes up less
than one-fourth the face of a
traditional pull-up bar you can easily
tuck it away in any extra space you have
in a drawer or a closet
the frame is made from high-grade
durable yet lightweight metals and the
door support is made from quality
injection molded plastic the flexor is
designed to hold up to 250 pound it
folds to under 2 feet by 1 foot by 6
inches and weighs less than 6 pounds the
flexor requires no assembly at all just
pull it out of the box unfold it in
under three seconds and you're ready to
go you can use the flexor to do pull-ups
chin up bit up dip legless and whole
range of other exercises it's a
full-body gym all by itself to create
the flexor we brought together
world-class teams including one of
London's top design firms and one of
China's top engineering teams we spent
over a year designing prototyping and
redesigning the product
we've been through many prototypes and
run many tests to ensure the quality of
our product we finally have a prototype
that were really happy with and we have
a manufacturing partner we trust to
deliver a great product on a fast
timeline this is where you come in
Kickstarter we need to raise the funds
to get Flexer into production
so we can immediately start shipping it
to your door so I hope you'll choose to
back this campaign and be one of the
first people to receive the world's
first foldable easy to store easy to use
easy to travel with Pula fire
yeah
Oh
you
new technology is making life easier in
many ways but it hasn't really been
applied to outdoor and camping equipment
until now this is the world's first
outdoor smart lantern for both - tech
first I hope you agree that it looks
great your granddad may have taken you
camping but your equipment doesn't have
to look like it the lantern can be
adjusted here but it can also be
controlled by a Bluetooth app on your
phone at the end of a long day outdoors
you don't have to keep getting up and
down to adjust the lanterns brightness
you can do so from wherever you're
seated you can adjust it to a range of
16 million colors to suit your mood or
later you can even turn it off remotely
without getting out of your tent or
sleeping bag that's great when the
weather is freezing or you have
something else to do have you ever been
hiking and had trouble finding your tent
now it's easy just set your life to
flash but at otech we have gone much
further the lantern comes with built-in
weather sensors temperature humidity
barometric pressure it will even give
you weather alerts our smart lantern
comes in two sizes the 200 lumen and a
powerful 400 lumen that illuminates to a
range of nearly ten paces at full power
it will last eight nights at low power
30 nights the lantern is strong durable
and lightweight it is water resistant so
no worries would spray on a boat with
full batteries even the 400 L is just
over three pounds or 1.6 kilograms it
also has a built in tripod for uneven
surfaces and the handle it won't break
it uses rechargeable batteries or board
d-cell batteries you can even use it to
charge your mobile phone or other
devices because it has a built-in USB
port Oh - tech is developing a number of
other smart camping devices here is our
CEO who can tell you more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
