keep the cooking surface five times
faster than a traditional charcoal grill
it's super easy to use leaving you more
time to enjoy the day fuel free rather
than fiddle with a fire since sole
source port has no flame and is cool to
the touch you can also use it in places
like beaches national parks and
apartment buildings where fire cooking
isn't allowed treat yourself to fresh
outdoor cooking free of toxic smoke you
can grill with soul source in the
morning midday late afternoon when it's
cold when it's windy at the beach even
under passing clouds as long as the Sun
is still smiling down on you the solar
reflectors are engineered with the ideal
curvature for capturing the sun's rays
providing the equipment of about 600
watts of we're all cooking powers you
can cook from approximately one hour
after sunrise to one hour before sunset
on a bright beautiful sunny day for
example within five minutes the grill
will be at grilling temperatures within
10 it'll be hot enough to sear within 10
minutes charcoal is well it's getting
there even though it's reflecting all
that energy the surface is cool to the
touch as the heat of focus directly onto
the cooking surface and only the cooking
surface aligning the grill with the Sun
only requires you to look into the
blackout mirror and aim the beam right
at your pan the v-shaped cut out puts
you in the captain's chair of the soul
source port because you deserve this
girl to work for you how are we looking
there
okay the grilling platform is a
versatile pot stand that allows you to
use the cookware you already own you can
grill pan fry saute beans boil deep fry
pressure cook and slow cook we have
taken our original model and redesigned
it with the on-the-go griller in mind
the new sport assembles in less than
three minutes and packs down to a
lightweight two feet carrying case
giving you the freedom to cook anywhere
and remember no flame means no smoke
clean air cooking bright months are
ahead so get outside and get grilling
whether it be your first grill a girl

grill for the end of the world or you're
just looking for an upgrade the sole
source port makes you the star of any
cookout so head over to our crowdfunding
page to take advantage of our early bird
special pricing grill with soul source
port
they say when you gain something you
lose something your headphones give you
a great immersive audio experience but
they also make you lose awareness of
your surroundings and I notice people
listening to headphones being oblivious
to the outside world I thought there's
got to be a device that can fix this
problem and that's how I thought of the
concept for sound break introducing some
breaks 2.0 the world's first device that
lets you be isolated and immersed in
your headphone audio yet still be able
to clearly hear important outside sounds
sound brake fits between your headphones
and your audio player sound rate adjusts
to the sound level in your environment
after you press a button the button
illuminates while sound brake is taking
samples of your outside sound level when
the light turns off some brake has
created an alert level that is custom
for your surrounding from now on when
outside sound is louder than the alert
level you'll hear it instantly streamed
into your headphones there is no impact
to your audio quality you can also
select from five different sensitivity
levels so you can choose to be alerted
by song sounds or louder sound you can
also use it with Bluetooth headphones
using an extra Bluetooth accessory some
breaks 2.0 is the result of over two
years of research and development design
and iterations what did sound breaks
have a simple design to be as easy to
use as possible version 2.0 has new
features that make it even easier to use
than before with just three buttons when
you go to a new environment or the sound
level changes just press a sample button
again to have it adjust you can change
the microphone volume by holding the
sample button you'll hear only outside
sound as it blinks and then you use the
up or down button to change the volume
press it again to return to normal
sound break is rechargeable with a
simple micro USB connection Arrow
Electronics has reviewed the sound break
2.0 design and certified our campaign in
their partnership with IndieGoGo by
laughing our campaign you'll receive the
world's first headphone device that
selectively streams and outside sound
and you'll also help us to bring sound
brakes and mass production let's put an
end to headphone users being oblivious
to their surroundings thank you so much
for your support
honestly I've been looking for something
like this my entire life this thing is
insane I didn't even know was motorized
but you look at it it's different game
and I mean the board had a lot of great
technology but I've got to say to the
new designers face it's kind of like the
new Apple style of design right clean
seamless this thing's got juice I was
flying around I think design very sleek
it's very cool overall I think it's the
best product on the market
forget the familiar introducing the
first intelligent electric board that is
exceptional in every way it is better on
every level not just thinner or lighter
the board's artificial intelligence
allows it to collect data about the way
you write evaluate it and then create
unique settings to adapt to your style
it then uses the data to improve its
performance and efficiency riding the
board is easy and intuitive no previous
experience is necessary because the
board will teach you how to write it
it's both powerful and safe the board
can recognize whether I'm standing on it
or not so it won't move by itself
the Xtend board is light and comfortable
to carry its special anti slip surface
makes it safe for clothes too during the
night it lights up automatically range
can be extended with a swappable battery
pack the in wheel motor recharges the
battery while riding downhill or braking
everything is designed perfectly to the
last detail and every detail has its
purpose every extend board is made out
of 200 high quality engineered parts
that we have designed from scratch we
have already secured all the major
investments that have brought us to the
final product we have it's a small
operation that brought this board to
life just a group of people with big
dreams and passion for design and
technology the board is handcrafted
perfection made out of carbon fiber
titanium and space grade materials we
have already made dozens of prototype
iterations to test our manufacturers now
we are ready to craft one for you as
well now you have the opportunity to get
a special Kickstarter edition and help
us bring this unique board to the market
you
Jubba light is an amazing dance party
light that your kids built wire and
decorate themselves while they're
assembling the housing connecting the
electronics and decorating with stickers
markers and sequins they might not even
be aware of all they're learning and
that's okay by us I'm a professor of
mechanical engineering at MIT and I
teach people how to make things I'm also
a mom and I realize how valuable it is
to give kids especially girls experience
making games that also help them learn
about technology we've tested rubelite
with over 300 kids by combining a craft
kit girls already love with an
electronics kit they might never try
when you found we capture their
attention and their imagination this is
a proven way for getting kids to learn
it takes around 30 minutes to assemble
juba light and with a lamp first lights
up kids eyes light up - then they'll
spend hours decorating to make it their
own when it's all done they'll have a
beautiful and personalized product that
they'll be able to use and show off for
years girls are telling us jubilant has
made them feel confident like they can
make anything parents being with pride
when they hear this and are thrilled to
have found an activity that they can
build with their girls we created UV
light to spark kids interest in stem
science technology engineering math
through creative play we want to impact
as many kids as possible not just the
ones who are already tech-savvy our
dream is that jubilife and our future
family of educational toys will reach
millions of kids and ignite that passion
for discovering how things work and
inventing new ways of improving the
world now we need your support to help
get jubilife into production and into
the hands of kids please back up and
help spread the word</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
