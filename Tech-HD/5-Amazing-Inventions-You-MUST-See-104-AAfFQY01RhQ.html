my inspiration has been to combine the
best of our Swiss heritage in
traditional watchmaking with the key
features of a SmartWatch to persuade the
majority of consumers adopting our world
ball technology we wanted to create a
world without compromises the one that
is desirable and will be accepted and
word by majority of consumers z time
will provide a 30 days battery on a
single charge and a water resistant up
to 30 meters when we first started
working on the Z type project we knew
from day one that the most critical
challenge for us would be to offer users
the opportunity to keep track of the
daily time without necessarily having to
turn on the display and therefore have
some battery life issues this has been
accomplished with the time the perfect
hybrid SmartWatch it combined the best
of both wars stainless steel watch case
and mechanical hands of an elegant
traditional timepiece with a full-color
touchscreen that instantly shows
incoming calls smart phone notification
real-time fitness activity cunning
calendar events daily reminders and much
more right from the wrist the best way
to deliver make any cold hands
experience with a SmartWatch was
actually to use real ones but how and
how to make the background of the
traditional watch becoming smart while
drinking a hole into a TFT display was
the only solution we spent countless
hours with our engineering team an
industrial partner finding the right
solution to create a brand-new
touchscreen that could accept a pass
through mechanical health solution and
we finally did it over hundreds of
prototypes and design proposal by
combining a revolutionary TFT color
display together with ultra precise
touch panel and a high-grade quality
glass we succeed to deliver the best of
both worlds an amazing SmartWatch that
can offer both doctrine experience
together with the traditional timepiece
but we didn't stop here
with our ha noise we can tweak the
lowest level features to improve power
consumption in addition geez who has
comes with lot of Princeton applications
and a white sari looks nice which faces
while using a traditional quartz
movement when we live into a brand new
smart work we work on gently with
several partners to create what we call
the smart movement built around two
micro motors this movement is capable of
not only providing accurate time but it
can more importantly be controlled by
the watch CPU to automatically adjust
time depending on times on where you are
and also move the ends where we need
them to be on a particular screen as a
result know if you're having hands
covering the text on your emails or
messages we can position them the way we
want to deliver the best reading
experience and they will go back to
their original position automatically
having orhan OS help us to customize our
UX and the diverse with highest level of
compatibility for iOS and Android users
the time is also embedding some of the
most advanced technologies like a suis
le D heart rate monitoring solution
delivering precise and accurate measures
of your cardiac frequency throughout the
day or at a particular point in time
when you need it we also decided to be
played the traditional crown is a very
advanced smart crown helping user to
hand hence there are navigation
experience inside of Polish and nicely
design user interface the experience
will be improved and enhanced week after
week with regular of those year update
offering new watch faces new
applications and personal new features
Zita is with no doubts an amazing
timepiece that will for sure reset the
future of the SmartWatch industry when I
started in early 2013 people throw that
a West map why would I start a
SmartWatch company in Switzerland in
such a challenging market
he turns out and my vision and passion
have paid off has our company has sold
nearly two million smartwatches system
we have established strong foundations
in Europe and now we are willing to
expand worldwide today we want consumer
to embrace that were amazing joining
with the time and be the first ones to
get the hands on this groundbreaking
innovation as we are heading soon to
mass production
micronized

it is incredible how much we rely on
weather forecasts and so-called local
temperatures the truth is that those
values available online or through apps
come from weather stations that can
easily be dozens of miles away
nothing beats measuring the values by
yourself right where you are but that's
just not possible and silly so we have
created the world's smallest a weather
station that can easily fit in your palm
simply plug weather point into your
device and start the app simple as that
it consists of four sensors for
temperature humidity atmospheric
pressure and ultraviolet radiation with
this information you can have the most
accurate weather forecast anywhere you
are also by measuring atmospheric
pressure you can know your altitude more
precisely than GPS devices you can also
measure UV radiation and limit your
exposure to these harmful UV rays the
housing is made from aluminium and
titanium and ensures longer life time
when you're not using weather point it
is safely placed on your keychain so you
don't have to worry about losing it
weather point doesn't use a battery well
who likes them anyway it doesn't even
require internet connection the building
hardware is costly we invested a lot of
resources into making weather point
possible and now we need your support to
make it available and affordable for
everyone thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
