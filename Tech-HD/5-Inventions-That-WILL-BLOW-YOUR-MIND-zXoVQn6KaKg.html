flexed the team behind the edge we have
been immersed in the swimming world for
as long as you can remember and credit
the sport for playing a huge role in who
we are today
for the past two years we have dedicated
all of our time to developing a swimming
tracker that would change the way we
train something that would help us take
our performance to the next level shared
passion for the sport has brought us
together and now that passion has
allowed us to build an incredible team
of people committed to achieving the
same goal from a stellar team of
engineers it's an incredible community
of coaches and swimmers our team
understands your needs the journey
started with the idea of seeing how
technology could be implemented into
swimming we noticed there was a lack of
training tools in swimming compared to
other sports like running and cycling so
we asked ourselves how can we use
technology to benefit swimming we spent
thousands of hours working with hundreds
of athletes and coaches collecting data
to develop and train our machine
learning algorithms the motivation
behind the edge is to make you a faster
more educated and efficient swimmer the
edge features a combination of tools
designed to improve your training and
technique you simply thread your goggle
strap through the edge press the button
and start your workout the edge tracks
your strokes distance heart rate and
understand sets to give you a complete
overview of your training for real-time
feedback you simply press a button and
the edge lets you feel your heart rate
following your swim our cloud-based
algorithms process your work out for
review the Flex app gives you insight on
your training presents your latest
workout and enables you to monitor your
long-term progress with goals and
workout history a flex app even offers
thousands of workouts designed for all
levels the product was developed with
the help of a larger swimming community
that we have cultivated through all of
our time in the pool we worked with
coaches and swimmers from various
segments of the sport ranging everywhere
from recreational and master swimmers
all the way to multi time Ironman
triathletes and Olympians
we saw this massive network as an asset
to the company so we collected feedback
from hundreds of swimmers to create a
product that we would personally use on
an everyday basis learning the needs of
all these segments was the most
important part of the project no matter
what you're training for we're counting
on you thanks for your support
