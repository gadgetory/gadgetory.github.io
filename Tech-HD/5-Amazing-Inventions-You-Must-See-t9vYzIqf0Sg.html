magnet it makes everything so much more
fun backers get to choose from a bunch
of sweet color options
and can go with either a non-magnetic
rolling ball or select the magnetic
version and no additional cost but
honestly that's just half the story we
engineered fidget power from the ground
up to be the smartest fidgeting device
out there we turn to a gun ominous
psychologist product designers and even
shapes used in anti-anxiety exercises
for inspiration with the design and
after several months of prototyping we
have created a shape that rests
effortlessly in your hand providing a
calming feeling that reduces anxiety
while also improving your focus let's
not forget about the built in gadgets

your coordination and reaction skills

bringing this back
to say
to get us back on now where can we try
I've thrown my word
bringing this back we'll kick it up
where we left it again we never forget
cuz what we got
there's one guarantee in life it's gonna
get dark tonight and you're gonna need a
good light whether you're in the comfort
of your own home or the Sun is going
down on your campsite a useful lights a
necessity for anyone
luckily everyone here it's striker is
passionate about lights or we're scared
of the dark either way we've got an
exciting new light for you some of you
may already be familiar with the Tri
light it was a phenomenal success on
Kickstarter we really appreciate
everyone who helped back to try light
and make it a reality now we're looking
to expand the line and offer all the
technology of a tri light but in the
palm of your hand
introducing the rover the rover is
rechargeable mobile task light that is
designed to be lightweight durable
easily packed and flutter room work area
or campsite with hands-free usable light
the rover features the same cast
aluminum head of the Tri light the
aluminum makes it incredibly durable but
it's also a fully functional heat sink
unlike halogen shop lights the Rovers
always cool to the touch and cool to
look at this aluminum eye candy' pivots
nearly 180 degrees to ensure that light
can be directed exactly where you need
it one same cycle through the four modes
until you find the one that's right for
you high when you want to flood an
entire room after a power outage hazard
when you want to be seen or party SOS
when you are in serious trouble
luckily the robber is surrounded by a
tempered steel exoskeleton which has
been dropped tested a lot the steel
exoskeleton acts as a stable base or
frame to hang the light there's also a
universal tripod mount on the bottom of
the rover so users can elevate the light
if necessary the robot is powered by
dual lithium-ion rechargeable batteries
that boasts four thousand milliamp hours
ensuring plenty of power and long run
times recharge by simply inserting the
supplied USB cable into the plug in the
back if you need longer run times the
rover can be used while plugged in
finally the rumor features a very unique
variable lens when the lens is in the up
position the COV LED produces over 1200
lumens of light and spreads it nearly
180 degrees creating a massive flood of
light slide the variable lens over the
LED and this will focus the light to
about 120 degrees adding more of a
hotspot which will project the light a
little further if you desire it be a
gift-giving hero and pick up an extra
for a friend or family member
remember Father's Day is just around the
corner and dads dig light the thoughtful
and unique gift will really light up
their day like the Tri light the rover
