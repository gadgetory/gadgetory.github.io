some tools never change a hammer is a
hammer a hairbrush is a hairbrush and
for nearly 150 years a nail clipper has
always been just a nail clipper current
nail clippers require odd uncomfortable
movements of your wrist and can easily
rotate or shift unexpectedly which is an
issue when you're holding a sharp object
it also requires you to be able to have
a strong squeeze between your thumb and
your pointer finger which may not seem
like a big deal but degeneration at the
base of the thumb
is very common among people over the age
of 50 causing them to struggle with this
pinching move and when you lose strength
in that motion cutting nails as one of
the first tasks effectively as
orthopedic surgeons ourselves we've
become used to precise surgical
instruments built for ease-of-use and
accuracy we thought why can't we bring
this type of quality ease and precision
we find in the operating room to
consumers in their own homes that's why
we invented clipper Pro its unique
swivel function allows you to position
your hand wrist arm and shoulder in the
most comfortable position for you the
double action mechanism makes cutting
your nails much easier requiring very
little strength to operate and our
surgical grade stainless steel blades
cut cleanly precisely and effortlessly
we've spent the last 10 years working
diligently to take an outdated
frustrating hygiene tool and bring it
into the modern era by combining decades
of experience as orthopedic surgeons

art manufacturing and cutting-edge
design we have created a revolutionary
tool clipper Pro is so precise it could
be used in the operating room and it is
