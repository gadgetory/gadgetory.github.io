is innovation that will truly change the
way you beat the heat from the outside
it looks like a sleek user-friendly ice
chest and in fact it is but it's what's
on the inside that makes it an icy
breeze like any cooler food and
beverages stay cool in the ice but if
you add just a few quarts of water the
ice will actually transform this dual
purpose unit into a portable air
conditioner inside the chest is a pump
that circulates the ice-cold water
through a condensing unit and then blows
ice cold dry air through a vent or the
commute with Lexi heads the rechargeable
self-contained battery system will keep
you cool for up to seven hours on a low
setting the multi speed internal fan and
the flexi hose let you control the
direction and the power of your breeze
the icy breeze can produce airflow up to
25 miles an hour and 30 degrees cooler
than ambient temperatures this portable
air conditioner contains no freon so as
long as the battery is fully charged or
if you have access to 110 volts
electricity all you need is ice and a
little water
when you're finished all you do is pop
the drain plug and pour out the contents
the durable construction make this the
perfect companion for almost any setting
where you need to stay cool and
comfortable
you won't have to sweat in the heat any
longer with an icy breeze portable air
conditioner
hey I'm Jessie and this is Lloyd and
this is the power case it's an iPhone
case that unlike any other case in the
world it has built-in plugs so all you
need to do is find an outlet you can
charge up anywhere three years ago we
came up with the idea for the pocket
plug you put that idea on Kickstarter
and raised over a hundred and thirty
thousand dollars from our backers pocket
plug was written up all over including
the New York Times Washington Post
calling the pocket plug ingenious in one
of the coolest cases they've ever seen
the key piece of feedback that we got
when we released it was wow this thing
is awesome but how great would it be if
it also had a battery in it so we went
back to the drawing board and redesigned
it from the ground up when it's charging
you could see the LEDs light up and when
it's on your phone you could check the
battery indicator by touching the button
between the prongs here and when it's
charged up you just slide it right back
in and starts charging for the backup
battery what's really inconvenient about
the current solutions on the market are
one you need to carry an extra cable and
a charger with you and number two is
while you're charging you need to be
tethered to the wall with the prong
power case you have the plugs built
right into the case and not only that
the backup battery detaches so you can
plug the battery in the wall and keep
your phone with you that's really the
differentiator between us and every
other solution on the market you don't
need to worry about having the right
cord or the right type of charger
because everything you need is right
there in your pocket you sometimes
you're in situations like you're in your
car or you're sitting at your desk where
you have a cable available and we built
a micro USB port into the bottom of the
backup battery so you can still detach
it so that way you're not tethered to
the cord but you have that option of
using the cord in those scenarios where
you have one available one of the really
great things that we love about
crowdfunding is it allows us to
communicate directly with our customers
and learn how to improve our products
and better serve you but we're not there
yet we need your help to make this thing
a reality we'd really appreciate it if
you share it with your friends on social
media make this thing a great success
