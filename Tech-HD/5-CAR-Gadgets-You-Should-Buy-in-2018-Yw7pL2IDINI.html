nonde the air bubble is the first
provement technology that effectively
removes more than 95% of both nitrogen
dioxide and particles from inside a car
it's now well known that air pollution
affects our health especially those
living in cities however what most
people aren't aware of is just how bad
the air in your car can be nitrogen
dioxide levels primarily from diesel
emissions inside your car cabin can be
10 times over the w-h-o limit sitting in
a vehicle with your windows up in
traffic is not the safe haven you might
think that it is that's why we've
created the air bubble
the first proven technology of its kind
that removes all elements of air
pollution including nitrogen dioxide
from inside a car cabin the air bubble
is optimized to protect drivers and
their families in polluted cities and
professional drivers who spend hours on
the road designed to fit on the back of
the car headrest the air bubble works by
drawing polluted air circulating inside
the car into the unit before our
proprietary filtration technology
removes gases particles bacteria dust
and odors clean air is then released
back to the driver and passengers in the
most efficient way possible using
advanced air flow dynamics what we
breathe matters an a lab some missions
reduce people's exposure to air
pollution like most parents and for is
conscious to avoid the high levels of
air pollution found on busy roads what I
hadn't realized is the levels of harmful
nitrogen dioxide can be even higher
inside our cars
our research is a real wake-up call as I
realize the impact this could have on
the house of my son and of other
children and air labs knowing we had the
only proven technology to effectively
remove nitrogen dioxide I knew it was
our duty to divert the air bubble giving
people the power to protect themselves
and their families the air bubble has
been designed by our team of atmospheric
chemists and airflow engineers at air
labs in our research laboratory here in
Copenhagen
it uses our proprietary filtration
technology developed over the past
decade at air labs we specialize in
creating clean air zones for people the
technology inside the air bubble has
proven itself inside of clean air bus
shelters and in a clean air bench
commissioned by Transport for London
during the past year we have focused on
creating a clean air zone inside of a
car and not making the air bubble a
reality we have manufacturers lined up
and with your help we can start
protecting people with the air bubble
early next work
we're really excited to be launching the
air bubble and today we're asking for
your support
so we can start making a real difference
to people's lives</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
