not us with a doubt to develop the
smallest lightest most convenient urban
transport we could meet Lou a new kind
of electric skateboard our Swiss
engineering team wanted to create a
short Baltic really indistinguishable
from a non power board would you think
it's near perfect design for both fun
and transportation
it's then like and simple it's exactly
does what it's supposed to do whether
cruising the streets are tracking the
park hey but don't be afraid to skate it
hard
Blue Bird uses standard tracks an 83
millimeters impact absorbing
polyurethane skate wheels with one
important difference there's two 1.5
kilo watt motors inside driving them to
user control speeds of over 35
kilometres per hour and travels over 24
kilometres we took special care
designing a wireless handle throttle for
acceleration and braking the design is
clean without any unnecessary
decorations yes we are Swiss and cross
pattern on the deck % accompanies origin
on functional side it helps a list with
food group for increased stability let's
face it
skating is more fun than biking and lot
more convenient no need to waste time
looking for a lock-up spot nothing heavy
to carry Bluebird is really small it's
small enough for urban commuters like me
to pack away on a train bus our unit the
office the carbon fiber shell it's way
more durable than any wood that will be
it keeps the board super light for
protecting the sensitive electronics and
ultra-thin battery inside
if our manufacturers line up B of our
global distribution network in place a
most importantly it's funny you never
look at album travel the same way again
we are here to raise $80,000 so we can
put liubot on the street of every city
in the world
hi I am very proud to introduce domestic
an amazing product that my team and I've
been working on two years we imaginated
and creating domestic because we wanted
to deliver ties German and facilitate
the drummer's life Dramastic is the only
connected solutions that enables you to
play record and improve your brand
whether you're beginner intermediate
forever professional you will find
drastic incredible features
using crema stick is very simple whether
practicing from your coach or sitting
with your actual drum sets thanks to our
app and sensors
you just got to define your eating zones
to enjoy fantasticks highlight you can
discover Brahman in it simple and fun
way the app lets you make real dreaming
sounds by picking the zones record
yourself through the app you can record
all your preferences and export into
MIDI or directly to sheet music practice
and the water skills for sheet music
work on exercises and play real time to
improve your play behind the magic of
drama stick is a patented technology
realistic concentrated technology lets
you transcribe the music you play
directly to the hub these connected
solutions provide heat zones with
incredible precision resulting in
instant responsiveness the hub is of
course compatible with all smartphones
tablets and computers the design goal
was to develop a product that was at the
same time stylish and robust why not
influencing the balance of the
drumsticks the sensors are removable and
can also be attached to feet of directly
on the bass drum pedal or on the hi-hat
for precise transcription option music
today we need your help and support so
that the dream of domestic can become a
reality the success of this crowdfunding
campaign will help us to finance the
development of the sensor the app allows
our first production participate and be
the first to discover the new domestic
dimension thanks everybody and keep on
drumming

they're the most convenient piece of
footwear we own we all have memories
wearing them out on the beach on
vacation out on the hot sunny day when a
sandal is not some of you unaware all
day because they're really bad for your
feet they're mass-manufactured made for
no one in particular and they use the
cheapest materials they can find just to
get something you can put on and off the
ones that do offer some kind of support
really falls short because they're not
actually custom and we just said well we
can fix that introducing the world's
first custom fit sandal captured from
your smartphone using the photos
submitted through our app our technology
digitally maps each foot with over 200
points in the arch the heel and the top
of the foot this data is used to create
a biomechanical enhanced sandal that is
truly custom to your Anatomy in every
way the leading feature of the sandal is
the custom arch support leveraging 3d
printing technology every arch is
completely custom person-to-person left
foot to right foot one of the biggest
complaints of sandal wears is how
annoying the toe fungus we've completely
reinvented the tooth on construction
making it ultra durable and more
comfortable and based on the width of
your foot we know where to place the toe
phone within two millimeters of accuracy
one of the things that helps us take
advantage of the custom arch support is
the deep contoured heel cup we use a
triple density foam and a really soft
dropping footbed that helps contour the
foot and absorb heel strike another
feature that makes a sandal custom is
the interchangeable strap system the
ability to adjust the strap position
based on foot volume helps ensure a
perfect fit every time the straps are
also interchangeable to fit your taste
and personal style making it a sandal
you can wear for any occasion
we're celebrating what makes a sandal
easy and comfortable while also
factoring in sustainability we've
sourced a premium material that feels
great the moment you put it on and it's
a hundred percent closed-loop recyclable
by 3d printing and assembling in San
Diego California it allows us to reduce
our carbon footprint and deliver to your
doorstep faster we were done a variety
of studies with our custom insoles when
we found
dramatic evidence that custom makes a
huge difference for running economy a
maximum pronation tangles your ankle
stability and so on the science we've
learned through the insole project is
being applied to the sandal weave
end-to-end technology stack represents
probably the biggest leap in footwear in
the last 50 years we've got a software
system which can not only take foot
shape but it can also take their
preferences their size their shape we
mix that in with a system which allows
us to have conventionally manufactured
pieces that integrate with those 3d
printed parts to make it the best shoe
it possibly can be for them one of these
I really enjoyed about working with
weave is the bigger vision that they
have for what Footwear can be they
combine technology 3d printing with
solid innovative design in an
interactive way that no other product on
the market does right now I think we
launched our first product at custom 3d
printed insole not knowing what would
happen and we became the most funded 3d
printed product ever people love having
the custom support in their shoes but
they can't get it with their sandal the
thing they wear all the time and as we
started to talk to more customers we
kept hearing a theme hey can you make a
custom flip-flop my insoles are awesome
oh so was kind of like okay it's a
no-brainer we're gonna go do a sandal by
having an entirely unique product that
ensures that your body moves correctly
loads itself correctly you significantly
reduce the strains and stresses that you
put on your body and that can prevent
you from incurring injuries in the
future but it can also improve your
performance today
we're coming to today because we need
your help we spent the last 15 months
creating the sandal we have material
source and processes defined and we need
the funds to get first units out to
production we believe this would be the
best sandal you'll ever wear
