we all have something in our life that
we want to improve for me last year it
was living healthier so I began
exercising and eating better but for a
long time as so felt sluggish and tired
it's like where did all my energy go and
then I realized that I forgot the most
important part drinking water the bottle
connects to your phone via bluetooth and
there's a sensor that tracks how much
water you drink so you don't have to
think about it so if you've forgotten to
drink water the bottle will glow to
remind you and the battery lasts for
over a year so you'll never have to
charge it it syncs with your favorite
wearables and fitness ups and so if you
go on a long run or a workout it'll
increase your daily water goal to make
sure you stay hydrated the app can use
your location to account for the
temperature humidity and elevation of
your surroundings so if you're in
Colorado and the mountains the app will
remind you to drink more we carry our
water bottles with us everywhere so we
wanted to make something that was sleek
elegant and smart and could transition
from the gym the office so something
that is technically advanced but doesn't
look like a tech product because we
wanted to be natural almost like a
natural extension of yourself this
little water bottle goes everywhere with
me it's it's an overall part of my
health and fitness regime it's my food I
go to the gym I go to work I go to
Target I go out with friends I think my
kids are the part like I always have my
water bottle with young people take it
for granted or completely overlooked how
important water is we have a
manufacturing lined up and oh we're
missing is you so help us put in the
first production order we want to make
our smart water bottle available to
everyone because many of us don't
realize how good we could feel if we
were properly hydrated all it takes is
drinking more water it starts with a
drop
