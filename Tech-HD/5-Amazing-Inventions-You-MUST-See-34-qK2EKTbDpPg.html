market introducing Ben sense the world's
first smart parking device

detect any object within three meters of
the car's front or back blind spots we
use an accelerometer detect when the car
is backing up and then use Bluetooth to
automatically launch the app on the
drivers phone we've designed a
completely seamless experience that
requires no interaction on behalf of the
guys the device itself installs in less
than five minutes with absolutely no
wiring and only four security screws to
prevent that so easy your grandma can do
it
the device itself knows when your car is
backing up and immediately launches the
app on the drivers home providing
audio-visual and vibration alerts /
optics and the client spot
