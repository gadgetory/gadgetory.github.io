not very much hi I'm Amanda from the
window a Test Kitchen and in our kitchen
we do a ton of a depressed every day
these choppers have saved us so much
time and made our life so much easier we
have an in-house product design team and
they were tasked with creating a chopper
that really reduces the force needed to
get through hard vegetables and what
they came up with was this pro chopper
they designed to handle with a
spring-loaded mechanism and they used
color equality shameless feel in the
blades so you can get through even the
toughest of veggie I'm going to show you
how it works by wedging some potatoes
let the handle up a little bit and I've
already put in the wedge play
right in so easy I love in the uniform
hit a rustling sending us press and then
when you're done is that it locks right
into place for you these points now for
the ways from a veggie chopper I love
this one too because it's got
interchangeable blades to do dicing and
slicing let me show you by starting with
animation now I'm going to add my onions
to my roasted vegetable I love how this
shows the yield sometimes I'll just
leave it in the refrigerator like this
cover
and now for the mini-chopper this is the
perfect tool for garlic because it
allows you to slice it or mince it it's
really hard to do even with a paring
knife goes right through one more
clothes for my roasted 50 now i'm going
to buy it all of these things i love to
consider all vegetable really high heat
in an oven little olive oil salt and
pepper today I'm going to add a little
bit of time toss them up and into the
oven they go
