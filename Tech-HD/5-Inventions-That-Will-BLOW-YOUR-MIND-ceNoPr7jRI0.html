been there spilling our wine via scotch
or favorite drink and the more we drink
the more likely we are to knock them
over after exhaustive research and lots
of wasted alcohol we set out to create
the first bar where that won't fall
we are happy to introduce the
revolutionary mighty mug bar where line
able to withstand knocks from 360
degrees so you can say goodbye to
staining your carpet pants and making a
mess and get back to enjoying your
relaxation time grips to any smooth and
solid surface such as your tables desk
counter or bar the magic is in our
patented smart grip technology which
allows my tea mugs to grip when hit but
lifts when you need a sip once placed
down my tea mugs creates a powerful
airlock within a space in this position
you are protected against any accidental
knocks and bumps constructed of
crystal-clear BPA free Tritan plastic
for enhanced clarity my tea mugs bar
where is virtually unbreakable and is
top rack dishwasher safe for easy
cleaning after launching our travel mug
last year and receiving press from
around the world many asked us for our
mighty mug to enjoy their adult
beverages so we got to work designing 3d
printing and crafting the greatest bar
wear line ever for entertaining at home
on a boat in your RV by your pool and
even by the edge of your bathtub mighty
mug bar wear will instantly amaze and
wow you quickly becoming your go-to for
drink time we have completed the
development process and all
manufacturing tooling is being finalized
at this time

awesome reward whether the party has
begun to wind down or the times have

standing but your mighty mug will thank

hi I'm Valerie designer officially I've
been working this project for two years
now expect this race will not only
simplify time the truth it can be the
entire with one hand only but also to
become a new fashion accessory that's
modern looks in different colors can
speak to area of the defense with your
support
I hope you could start material
production here in they depend in
fashion accessory stores all around the
world that's my dream I want to achieve
your creature lady
you
you
introducing heroes the first protective
hearing devices designed with music
lovers in mind ever got home from a
concert a club or any loud event with
muffled hearing or a ringing in your
ears that acoustical hangover is the
sign of hearing damage a terrorists were
out to change them with our
patent-pending technology we have
developed a solution that reduces
decibel levels maintains quality of
sound and lessens hearing damage hi my
name is Ronnie madra and I'm the founder
and inventor of euros I have noise
induced hearing loss I also have
tinnitus I own and operate several
nightclubs I'm in loud environments all
the time seven days a week I need to do
something well me for myself but for
people that I host or people that come
to my places 80 decibels of sound is
what OSHA recommends hearing protection
ads and that's roughly the sound of
walking down the street in New York City
what euros was designed to do which is
so cool in that it blocks the bad
decibels from getting in while still
allowing sound quality these little tiny
sound boards that travel through the
product to an acoustical filter you can
stand at a concert and hear the music
crisply or still protecting your ears
from the damaging decibels what I
thought was really exciting and
interesting about the approach that
running in the team took was that they
incorporated app technology into the
whole product set and what does that
mean that they've created a solution
that allows you to really understand
what's happening in your is based on the
noise levels around you since this
product doesn't operate on batteries it
doesn't requires to make it rechargeable
we don't have to provide an extra plug
with it we've designed the passive
technology this has a very strong health
benefit I think that's important I think
because I feel it I know it I live it I
want to keep building clubs I want to
keep throwing events and I want to keep
being in hospitality that's what I love
to do
we need your help back this project
share with your friends help us help you
protect your hearing thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
