one-third of all us drivers read and
send text messages while behind the
wheel
even we look down to just check our
speed we drive blind for over 300 feet
it's 60 miles an hour even worse we take
3 to 6 seconds to read and interpret
maps on a regular navigation system well
according to the government-sponsored
research taking your eyes of the road
for more than two seconds is unsafe in
dangerous in a significantly increasing
your chances of getting into a car
accident we are half way believe but
very best safe way to use smartphone
behind the wheel and we hope to change
everyone's driving habits of a better
in 2015 we ran our first Kickstarter
campaign for Hardwicke was a simple
vehicle accessory but reflects a
smartphone screen and a special glass
this summer we are launching a new
product at wiha's it's a portable
hazardous play that sits on your
dashboard and worst as an external
display for a smartphone wirelessly
together with our app it will let you
control a basic smartphone functions
while driving navigation calls messages
and music in a safer less distracting
way it's like Android or carplay but
with a virtual heads-up display image
floating above the hood eight feet away
easy to use easy to install and all you
need is a smartphone
they have this in like in like high-end
cars right like BMWs or whatever they
did the projects on so you're not
looking away from the road to actually
see the directions and it like moves
with here's here that is really cool
I've seen people on their phone all the
time and they're always looking down so
this is definitely plus in terms of
trying to keep up P and drivers away
from being distracted it's actually
really awesome
that's very cool I guess the word comes
in maps that makes it a lot easier I get
it
I love the technology and I think it
would be much safer than looking down at
my phone every two minutes you know I
always have my kid in the car and I'm
always really worried and I use Google
Maps all the time wherever I'm going and
I feel so bad because I have to hold it
here is it just works with any app like
is it just showing literally your phone
screen okay awesome
it's pretty sweet seems super safe so
definitely something that I would try
out
yes it works with ways Google Maps Apple
maps you name it but varies more our
Hardwick ass app works as a control
panel for a basic smartphone functions
well as distracting and driving friendly
way navigation in places that where you
want to go to follow directions using
your navigation phase make and receive
phone calls using a car media your
favorite contacts are always here reply
to incoming messages with preset
templates or send a voice message no
need to type manage your music library
with quick swipes and taps in our
driving friendly UI in all these cases
you will still see your directions and
navigation information on a hard wakeup
screen and use your phone as a control
panel if you want to use any other apps
no problem how the cast will mirror
whatever is on your phone screen like
chromecast now fancy and complicated
integrations with a car and media it
just works
since our last Kickstarter campaign we
learn how to handle things in Hardware
projects we dealt with quality issues
production delays shipment slows by
Canadian post copycats Taiwanese
typhoons Chinese national holidays and
customs but it was all worth it support
in experience we've gained is priceless
help us deliver this product the best
price possible and make our rows a
little bit safer join us to do this
together Hardwick asked to see you soon
thank you
Wendy are you sure we should be doing
this my parents are really strict about
this kind of thing
yeah Ronald I mean as long as we're
careful they'll never know I guess I
mean if you're not ready no pressure we
can wait no no I'm ready
I've been waiting all night for this
wait did you bring protection
good job son you'll pass no problem
thanks dad look before you go Ronnie I
think it's time we have to talk your
mother and I are going to allow you to
use the car sometimes which means you're
going to have certain freedoms that you
didn't have before
what kind of freedoms dad well for
instance you may have a young lady in
the car and one thing may lead to
another but it's important that you
don't let your hunger get the best of
you what happened to boy are you the
best in me dad
well unless you use protection you could
end up in a a messy situation protection
yes son I always keep a couple in the
car I'll show you how to use one the
first thing you want to do is gently
tear open the package then you want to
slide the dip clip onto the vent it's
one size fits all so it'll work in any
car after its secured you'll take your
sauce and slip it right into the hole
then just dunk and enjoy yourself dad
what if my sauce doesn't fit don't worry
Ronald they're designed to hold almost
all sauces from any major fast-food
chain a dad what if I'm in other stuff
you know like ketchup or mustard
um well I'm the son your mother and I
are gonna love you no matter what you're
into and don't worry there is a ramekin
that comes with the dip clip just for
that what if I don't use a dip clip mm a
lot of people like to risk it but what
happens more often than not is you get
your sauce everywhere dad why don't you
just eat it without sauce if you like
I'm just going to leave this one right
here for you
just remember it's for your protection
we just want you to practice safe sauce
yeah did you bring protection oh yes
okay I'm ready if you are
I'm starving me too
please support our Kickstarter campaign
and help make dick clipper a reality so
millions of people around the world can
practice safe sauce atta boy
Ronald
this is out of Herman compared to the
other car extinguishers he because up
the beaten track let's see what exactly
it can do
generally speaking car fire always
secured firstly around engine usually
the driver cannot that is in time and
the situation become more serious
ten minutes past the situation will end
like this if you have out of Herman the
situation will be completely different
now I'm in saline and out of Herman in
the engine compartment these two magnets
will be attached to the engine
compartment the installation is within
30 seconds
not only the installation is fast but it
also can put out fire quickly what the
temperature in the engine compartment is
up to 600 Celsius the pillion sensor
will detect the high temperature or up
and higher it will activate the auto
extinguisher and start to release the
extinguishing the car fire can be put
out within 30 seconds
we've all experienced the spinning
wheels of a stuck car and using anything
around us like kitty litter a piece of
plywood even a shovel just to get out of
it
traction mat is a better solution one
that's small enough to keep in your
trunk just in case and one that you can
use without needing the help of a friend
or a random person on the street the
linked treads give tires the traction
needed to get moving on rocky icy or
even muddy terrain founder Megan edge
found herself in this very common but
less than ideal situation I designed
this mat because a few years ago I was
driving with my children on a snowy road
and I slid on the ice into a ditch
I had a traction mat in the car and it
was a traditional traction mat that
opens three ways it's stiff and I put it
under the car got back in the car
started the car and still couldn't get
out the bigger problem was there was a
small rock and it cracked the traction
mat and then unfortunately the tire the
momentum of the tire actually created a
projectile out of the traction mat and
it flew out from my car traction mats
innovative links make it flexible so it
hugs the ground way better than those
stiff mats or even that piece of plywood
which to be honest can be a real
dangerous solution unroll the traction
mat under your tire depending on if the
car has rear or front you'll drive and
simply drive over it the thick rugged
plastic is designed so it won't crack or
split while it maintains a secure grip
on the ground you'll be on your way in
no time
