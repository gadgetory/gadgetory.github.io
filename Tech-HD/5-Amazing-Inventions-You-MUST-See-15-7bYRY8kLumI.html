a problem portal uses all of those
ladies and it does it intelligently you
can change lanes predictably to avoid
interference and to avoid traffic a big
part of the Wi-Fi spectrum actually is
reserved for radar Wi-Fi is allowed to
share on it but to share it you have to
make sure radar is not present and
that's a very delicate and very highly
regulated environment we've received
certification for doing that the way we
achieved us we've been working with the
FCC for quite some time all of our
products are now authorized to work
within those radar bands so one of the
key applications we develop portal for
was gaming what we want to do is create
some special channels offer both high
bandwidth and very little agency and we
control the access to those channels so
that if we know you're gaining and we
can detect that automatically
