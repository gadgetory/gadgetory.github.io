skip a song tap if you like a song once
you've liked a Saw IV remembers it and
adds it to your favorite channel it's
like having a personal DJ IV learns what
you like and generates playlists just
for you switching between channels is
super easy just use the channel rank and
you're there through sensors IV learns
where and when you like to track the
more you use IV the better it
understands your preferences the more it
plays music you like no more wasting
time for organizing your music ie

library of over 40 million tracks IV

IVs battery life lasts up to 40 hours
it's as if the music never stops until
you want it to when you remove your
headphones it pauses the track
automatically so you'll never miss a
beat

sound is arguably the most important of
the census it conveys emotion health
stories and helps us navigate our world
while we can only see what is directly
in front of us we can hear everything
from all around all of the time when was
the last time your headphones made you
feel like you were actually they're not
just identifying the sound but feeling
transported that's the sound we want you
to hear I'd like to introduce you to the
Asik x Asik x headphones combine
advanced 3d audio algorithms with head
tracking and individual anatomy
calibration to create incredibly
realistic 3d sound headphones haven't
changed a lot in the past 65 years the
mission at Asik is to take the final
leap from reproduced audio to something
that's indistinguishable from reality
our founding team has a passion for
audio we have a combined 50 years of
experience designing some of the top
selling gaming headphones and speakers
on the market our mission is to change
the way people hear sound oh my got it
so it's so different it's like a movie
theater experience Leslie at home Jason
the sound everywhere was it was awesome
oh my gosh I don't know I was amazing I
don't forget anything like that before
in real life sound comes from everywhere
and the way you hear the world is unique
only to you it's based on your position
in space the size of your head even the
shape of your ears but with traditional
and even surround sound headphones these
elements are not taken into account in
effect you are removed from the sound
equation this makes for an incredibly
small audio experience where Psalms can
only come from a few places instead of
anywhere the Asik x is the world's first
headphone that instantly calibrates to
the listener creating the ultimate 3d
listening experience you can be on a
train and have the same experience you
had hearing the concert from the best
seats in the house we can now transport
you to the highest end theater that has
a full array of speakers so you feel
like you were at the movies when you put
them on hi my name is ty ahmad taylor
i'm the CEO of THX for the first time in
my life I was able to actually
experience
sound outside of being the center of my
head and in a natural sound field that
expanded about several feet in front and
behind and above me it was really
revolutionary in virtual reality is all
about immersion it's about transporting
you to another world Asik X will allow
you to accurately hear the sounds
anywhere in the full sphere and it's
going to be crucial in virtual reality
to help direct your attention and create
an incredibly immersive experience that
ties in with the visuals to create the
ultimate presence I was is so real yeah
I can see what the fuss is about now
well the audio effects ended up messing
perfectly with what I was seeing Asik X
is gonna change the way we game we bring
a whole new level of accuracy to hearing
sounds anywhere in space not just around
us but we also have the ability to
unlock the sounds above us and below us
you get the feeling that you've been
teleported into the game communication
is important in gaming the Asik x
headphones use a 3d microphone array
with beamforming to give you the same
noise rejection you would get with a
boom but unlike a boom ensure that your
voice level is always consistent the key
to creating an accurate and realistic
sound experience is knowing the
listeners individual auditory anatomy
and how it influences the way we hear
sound this is called an HR TF or head
related transfer function in order to
create this instant calibration we've
incorporated sensors into the headphone
and we take the information from the
sensors and feed it into software and we
have an adaptive algorithm that
customizes the playback for the
individual wearing the headphone
additionally we have multiple drivers
within the headphone that can beam the
sound around the ear and so we can have
the sound naturally interact with the
ear the way it normally would by taking
the intelligence of the adaptive
algorithm and the physical hardware
that's interacting with you were able to
create a personal experience that's
unique to you the headphones feature a
uniform headband design and high quality
lightweight aluminum construction it's
unbreakable they have been designed for
durability acoustic quality and comfort
for prolonged periods of use they can
form perfectly to the user's Anatomy
featuring soft over the ear pads and a
revolutionary micro adjust air time it's
taken our team numerous prototypes and
years of research package components
necessary for accurate 3d audio into a
high fidelity and durable headphone with
a design ready we've secured
manufacturing partners who are
experienced in production of
high-quality audio products now we are
excited to get 3d audio into your hands
we know that there's a huge gap between
what's currently available for 3d sound
and what's possible that's why we
started asik we want to bring this
technology to life we want to put it in
the hands of content creators gamers VR
enthusiasts audio files together we can
shape the future of audio
