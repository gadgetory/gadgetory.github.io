frequently having to recharge your

skip a song tap if you like a song

learns what you like and generates
playlists just for you switching between

you want it to when you remove your
headphones it pauses the track
automatically so you'll never miss a
beat

sound is arguably the most important of
the census it conveys emotion tell
stories and helps us navigate our world
while we can only see what is directly
in front of us we can hear everything
from all around all of the time when was
the last time your headphones made you
feel like you were actually there not
just identifying the sound but feeling
transported that's the sound we want you
to hear I'd like to introduce you to the
Asik ex Asik ex headphones combine
advanced 3d audio algorithms with head
tracking an individual Anatomy
calibration to create incredibly
realistic 3d sound headphones haven't
changed a lot in the past 65 years the
mission in Asik is to take the final
leap from reproduced audio to something
that's indistinguishable from reality
our founding team has a passion for
audio we have a combined 50 years of
experience designing some of the
top-selling gaming headphones and
speakers on the market our mission is to
change the way people hear sound oh my
god it's so it's so different it's like
in real life sound comes from everywhere
and the way you hear the world is unique
only to you it's based on your position
in space the size of your head even the
shape of your ears but with traditional
and even surround sound headphones these
elements are not taken into account in
effect you are removed from the sound
equation this makes for an incredibly
small audio experience where Psalms can
only come from a few places instead of
anywhere the Asik ex is the world's
first headphone that instantly
calibrates to the listener creating the
ultimate 3d listening experience you can
be on a train and have the same
experience you have hearing the concert
from the best seats in the house we can
now transport you to the highest end
theater that has a full array of
speakers so you feel like you were at
the movies when you put them on hi my
name is ty mod Taylor I'm the CEO of thx
for the first time in my life I was able
to actually
and sound outside of being the center of
my head and in a natural sound field
that expanded about several feet in
front and behind and above me it was
really revolutionary in virtual reality
is all about immersion
it's about transporting you to another
world asik X will allow you to
accurately hear the sounds anywhere in
the full sphere and it's going to be
crucial in virtual reality to help
direct your attention and create an
incredibly immersive experience that
ties in with the visuals to create the
ultimate presence house is so real yeah
all the audio effects ended up perfectly
with what I was seeing
Asik X is gonna change the way we game
we bring a whole new level of accuracy
to hearing sounds anywhere in space not
just around us but we also have the
ability to unlock the sounds above us
and below us you get the feeling that
you've been teleported into the game
communication is important in gaming the
asik x headphones use a 3d microphone
array with beamforming
to give you the same noise rejection you
would get with a boom but unlike a boom
ensure that your voice level is always
consistent the key to creating an
accurate and realistic sound experience
is knowing the listeners individual
auditory Anatomy and how it influences
the way we hear sound this is called an
HR TF or head related transfer function
in order to create this instant
calibration we've incorporated sensors
into the headphone and we take the
information from the sensors and feed it
into a software and we have an adaptive
algorithm that customizes the playback
for the individual wearing the
headphones additionally we have multiple
drivers within the headphone that can
beam the sound around the ear and so we
can have the sound naturally interact
with the ear the way it normally would
by taking the intelligence of the
adaptive algorithm and the physical
hardware that's interacting with you
were able to create a personal
experience that's unique to you the
headphones feature a uniform headband
design and high-quality lightweight
aluminum construction it's unbreakable
they have been designed for durability
acoustic quality and comfort for
prolonged periods of use they conform
perfectly to the user's anatomy
featuring soft over the ear pads and a
revolutionary micro adjust air temp it's
taken our team numerous prototypes and
years of research
package components necessary for
accurate 3d audio into a high fidelity
and durable headphone with a design
ready we've secured manufacturing
partners who are experienced in
production of high quality audio
products now we are excited to get
through the audio into your hands we
know that there's a huge gap between
what's currently available for 3d sound
and what's possible that's why we
started Asik we want to bring this
technology to life we want to put it in
the hands of content creators gamers VR
enthusiasts audio files together we can
shape the future of audio
I'm Tim a couple of years ago as embed
trying to get to sleep after a busy day
and I realized just how much of my life
I wasted trying to get to sleep on
trains and planes and festivals and
there my embeds I wanted a natural way
to help myself get sleep better that fit
in my busy lifestyle and didn't involve
drugs or earplugs
this inspired me to create cocoon the
world's first sleep sensing headphone
that helps you relax and sleep better
anytime anywhere audio is one of the
most effective ways of helping us relax
and switch off naturally whilst normal
headphones get uncomfortable and for our
patented comfort technology keeps the
cocoons cool and comfortable even in bed
cocoon accurately tracks how deeply
you're sleeping using as EEG sensors it
then uses this information to adjust
your audio as you fall asleep this
ensures your audio doesn't wake you and
is better tuned to block out external
disturbances we realize that to ensure
