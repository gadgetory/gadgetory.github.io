things make our life easier in the
workshop or how we can work on the
exactness of our products
the idea no jet to same which is
narrower cheaper method it is all very
very problematic the hakuna facility

Goliath votre bière millaa millaa Laura
durante rutilated la máquina
traditionally quindi calm instrumental
turn a TiVo or Dysport Oh have you ever
imagined at all the turns idea of any
scale into reality without restrictions
of limited space Goliath it's a CNC
portable robot that moves autonomously
and can be placed directly on your work
surface
grab flexibility makes it much more
affordable than a workcenter both for
carpentry and shared workspaces such as
fabrics schools and universities
the Goliath CNC for me is interesting in
terms of being able to produce very
quickly custom designs or more
spontaneously to be able to change our
ideas and put them into practice as
quickly as possible
Arisa Goliath la primavera tosin Abasi

especially due to the size of the
machine we don't have to have it fixed
in one place so we can use it in lots of
different areas in the workshop Casavant

to materiality we have spent many hours
testing and prototyping with Goliath now
we are very close for the final product
for mass production one of the best
thing we experienced was seeing so many
different people having ideas about how
and where they will use Goliath
I strongly believe in the digital
fabrication and we can't wait to see
what you are going to make with the life
you
we all know what it's like to leave our
dog at home every day when we need to go
to work they have to stay alone from
nine to seven and that's not fun for
them or for you so for you and your dog
we created Lika Lika is a life companion
for your dog it is similar to a mobile
terrestrial robot that you can control
with your smartphone from anywhere like
us equipped with a camera a microphone a
speaker and a tree tosser that can be
used to reward your dog this makes your
dog love Laika
while having fun play times together we
also developed a tracker to keep tabs on
your dog and adapt based on your dog's
behavior so if you're busy and your dog
needs attention like this autonomous
mode turns on and take care of your dog
until you're back
hi everyone my name is thomas i'm one of
the co-founder of kam toy and i'm a dog
lover since my childhood when i started
college i couldn't spend as much time as
i used to with my dog this is how i
first thought about lekha a smart dog
companion
the cam toy team has been hard at work
conceptualizing lekha we gathered
amazing partners and were ready to go
over the industry ization process and
here we are now in Paris in the biggest
startup campus in the world the station
F I'd like to introduce you one non
veterinarian and dog behaviorist in
France he helped us a lot
from the beginning to better understand
dogs I was very lucky to meet tomorrow
Marvin and all the team of kam toy
lekha the companion of the dog the
companion of his life is the best
solution the most ethical solution to
prevent boredom when a dog is alone if
you love dogs as we do and you want to
improve their well-being please support
project and backers on IndieGoGo
so now show its family and your friends
to help us to imagine thing together we
hope you join the Laker community thanks
for watching
you
hi my name is Paula I'm a certified
chiropractor posture doctor online
educator with a fellowship in the
students of posture now you might think
you've got your neck covered by regular
exercises you do in the gym but that's
simply not true most of the exercises we
do in the gym fail to address the core
stabilizing neck muscles the ones that
matter most
that's where fit neck comes in fits neck
is a patent-pending unique and
innovative device designed to strengthen
your neck stabilizer muscles and correct
your posture the exercise can be done
sitting or standing which means it's
suitable for all kinds of users it's
also the most effective way to enhance
your posture strengthen your core neck
muscles and prevent neck injuries with
our modern lifestyle we are constantly
looking at phones and computers this is
creating extreme pressure on your neck
if its neck is based on academic
research and was developed in
collaboration with professional sports
teams and chiropractors in the United
States and Canada I don't like spending
a lot of time in the gym I like spending
time on my bike but there's some
strengths that are just critical and
your neck is one of them that's why I
like fit neck it's easy it's simple it's
quick and it does what it's supposed to
do having a strong neck and proper
posture doesn't require much doing the
chin tuck exercise has been clinically
proven to improve your neck posture fit
neck makes it easy all you need is a
two-minute exercise done four times a
week done standing or sitting wherever
whenever it comes with adhesive mounts
and can be set up anywhere just set your
resistance and within two minutes you're
done when you strengthen your neck
muscles with fit neck your body
automatically pulls your head back in to
correct posture did you know that
anxiety fatigue and even allergies may
all be connected to our posture let me
explain our head is heavy roughly ten
pounds
and if we carry it out in front of us
instead of over top of our shoulders
where it belongs the weight increases
dramatically the nerves are put under
great stress and tension in this
condition and because the central
nervous system runs your entire body we
begin to imagine that a stretch spinal
cord is a significant health risk over
time when we begin to use effective neck
exercise designed to realign our head
back over our shoulders where it belongs
we look more attractive feel way more
confident and aged better because our
health improves dramatically so please
support us with our project and help us
straighten up the world we live in
thanks for watching
you
hi I'm Shelly and my name is Tyrone and
we're founders of total penny so as
parents we couldn't quite find what we
were looking for on the market we had
twins and right away I knew I needed a
monitor that move around to different
areas of the house how was I able to
keep eyes on both children how do people
with multiple kids manage to keep tabs
on everyone I needed an extra pair of
eyes luckily enough where expats based
in Taipei Taiwan the kingdom of harbor
providers that have produced the likes
of Dropcam and bill Crowe in fact a
large part of the components and the
manufacturing are done by the very same
Tony ceccacci now we did a lot of
extensive research and during our
research we found that many major brand
names would come to Asia and pick any
model out of a catalog or just lack of
rental that's why I found monitors to be
so lucky they were mainly designed by
people who knew nothing about what busy
parents with me now what makes termagant
special the fact is we've got it over
four hour battery life it's recognized
so you can get it wet and not be worried
about now in terms of features we've got
an easy set up process that it takes
less than two minutes we have over four
hours of continuous battery life and
also it's cordless importable so that
you can toss it into your pocket or
diaper bag we've got an optional cloud
storage where you directly send it up to
your Dropbox HD 1080p provides a clearer
picture in quality wherever you go
and it also is compatible with all I Oh
s and
great devices but more importantly if
you take a look at most baby monitors or
IP cameras you have to go from your
handset to your router to a monitor in
the back again now we have that option
to be sure but we also give the extra
data option we're going Wi-Fi direct
now what does that mean well we turn
this into a portable hotspot so as long
as you're within 60 yards or 60 meters
you can connect directly to your cell
phone so when you go to your friend's
house for a cookout or the park you
don't have to Bossman's right now this
is recognized
well for the starters we have a casing
this three times thicker than your
average consumer electronic device which
means it's also three times more costly
we also have higher in lithium batteries
that are strengthened and protected from
overheating and finally we have
enterprise level security just to make
sure that you're covered we built it
again to be portable and rugged enough
for you to use even up doors now we're
fesses are a water-resistant see in the
middle of the strongest typhoon in and
decade at this area we've also applied
numerous drop tests and toward your
tests so you don't have to unlike
traditional baby monitors you can take
this one on the go in your diaper bag is
it at a playdate
or in the garden with the sprinklers on
have you ever been caught in a situation
where you're out on a friend's house the
older one is playing outside of the yard
and the baby is asleep and you need to
borrow someone's bright learning for a
nap a design is final and ready please
help us reach our goal
please help us scale up to manufacturing
we spent years researching designing and
manufacturing this monitor to make sure
that is safest and best monitor out on
the market</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
