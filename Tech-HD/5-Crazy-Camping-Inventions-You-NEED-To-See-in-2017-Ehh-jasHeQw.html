the mutt utility model combines the best
of Letterman's heavy duty utility
features with the most necessary firearm
maintenance tools built with the ar-15
m16 platform in mind the primary
features on the mud make it the perfect
tool for uniformed professionals and
civilian shooters the bolt override tool
on the utility model allows for clearing
a piece of brass or live round jammed
between the chamber charging handle and
the bolt carrier to clear this
malfunction drop the magazine insert
your bolt override tool onto the bolt
carrier and pull back sharply to the
rear this will clear the round and your
gun will once again be operational
the replaceable firearm disassembly
punch makes for easy removal of takedown
and retaining pins the 1/8 inch standard
punch can be used alone or with the
hammer end of the mutt when more force
is needed the hex Torx screwdriver bit
on the mutt is extra-long and sized
specifically to fit both old and new
optics rings adjustment to an a2 pistol
grip and most optic adjustment screws
can be made with the extra-long quarter
and screwdriver and the opposing Philips
number two is sized for heavy duty
utility work
the shorter Phillips number one two and
3/16 and screwdriver bit is perfect for
more general equipment adjustment and
keeps the cutters blocked when not in
use the replaceable carbon scraper for
cleaning performance degrading carbon
buildup is made of bronze to prevent
damage and scarring of parts the tool is
designed to reach all areas of the bolt
carrier group with plenty of surface
area to clean them quickly
there are both male and female threads
on the mud for attachment and use of
your standard cleaning rods and brushes
both models of the mud come with a half
inch and three-eighths inch wrench with
12-point heads for optic systems
adjustment as well as a rugged Molly
sheath for transport of the tool wrench
and any extra bits in addition to the
firearm specific tools there are the
everyday carry utility tools synonymous
with the Leatherman name needlenose
pliers
regular pliers replaceable regular and
hard wire cutters a saw bit driver and
hammer make the mutt a perfect
all-around field tool it's the MOT
designed to letterman's rigorous
standards for the military law
enforcement and civilian shooters and
tested by operational professionals the
world over Leatherman now you're ready
you
with the success of our first
Kickstarter the world's first heated
down jacket which we produced and
shipped in a record-setting three months
we got to thinking what else could we
create that people use but are just
satisfied with the current products on
the market I recently went camping
probably a little too early in the
season I only have my two season bag
that was rated 230 degrees and it
dropped below like 20 degrees I was cold
I was miserable so I thought why not put
my ray V and heated jacket on I fired it
up when my core was a toasty but my feet
were freezing all I could think was I
wish I had another heated jacket which
sparked an idea why don't we create a
heated sleeping bag
we started chewing on that idea I
realized not everyone wants to buy a
brand new bag so we thought what if we
created something that would make their
current bag work in colder temperatures
the Ray V and heated sleeping bag liner
was born
after a lot of iterations we created two
sleeping bag liner versions the first
version is what we call the simple it's
the shape of a mummy bag the heating
elements wrap around your core and your
feet it has a side zipper like most bags
which can be accessed from the inside or
the outside of the bag the added since
around the top makes it so that you can
close it all the way up as tight as you
want we also added a foot box at the
bottom so your feet are nice and
comfortable there's a vertical draw
along the side of the bag so you can
adjust the length to put the heat on
your feet where you want it and adjust
to your height the battery pockets are
at the bottom of the bag so you won't
roll on them or get in your way while
you're sleeping we think this first
version of the bag liner is a great
product and it can be used in any
sleeping bag for those colder outings
where your current bag isn't quite warm
enough for our second version of the
sleeping bag liner we went even more
raving on it we thought what if we made
the bag liner do more what if we made it
wearable and you could get up in the
morning and stay warm without having to
change clothes in the chilly morning air
you can walk around camp and cook your
breakfast you can chop some firewood or
other stuff around camp until the day
starts to warm up we added a hood that's
heated as well so you can keep that
precious noggin of yours
we actually built in a bunch of other
features as well in addition to the
heated hood the core and the feet there
are three temperature settings tai
medium and low for each heating zone
your feet and your upper body sensors
are located at the bottom - since around
your feet to keep them toasty or since
around your waist to wear it around camp
like a long jacket we've had a eunuch
ups - keep the sleeves in place and keep
the chill out we've given you some
simple hand pockets to stuff things in
and chest pockets for your mobile
devices and other items you want to keep
secure the main zipper is extra long so
you can step into it and slip it on
easily and cut down on anything that
wasn't necessary so you're as
comfortable as possible when you sleep
we need your help to fund the production
of the bag liners and the new 12-volt
batteries help us make some really cool
products and be the first to own a
heated ravy and sleeping bag liner
