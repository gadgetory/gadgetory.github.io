hi I'm Belle and I'm chase and we are
the founders of Ava as a foodie I've
always dreamed of having fresh
ingredients at home and growing up some
of my favorite moments were gardening
with dad and harvesting fresh greens
from the garden and I grew up cooking in
different restaurants and found that
every chef wanted to have access to the
freshest ingredients possible but always
never had a time space or knowledge to
grow things themselves after becoming an
industrial designer I wanted to create a
sustainable solution we wanted an option
to grow fresh herbs and vegetables
indoors that compact smart and designed
for modern lifestyle so that anyone
anywhere could grow anything so we came
up with Ava bites we spent the last two
years putting together an incredible
team of plant scientists designers
engineers and vertical farmers to help
bring Ava to life we're on a mission to
feed the world's transition to
sustainable food and giving you a new
way to connect to nature at home our
