hammer all come in handy but why haul
them all if you don't have to you can
search the deepest corners of the forest
and never find a tool as versatile as
the four and one woodsman buy Zippo
outdoor it's got the heft to drive
stakes into hard ground and the leverage
to pull them out again the four in one
woodsman converts to a bow saw with a
cam blade tensioner and a sheath that
doubles as a comfortable non-slip hand
grip and it changes back again so you
can make dry tinder to help start your
campfires
the poor in one woodsman features a
sheath that doubles as a saw handle a
set screw that's an integral part of the
sheath securely connecting the sheath to
the axe blade and securing one end of
the saw blade it has a 5-inch full tang
axe head a high performance engineered
polymer handle wrapped around a full
metal shaft with a 15 inch metal saw
blade that stores inside the handle a
tent stake puller and a stake driver the
four-in-one woodsman it's a handicap
tool it's a survival tool it's one tool
that lets you leave three others at home
you
you
smartphone cameras have become more
advanced and accessible than ever before
although everyone has the ability to
create high-quality pictures and videos
dim lighting can make this a challenge
with dim lights it's possible to take
decent photos but with videos the
technology hasn't existed until now
without proper lighting your videos will
come out grainy blurry and underexposed
that's why you need the fire pack from
surefire it's a smartphone video
illumination tool that will help you
capture high-quality pictures and videos
in low-light situations it's the most
advanced smartphone illumination tool on
the market offering a perfect beam of
light that fully fills up your camera's
frame while there are other products on
the market there's nothing quite like
the fire pack it's the only smartphone
accessory that is reliable and gives you
stunning results each and every time up
to 50 feet and slow motion it's
lightweight portable rechargeable and
attaches to the back of your phone when
used with the surefire phone case the
fire pack is so much more you can use it
to recharge your phone and use it as a
personal safety light when needed
here's some examples with and without
the fire pack and challenging lighting
conditions look at the amazing
difference the fire pack makes as you
can see in these examples you can barely
see what's going on in the dark but as
soon as you turn on the fire pack wow
your entire frame comes to life with its
wide range and powerful light output it
truly can't be matched by anything else
on the market the Sun no longer dictates
when you can film we've all been there
and we know what it's like to try
filming at night
although smartphones are equipped with
lights these aren't powerful enough to
capture truly amazing content the fire
pack has multiple levels of illumination
with an output of up to 1500 lumens
that's just as powerful as a 100 watt
light bulb
light levels can be adjusted manually
with its slide switch or remotely with a
free bluetooth app finally you can
capture the perfect moment anytime
anywhere and share with friends
immediately and although it works
remarkably at night it's also great for
indoors even when your subject is lit
from behind the high quality images
you're seeing are the direct result of
the fire packs refined distribution of
light which has been precisely matched
for what works best with a smartphone
camera sure fires technological
advancements have allowed them to make
professional quality video lighting
easily accessible to anyone and everyone
and with its small size it's easy to
carry in a pocket or purse wherever you
go the fire pack projects a perfect beam
of light that allows you to take the
very best video with your smartphone
capture the moment and share your
memories with the world like never
before
