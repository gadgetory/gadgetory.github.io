pollution and although many of us are
doing our best in our daily lives to
reduce and categorize food waste
properly the problem persists therefore
we want to take a more positive approach
in dealing with the food waste that's
been created to take all the food waste
that would have originally reached
landfills and incinerators and instead
bring it to the repurposing plant the
food waste then goes through the simple
processes of mixing drying and pressing
to finally be molded into shape to
create alpha pod made from food waste
the 100% biodegradable pot for your
plants it's self watering through a wick
system it's modular design
and more importantly it can be directly
transplanted alphabat becomes nutrients
helping your plant to grow as it breaks
down naturally in the soil this is the
kind of positive cycle we want to
achieve
to give food waste a new and more
beautiful life
to create a sustainable and greener
future alphabat grow easily in nature
hi
we are Arabs and this is our story we
have been living in big cities for a
while and as many other people we
suffered from poor air quality so we
started to use air purifiers and
essential oils to help us with the side
effects of air pollution and we
discovered the benefits of aromatherapy
essential oils are known for centuries
for their benefits on human bodies by
entering into respiratory system many of
them have a positive effect on the body
more than that they also provide nice
sense to the environment help relaxing
and that's what people usually use them
for but to be honest we were not really
happy with the products on the market so
we decided to design and produce our own
diffuser
after some time discussing with doctors
visiting factories and producing three
different prototypes we achieved the
best diffuser ever his name is Zen Zen
is made with noble materials rubber wood
and ceramic that makes it beautiful and
inspiring it will fit any place in your
home in their office in your shop by
nebulizing the essential oil directly
from the bottle it diffuses it in very
small particles
it doesn't require any water so no risk
of leakage or too much humidity it's the
most efficient and simple diffusing
technology so we wanted to let's set to
do the best mix between design and
technology so we blended both together
what's incredible is this product is
that it's very easy to use it's very
intuitive you just have to turn the
trigger and you just have to to press to
stop it it's very very simple in terms
of features we wanted to do something in
between the Western and the Asian world
so that's why we drew something that is
a little bit inspired by the Japanese
Zen garden map what is interesting is
this product also is that you can
customize you can create many many
different kind of outlook Zen is super
simple to operate just turn the handle
and it works for the time you desire and
if you want to stop it just press on the
wooden panel and you know what you can
directly use the essential oil bottles
from the market no need to buy any
refill system or cartridge it's smooth
light provides a warm feeling when
working late at night
it can be used before going to bed for a
relaxing break or at any moment you feel
the need to experience essential oil
benefits Zen is the best companion for
aroma oil users ever we have been
working for months now to design and
develop the best dishes I've ever made
it's time to read it to life so we
really do support to make it possible
thanks for backing our campaign
