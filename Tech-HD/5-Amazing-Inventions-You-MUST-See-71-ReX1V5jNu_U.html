mechanic so I saw firsthand the kind of
handheld lights and area lights that
were being used they were cheap with dim
underpowered bulbs and flimsy
construction I'd constantly be buying
new ones because they always fell apart
even with newer LED lights the
electronics often broke creating an
unreliable light
I remember thinking then that car shops
deserved a better light and so did
truckers electricians first responders
anyone else who works with their hands
when I started working at Big Ass
solutions I knew this was a project that
I wanted to pursue I came up with a
rough concept a handheld area light that
was bright cordless portable durable a
light that was over engineered to stand
up to years of abuse and harsh
conditions I pitched the idea to our CEO
Carrie Smith and he actually encouraged
me to pursue this project and see where
it led and now after two years and
countless hours of work we have the
big-ass light bar we wanted a light that
was bright as hell with five thousand
lumen at maximum output it's everything
you need up to 48 hours of continuous
light on battery power the light bar
itself is made of a chemically resistant
Scytale glass filled nylon that means
that you can spray it off with common
chemicals the shape of the light itself
was actually designed to prevent it from
rolling away if you dropped it or set it
on the hood of a car
with its ip66 rating you can take it
outside and not worry if it gets rained
up we know that you were going to toss
around the life on so we overmolded it
in key areas with the technology called
versa flex to be shock absorbent
now we're closer than ever to making the
big-ass light bar in reality we need
your help for the final stage though
production if your assistance will be
able to begin manufacturing and start
shipping the light bar to all
contractors first responders soldiers
police officers and anyone else who
demands a product that they can take to
hell and back in return you'll be the
first customers to receive the
revolutionary big-ass light bar this has
been a passionate project for me it's
something that I've worked on for years
and I'm very proud of what we've come up
with it is absolutely the best handheld
area light in the world bar none
hey we're thirty minutes late sorry it's
not like I'm a master at ironing what's
the big deal
get a flipper what a flipper time is the
most valuable thing we have going to the
cleaners or ironing your shirts on your
own takes a really long time I found
iron is difficult after looking at
product in the store I had the idea of
creating revolutionary 360 degree
flipping available we've shortened the
ironing time from eight minutes to two
minutes by eliminating the unnecessary
steps of traditional ironing we've
completely redesigned the board to the
modern consumer featuring pen clicks
sleeve detail board and many other
remarkable features and benefits for the
very first time since the 1800s the
ironing board has been completely
redesigned with a human being in mind he
is both side iron both contoured like
human body we need to secure enough
demand to ensure that we can bring this
innovative product to market in time for
the holiday season with your backing and
your support we'll be able to make this
dream a reality and bring the flipper to
the masses worldwide
you
what if you could connect to any device
with a single cable are you ready for
ten times more speed and a two times
more powerful cable introducing net need
of crafted with the highest quality
materials including rare earth neodymium
magnets 18 karat gold plated connectors
shielded with aerospace aluminum
combining the latest advanced circuitry
technology for smarter and safer
charging on both ends the world's first
groundbreaking patent-pending reversible
cross device USB 3.0 magnetic cable
featuring 10 times faster data transfer
speed and a 2 times more powerful cable
compared to a traditional USB 2.0 cable
by harnessing the force of nature
you can effortlessly insert the magnetic
tip to both ends of the device and the
magneto cable immediately magnetizes and
snaps to the devices the breakthrough
concept of the both end magnetic
connector cable successfully opens the
door to multi device connectivity for
SuperSpeed charging and data sync
meaning you can cross connect almost any
device between USB lightning Android
type C mini USB and beyond
Magneto was born out of the creators
frustration with our daily lives caused
by all the different types of devices we
first created a prototype by putting
some existing product components
together and we spent months with
countless hours to complete the design
we knew this was going to be a great
product that we got to share with the
world to reinvent a new standard of USB
cables we have accomplished the most
sophisticated tests compiled
with the highest quality materials to
design a state-of-the-art USB cable
our team has chosen the largest
manufacturer that's made over a hundred
million electronic devices for many of
the top brands to build this awesome
design and we're ready to go we need
your support for our campaign to help us
bring this super charging cable to the
market be part of us as contributors you
are welcome to write us with a new
suggestion or new ideas for further
improvement of magneto within the period
of the campaign magneto is the world's
most powerful magnetic USB cable for
everything
you
introducing the air lever from barfly
the air lever is a two-in-one tool
combining two things you will always
need you will always need a tire lever
and a co2 inflator it weighs less than
40 grams it's also beautifully designed
it works great as a tire lever for
removing and installing any tire the co2
inflator is simple and compact it fits
both Presta and Schrader valve stems

successful products you may know barfly
from our first product in 2012 it was
the very first out front mount for your
Garmin cycling computer we're here on
Kickstarter asking for your help with
the air lab order yours now to be a part
of bringing our newest product to market
once we've reached our funding goal we
expect to be shipping air levers in
early 2017
