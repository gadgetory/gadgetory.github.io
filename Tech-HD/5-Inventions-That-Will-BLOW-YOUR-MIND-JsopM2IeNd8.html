150 other countries the idea was born
out of the everyday struggle of people
on the go every time I go on holiday I
want to focus on what to wear but I also
have to carry around a lot of devices
that I don't want to think about but I
can't live without or when I am on an
important business trip abroad and I
want less luggage but I need my smart
gadgets all these devices require many
chargers that take up half of my space
and don't forget the countless number of
adapters around the world yeah I always
get those confused and there are never
enough outlets in hotel rooms to charge
all my devices at once that never
happens anymore because we have charges

ports to make it the most convenient

bank that charges my phone up to three
times and has a USB port for any other
device it's been a great journey so far

into an awesome compact design we built
the PCB and model the design then we 3d
printed and tested some more this led to
the final working prototype that we sent
out to ten people to test for two weeks
we got their feedback and now we are
ready to go into mass production I love
to travel the world but I always find
difficulties in the outlet standards of
each new country now I visit yeah I
found charges and solve that problem
forever I mean it is so compact and
handy I've taken everywhere with me my
wife and I used to argue over who is
going to use the phone charger every
night yeah the chargers solve that
problem with its dual charging station
and we don't argue anymore forget the
old chargers go char just like us now on
