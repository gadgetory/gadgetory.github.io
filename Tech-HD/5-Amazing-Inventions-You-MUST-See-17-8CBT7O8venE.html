blogger when I travel I like keep things

with videos music applications and games
things add up quickly and unfortunately
storage costs money that's not all I
have to sort out the contents use iTunes
backup sit for hours and hope it doesn't
stop iodine is a simple solution that
adds extra storage to my phone
magnetically snap it on the back of the
case and twist 15 degrees lock it
awesome let's see what I can do with
iodine for the whole day 10 am Times
Square is full of excitement look at all
these mascots and tourists taking
pictures everyone is taking pictures it
feels like a competition 2pm got in the

it's that easy it also comes with the
lightning holder which I can stick to
the bottom of my phone I totally forgot
about my girlfriend gotta go
this is my girlfriend Sarah hey what did
you do today
so do more without
this is a story about life about all our
lives everything began with just an idea
the idea to convert cemeteries into
forests then that idea became the BIOS
earn a biodegradable urn designed to
convert you into a tree afterlife and
now we want to present a new product
that will help us bring the BIOS earn
two more people creating a meaningful
experience for us and the environment
BIOS in cube is the world's first
incubator designed for the afterlife the
BIOS in cube lets you plant your BIOS
earn while also tracking and watering
your tree using a custom sensor the BIOS
in cube watches for moisture ground
temperature electrical conductivity and
more then the algorithm combines all the
data it receives to understand the
specific needs of your tree when
watering is needed the built-in
irrigation system conducts water from
the tank to the seed distributing the
water homogeneously around the seed
while also preventing over watering and
under watering the sensor also checks
for environmental humidity temperature
and solar irradiance with this
information the BIOS in cube will notify
you if the temperature of your place is
not appropriate or if your tree needs
more sunlight during the entire process
your tree will be growing close to you
somewhere where you'll be able to see it
touch it and enjoy the real experience
of the afterlife the BIOS in cube also
connects you to our in cube centers
incubator spaces where if you want to we
will incubate your tree for you here at
BIOS earn we've been heads down for
quite a while now building this product
we're a team of designers engineers and
operation experts who've been working on
the BIOS in cube for a whole year when
designing the BIOS in cube we wanted to
create something that would fit in any
space
an object with a seamless and adaptable
design that serves any environment it is
placed in since the beginning we've
asked ourselves who's going to use the
bios ncube what kind of emotions do we
want to create so the experience is
driving the product the technology just
enables it everything in the bios in
cube has been designed to work by itself
over the past few years we've been lucky
enough to connect with a community of
people who have used the bios earn we
spent over a year designing and
developing the bios in cube and now we
need your support to cover tooling and
manufacturing costs so we can bring bios
in cube to the market we think death is
a transformation and a return to life
through nature with bios and cube we can
move a step forward in our quest to
prove that there's life after life so
join us
you
today to make a professional film we
need lighting cameras and sound
equipment that would make us think it's
impossible to do at home but what is
actually holding us back the cell phone
cameras that we have keep getting better
what's the problem the microphones stay
exactly the same to solve this problem
we've created the solo cab an HD
microphone that connects to your phone
via bluetooth bill to match the quality
of sound to the quality of video the
solo cam can not only connect to a cell
phone but also to a camera or GoPro the
180 degree pan is possible as a result
of an advanced axle and lets you film
without shaking the camera and getting a
much more stable image we also have a
natural hold handle to allow you to
stable esupport the camera or cell phone
to film for long periods of time finally
we have a smart app with a karaoke
station teleprompter filters and much
more with these options you can
customize the solo camp to film wherever
and however you want if you're a
journalist move faster to catch your
story and stream it live if you're an
aspiring artist or karaoke lover record
your song and directly upload the video
to share your creation with the world
and if you're taking videos of your
family you can catch voices and sounds
without interference we have a great
team of designers and engineers who have
been working for months to make sure
that the microphone provides top sound
quality that the handle is comfortable
and that the stick can stable support
the phone or camera for as long as you
want to film we need a microphone that
is as useful flexible and versatile as
the cell phone and we believe the solo
cam is that solution
you
we think learning should be as exciting
as games are now so we've come up with
something really awesome a t-shirt but
it's more than that it's the ultimate
way to learn about the body we call it
the virtuality it's super simple load
the app and point your device appetit
sure to reveal a realistic animation of
the internal anatomy it's a fascinating
and unique way to see all the major
organs tapping on specific areas allow
you to dive in and explore from the
inside but we think it's an opportunity
to go a step further imagine you could
show the benefits of exercise by
visualizing how it affects the heart
imagine you could show the benefits of
diet by seeing how the body digests food
help us exceed our goal so we can make
all of this possible for everyone we've
designed the app for curious minds of
all ages but kids love it that's the
heart those are the two young it's an
experience you can enjoy together at
home or in the classroom but it also
works on your own too it has a selfie
mode and it works in the mirror but for
a truly mind-blowing experience combined
your phone with the virtual reality
headset it's a little like the Magic
School Bus is diving aside to feel like
you're really there we've been crafting
experiences for kids the last ten years
we know how to get kids excited about
learning and we're working closely the
schools and institutions to ensure the
content has a real impact we think kids
should grow up having the freedom to
explore the widest range of subjects so
they can find out what it is they love
that passion will drive their careers
which is why we found it curious cope so
that young minds are inspired to explore
and learn through adventure and play
let's turn our tech into something
really valuable
