excited to show you revolve automated
motion a versatile portable and
affordable motion control system that
can have precise motorized control to
your calendars
you
motion control systems can add dynamic
automated movement to your time-lapse
and live video shots but these systems
underarm is bulky complicated and can
cost thousands of dollars so I spent the
last eight months designing a versatile
easy-to-use an incredibly affordable
motion control system that can help you
create amazing time-lapse and stunning
video footage revolve automated motion
is a complete motion control kit that
will work with the revolve camera dolly
or with any camera slider on the market
the kit installs in seconds and is
really simple to use you control the
speed with a turn of a single note and
change direction with the flip of a
switch once you set up your shot you can
sit back and watch the RAM system work
its magic
when paired with a slider or with the
revolved Ollie rail system you can
perform dynamic linear tracking inclined
or even vertical camera moves
when paired with the revolt dolly the
system can travel across any smooth flat
surface and is not limited by the length
of the slider or track
it can also capture stunning curved
panoramic or circular movement
by simply switching out the motor the
system can be set up to capture
live-action video with motorized control
you can be sure that your camera moves
will be ultra smooth for every time
the revolve automated motion system is a
lot of fun to use and is a valuable tool
for capturing amazing time-lapse shots
an incredibly smooth video footage the
design phase is complete and I'm really
happy with the way the system
performance but now I need your help a
starter in order to be manufacturing
minimum for the first production run by
pleasure today you can pre-order the
revolve automated motion system so
pledge now to please share this video
with your friends and family I thank you
for your time to support and together
let's make this product a reality
hi my name's Steve I'm Greg I'm Chris I
works out introduce you to the new
Radian
introducing rate and iPhone and Android
enabled device that moves and controls
your camera and allows anyone to take a
still or motion time from simple to
multi axis shots Radian is designed to
make time-lapse
easy Radian is wirelessly programmed
from your smartphone using Bluetooth and
controls your camera via USB or trigger
port once your time-lapse is running the
Radian half keeps track of how it's
going for you and if you are using USB
control you can get image thumbnails
from your time-lapse on your phone and
even adjust your shutter speed aperture
and ISO all completely wireless in
addition to making basic timelapse of
breeds Radian also has advanced features
such as speed ramping which changes the
speed of motion during your time-lapse
and full ramp which allows you to
capture scenes with changing life such
as sunrises or sunsets we are also
excited to release our new linear
capture which allows reading to control
your camera for sliding time lapses as
well from talking to retired foods we
found that they use a variety of sliders
for different purposes so instead of
creating a single slider that ranking
works with designed an attachment and an
interface that allows ready to drive
whichever slider works best for you
we've designed the slider system to be
fast to assemble so the transportation
is easy and you can spend less time
setting up your shot to use your rating
to drive your slider just add the gear
onto the base place your rating into the
carriage to engage the belt drive and
lock it down
then set the distance you want your
camera to move and your time-lapse
settings and press Start radium will
then drive your camera along the slider
stopping to take photos along the way
radians new Bluetooth capabilities allow
you to program up to three synchronized
radians at once meaning you can easily
add additional radians for more creative
shots and still have the ability to just
take one if you're trying to go light as
photographers we wanted to create a
device that would allow anyone to take
stunning motion time-lapse footage
regardless of their back so we launched
the first Radian here on Kickstarter we
were amazed at what people created and
we're inspired by our backers creativity
and by the hundreds of people who took
their first time-lapse with rady the
support of this community allowed us to
take the first Radian from a prototype
in our garage and turn it into an actual
product since then we've taken your
feedback and we've spent the last year
getting the new Radian to where it is
today now we're back on Kickstarter to
ask for your support on this project and
we hope you'll join us in making
time-lapse even more fun and accessible
for all photographers

B works v is a camera stabilizer that
enables you to get steady and dynamic
shots from new perspectives the clean
design is as functional as it is
beautiful there are no dangling cables
and it works well for more formal events
like weddings the B works v stand can
sit on a table can be mounted on any
smooth surface with suction cups or it
can be attached to a tripod or see Stan
you
tire B works five system including the
stand
can fit in a single carry-on case for
the past year we have produced the
control boards used in some of the
industry's top gimble's our seattle
manufacturers have been an integral part
of our team in the beginning our primary
machine shop was one of Boeing suppliers
of the year they built our prototype and
working with them has enabled us to
drive down cost and have confidence that
we can build the B works v at scale our
vision for B works is to use the latest
technologies to make creative tools for
artists our experiences and business
engineering software and the arts give
us a unique perspective on product
design we truly appreciate your support
in helping us achieve this vision the
money you contribute will pay for
tooling and will get us to economies of
scale we need to make the V Werks v a
viable product this is just the
beginning

and I cam design we specialize in
advanced camera gear since 2008 we've
been developing and manufacturing a
series of professional camera equipment
for decades photographers have insisted
on using the old neck strap to carry
their cameras they're reluctant to use a
holster despite of the pain and
discomfort it causes we believe holsters
are the best way to prevent pain but it
isn't complete without full safety
features integrated this is the click
the first camera holster that is
designed with safety as the number one
priority it works swiftly in tandem with
your neck strap providing you with
comfort convenience and peace of mind
the click comes with a single hand
release trigger that allows you to take
a photo in less than one second and
you'll be able to holster your camera
back easily safety comfort and
convenience
click changes the way a camera should be
carried in over just a year our parent
company turbo ace has launched three
successful Kickstarter campaigns and we
want to take a moment to thank our
backers because without them none of
this would be possible there are two
things that I really love about the new
click number one is that I'm able to
remove the pressure in the weight of
carrying a camera on my neck all day and
shift that to my hip it's very
comfortable you almost don't even notice
that you have a camera with you the
second thing that I love about it is I
do a lot of Shore shooting where I might
be standing in the waves with a tripod
and I need to make an adjustment but I
have to take my camera off my tripod and
there's nowhere to set it down because
it's wet sandy I don't want to put it on
a strap because they'd be hanging in the
waves now I can just throw it on my hip
make the changes on the tripod and then
get back into the action very quickly
something that I use in my regular
shooting
