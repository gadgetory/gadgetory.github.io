lives
while some measured time achievements
and bank account growth we measure well
everything else hi we are data probe a
veteran owned small business based out
of Colorado and we know how important
measurement is for you your business and
your family that is why we designs the
data Pro 25 a bluetooth-enabled smart
tape measure the data Pro 25 gives you a
precise digital readout of your
measurement allows you to share your
measurement with your entire
construction team or just with your
partner in addition we have designed two
apps to give you everything you need to
save time prevent mistakes and open a
world of opportunity to get more value
from your measurements this is how it
works by pressing the Wi-Fi button on
your tape measure the measurement gets
sent to your mobile device the transmit
button transfers your measurements into
a spreadsheet app you can transmit
multiple measurements and then share
entire cut lists with your team or
project collaborators and our photo
dimension app allows you to touch two
points on an image and when you take a
measurement with the data Pro 25 the
length will appear as a dimension on the
image from construction to engineering
to small craft businesses the data Pro
25 makes measurements more reliable more
useful and more exciting but to make
this happen we need your help
we need to raise 25 thousand dollars to
meet our margins and distribution we ask
that you take a minute to contribute to
our campaign share it with your friends
and family or tell us how you would use
the data Pro measure in your home or
business thank you
