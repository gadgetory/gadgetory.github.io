and to enable us to deliver the light
saber max as soon as possible with your
help we can take portable power to a
whole new level
you
are you into sports yeah I really like
inline it you know wingding hair my
favorite song the freedom
well except for those heavy shoes I've
got a hole in my backpack
and what about hiking sure I love hiking
being out in nature is where I can
unwind and get new ideas it's just
really a drag lugging around those heavy
boots all day then why don't you use
Skinner's water Skinner's Skinner's the
most ultra portable Footwear in the
world also I mean they're like super
cool
Skinner's are light yet very durable
they fit into your pocket don't slip and
have a cooling effect and best of all
seriously yep you can throw them in the
washer
scanners were designed to be won
anywhere anytime like at our wedding
okay well almost any time if you're
tired of carrying an extra pair of shoes
with you all the time
try Skinner's they're lightweight
portable comfort simply put its Footwear
tuned to perfection I get it so I can
have Skinner's with me all the time like
when we take a trip to Japan again
exactly that's right you can date them
pretty much anywhere hi Kickstarter I'm
Peter and here at Skinner's we spend the
last 18 months developing a better
alternative to your heavy clunky
Footwear many of us were winning travel
or exercise well we found an easier way
both for you and your feet our
patent-pending technology says goodbye
to gluten themes that could fall apart
over time scanners are manufactured in
Europe using the finest Swedish
materials with a dual coding of extra
durable anti abrasive polymer and we've
tested them all over the world in all
kinds of conditions to make sure they
can keep up with you wherever you go
we even have guys running marathons in
them long story short very excited with
how Skinner's turned out and the way
they feel and protect your feet and
people are surprised to see how
something so simple can be so durable
the next step is to give more people the
chance to experience Skinner's for
themselves and to do that we need your
help
simply put Skinner's are designed to be
small too functional as you are
you
if you're like me you love escaping into
the outdoors on camping and backpacking
adventures but a problem we face again
and again is that each trip calls for a
specific tent an ultralight shelter when
it's just me two-person tent when the
body type is long and something bigger
for a group a cotopaxi we set out to
solve this problem we're introducing the
new NT to tent system offering you one
streamlined setup that adapts to your
specific needs our system is made up of
a two-person standalone ten it's rain
fly and a snap-in
alcove that seamlessly integrates with
the tent
the in-situ itself sleeps two pictures a
double wall construction and using just
three holes for super Dickman setup it
has just the right blend of features or
lightweight backpacking or camping
adventures a simple lightweight body who
looks perfect for one or two person
backpacking
and the included rain fly with dual
integrated vestibules lets you batten
down the hatches when the weather turns
now to the alcove also known as the
tents guestroom it's a separate shelter
that seamlessly integrates with your ng
to effectively doubling the space with
two extra people or added gear many
other tent makers use some type of
vestibule or awning and claim it adds
living space but only ours features a
built in floor to create more space that
protects you from the ground up just
like the 10 on zone we alcoves single
pole setup and multiple stake out points
means it serves as an ultra light and
minimal two-person standalone cell phone
it can be set up in two separate
configurations lash it to a tree or a
larger opening or stake it down with
trekking poles with the nt2 tent system
we're filling the gap in the market our
system is made to adapt to any camping
situation three times in one spoon line
from the initial concept of final design
into 2/10 system is something that super
excited tens continue to get lighter and
will technical the overall design hasn't
really changed until now our system
solved the problem and we know it will
help eliminate your 10th conundrums to
making your time in the outdoors much
more fun and hassle-free
but the final step of our journey in
getting the first batch of NT 2/10
systems produced and out to market
involves you join our campaign and get
your indie to in time to enjoy the
summer camping season thanks for
watching and for your support of
everything we're doing to court
this is a 200 liters about 50 gallon
sized nylon bag that I'm going to fill
with air with just one breath
this is called the Bernoulli effect
watch what we made up
you
backpacking is adventure it's a journey
through the wilderness saying beautiful
sites and carrying everything you need
to survive in your pack if I can pick
the two most important things about my
gear they would be make it lightweight
and make it reliable
a Kickstarter's my name is Kevin and I'm
introducing the vertex ultralight
backpacking stone this stove has a
patent-pending curved construction that
provides incredible strength while only
weighing 1.8 ounces light enough that
you won't even notice it in your pack
the unique design packs completely flat
and the flexible pieces assemble in
seconds with no tools it has no moving
parts valves bow rings or seals that can
wear out
the stove uses solid fuel tablets that
burn at 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit and
only weigh 14 grams each the curved
sides of the stove shield the burning
tablet from wind and also serve as a pot
stand for added versatility the stove is
also designed to support the Trangia
alcohol burner that is popular with many
minimalist backpackers and uses
denatured alcohol fuel that can be
purchased at any hardware store I've
tested several rounds of prototypes and
fine-tuned the design now I need your
help to take this project to the next
level if you appreciate the simplicity
of ultralight backpacking I hope you'll
consider supporting me on Kickstarter
