fitness I don't always have to worry
about making sure I go on and walk with
Lou every day sometimes it's just so
hard to get there when I have an eight
hour day and then I come home and I just
don't have any energy but when I put

what makes a smart security camera truly
intelligent and how does the ability to
differentiate between objects animals
and people bring us closer to that peace
of mind we all desire when buying a
smart security camera you want to make
sure that wherever you are your home is
always in good hands but smart security
cameras are either overly complicated
unreliable expensive or all of the above
so one year ago
to change all that hi my name is Daniel
I'm co-founder and VP of engineering at
iCloud and this is what we've been
working on driven by Intel Nvidia
12-core vpu iCloud cam is the first
battery-powered security camera to run
an embedded neural network
for efficient power consumption the
camera uses one core while the other
ones are waiting to be wakened by an
event when iCloud cam sees an unknown
person it starts recording and sends a
notification containing the images of
the event along with the option to
trigger an acoustic alarm I cloud cam
captures and encrypts crisp HD videos
day and night and works on hardcore
rechargeable batteries that last up to
six months
truly wireless and cordless it can be
placed anywhere inside or outside
keeping your surroundings cable free and
safe
have been hanging off a metallic object
or simply place it on a flat surface
plug and play if you will except there's
nothing to plot essential to our
innovation was our experience working on
Intel's NVIDIA CPU as well as our
know-how in computer vision image
sensors and AI algorithms we use machine
learning to feed the camera countless
scenarios to ensure the least amount of
false alarms possible we created an
all-in-one smart security camera that
delivers real-time person and face
detection that is truly wireless and
affordable and now the reason we are
here setting high goals calls for big
investments we are finally ready to make
this fantastic product a reality all
your contributions will go into
fine-tuning and manufacturing as we move
on from prototyping into mass production
this is the first big step for iCloud be
part of this journey to the smart home
of the future thank you
