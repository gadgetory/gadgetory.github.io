hi I'm Ryan and I'm Valerie thanks for
checking out
Lubitz we all love our shoes but don't
the laces present some challenges
there's the time the squeezing the
floppy bows becoming undone
the double nodding
and the untying to get them off
well with your support we think Zubat
can help zooids are small yet powerful
magnetic fits that you attach to your
own shoelaces making your shoes very
easy to put on so how do you really want
to put your shoes on wouldnt it be great
if there were no laces at all I mean
nothing to get in the way well this is
what zubats are like when separated
Zubat Salima Nate three rows of laces so
there is a huge mouth opening to easily
slide in
then just connect the magnets
and that's it
now go for a run
go to the playground
go to the gym
play some basketball
Zubaz hold securely for most
recreational activities
but two bits are not just for athletic
sneakers they're for your everyday
casual shoes with soup it's you have a
clean looking shoe no ugly bows and
they'll never come undone
and how do you really want to take your
shoes off let's face it
most of us do what we are not supposed
to do we step on our heel and squeeze
out of our shoes this wears down the
yield and leaves you with a knot to
untie later but with zoobooks stepping
out of your shoes becomes the right way
to do it the magnets will split as you
step out and now your shoe is open and
ready for the next time you want to slip
in two bits are not ordinary magnets
they've been specially engineered to
concentrate the magnetic forces toward
the face of the magnets this gives them
incredible holding forces in a small
size this also means there's almost no
magnetism on the outside of the zoo bits
where you don't want
every single day on this planet sound is
injured or killed by a landmine removing
them is very time-consuming and
dangerous millions of landmines
leathered landscapes of the world turn
countries around the world
my name is Massoud asani and I want to
change this our mission is to solve the
landmine problems within 10 years in
2012 we have launched our first
Kickstarter campaign it is called the
mine kafon
a low-cost wind power and the landmine
detonator it rolls along on a desert
when it hits a landmine it blows itself
up and it storage the landmine at the
same time after three years of hard work
we brought our mission to the next level
now we are very excited to introduce you
our newest robotic invention the manga
pondrom it is an airborne de mining
system which aims to reduce landmines in
less than 10 years globally mine kafon
drone flies above a dangerous area it
generates a 3d map done at the text land
mines with a metal detector and GPS
coordinates the drone has a robotic arm
which places detonators on top of a
landmine and blows them up from a safe
distance these three methodologies
combined makes the mine kafon drones up
to 20 times faster than the traditional
technologies at the saver and up to 200
times cheaper imagine every could fly
with hundred of mine kafon drones all
over the affected landscapes worldwide
and freed the world from landmines
now it's our final goal to bring the
microphone drones to a pilot in order to
be able to test them on different
environments and weather conditions this
is needed to prove and show to the
remaining organizations that the man
control is faster cheaper and safer than
the existing technologies with such a
disruptive approach we could save
thousands of lives
we need your support to make this happen
please join our campaign and let's have
a landmine
free world because one less landmine
means one safe life you're looking
forward to collaborate with you on this
project
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
