ovo one key for all
for many years DJ's have only had one
option wired headphones but why haven't
they cut the wire
when I'm DJing and I have my headphones
around my neck
you're always wired you know to your to
your mixer obviously and it's a big
disadvantage of having the space and the
freedom to jump around it to play with
the crowd because there's been no way
for them to bridge the gap between
wireless headphones and their DJ Mix's
consumer bluetooth transmitters have
latency issues when playing back their
audio signal which is why by default DJs
and recording artists have completely
written off going Wireless so where does
ether come into the picture
our story begins less than a year ago
when it was brought to my attention how
cool it would be to DJ using wireless
headphones at a latency rate that's
unperceivable to the human ear it was at
that exact point in time when I dropped
everything I was doing and made it my
goal to bring this project to life after
finding the right team research and
development and tons of testing on
existing transmitters we found out that
the A to D converters and standard
Bluetooth ships just can't convert audio
signal fast enough I currently perform
with wireless headphones but it's a huge
pack I've got a box I got a plug into my
booth I've got a hip pack that I've got
to carry around on my belt sometimes the
cords get stuck when I'm sitting and
then they get ripped out and it's pretty
embarrassing when that happens live so
you can imagine the heartache the
headache the struggle that this would
save so how does the ether transmitter
work very simple choose any Bluetooth
wireless headphone pair it to the ether
transmitter plug your transmitter into
any DJ mixer or headphone preamp turn up
the volume and you're good to go almost
a year later and we're a little short of
funding to finalizing the ether
transmitter and we need your support
we're offering some pretty cool perks so
let's cut the crap
cut the cords and let's bring the ether
transmitter to life
