ovo one key for all do you feel tied up
with a bunch of big keys all day your
car opens four doors so why do you need
all of these to open everything else ho

can change the combination to give it
maximum reusability it has all the
applications of a typical one-to-one
lock but with greater flexibility
the ovo pair lock has six main features
easy-to-manage it has all the
applications you're used to with the
standard
new tenant same luck
for anyone renting or sharing their
space the hassle of changing locks is
gone
multi-layer management one incredible
feature is that any communal space you
can imagine can now be accessed by
multiple people by having some digits of
their past codes in common this leaves a
room for individuality in each key for
areas that aren't shared lost key be
your own locksmith if a key is lost
there's no longer a need to call a
locksmith or replace existing locks you

standard four-digit combination each
order will include a custom cylinder
that's unique to your parallel this
digit wheel upgrade will make any
passcode exponentially harder to guess
remotely unlocking the pair lock perhaps
the most convenient feature is the
ability to share your key with friends
allowing access is simply a text or
phone Paula way pass codes can easily be
reset if sharing temporarily
now we need your help the cylinders and
various lock applications are fully
developed for production and marketing
we need you to be part of our team
thanks for your support
ovo one key for all
for many years DJ's have only had one
option wired headphones but why haven't
they cut the wire
when I'm DJing and I have my headphones
around my neck
you're always wired you know to your to
your mixer obviously and it's a big
disadvantage of having the space and the
freedom to jump around it to play with
the crowd because there's been no way
for them to bridge the gap between
wireless headphones and their DJ Mix's
consumer bluetooth transmitters have
latency issues when playing back their
audio signal which is why by default DJs
and recording artists have completely
written off going Wireless so where does
ether come into the picture
our story begins less than a year ago
when it was brought to my attention how
cool it would be to DJ using wireless
headphones at a latency rate that's
unperceivable to the human ear it was at
that exact point in time when I dropped
everything I was doing and made it my
goal to bring this project to life after
finding the right team research and
development and tons of testing on
existing transmitters we found out that
the A to D converters and standard
Bluetooth ships just can't convert audio
signal fast enough I currently perform
with wireless headphones but it's a huge
pack I've got a box I got a plug into my
booth I've got a hip pack that I've got
to carry around on my belt sometimes the
cords get stuck when I'm sitting and
then they get ripped out and it's pretty
embarrassing when that happens live so
you can imagine the heartache the
headache the struggle that this would
save so how does the ether transmitter
work very simple choose any Bluetooth
wireless headphone pair it to the ether
transmitter plug your transmitter into
any DJ mixer or headphone preamp turn up
the volume and you're good to go almost
a year later and we're a little short of
funding to finalizing the ether
transmitter and we need your support
we're offering some pretty cool perks so
let's cut the crap
cut the cords and let's bring the ether
transmitter to life
