momentum when you're on the move you
need power the moves with you we've made
layer for this purpose it's a Bluetooth
enabled laptop sleeve which can charge
your laptop PC or Mac the smartphone and
tablet simultaneously wherever you are
it has wireless charging tracking with
tracker and USB C so instead of having
to pack chargers adapters and power
banks you just ring LAN I'm charging
your devices at night you can charge all
of them by layer from just one socket so
when you're heading out you just grab
Blair with your devices already inside
and charge along with it both in battery
and if you're traveling it may be the
only thing you need as it has adapters
for every country Blair isn't just a
battery it's a solution which allows you
to keep momentum throughout your day and
stay in charge I used to travel a lot
for work and I was always in need of a
product like Blair power banks are great
for quick phone charges but it wasn't a
solution for all of my devices in the
end it was just another thing I had to
worry about so I brought a team together
to find a solution with the years of
experience in technology and product
design
there was the end result and it's the
first of its kind we also wanted to
create something that would look
beautiful and would stand up from the
average laptops leave the closure system
we design allowed us to keep the sleeve
as compact as possible expanding only
when you need to the battery can be
changed or replaced we wanted that to
expand the lifespan of the product and
we include international adapters so you
can use the product anywhere we're using
a composite material specifically
designed for layer which provides
durability cushioning and protection
from scratches
it was important our product answered
all functionality our users would need
charging all devices not just some it
has DC charging for PCs and Macs along
with USB C for newer laptops and phones
for everything else we've included a USB
port with quick Charlet anyone can work
layer with our easy to use app and
you'll never lose it because it's
trackable we're a small team but we have
a great history of bringing the impalas
to market we built our prototype and now
we need fundings to scale a manufacture
the product we're really proud of their
the quality and the solution of provides
and we can wait to get it in your hand
you

hi I'm Ted and I'm Davey we're the
creators of Flash's thanks for making
our products a viral hit it seems like
you spread it all over the internet and
you really really want it flash has
started off as a Halloween project when
I saw Davey working with these tiny
little LEDs and I thought how can I make
them into something fun so I asked Davey
can we make them into eyelashes no we
should try it so we did it and the first
iteration was just simple on and off the
second iteration we thought why not make
it a little bit more fun so what if that
some more interactivity so we had a
motion controller and the LEDs
individually addressable and so you've
seen some of the patterns that you that
we have let's look at some of the
interactions you can till your head like
this you can balance or dance or you can
just simply turn your head it's a fun
project and we're hoping that you guys
really really want it and like it so
please support our Kickstarter thank you
thank you
hey Kickstarter I'm Tom this is Dan and
we made a notebook for your desk
it's called panel book it all started
with an insight about how we use
notebooks even though we spend eight
hours a day doing digital work on a
computer notebooks are an essential
analog tool we really wanted a notebook
that could sit directly in front of us
but that would require a different type
of notebook one with more of a panoramic
ratio so that's what we made and using a
prototype of the pen a book we realized
that unique format opened up some
interesting creative possibilities and
landscape it is fantastic for things
like UI flows
storyboards weekly calendars Gantt
charts comic strips level design bullet
journals etc open up the notebook fully
to get an even wider view rotated 90
degrees and you've got a mini legal pad
great for making lists note-taking web
page layout giraffe doodles and more
every page has a subtle dot grid with a
twist we've included guide markers that
make it easy to quickly draw three
rectangles sized ideally for smartphone
UI design or storyboarding we also
include edge guides to divide up the
page and provide layout cues the guides
virtually disappear if you're not
looking for them but are very useful
when you need them the paper and panel
book is super high quality and performs
well with a variety of writing
instruments the front and back covers
are rigid with an amazing soft touch
feel it's all bound together with a wire
opening which allows the notebook to sit
flat when open we think you'll
appreciate all the little details
lastly the panel book was designed to be
kept it comes with a slip case which is
meant to be the final resting place for
your notebook you can add a label to
keep things organized and when several
are lined up on a shelf it looks awesome
we're on Kickstarter because we need
your help we need to gather enough
pre-orders to make it cost-effective to
have these printed and bound in the
United States you can back for just a
single notebook or a multipack if you
want to a stockpile and save a few bucks
so please hit the green button to back
the project and help bring pana book
into existence thanks for watching and
have a great day
this is the zip chip and it's the new
way to play from the way it's thrown to
the way it flies the zip chip is unlike
anything else seen before it can fly
both long and short distances topping
out over 200 feet
we handcrafted dozens of prototypes
until we perfected the now
patent-pending design with your support
the zip ship will be injection molded
here in Connecticut and will zip them
right out to you and the whole thing
fits in your pocket for fun anytime
anywhere please support us share this
page with everyone you know and help us
bring the zip chip to life Thanks
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
