hello my name is Brian Perla I'm a
student at stamp University and also the
founder and CEO a little elf little elf
is a patent-pending device which is the
most efficient safe and easy device for
cutting wrapping paper holidays and
other gift-giving occasions are
stressful enough but with little elf
wrapping presents can now be
headache-free the outdated way of
cutting wrapping paper has never worked
because the slice is always either
jagged ripped or crooked and that's
frustrating it's a waste of paper and
your time now you've tried blades or
knives or sharper scissors but the
question is are those safe and it's just
not worth putting your own or your
children's safety at risk during the
holidays the thing people have least of
is time so why do we continue to spend
hours upon hours fussing with dull
scissors or unsafe blades trying to
convince ourselves that these are
effective tools for cutting wrapping
paper little elf is the answer little
elves patent-pending design ensures that
every cut is straight clean fast and
safe two years of work have gone into
the product perfecting the blade angle
safety features and its simplicity
here's how it works first slide the
little elf over the wrapping paper the
device is flexible so it can be used on
any size roll next pull a sheet of paper
through the larger slot in the device
once the sheet of paper is the desired
length slide the little off back to the
end of the roll allowing the paper to
drop into the slot where the blade is
embedded now just gently push a little
out forward and get a clean cut every
time
when you're done you can bring the
little elf back to the center of the
wrapping paper it doubles as an
organizer so your paper will never
unroll I'm asking for your help and
support as I bring this product to
market your generous donations and
pledges will allow me to produce a
product that will make the holidays less
stressful so we all can enjoy more
family and what matters most thank you
