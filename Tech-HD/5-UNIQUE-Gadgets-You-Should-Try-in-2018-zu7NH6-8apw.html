you
normally I'll be stressed with only two
minutes to leave for work especially if
I haven't brushed my teeth but I'm not
that's because I use whitewash developed
with dentists why brush is designed to
give a better clean life saving time
instead of brushing your teeth
individually like a regular toothbrush
the flexible and comfortable mouthpiece
can clean your teeth simultaneously and
in ten seconds only five seconds for the
top of your mouth and five for the
butter our mouthpiece is lined with fine
nylon bristles these provide the best
clean possible and remain today's best
choice the handle activates the bristles
with sonic vibrations replicating the
best method recommended by dentists made
with antibacterial food grade material
the mouthpiece is easy to clean just
rinse with water after use when you're
finished the white brush charging
stations stores your mouthpiece and
wirelessly recharges the humble want to
take a break and spend more time
outdoors no worries
why brush can go with you anywhere and
stay charged for up to a month you can
even share the handle with the whole
family fun right
Kevin time to brush your teeth
I better get going
by
cleanness I ever felt I feel like I
could never go back definitely worth
trying it's affordable for everybody's
household I thought it was the coolest
thing there was hey everybody my name is
James Amburgey I'm marketing director at
bio bidet at bio bidet we're really
focused on offering products that
enhance the beauty and function of your
home after the success of our first
Kickstarter campaign America proved that
it was ready to move towards a cleaner
healthier lifestyle
an alternative to toilet paper we got a
lot of feedback during that time and we
heard things like what if I don't have
an outlet in my bathroom or what about a
non electric version it's been eight
months and I'm excited to announce the
latest bio the day project introducing
the slim zero you get a lot of great
features with this product you get a
dual nozzle you get adjustable water
pressure soft closing seat soft closing
lid and best of all something that we've
newly developed a battery-operated
nightlight this is a product that speaks
for itself we hear all the time from new
customers I didn't know a product like
this exists or why don't I try this
sooner we wanted to design a product
that was for everyone for every home
simple easy to use with plenty of
features you don't need to call a
plumber you don't need to call an
electrician
15 minutes later with a quick easy DIY
install you're done so the great thing
about the slim zero and the dual nozzles
is that you get our effective posterior
wash and then you also have the option
for a softer front feminine wash one of
the things I'm most excited about with
this project is the high and low stage
nightlight you've got two different
brightnesses to choose from so it gives
you that additional flexibility for a
night time
don't have to worry about you know
having a bright light on or keeping your
partner up or keeping yourself up it
gives you options it gives you
flexibility it comes with everything you
need to get the product installed we've
got a user manual plus we have resources
like our service team is happy to help
if you call in or we also have videos
that you can watch complete installation
by Oba day is 10 years old and we've
been offering these products the entire
time so we're really interested when we
meet customers and they say things like
wow why didn't I try this sooner or
where have you been or I didn't know
about these products we've been doing
this a long time we've got a great team
here in Crystal Lake Illinois completely
dedicated to bringing these products to
people and making sure they can enjoy
them it's an exciting year here for us
and we're more excited than ever to show
the world why water does it better if
you're still flying a drone you are a
century behind this is the age of
tinkering and really just figuring out
what else there is to a drone
because the 21st century is not the age
of flying it's the age of experiments
but how do you experiment with drones
that are fragile expensive difficult to
reprogram and that's where we come in we
are engineers and researchers from the
Indian Institute of Technology working
on drones for the past eight years after
successfully launching our flagship
product Pluto we've now come up with a
comprehensive aerial robotics kit Pluto
X with this aerial robotics kit you get
an open source firmware free SDK
comprehensive frame design spare
propellers and a learning kit easy to
code crash resistant and affordable for
all your crazy experiments so don't just
get stuck to flying think of the Pluto X
as a buddy for the lazy ones a wild card
for the crazy ones a friend who's got
your back
a pet a companion musician maybe it
compensates for your hype and once in a
while for your lack of words fly it
build it crash it whatever you do just
be open to the experiment it is a very
useful platform it is going to play a
major role in revolutionising hands-on
aerial robotics by almost anyone
and the best part we have hundred Pluto
eggs gets ready to be shared and you are
capable of producing thousand more we've
already shipped out fifty of the Pluto
Lexus and five innovations have come out
of it
imagine if we were able to give out a
thousand boxes or a million that is
where we need your help we want to start
a chain reaction of innovations with the
community of tinkerers creators and
makers were open to experiment and have
the freedom to refine their own dreams
Pluto X the most agile and modular
aerial robotics kit
