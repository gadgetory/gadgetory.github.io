some years now I have a problem every
evening and sometimes several temps a
day I have to put my mobile devices on
charge and what is the most inconvenient
about it is that the battery goes out
when I have a huge necessity to is one
of them I think I'm not the only one who
get bothered by this problem I'm pretty
sure that every one of you got into the
situation when one of your gadgets ran
out of battery the moment you needed it
the most
you should not worry about this animal
because I got that solution the solution
is in Kent energy this is your device of
unlimited energy its unlimited because

need canned energy preserves energy
inside of itself that's why you can use
it anytime you need it and of course you
can charge your device during the
rotation of intelligent as well and
energy is very easy to use first you
need to rotate the ring and let it go
then just give the Dacian goal it may be
a surprise but the author wishes inside
the Kent energy device rotates with the
average speed of 5000 tons per minute
that's why your smartphone will be
charged by pent energy with the same
speed as you charge it from the clock
take the hand energy device with you of
the time and your energy will be safe no
matter where you are and what you do and
energy is indispensable for the people
living in the areas with limited access

the most effective energy generators and
what is more it looks nice you may
choose the hand energy device according
to your taste or style

have performed a huge amount of
experiments created a huge amount of
prototypes and now and energy is finally
done and ready for production and we
need your help
by the way and energy divided
synchronizes with an app where you can
observe your statistic and also achieve
particular goals win competitions and
get prizes before the gig starter
campaign we've made a tour around Europe

device to people let them take a close
look at it and use it to see what it's
like you may learn about the impression
regarding this experience by yourself

this is lock farm in 2014 1800
Kickstarter's help bring his product to
life today he's back to introduce not
one but two macro products the mission
stays the same transforming this to this
crafting solutions to keep your cables
neatly organized and tangle free first
up Marco 2.0 magnetic cable organizer
that keeps your cables neatly bundled
it's easy to use insert the cable
through the slits so that Marco stays
safely attached and secured next roll up
your cable and snap the magnetic ends of
the macro together and there you have it
the macro does so much more than
organize your cords with the use of
magnets you can also secure your earbud
cable on your shirt it ensures cords
will stay out of the way while you're in
the creative zone going for a morning
run or enjoying a coffee
use the magnetic points to dark Marco to
any ferrous metal surfaces you can duck
your belongings to the fridge so that
it's always in reach and ready to go
when you are for the new maco 2.0 we've
made several improvements it's more
streamlined as the magnets are now
enclosed inside the elastomer rubber
body the new material is both dust
resistant and water repellent
compared to the original macro the macro
2.0 is longer and it's filled with
stronger magnets making it simpler to
use in addition to Marco 2.0 we're also
excited to introduce the big makkal
suitable for larger cords big macro is
available in two types of materials the
durable elastomer rubber and the
two-tone premium leather the stay on
cable feature of big Marco differs from
the Michael the loop design allows the
big Marco to accommodate four cables
with a variety of thicknesses and all
kinds of connectors
rest assured big Marco still shares all
the same features as the macro 2.0 there
are endless applications for big Marco
for instance organize your guitar chords
for easy carrying a quick release it's a
handy travel buddy keep your luggage in
order and your electronic device is tidy
lastly for non-ferrous metal surfaces a
custom-designed platform can be used to
dock your cables platform incorporates a
removal and reusable micro suction tape
to allow for convenient relocation it is
taken two years to refine the design
through sketches 3d modeling prototypes
and testing
the design is ready for production your
support will help fund the tooling your
minimum order quantities required for
manufacturing we look forward to having
you join us on this next adventure thank
you from the team of Marco
you
for most of us there are countless times
in a single day where we feel nervous
anxious or not our best sometimes
even the subtlest moments can have our
body reacting with fight-or-flight and
we don't even realize that it's
happening
hi I'm Rowland and I'm Nathaniel and we
are the creators of leaf the leaf is a
smart patch that helps you control your
natural response to stress
using patent-pending biorhythm
technology Elite continuously monitors
your heart and breath in real-time when
the leaf notices you are imbalanced it
uses gentle vibrations to guide your
breathing this product is built on over
20 years of evidence-based research
heart rate variability biofeedback this
simple technique teaches you to reduce
your stress response by breathing in
tune with your heart's natural rhythm
our team has completely reimagined this
technique for the way that we live life
we provides my patients a tool they'll
actually use once they be in the office
they simply put it on their chest in the
morning and set it and forget it you can
have this perfect environment when
you're at home but when you leave the
house it's kind of like you're going
into battle with the world and you have
no idea what's going to be coming at you
bring in this little device it's
amplifying your body and empowering you
to then take action reset my and
feedback is basically the superpower
that allows you to control things about
your body that you thought were totally
unconscious think about training your
bicep at different times to create more
muscle you can train more resiliency
nervous system by doing this throughout
the day
unlike other wearables Leif uses a
medical-grade heart rate sensor that's
over 200 times more accurate than a
wrist worn heart rate longer we remove
the strap when with stickers so that you
don't feel restricted and you forget
you're even wearing it with up to seven
day battery life and continuous HIV
monitoring and training Leif is
listening to your art every day and
coaching and we've actually heard from
users that this is like meditation with
training wheels and we've gone through
many iterations to find the right
ergonomic shape they have flexible so
that when you put it on it fits any body
type we've tested leave with everyone
from high-powered CEOs to monks living
in the Himalayan mountains and for the
last two years we've been working
Sanford in UCSF clinicians to make a
tool that really works we're really
excited to get this into your hands our
early users love it and our
manufacturing supply chain is all set up
but we can't do without your support so
thank you for checking out our project
and backing us we can't wait for you to
experience lis
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
