hey I'm John Horvath and I'm the founder
of motives ever since I can remember me
and my friends I've been into action
sports and filming them
however I've recently come to the
realization that my friends make
terrible camera operators about ten
years ago action cams like the GoPro
came on the scene and this made shooting
action sports much easier
however the GoPros wide-angle lens is
optimized for shooting point of view
99.9% the professional content is shot
from a third-person perspective when you
turn the Gopher around film your friend
it really doesn't cut it
not only is Moses the world's most
advanced robot camera man notice also
functions as your personal coach whether
you're an amateur tennis player working
on your serve or an aspiring Pro BMX
rider perfecting a trick being able to
see yourself up close and in slow motion
it's the fastest route of improvement
we looking what we got oh man definitely
not enough extension I can go higher
than that
- alrighty well let's try that one more
time
boy
we I think that one was it check it out
boom that's it exactly what I wanted the
footage is stored on your front camera
roll so editing and sharing is a snap I
method motifs to film you like a
Hollywood movie centered and in focus
all of the time now we've been
developing motives for the last two and
a half years but now we need your help
to bring it to life I truly believe that
motifs will help athletes everywhere to
improve their games but also to make
better videos so please pre-order your
motives today and eradicate shaky point
of view once and for all
you
do you love the look of a freshly
painted wall ceiling or fence but avoid
painting because of those dreaded roll
the drips and splatters do you spend
more time going back and forth to the
paint tray or up and down the ladder
than actually painting then what you
really need is the all-new renovator
paint runner Pro the quick and easy
professional paint system that can
transform the look of an entire wall
ceiling or fence in just minutes
with no dripping and no constant
back-and-forth clips to the paint tray
it's easy just pouring your favorite
paint pop on the lid and roll the
perfect coat it's like having an entire
plan of paint in just one contact easy
to use innovative free roller and you
control how thick the paint is by how
hard you press so all you'll ever need
is just one coat imagine painting an
entire wall in just five minutes or an
entire room in just 20 use any old broom
handle too quickly paint an entire
ceiling without a single drip or
splatter save time and money on those
messy time-consuming drop sheets that
don't always catch the splattering paint
from old technology rollers the secret
behind this amazing new technology is in
the paint roller Crowes innovative
microfiber roller and patented
distribution system that releases the
paint in a perfect even flow with
machine life precision giving you the
perfect coat every single time again
with no dripping watch as the paint
roller Pro rolls a perfect even coat
over this delicate piece of wood then
without changing rollers or going back
for more paint we can go over to their
stucco to get another perfect even coach
even this concrete slab it gets right
into the grooves giving the perfect
coach even this rubber mat is no match
for the all new paint runner Pro look at
that for a perfect nice even coat it's
also great for touching up scuffs and
marks on walls and baseboards and
cleanup is as easy as rinsing under
attack

an ordinary roller

ah difficulty - sir I've enjoyed over
there we were looking at startup
business it was always just looking at
looking at how looking at the team first
looking at our resources and our skills
and the strengths that we bring in
together and then looking at you know
what can we do with this I get a text
from my buddy Nathan as they came in I
have an extra room in a house if you
started looking at all the unique places
I'm like yeah I don't want to start
looking so sure man I'll take it
the first day minam was when he walked
in to move in so he has never seen the
house - yeah so he started off with kind
of like who are you like why are you in
my house and I'm like hey man I'm your
new remaining me living with you we
looked at each other you know and I kind
of dropped my books a bit we lost eyes
and it was magical
yeah no I'm just kidding but no what
actually happened was brought my xbox I
would played some FIFA for a bit I was
more of a Nintendo kid but uh just I
really started getting no any other and
we started talking about different ideas
and one day I had the idea like
caffeinated energy gun the next day he's
already ordered all the Amazon supplies
that we need all the powder that we
needed all the heat equipment and the
boilers and you know he's already ready
so I was like okay what we're really
doing this I remember looking at James
and him looking and me and we were like
okay you know like this is this is it
you know this is our product
not as bad as you think it was awful we
had a lot of serious work to do and we
knew that so honestly when we did our
research we found out that coffee and
energy drinks take about 40 minutes to
hit you and because of all the sugar you
crash every single time rush energy gum
is like having eight sugar-free crash
free energy drinks in your pocket and
rush only takes about five minutes to
kick in because of all the science rush
is more than just gum though it's a
movement for everyone out there trying
to be the best they can be so get out
there and do more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
