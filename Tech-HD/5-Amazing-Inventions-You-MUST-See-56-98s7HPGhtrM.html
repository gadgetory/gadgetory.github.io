stream the video on your smartphone at
that moment you are no longer tied to
your living room for your entertainment
or to your office for work you could
access your content anywhere but there's
one small problem your small mobile
device screen almost all of us prefer
large displays for entertainment and for
work those work deadlines are
approaching a large desktop monitor our
dual screen setup will significantly
boost your productivity so what if there
is a way to have the mobility of a phone
tablet or laptop without losing the
benefit of a large screen sounds
impossible but that's exactly what we
did introducing spud the spontaneous
pop-up display spud is a high-resolution
24 inch display that collapses down to
the size of a book and weighs less than
two pounds this revolutionary product is
the first truly collapsible display and
the only device that gives you both
portability and a large screen for
entertainment and productivity sorel the
spa design process we focus on image
quality and ease of use we use the
latest projection technology combined
with our own custom optics to project a
large high quality image over very short
distance this enables spa to produce a
bright sharp image that's about four
times larger than our laptop screen and
23 times larger than a smartphone screen
to mix but as easy to use as possible we
designed to work just like a ruggedized
umbrella you can pop up the screen in a
very intuitive way and you have the spot
set up and run in less than 10 seconds
and sings but it's also lightweight
battery-powered and uses a hassle-free
hdmi connection you can get straight to
the big string you want without wasting
any time on set up one of the most
exciting things about spud is the many
different ways that you can use on the
entertainment side spud is basically a
portable TV or movie screen whether
you're traveling camping hanging out
with friends at a coffee shop or just
lounging around your house it's the big
screen that you can use anywhere for
work having a dual screen setup is great
productivity but you can also use it for
presentations and it's a collaboration
it's great for tradeshows sales visits
or any kind of field work spud gives you
the flexibility you need no matter the
situation and it's great because it's a
complete solution in a very small
package that you can take anywhere we
have the team the product and the vision
to execute on spud and now all we need
is your support by backing us on
Kickstarter you're becoming part of our
founding community as a special thank

hi Kickstarter I'm Avram over the past
year me and my partner John I've been
working hard to bring you ding a
beautiful simple smart doorbell for your
home the idea is a simple one when you
press the doorbell button you hear a
chime in your home like a normal
doorbell but you also receive a call to
your smartphone allowing you to talk
with the person at the front door from
wherever you are in the world whether
you rent your flat out on Airbnb you're
out of earshot in the garden or even on
holiday you carry your doorbell wherever
you go it's right there in your pocket
you'll never miss your door again
currently doorbells are unloved and
forgotten objects they don't work with
how we need our busy lives that we
control through our smartphones we want
to fix this for you you can control ding
to our smartphone app this allows you to
set the kind of time you have look at
caller history and even set some quiet
time when you don't want to wake up the
household we've worked for over a decade
and the design and technology industries
and design is really important to us we
don't want to make just another plastic
box sits in the corner of your room we
want to make ding something really
special but compliments your home rather
than distracting from it who did spend a
lot of time trying to find the right
finish in color for ding whether it was
for the chime which had to feel really
and belong inside the home so we made it
really friendly and warm using the
fabric for example though both haven't
really changed in 50 years it's about
moving a kind of doorbell from something
that you're only able to interact with
when you're in the home to actually
something that you can use from anywhere
we've had some great support in
developing Dean from both the UK design
council
and from John Lewis a leading department
store in the UK from a John Lewis
perspective it's the perfect product you
know we are really excited about new
innovation coming our way and given the
kind of the big boom that we're seeing
around smart home we think this place
perfect it's that trend we believed in
will change the way people think about
mimes making it more about the home and
less about the tech inside with our
manufacturing partners were almost ready
for production so if you want to be one
of the first to own d check out our page
below there's several rewards for you to
choose from including ordering your very
own ding we hope you're all as excited
about Dean as we are and we're looking
forward to bring it to you very very
soon
you
at power practical we love high voltage
shooting sparks and lighting up the
party after bringing this Tesla coil too
wide we knew it was time to put one in
everyone's pockets introducing the
sparker
a plasma wider and flashlight and one
the flashlight is a 1 watt dimmable LED
Becca run for four hours on Fulbright
the removable lid doubles as a diffuser
transforming the light into a lantern
the plasma lighter uses electricity to
create a windproof solution that
requires no flame butane or fueled the
sparker is great for any of your outdoor
adventures
lighting your barbecue around your house
or simply being prepared
sparker is also USB rechargeable please
back or share our project and light it
up
you
two years ago we did a Kickstarter with
loon cube and thank you for those who
backed us hey we start to be back on
Kickstarter bringing you the lifeline
we've engineered the live flight to be a
thousand lumens waterproof to 30 feet
half the size and a third the way we
want it to be the light that you take
with you anywhere it's something that
you want to keep with you because you
never want to miss that moment
a couple years ago at my foundation
event I was introduced to the product
and from that point on I was very
interested in luma cute now it has a
LifeFlight half the size seventy percent
of the light is still there it's an
amazing piece of electronics you forget
that it's in your pocket cuz it's so
small and so compatible with everything
as the company grows it still listens to
its customers and that's what's so
amazing and seeing everybody work
together out of absolute love for what
we're doing and the solutions that were
create doing something different whether
it's photography or surfing with the
lights at night this lights opened up a
giant opportunity for me I don't want to
miss one surf session after the Sun Goes
Down
we're a software company with hardware
devices that solves problems in the
mobile imagery world there's great
companies out there that have created
great products but we're just that
perfect complement we realized that in
order to have the perfect image the
perfect memory you need the perfect
light I think lifeflight brings that to
you
it's cool to be partners with a company
that allows you to make the product look
sick but to also have fun I believe
that's what movie tube is all about is
having fun and trying to light up things
you normally want to be able to wherever
I am or whatever we're doing I'm finding
that we're using the life life for so
many more things than we ever intended
the light waterproof is so small if it
allows us to do things that we weren't
able to do before and yeah people night
sir foot not with lights this bright not
what the technology of cameras these
days we're capturing things that were
never really imaginable this is so
different to anything else that's ever
been shot and surfing like this I'm just
so to be a part of this movement
just cool that you can take life light
and put it in the ocean film Jamie
O'Brien and then you know you can take
it to some skate spot with me and films
an incredible scenery shot we need to
take you to the snowboarding guys we
have to take it everywhere that's what's
great about life light is that it's
bringing all these different athletes
together because now we can do unique
things that we weren't able to do before
because you couldn't see I'm stoked to
be with the Loom cube family it's
allowed me to do some insane things
check out the Kickstarter light it up
have fun please support us let us show
you what we got
I'm confident with the team around us
will continue to bring the most
innovative products to market
donate to Kickstarter let us bring some
light to your life
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
