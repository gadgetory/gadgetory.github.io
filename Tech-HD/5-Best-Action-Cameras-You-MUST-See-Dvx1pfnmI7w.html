Robi could record his life in every
scenario when the selfie needs no hands
involved only God knows how creative we
can be the rotatable screen mode allows
you to find the best filming angle and
here's one of many awesome innovations
we've added to mocha cake we believe the
built-in battery of the screen to
provide power to the camera as well
which doubles the battery in case even
this doesn't provide enough battery
light mocha cam has spare batteries that
simply snap on magnetically in one
second to extend your battery life to 4
hours for video filming connect a mocha
cam using Wi-Fi to control the camera
and
review the video directly mocha cam also
synchronizes your photos and videos and
lets you share them instantly

last for eight hours without a power

time and light join us record every
moment that makes you unique
let the world know you better please
support us let's make the dream come
true
you
you
snores which ISA leading us is all will
ever trust ya know I don't always
we'll go
through the wastelands through the
highways from a shadow through the
sunrays and
I phoned away melodies we haven't played
I don't know
I go in around these walls to create a
song
through the wastelands through the
highways through my shadow through the
sunrays and
we'll go
when you're fishing and you know you you
get a bite and and you hook on a fish
and you're reeling that sucker and I
mean you have all that action throughout
that process but then when you catch the
fish you know you take a picture with it
you smile for the camera and you share
that to all your friends saying look at
this cat so we want to make it so that
you can share the actual action go fish
cam incorporated it's developed by me
and my brother and then we developed it
to be a technology for what we found to
be an underserved market there are
camera technologies or fish finders in
the market but what we found was they're
not capturing where the action was and
by seeing which baits are attracting
fish and how a fish might strike just
having the data and learning about those
aspects of fishing will allow you to
make better decisions in what to use and
why and when that's something that is
very hard to do without an application
like this one of the key features is
that it sits on the line and it works
with your fishing line so it's not gonna
be a fish or your fishing style and top
of that we have infrared and green
lighting around the camera rim so that
you can fish during nighttime wearing
darker lighting and then we also have
the depth of it so that can go up to 150
meters underwater as well as the ability
to last for four hours so we really put
in a lot of work into making sure that
when they go fish that they're good news
go fish camp when we started the project
with Go Fish we broke down the process
into multiple steps we started initially
with a conceptual design looking at the
product from a both a visual as well as
a future benefit standpoint it was
important to us that we had a premium
product that had future benefits that
just weren't available on the market
currently in terms of looking forward to
production the three-dimensional CAD and
mechanical drawings are all completed
the coding for the app is completed at
this point we're really just using
Kickstarter to get ourselves into
production and get this product out into
the marketplace this is a new product
that a lot of people are excited about
and by their support and their backing
of us it's going to allow us to get to
the next step so that we can share our
vision with the world as well it's an
awesome technology that allows you to
capture kind of action-packed footage
and share it with your friends and
family and definitely bring a lot of the
excitement to the industry</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
