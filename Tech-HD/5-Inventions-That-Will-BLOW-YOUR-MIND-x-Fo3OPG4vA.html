communication is not easy Travel detects
the voices in the conversation with its
front microphone recognizing the
language and translating it through the
ear but when you're speaking travel
records your language through the front
mic and plays the translation into the
other language through the front speaker
so only one person has to wear the
device luckily we've been working on a
live translator that will solve all of
these problems travel the global
translator the first hands-free live
translator for automatic two-way
communication but how is it different
from the others
Travel is not intrusive Travel
recognizes the voice of the two people
that are having a conversation and
discards other voices around it even has
a noise canceling technology that
deletes any interferences from the
environment you don't need a data plan
or Wi-Fi for most languages Travel comes
with everything built-in you'll just
need a mobile device to set up the pair
of languages you want to use and you're
good to go
when the other person talks their voice
gets recognized by my front microphone
that translates it through my ear button
you potential mouth is very she should
say how the roofer to bother anyone and
this is the best part it's only human
control three years of a design and
engineering process has led us to
develop a perfect fit for people all
over the world trying to get through
conversations in a foreign language it's
been a journey of many prototypes
designs and materials resulting in a
live translating hands-free device
it all gets logged through the travel
app where you can control any part of
the process if you need to hemos estado
dispositivo
we've been testing the technology
hardware and software and we're ready to
start the process of manufacturing but
we need you help to make it happen if
you are like me and like to travel learn
from other cultures and more
specifically close the best deals this
is what we made this device for with
your backing you start the production of
the devices in Europe and we'll send
them to you for the best price we can
never offer it's time we forget about
language and engage in communication
this is linked it connects two or more
people together so they can find each
other
it's a simple one-button interface
just pair two or more devices
and then follow the arrow and distance
right to your people
that's it all without the need for
phones maps connectivity or
subscriptions have you ever been lost or
separated from your group been unsure at
a fork in the road anxiously waited for
your group to return struggle to
describe where you are turned around in
a crowded place and your child is gone
but length is as much for fun as it is
for safety
find your friends at music festivals
stay together in large crowds reunite
easily on ski trips
allow your kids to explore with more
peace of mind
or simply enjoy your outdoor activities
with more confidence link uses a new
approach to GPS and has a range between
devices of up to three months
scroll through groups of up to 12 user
interface that's simple enough for a
young child to use length lasts up to
three days without recharging and its
built-in clip allows you to attach the
device to your clothes here or even pets
engineered to endure the harshest
environments from snowy descents the
young kids link is more than a people
compass you can set meet-up locations
that everyone in your group can easily
find and return to a safe zone feature
alert you when anyone strays outside the
boundary that you choose it's great for
kids and pets
no more worrying wandering or waiting
around link will find your people when
nothing else will
hi I'm Steve beam box than me straight
up he felt like instant power the power
to create with this power I can free my
people from buying things they don't
move free them from personal reason time
to wake up in the name of lasers free
march to the promised land with beam box
powerful laser we can touch the tons of
materials
for your night and go find your
materials looks like we found something
I've been boxes then raving up we found
would we cantilever now with the great
power of beam box we have the chance to
inspire ourselves and leave the way
we must take off our masks and change
them to cool user-friendly touchscreen
faces by feeding box for your soul with
bean box it's our honor to introduce mix
mix is an AR device it's small like
sunglasses it has a 96 degree immersive
field of view and it's compatible with
steamvr moste our glasses promised to
give you an experience like this but
delivered through a product like this
with the optical technology we invented
dual channel mixed optics mix remains
slim &amp;amp; Sons but comes with a 96 degree
fov the virtual image will cover almost
the entire field of view and it's mixed
with the environment naturally it's
truly an immersive AR experience let's
test the fov hello mr. terminator
hello everyone one of mr. terminators
eyeballs is a camera it can measure the
view of every device the fov and mix is
much broader than
other devices now let's fasten a hammer
behind the glass to show how you feel
with mix well connected to a PC mix can
run on Steam VR existing steamvr
applications with a dark background can
be used directly on mix it will give you
a fresh pay our experience with existing
VR content mix supports positional
tracking so that virtual objects can be
combined with the real environment and
there are optional controllers eye
tracking and hand tracking if you have
already developed VR apps on steamvr
just clear the background and apply the
black skybox then your VR project will
transfer to AR we are collaborating with
community partners to create new AR
games you can also hacked with mix in
different ways we hope more and more
developers can join us and develop more
AR apps
we've been demoting mix around the world
and events such as GDC SBV AR and VR
Ellen and have been getting feedback
from the community
beautiful
coz you straight it's very compact I
believe the lightest
much bigger
IKEA seller and ginger the fellow and
male four years ago at the very
beginning of our Stella user burgers on
kick seller help us to make our first
beer devices come to life after that we
funded with Sequoia to build
partnerships with many big companies for
example the noble Motorola worthless
and ALC join them and the sex to your
support King's mother as parents we want
our kids to have the confidence and
skill to take on the world
skills that stem from the flow of
balance and control skills we must take
time to develop or risk missing out yet
a lot of us overlook the fundamental
skill of board riding well what have I
told you we crack the code with a
revolutionary new surf trainer that
features switchable modes designed to
compress the gap between learning and
new skill and its payoff so you get all
the exhilaration without the fear switch
modes and now you're riding one of the
most realistic surf trainers ever made
it's called the street board switch and
with it we've reimagined what a street
board should be an affordable all-in-one
training package the front truck
features a sliding switch changing it
from a conventional truck which is easy
to push and coast to a caster truck
which unlocks the creativity of carving
the back truck optionally comes with a
detachable leash break solving the
problem of skateboards rolling away from
beginners every coach has ridden the
switch agrees that this is the best surf
trainer on the market today without
exception if you can't be surfing you
want to be training to surf or something
like this it's a completely necessary
tool to continue to progress in your
surfing I've used in the past so many
different surf trainers but this has
actually been the first one that I've
got on where I thought this is exactly
what I need and what I need to help the
kids that I coach progress
order precision geometry is the key to
the switches smooth responsive carving
the switch features the first cast a
truck with reverse kingpin hangers
requiring you to drive from rail to rail
with the same weight distribution a
surfing eliminating the possibility of
wiggling a bad habit of most other surf
trainers from our strength and a fitness
point of view I think pumping and
driving on the flats is super important
through three or four pushes and just
pump and drive pump and drive route a
railroad around and until you reach
fatigue and this is a really great
training tool for that specific muscle
group that you need for surfing and then
the hills big Hills are great because on
a big hill on a board that you control
the speed of with your rail is exactly
like surfing and so in big wave
situations you need to hold that rail
and set that rail and drive through the
extent of the turn and manage all of the
mayhem around you through your rail work
and then you can do specific maneuver
work you know find embankments use cones
and and you can specifically work on
technique in a controlled way you don't
really need to do anything specifically
but ride the board because you can't
ride it wrong Street boards has years of
experience bringing products to market
and our surf training skateboards are
used by leading surf coaches and
high-performance training centers around
the world by backing our campaign with a
pledge of $99
you'll be amongst the first people in
the world to ride a Street board switch
direct from us at a wholesale price by
joining our campaign you'll receive
updates and be involved in decisions
like selecting wheels colors and artwork
which takes the guesswork out of it for
us our campaign is all about getting
more kids riding boards with a switch
you can progressively develop
fundamental board riding skills where
you take it from there is up to you like
your body loves it as this thrill and
this adrenaline the rush is through your
body and so it's one of those things
that is life-changing so if you don't
challenge yourself and get out of your
comfort zone to try and do things
that scare you and challenge you you
won't grow and you won't evolve to your
potential</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
