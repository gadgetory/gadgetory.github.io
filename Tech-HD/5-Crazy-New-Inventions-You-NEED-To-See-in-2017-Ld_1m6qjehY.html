we all know about air pollution for me
it became personal recently when Alma my
daughter was born I started to look at
the effect of urban air pollution on
baby's health what I found wasn't good
steadily death when I came up with
breathing Brizzy is an app operated dual
fan filter that cleans the air in a
baby's or child's breathing area
it's an autonomous device that is
activated when high pollution levels are
detected by the sensors attached the
urban environment exposes us to a large
variety of pollutants carbon monoxide
sulfur dioxide particles of metal rubber
and dust are all present in the air we
breathe every day children are
particularly vulnerable their lungs and
immune system are not fully developed
during their first few years of life
putting them at greater risk when
exposed to air pollution 30 to 60
centimeters above ground is where the
heaviest most dangerous particles are
concentrated frizzy is designed to stay
with you and your child throughout the
day
it delivers 1.5 liters of filtered air
every 10 seconds to babies or toddlers
breathing area through its patented
innovative filter this unique and
high-quality filter is a multi-layered
medical grade nanometric woven fabric
the woven layer removes particulates and
the carbon layer removes harmful gases
reducing both particles and chemicals
being inhaled there are a number of ways
of reducing the exposure of the
pollutants the one of the simple ways is
to find the route where you can avoid
the hotspots the other way is to create
a clean air zone around it and Vigi can
provide both these solutions Brizzy has
undergone a series of tests led by
Professor Prashant Kumar what we wanted
to see is how clean actually this can
make the air for the kids who might be
sitting in this kind of prams
the Brizzy app visualizes pollution data
in the form of a real-time heat map
which is updated by users sensor
readings Brizzy has a sensor only option
that can be used separately with the
free app this information is collated
and displayed in map form via the app
and the website sharing air quality
information visually within the Brizzy
community so as you can see in the real
world scenario you are really seeing a
lot of these spikes and these spikes are
normally due to the fact that there are
buses which are idling organ air
emissions actually coming from other
different sources when you look at the
blue curve actually so that seems to
have removed these spikes creating a
much cleaner zone removing those bigger
spikes and the higher concentration
inhaled by the the children sitting in
the pants protect your loved ones and
inform the community about air quality
