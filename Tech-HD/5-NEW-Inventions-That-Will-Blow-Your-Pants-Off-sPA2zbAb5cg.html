attach and secure your bags quickly the
travel bag buddy is a patent-pending
rfid travel organizer and secondary bag
strap you first attach the adjustable
velcro panels around the handle next
place the bag on the support panel and
fasten the strap with the buckle giving
you peace of mind and access to both
hands if needed
the idea for the travel bag buddy came
to me from a real-world problem I think
many of you can relate to I was
traveling with my fiance and getting on
the escalator she struggled holding her
luggage in one hand and her water in the
other watching her I knew there had to
be a better way to both secure your
luggage and easily access your items on
the go so your hands are free if you
need them the travel bag buddy is strong
functional easy to use and provide
secure access to your items while
keeping them hidden when not in use the
main panels fold over transforming the
travel bag buddy into a compact RFID
protected travel organizer which packs
flat and takes up almost no room in your
purse briefcase or luggage the travel
bag buddy is currently patent-pending
the prototypes have been tested with
travel around the world and our
manufacturing partners are lined up I've
backed many Kickstarter projects myself
and I'm excited to now launch my own
unlike other bag straps the travel bag
buddy is also a personal travel
organizer this makes traveling and going
through airport security a breeze the
travel bag buddy remains attached to
your bag with your personal belongings
so you don't ever have to worry about
leaving your phone wallet boarding pass
or other personal items behind the
travel bag buddy is constructed from
ballistic nylon reinforced by
high-density plastic and RFID protected
the strap uses extra sturdy elastic
webbing designed to carry heavy loads
while retaining elasticity when you get
to your destination the travel bag buddy
stores quickly to fold up you place it
front side down then click it and flip
it on the go the travel bag buddy gives
you easy access to your phone money
cards and other belongings when done
flip the
run back to keep your items secure and
hidden it can also be used as a
standalone travel organizer simply fold
the straps in and place it around your
suitcase handle we cannot bring the
travel bag buddy to life without your
help we ask that you press the button
and choose a reward you like we have
early bird discounts stretch goals and
fun rewards for helping us bring the
travel bag buddy to life the funds will
be used for manufacturing the travel bag
buddy using only the highest quality
