did you know that a significant number
of dead batteries you throw away had
only used roughly 20% of their battery
life what if you could instantly tap
into the other 80% that is still trapped
inside now you can with batter Iser
batter Iser is a reusable stainless
steel sleeve that slips over your new or
used batteries and taps into the 80%
that is usually thrown away when your
batteries are running out of juice just
slip the batter Iser micro thin sleeve
over your low or dead battery insert it
back into your device and see your power
level jump from low to 100% instantly
the idea batteries there was to come up
with a way up squeezing all the juice
out of the battery before you throw it
away we tested the batteries in you know
laughs and we confirmed that the
batteries are taps into that 80 percent
energy that is usually thrown away what
is most impressive about batteries are
asides from its performance is the fact
that this technology would have not been
available a few years ago it is not only
by pushing the edge of technology and
industrial design mechanical design and
electrical design that we have been able
to achieve such miniaturization for too
long
alkaline batteries have largely been
unchanged in either their construction
or their delivery of satisfaction that
Arizer changes on the average household
has over 25 different battery powered
devices and VAT Arizer is designed to
instantly extend their battery life

remember the Jetsons who didn't dream of
that home a home that knows us and how
we live and generally makes life better
and much easier well we're still a bit
away from having Rosie make us dinner
but that hasn't stopped a lot of
companies from trying to bring us a
smart home experience it's a great idea
the problem the smartphone is not the
answer to smart home this only makes a
simple task like flipping a light switch
even more complicated the smart home
that's been delivered isn't all that
smart
until now introducing Umi the smart home
system for everyone it's simple it's fun
and there's nothing else like it
guaranteed this little cube makes your
home a lot smarter and your life much
easier right out of the box here's why
typically smart home systems have a
central gateway that allows you to
control and monitor your home but you
must have additional sensors installed
all over the place just to keep an eye
on things
who me is different because Umi cube is
more than a gate wedding we packed it
full of sensors including a 360 degree
IR blaster so you can control your home
theater and even your thermostat it even
has a camera so you can keep an eye on
your home even when you're away cube is
brilliant but the real beauty within me
is that you can be up and running in
minutes thanks to our innovative tap and
touch technology app and touch lets you
add new devices to any with just a tap
this makes setting up and expanding your
system super easy
we made looming for everyone so even if
your mom is scared of technology she can
still set up a smart home in just a few
minutes once set up control of your home
has never been so simple or convenient
Lumi touch brilliant 7-inch display
gives you full control of your house
using familiar widgets' or by using
voice controls Umi touch gives you
control over your security your home
beyonds and your entertainment all from
one simple interface
but we don't just give you control of
your TV who me take Smart Home
Entertainment to the next level with
humi streamer you can watch movies from
services like Netflix and YouTube stream
music from Pandora access content on
demand or just surf the web wake up to
your favorite music or news channels you
can even get notifications see who's at
the door and let them in all from the
comfort of your couch and you can
control it alright from me touch no more
cluttered and clunky remotes on the
coffee table it truly is the ultimate
universal remote but Unni is about more
than just control it's about making your
life easier
who me is not just a if this than that
engine it's truly intelligent our
adaptive intelligence engine or Umi IQ
identifies patterns in your life and
also takes cues from real-time data
points to adjust to you and how you live
if other systems are considered smart
home then Umi would be the smartest time
I just got the touch jet way it turned
