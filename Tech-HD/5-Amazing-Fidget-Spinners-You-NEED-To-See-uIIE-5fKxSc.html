you guys actually this is called a hand
spinner this made by a metal worn from
Instagram Fame I was one of his early
backers on the hand spinner he banged I
think I'm out I'm not exactly sure how
many of these he made like 20 I think
there's still readily available now if
you follow metal one I'll put the link
below for his page but yeah the hand
spinner craze is definitely in in full
effect and Johnny metal Warren got into
the fray and this is his first venture
into it johnny is known for his very
intricate designs on on like he makes
like the Thor hammer I have one of his
pry bar bottle opener axes
he does like shields beads and yeah he
went into it he tried it so he did this
for me this hand spinner and you can see
it's full tie the buttons tie buns tie
over there and he did some nice satin
highlights and blue a no these are all
flame a know as I guess the colors he
does also like I forgot what he calls it
but like almost like a I forget what he
calls it but it looks like I cracked the
desert floor theme on the hand spinner
it's very thick thicker than most hand
spinners
you see it's pretty good spare over
there if I can bounce it oh god I
dropped it but um yeah it's awkward to
what they would do it from this angle
but excellent excellent hand spinner as
titanium is very tough it's not soft
like like if you get the ones that are
made of brass or copper
it was pretty durable intricate
intricate machining on this
hand spinners you can see just amazing
detail work on it the button is concave
as you can see there so it accommodates
your fingers sitting there better
actually I like this side better it
grips a little better on the finger he
does lock it in with this screw told me
it's already locked I did so I'm going
to need to unscrew it if you want but
you could if you want just give you a
little bit of the action on it very nice
very nice so it does come in a variety
of different anodization a lot of styles
a lot of customizing if you guys are
interested some of the cons I'm give you
some cons because I want to give you
like a full honest review on this it is
a lot of titanium because if you guys
don't mind carrying all that tie it is a
little bit chunky in the pocket you know
but if you have like an EDC bag that you
can stick it in or you want to just
leave it on your desk like a paperweight
that'd be great for it but I don't see
you like guys carrying this it's not as
portable as the torque bar or the stubby
just virtually because of the size of it
right does have good spinning on it
because it is Thai and it's got this
this propeller design I know what would
you call this this look here
it is I do like prefer spinning it with
the other hand you could do it you could
do it with your finger there's couple
ways to do it the edges because it is
tie and it's machine it is a little bit
sharp I mean it's not going to cut you
but the edges are a little bit sharp but
yeah but I mean amazing just really
beautiful a beautiful hand spin I talked
about design wise it's just gorgeous
available in different and decision
colors again look at the millwork
got a millwork in there that's sick so I
believe it's two it is two pieces of
titanium that he locks down with these
three screws if I always talk to Johnny
again I would tell me we can go lighter
maybe just half of this I'd be a good
size alright folks that's the hand
spinner from metal one check them out
peace
you
looks like everyone is in love with this
frigate spinners when I see him I think
how fast could I make it spin so I got a
make one in fly why you
you
Oh
Oh
you
you
Oh
you
everyone thanks so much for tuning in as
always I'm really excited to share with
you guys a really cool spinner that just
came out from custom manufactory this is
the custom 9 factory Pepe acha spinner
so if you're not familiar with custom 9
factory they produce really high-quality
production knives I've had a number of
their knives when they announced that
they were doing a spinner I knew it was
going to be really high quality so let
me show you again is kind of what it is
and what it looks like does ship with
their a padded pouch as most of their
knives do and here is the spinner itself
so completely made of titanium does have
ceramic bearings and these white vials
here are actually tritium tritium is a
compound that glows it doesn't need to
be charged if you'd like a little bit
more information you can definitely
google it so yeah really cool spinner
again full titanium it's got a bit of
weight to it as far as the specs go it's
about 3.6 inches long 1.1 inches wide
here's the widest portion the thickness
varies from about zero point four eight
inches to zero point five nine inches at
the caps here the thumb caps or finger
caps whatever you want to call them does
weigh in at four ounces and these do
retail for a hundred and ninety dollars
so obviously a bit more expensive than
some of the you know plastic 3d printed
ones that I've shown you guys thus far
but hopefully you guys understand that
working with metals requires a different
machinery a lot more expensive in terms
of materials in production time and so
forth but it's you know it's really high
quality really well-made spins well and
has some nice features like the
different anodized colors and the
tritium vials so it does again work well
with the caps with the capsule and it
spins on the table too and then the caps
are removable if you do want to decrease
the size factor and you're okay with
giving up the the caps essentially
where your fingers go so yeah that's
what it looks like without the caps on
obviously we have the enclosed bearings
here which are ceramic spins pretty well
that way but again it's not going to
spin on a flat surface like it did prior
so yeah that is the custom knife Factory
Pepe akka really well-executed as far as
availability goes they have sold out of
the pre-orders there might be a couple
left at the time that this video goes up
but I will put the link in the
description box below if you guys want
to get on the notification list or
potentially get a little bit more info
if you go to a website right now there
will not be any specs on this one as
custom knife factory was worried about
knockoffs being produced so they are
numbered although again probably not
limited and there is the custom knife
factory logo so let me give you guys a
up-close look at some of the detail on
this one
and yeah I'd love to show you guys the
tritium vials again my lighting setup
here is not going to do if my camera
does not like pitch black so probably
some images up on my Instagram of the
tritium vials glowing but if you're in a
dark room obviously these to form a
essentially glowing circle as you spin
it so they are on both sides anyways
thanks for watching guys hopefully you
enjoyed the video I have more spinners
coming the near future so comments or
questions let me know do my best to
answer them you can also check out the
website give me a thumbs up and I'll see
you guys soon take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
