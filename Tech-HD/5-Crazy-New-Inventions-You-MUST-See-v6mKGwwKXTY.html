any fancy lights whistles or bottle
openers but what I do have is pretty
awesome I have the ability to print on
just about anything in fact if it can be
printed on I'm the one to do it I can do
all of this because I don't have a
feeder instead I'm a free access printer
which means I don't care how thick heavy
or high what you want me to print on is
just put me on top of what you want me
to print on choose the file you want to
print from your preferred device and hit
print I do the rest of it because I use
a patented retractable tread system I
stay accurate and aligned throughout any
print job so whether you're printing a
cut out for a pattern a poster like no
other or some shirts for any upcoming
crowdfunding video I'm the last printer
you will ever need I'm SPO and I simply
print on everything I'm not perfect yet
but with your help I will be soon now
let me introduce you to my inventor hi
I'm Joey and for 25 years I worked in
the print industry I came up with the
idea of SPO after I realized how many
customers we were having to turn away
for jobs they were either too small for
the quantity that we needed to require
for our jobs to be done they couldn't
afford the jobs for the quantities that
they were doing or it was just a matter
of price and quality and the timeframe
that they needed it so I came up with
SPO since there was nothing else out
there like it everything about SPO had
to be engineered from the ground up from
designing and milling high-grade
reinforced treads with the fiberglass
reinforced mesh to eliminate stretching
a retractable system that maintained
alignment throughout any size print job
two cartridges with embedded hardware so
SPO reacts differently depending on what
you were printing on everything about
SPO has been made to fit in the smallest
footprint possible to maintain
portability after three years of
development and work and a team of
awesomely dedicated people who have been
working two jobs sometimes more to make
this happen we're now at the point where
we need your help we have our utility
patent set
everything is in motion our product is
working everything that you see in this
video none of it's an illustration it's
not perfect but it's really close with
your help I know that we can get there
and get the rest of the way as of right
now most of our custom internals are
made using 3d printers unfortunately
even the best 3d printers on the market
aren't perfect and those imperfections
on gears can trees in the body itself
caused a slight drift that has a
ghosting effect on the printing this
will be resolved by having the internals
machined and milled as well as making
them out of more durable materials than
PLA plastic finally there is no open
source large format printing software on
the market right now so SPO is limited
to an 8 and a half by 11 inch printing
size we need to hire on a software
programmer so that SPO can print on
anything as small as a business card or
as large as a billboard easily and
efficiently as our goal is to have SPO
manufactured assembled and shipped here
in the US we have spent years of
sourcing as many solutions to these
hurdles as possible and now have
everyone in place to be able to move
forward by backing us you will soon be
able to simply print on everything and
even if you can't help monetarily by
just sharing us on your social media
outlets you would do a lot for us thanks
a lot I appreciate it
thanks again for watching this video and
if you have any questions don't hesitate
to contact us because we're as excited
about this as hopefully you are thanks
since the time we launched our first
Kickstarter campaign in June 2016 the
wireless earphones landscape has changed
tremendously the launch of the air pod
by Apple is undeniably one of the main
reasons it did as always they called it
a revolution well you know we all want
to change the world hmm okay but
seriously what is this white thing
hanging out of your ear what the audio
signature is the same as the ear pod a
product launched in 2012 what if we tell
you that we have created a product that
has a superior connectivity that
connects automatically without any push
for five seconds kind of button that
fits perfectly and will stay in your
ears no matter what you do but has the
audio signature of a wired premium pair
of earphones and arguably that looks
like an actual pair of premium earphones
what if I tell you that you can get it
now and here at a fraction of the price
the EOC air follows the awarded design
of the AOC one because we all know if it
ain't broke don't fix it however the
similarity ends here
the eos z air is the complete new beast
thanks to its charging case these tiny
earbuds can last over 48 hours of
playtime and instead of packing the
limited space with unused and overrated
tech we used it to host to eight
millimeters large customized dynamic
drivers our pc b--'s boasting the very
latest csr bluetooth 5.0 chipsets are
custom designed and assembled in-house
our unique around-the-ear design does
not only secure the earphones on the
ears it makes it the world's first
Bluetooth earphones with an antenna
outside the casing giving it a much
better and wider exposure made in a
special alloy of high conductive copper
they will create a secure and flawless
connectivity
overall we believe the EOC air is a very
special product designed and built for
very special people as wireless products
become ever more present they also
become an expression of our personality
and style most of our competitors out
there keep doing the same products over
and over again we want the EOC air to be
different we want it to be the first
true Wireless product to be truly yours
as we entered the audio market 18 months
ago we never imagined getting that much
attention we are now selling in 300
shops all over the world we have entered
one of the biggest government finance
startup incubators in Europe and we now
work with one of the best earphone
factories on this side of the world as
we are getting better known in this
ecosystem we have developed confidence
that there is a place in the market for
a OS e audio we are here on Kickstarter
today to share with you our enthusiasm
working with the best implies large
volumes of orders and the EOC air needs
the creation of 12 different modes as we
needed you during the start of our
journey we now need your support in
taking this to the next level and to
move forward I promise you you won't be
disappointed
