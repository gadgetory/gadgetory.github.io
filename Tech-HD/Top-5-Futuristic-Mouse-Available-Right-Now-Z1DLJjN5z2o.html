10 years of experience in optical
electronics we're excited to introduce

Odin the intuitive responsive easy to
use laser projection mouse please help
us bring this cool innovative Mouse to
the world
Odin is the God of War and Norse
mythology flashing out laser projection
Odin points out the clear exact sensing
area for you
the infrared sensors capture reflection
signals and deliver high-resolution
easily portable the pocket-sized Odin
weighs only 40 grams it's way smaller
than a regular Mouse and even more
easy-to-use designers gamers office
workers lay your wrist hurt no more
simply connect the mouse to the USB port
on your computer or laptop and you're
good to go
we've been working on the intuitive and
responsive Mouse to enable smoother user
experiences we need you to be part of
this cool project now let's bring out
into life
you
the swift point GT is the first Mouse in
the world to give smooth panning and
flicking without having to reach for the
screen it opens up touch to Windows 7
and fully touch enabled systems like
Windows 8 and 10 just come alive you can
use the GT on your disk like a
traditional Mouse but unlike other mice
it's designed to operate on your laptop
next to your touchpad
so whether you're on a plane or a train
or in the living room you can always use
the GT and be 100% productive the GT
offers two modes of use there is a
point-and-click mode just like a
traditional Mouse then there is the
touch gesture mode tilt the GT over
slightly to touch the stylus and windows
8 and 10 now see it as a finger moving
on a touchscreen Windows 8 and 10 apps
are all about tiles designed to be moved
sideways with your finger there are
nightmare to use with a scroll wheel the
GT supports native touch so we can
intuitively pan and flick smoothly lift
and write the new web browser has great
features - but only for a touchscreen
with the GT you can flick back to a
previous web page read through the page
with the scroll wheel and then flick
back to the top with the new start
screen in Windows 10 preview you can use
the power of a mouse and touch to easily
open and switch between apps that now
open in smaller windows windows 8 and 10
suddenly makes sense and actually become
pretty awesome the latest versions of
Word and Excel are also touch optimized
and with the GT you can flick and pan
your way straight to the section you
need and in Excel you can instantly go
over to the column you need to view or
edit no other Mouse is this fast and
intuitive for navigating documents it
takes you to a new level of productivity
we also support all the other touch
features like zooming and application
switcher if you're using Windows 7
Android Mac OS or even an iPad we
haven't forgotten about you just check
out our other videos below with other
small mobile mice you need to use a claw
grip which soon causes cramping in your
fingers the GT has an ergonomic pen like
grip that is comfortable in anyone's
hands large or small it's 30 to 40
percent more efficient and more accurate
than a touchpad you can connect via
bluetooth 4 or the USB receiver which
also charges the mouse
you
let's talk about gaming when playing we
rely on two things our skills and our
gaming peripherals but we really have no
understanding how our bodies affect our
gameplay at Marist labs we want to
change that
just like athletes gather and analyze
data we want to do the same for gamers
variety with deep insights enable you to
understand your reactions and optimize
your kept their names QG is the world's
first smart gaming mouse it has built-in
sensors that track your heart rate
galvanic skin response and actions per
minute before you game you select what
data you want to track this data will
then appear as a transparent overlay on
your screen the overlay is independent
of the game and you can customize as
well as move it to any position on the
screen the software helps you analyze
your performance after game by taking
snapshots of your most stressful moments
the names QT is a game change of the
team by understanding our stress the
team members are you can make better
decisions and optimize the collaboration
in real time during the game the mouse
instantly senses play with your hammer
and LEDs react to your heart rate
the kaise assembly it's a new control
system for your hands that consolidates
several input devices into one assembly
enabling your hands to have full access
to all the features of a full keyboard a
mouse and a joystick no reaching moving
your hands from one device to another or
looking down required
I designed a specially contoured palm
rest that is just enough support and
friction to enable you to use the palm
of your hand to drive the mouse getting
this right was the biggest challenge but
with all fingers and thumbs finally free
I was able to design for each hand a
curved fingerboard with 30 keys and a
thumb module with five keys in an analog
joystick
it has finger keyboard rows angled for
fast access with 30 programmable keys
for each hand five programmable keys and
a two axis analog joystick for each
thumb the highest performance and
quality electronics and a contoured palm
rest to move the device as a mouse
without requiring any fingers of thumbs
to grip</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
