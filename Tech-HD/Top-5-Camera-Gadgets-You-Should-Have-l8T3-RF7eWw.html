it takes strength patience and even a
little imagination to get the perfect
shot and not all shots are perfect
what's even worse the sophisticated
operations of cameras can confuse even
the most seasoned photographers
introducing case air case air is the
smallest Wi-Fi DSLR remote controller
when you connect your phone to the case
air you can adjust the parameter of the
camera with the app in the distance so
you no longer get anxious with your
cameras complex functions using case air
photos can be taken nice and easily
all you have to do is just set up and
wait the case air also works great with
a robotic camera mount and tripod and
experience the Handy accuracy through
the app
once you are done the photos will be
automatically downloaded to the app
using the Wi-Fi connection case air is
not just for photography using the case
robotic camera mount you can remote
control the movement to the camera
during the video recording with a touch
of a button and share your photos
instantly the case air is small as a
size of a key size is 2.4 inch by one
point six inch by point four inch only
50 grams it's convenient and portable
you can mount it anywhere you like que
ser is equipped with a six hour work
time and nine hours standby time it is
compatible with three camera USB
interfaces and supports for operation
systems whoo yes ago we launched the
kitchen with a while on the India Go Go
with the part of our backers we improve
the software architecture and added a
video control and photo transfer
functions then expanded the software
from iOS and Android to Windows and the
Mac now the software has been updated to
version 2.3 and has more than 20,000
users our products receive lots of
feedback from kids community based on
that we started to challenge the
limitation of electrical and the
mechanical design we decrease the size
by 70% improve the structure and the
making it a more reliable for the first
generation the Wi-Fi signal will not
have activity so we took six months to
optimize the antenna although we made
the four samples and fill the four times
finally we made it at the fifth time now
the new product is light and the works
excellent so we named it
Kate air but his air is a
and ready for mass production it is
designed by faith community and develop
the by shearing tack without the support
of our users who will never been
completed so join this wonderful
community help us to develop innovative
products together
a wide-angle lens is a basic very
important part for every photographers
bag there are a lot of wide-angle lenses
in the market but most of them are
suffering from either dramatic barrel
distortion poor corner sharpness or a
too bulky to carry over the last two
years
Venus optics has launched a number of
lenses to meet the unique needs of
photographers today we are launching the
Loudwire
12 millimeter at 2.8 an incredible ultra
wide-angle lens with close to zero
Distortion we have spent a lot of time
to design and develop a rectilinear lens
which can overcome the weaknesses of
existing wide-angle lenses on the market
we also need the lens to be fast and
wide enough for all types of photography
from landscape architecture
interior
to travel
and astrophotography
the low wire 12 millimeter F 2.8 gives
you an extreme 122 degrees angle of view
allowing you to compose an impressive
landscape photo with ease it also allows
you to capture the beauty of
architecture with close to zero
distortion even if you're shooting a
small house it will still look spacious
and impactful in your photos
keeping barrel distortion out of images
from ultra wide-angle lenses is
challenging the ultra wines in the
market tend to suffer from two to five
percent distortion the wider the lens
the higher chance of distortion our
design team took on the challenge and
came up with an optical design which can
successfully minimize the distortion to
an extremely low level you'll struggle
to see any straight lines which have
been distorted and what about the size
people are amazed at how small and light
our low wire lenses when compared to
other ultralights and fast lenses on the
market you can insert a hundred
millimeter neutral density filters and a
105 millimeter circular polarizer into
our optional filter holder to create the
best landscape photo ever it weighs just
610 grams and has a front diameter of 77
millimeters our low wire lens is
currently the fastest 12 millimeter lens
in the market for full-frame cameras the
large aperture is perfect for
astrophotography where a shorter
exposure time is really critical for
that perfect Milkyway shot and of course
it is also extremely convenient for
shooting action in limited light or in
an indoor environment in order to be the
best ultra wide-angle lens an
outstanding optical performance cannot
be compromised housed with 16 lens
elements including three extra low
dispersion elements and two a spherical
lens elements our low wire lens gives
excellent sharpness and contrast from
corner to corner chromatic aberration is
also extremely well controlled
Wow Wow 12 millimeters F 2.8 is the best
ultra wide-angle lens that everyone has
been driven for and now the prototypes
are ready we need your support to
realize this dream and send allies to
cereal production thank you for
supporting us to develop extraordinary
lenses thank you
when I go out to shoot pictures I used
to have to bring my GPS unit remote
shutter control and a bunch of other
devices with me until I got this neat
little gadget called pin out pin out has
all the functions I need so I don't need
anything else
I bring pinout everywhere I go
it works beautifully with my smartphone
records the locations information and
embeds it into the photos I take
automatically the other day I went to
shoot a short time lapse video I simply
open the pinout app for my smartphone
set all the necessary parameters and
enjoyed every moment of my
transformation into a samurai
pinout can also remotely control up to
ten cameras simultaneously here I set up
nine cameras to automatically detect my
every move
from different angles
with pinout I'll never miss another
shudder chance pinout is a must to shoot
night scenes
with pinouts remote shutter function I
can avoid small vibrations that leave
too blurry pictures
I also use pinout and I'm on the move on
my way back I set pinout to shoot the
street scene every fifty meters from my
car
I had an incredible day I can't wait to
see the pictures
this is all the magic of pinout
hi my name is Alex from a company called
fly onyx and welcome to our Kickstarter
campaign at fly onyx we specialize in
remote camera platforms for film and
television production with a history of
designing building and operating
unmanned aerial systems we understand
the challenges of providing stable
footage and strive to overcome these
issues
we've already developed a camera
stabilizer that provides rock-solid
stable footage we call it the F 25 this
system is a 3-axis gyro stabilized
camera gimbal offering affordability and
quality in a lightweight but incredibly
robust package
working closely with filmmakers camera
operators and industry leaders it became
clear that there was a gap in the market
for a stabilizer that integrates
seamlessly with existing film and
television equipment for this reason we
are developing an advanced system that
we call the f95 machined from aircraft
grade aluminium the f95 is raising the
bar in strength and durability whilst
maintaining a lightweight framework with
an airy dovetail slider as standard for
camera mounting operators for the first
time take their current setup from
tripod to stabilizer in one simple
action with motor lock outs for each
axis and fine precision adjustment
screws on the camera tray the often
frustrating task of balancing the rig
has never before been quicker or easier
incredibly high talk brushless motor
technology allows for payloads of up to
10 kilograms and covers a huge range of
cameras lenses and accessory
configurations we are looking for your
help to Kickstarter's in the production
of our new stabilizers we are looking to
raise 25,000 pounds to enable us to
purchase additional tooling for our CNC
milling machines this will aid us in the
development of more complex components
and in turn cut down on machining time
allowing us to keep our products
sensibly priced we will also use a
portion of the money to develop a simple
to use app with a Bluetooth interface
for quick tuning of the stabilizers when
changing configuration
thanks for taking the time to watch our
video we really appreciate your support
and can't wait to deliver exciting new
products
you
hi Kickstarter's my name is ivan from
custom SLR and i'm really excited to
introduce our next project we call it
the pro dot a tactile shutter release
button for cameras the pro dot instantly
enhances the most critical engagement
point of your camera the shutter button
as it turns out
camera shutter buttons often require
your finger to fully depress to capture
a shot this often results in delay or
necessary vibrations leading to miss
shots the pro dot enhances your shooting
experience and puts her fingertip at
instant engagement so you can capture
better photos is built with a vibration
free material that reduces shaking and
improves comfort originally designed for
cameras we also found more uses from pro
dot
you
Kickstarter's we need your help to get
this project going and explore new
applications for the protoid thank you
for your support and have a great day
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
