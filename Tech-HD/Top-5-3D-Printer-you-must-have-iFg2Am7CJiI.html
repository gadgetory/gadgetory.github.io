the power of a 1 and a quarter
horsepower CNC mill a laser cutter and
3d printer has an all-in-one machine
each tool exists as a rapid change
attachment providing the user the
ability to switch from mill to laser the
3d printer in buildings our vision is to
break the barriers from makers by
equipping them with a creative power of
a personal machine shop that's small
affordable and easy to use while
immersed in a thriving startup ecosystem
of Pittsburgh my brother and I
discovered the need for foxy here we
joined a rich maker scene and gain
access to specialized manufacturing
tools accessible fab labs and maker
spaces like that shot we were inspired
by the powerful new tools and access the
manufacturing level regime is offered by
maker spaces and we wanted more so we
focused our attention on creating a
series of high quality desktop tools
that embody the precision and the
features that were once only accessible
large numbers with a purpose of making
those machines available in the price
and makers inventors students and
designers can afford and thus Boxey was
born Boxey has the precision and
reliability of a professional machine
with an industry-leading movement
resolution of 4 microns resource
industrial ball screws manufactured all
aluminum components and added stainless
steel hardware and then assembled them
into an all aluminum anodized body
creating the sturdiest co2 capture
machine on the market and one accessible
to the average maker
Boxey can shape most materials you can
source from plastics to hardwoods metals
Boxey is a true personal makerspace
allowing readers to move rapidly through
design iterations and empowering small
businesses to produce individualize
products for customers
Boxey gives fabricators the ability to
use methods switching rapidly from 3d
printing to CNC milling to laser cutting
the very same component to accomplish
this we designed boxy to integrate all
three tools into one clean easily use
interface Boxey is precise durable and
reliable and so easy to use that fresh
makers can create complex components
with boxy weaved a couple professional
quality fascia from location and
decentralize the power of precision
manufacturing Boxey is a mobile machine
shop a desktop makerspace with your help
we can start manufacturing boxy we give
everyone access to professional level
maker tools take start boxing so we can
make your space a makerspace now is the
time to think inside the box
the beast is a 3d printer with a massive
build volume and is capable of printing
four identical objects at the same time
making it the perfect machine for anyone
looking to pump out truly gigantic
prints or speed up production of
repetitive leaf printed parts hi I'm
Josh and I'm Dan
we're from cultivate 3d and this is a
beast combining the best in print
quality with a huge build volume with
the beasts precise motion system you
will get an extremely fine print
resolution and an enormous scale we've
put a ton of effort into making all core
structural components as precise as
possible with the best quality laser-cut
components one of our design
considerations was to make the best
flexible we have a ton of great add ons
for the beasts which are currently in
development which will transform its
functionality and rest assured
Kickstarter investors will be rewarded
with generous discounts when they're
released in the coming months
so you'll probably notice the Beast
isn't covered with a fancy case design
we don't want the beast to be a design
statement we want the Beast to be the
best of what it does without costing a
fortune we spend our time and money
making your investment our fast precise
production printer we're really excited
about the possibilities the beast will
create for so many different individuals
and businesses from artists and
industrial designers to eBay as
replicating their latest idea in massive
scale cultivate 3d and the Beast 3d
printer will help you get there fast the
Beast is a finished product it's not a
prototype or idea production has already
begun
so come on investors order yours today
and be part of something bigger
hi we're the team behind Tico as
inventors we constantly used 3d printers
to create and test our ideas but every
3d printer we used fell short of our
expectations they were heavy over
complicated and unreliable
we often spent more time calibrating our
printers than printing our inventions so
we came up with a simple solution
unibody this is Tico the unibody 3d
printer most 3d printer frames are built
using separate rails unibody means the
rails are built into the chassis
creating one solid piece one solid piece
you knit body and with this simple shift
in design all the problems that came
from separate rail systems disappeared
more reliable and accurate Tico sets a
new standard for 3d printers and it
doesn't stop at unibody Chico has an
internal filament tray and closed bill
chamber auto safety shutoff a large
print volume a flexible base wireless
connectivity and cloud-based software so
you can print from almost anywhere on
any internet friendly device with Chico
we've not only set a new standard for
design but for price too Tico is only
one hundred and seventy nine dollars yup
one seven nine that's the beauty of
unibody design it's better and it cost
less to manufacture we could set the
price higher but we want everyone to
have at ego this is where we need your
help we use 3d printing to create Chico
imagine all the ideas that could become
realities imagine what you could build
back us today and let's find out
you
hi Kickstarter's my name is lutz I'm
glad to introduce you the oval or 3d
printer Overlord is a desktop 3d printer
for everyone it's a smart aleck end and
user friendly printer that brings new
experiences
we started making 3d printers since 2011
after lots of research our first printer
or successful but we wanted to make it
even better we wanted to make an
affordable sweidy printer that runs
faster builds taller and fits nicely in
everywhere
we work with world-class industrial
design firm Roma to create a unique and
stylish outlook home door
you can even choose from our color
comfort to fit it better with your home
classroom and studio we also partnered
with the F open an open source hardware
provider to customize the high quality
electronic parts and models or these
efforts who made only to ensure the high
performance and precision to make award
more than just a bunch of metal and
positive parts besides precise
engineering and beautiful display Google
ov is also smart you don't have to be an
expert in 3d printing and needle will
you struggle during situations like
feeding rejecting or leveling we had a
power of protection and break assumed to
overload so you will no longer be
troubled with blackouts or careless
operations now you can focus on
perfecting your own design
you
hi there we are the most fun team after
16 months of development we have reached
a point where we are proud to present to
you most fun Pro RF DMS desktops 3d
printer
the most fun Pro has a full metal body
ensuring its strength and structural
stability is guaranteed in addition
because it is made from aluminum the 3d
printer weighs only 8 pounds the
extruder is d√©part we have spent the
most amount of time on during the
development process not only does it
print with high precision it can also
print 5 centimeter bridges another
feature we have included with the
extruder is auto bed leveling you put a
pressure sensor on the side of the
nozzle by gently touching to train a
corner the 3d printer can compensate
with a slant angle of the tray apart
from standard PLA we have also refined
extruder to be compatible with other
materials like TPU which is a flexible
material and even wax with which you can
print your own candles
we have not stop there we have also
designed extruder to be easily removable
so that it is easy to maintain another
important aspect of the most fun Pro 3d
printer is that we are using the Intel
Edison module therefore there is no need
for additional driver or software
installations you can either connect to
printer peer-to-peer directly with your
device or you can also share this
printer in your local network
with its wireless accessibility you can
access the control panel by scanning the
QR code with this you can choose and
print the model directly from their
mobile devices when the printing is
complete de printer will automatically
send an email to you
we have also added an auto resuming
function to secure your work in case the
power is cut off unexpectedly we have
completed over 80% of our product and
are currently undergoing final revisions
to enhance the overall experience we
have already gathered important feedback
from over 400 different users during the
development stages today marks the start
of our Kickstarter campaign and we
deeply appreciate that you are embarking
on this exciting journey with us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
