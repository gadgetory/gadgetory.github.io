I miss my childhood those days when I
could paint without a care in the world
I don't know one like just don't paint
anymore there's never any time then
hounds just what I needed to relive my
passion the river the color sheets a
tiny booklet of 16 vibrant transparent
water colors which easily opens into a
full count they dry instantly and are so
tiny that I can safely carry them around
in my purse and the best part is that I
can paint anywhere inspiration stress in
the park over a cup of coffee or even in
the subway while traveling to the office
that easy the colors mix beautifully and
they are highly saturated so that you
just need a little bit for a rich stroke
so once that is on for several paintings
it's amazing to relive all those
childhood memories once in a while but
without all that mess this is a color
sheet paint anywhere
hello IndieGoGo I am Aditya the founder
of the vive colors I'm at Orion medical
student studying in Mumbai I've always
been passionate about painting but ever
since I joined med school these big pad
books have made sure that I do seem to
be honest I'd still do it
if only I had the colors and then I wish
to paint it is just so inconvenient to
carry the colors the half pans cube
ballads and the bottles and so to fix
this I developed the Reviva color since
I've been working on these colors for
the last two years now trying to get
them just right as you see they're
specially formulated so that they're dry
but are still easy to pick with a wet
brush let me quickly show you how they
work all I have to do is wet my brush a
little bit pick the color and that's it
you get this rich vivid color on paper
it's literally that evening so in these
last two years I sampled about 200
products to artists across the world and
based on their feedback went through
different iterations improving design
after design and I'm proud to present to
you the finest and the best paviva
policy
this is a set of 16 transparent
watercolors which is specifically chosen
for urban and outdoor painting they're
indexed at the bottom which helps
navigate quickly and easily between beta
the shade between two colors is
specially formulated so that it repels
water and prevents them from sticking
and one final thing I've made this
really beautiful premium wooden case for
the color sheet which you can
personalize mine scribing your name and
a message or a book which makes it a
great gift idea right away and specially
for you folks you can unlock this reward
50 by simply sharing this campaign on
social read as you saw the product is
ready for production now all I need just
to buy the raw materials in bulk to get
the right price which is where I need
your help so please support this
campaign and we live the childhood joy
of painting</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
