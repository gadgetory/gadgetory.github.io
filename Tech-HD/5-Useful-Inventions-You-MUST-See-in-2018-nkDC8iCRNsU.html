looks pretty familiar like the one you
slept on last night but here's what you
might not realize this pillow isn't
doing you any favors
that's because most pillows only focus
on supporting the back of your head your
neck and spine are left to fend for
themselves leaving your upper back
slouching all night long then you get up
go to work and sit hunched in front of a
computer or use your smartphone all day
it's no wonder bad posture is such a
problem in the modern world but here's
good news this is true pillow the answer
to bad posture that works while you
sleep

routines required who's got the time for
that anyway true pillow guarantees
better posture in just 30 nights of
sleep it's great for back sleepers and
side sleepers the longer wedge helps you
even out your upper back other posture
pillows just can't do that when you've
got good posture you look better feel
better and are more confident and true
pillow can make that happen with no work
on your part all you have to do is
switch out your pillow it's that easy
true pillow relieves stress and relaxes
your muscles while providing firm
natural support for your head neck and
back it works hard for you all night to
improve and prevent unattractive forward
head posture and helps fix rolled
shoulders back us today to sleep soundly
