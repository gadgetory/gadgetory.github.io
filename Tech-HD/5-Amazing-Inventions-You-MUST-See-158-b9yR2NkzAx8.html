spectacular supersonic flying machines
that fight for our freedom what if there
was a way to contain all of that in a
small beautiful and useful everyday item
we give you jet K upcycling fighter jet
engine blades into keychains bottle
openers and desk candy but hold on for a
second let's first take a short flight
to Greece where people admire and
respect fighter pilots and their jets to
the point where they proudly display
monuments of them in their communal
spaces comparing the slide in a
passenger airplane with a flight in a
fighter jet is like comparing a ride on
a bus in they ride on a Formula One
racing the excitement is
its power is brutal this blade is at the
core of the engine speed at 10,000 rpm
he gives will jet fuel and air are mixed
and ignited to reach a temperature of
more than a thousand degrees Fahrenheit
its material is a super alloy made not
only to withstand all of that but to
perform reliably in it the idea of jet K
was born on a beautiful Friday afternoon
between hungers anti-aircraft guns and
training airplanes that pile of scrap
metal looked really interesting so I
asked my father what were they going to
do with it he told me it was going to be
sold to some old junk dealers
I couldn't believe such a waste all of
these stories all of this metal and then
it hit me by and upcycle it into
something beautiful and useful that was
it some weeks later the jet K team is
already set up and working on it
so the stories are driving the product
in our engineering and embassy
the blades are being mechanical engineer
to the CNC milling machine and precisely
engraved with a young lady we make sure
that the graphics engraved on the blades
are minimal stunning and described in
short what it is that you're holding in
your hand
nothing more nothing less my job is to
make sure that the development of the
product is done using the last word in
engineering software and information
technologies I manage the company
servers and everything else that thinks
and works in binary and I am the eyes
and ears of the outside world inside
deadly conspiracy is something we're
very serious about fields of cake and
I'm its gatekeeper all of our blades
keychains bottle openers and death candy
have been used by our beta testers for
more than 30 life hacks to do the job of
cutters pry tools can openers fruit
peelers shoehorns nail files and more
see that you can join us back dead kid

hi there Kickstarter folks my name is

all wearing the know soft look I love
the fact that the style is common it's

need for this product and say hello to
