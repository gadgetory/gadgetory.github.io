never run dry for me it's like magic
because out of the air and Sun we are
bringing this world to fill itself with
drinkable world created a compost small
and efficient technology completely
independent and easy to use
hi I'm Bowen I'm an electrical engineer
the develop a self-sufficient system
that uses a cooler
it combines the moisture from the air hi
I'm Brian in charge of engineering and
develop far this comes in two variations
the porters ride is designed for bikers
and uses the Airstream to press air into
the bottle the font is arrow is the
second version and is a standalone unit
that does not need to be in motion to
function we've been working on fountas
for a couple of years now here at the
University of Applied Arts in Vienna and
our efforts have been rewarded already
with several design awards we would like
you to become a part of to the venture
and support us so that we can continue
with the development of Pontus and be
able to prepare it for production
join us in making this vision come to
life thanks for believing promise
