starlit night it's a day and night
difference capture your experiences and
every sense of the action with Aurora's
still high speed burst slow-mo

life doesn't stop when the Sun Goes Down
have you ever found yourself camping
hiking or hanging out with friends and
you want to capture that perfect moment
but it's just too dark the aurora was
built for that action cameras today can
do some amazing things but they don't
see well in low-light night-vision
equipment sees great and low light but I
can't do it action cameras can do the
Aurora is a marriage between those two
worlds it's the first product that
provides all the features of an action
camera but can see in pretty much any
lighting situation you can see from the
noonday Sun to the moonless night
psyonix has been developing the Aurora
for about 18 months and we're just about
ready to launch but we need your help to
bring awareness to the product ramp
production and that all the accessories
for your life's adventures thank you so
much for your support and I hope that
the Aurora can bring your night to life
despite electronics coming a long way
even the latest water-resistant phones
still can't be taken in salt water
that's where the splash zero shorts come
in what if the shorts that I was wearing
can keep everything that I needed
completely dry even in the water so I'll
design the splash Sarah shorts the first
in the world to have a completely
waterproof pocket the secrets the
world's strongest permanent magnet they
create a completely waterproof seal and
when you let go they snap together to
create an instant waterproof lock in
fact the patented goop the dry pocket we
use is certified to over 100 feet on the
water the pressure pushes the magnets
even tighter together reinforcing the
sill says even more watertight that
means in the roughest conditions the
stuff stays bone dry our clothes
shouldn't have Takashi earth and I
wanted to make sure splashy arrow had as
little impact as possible in the
environment that's why they're made from
completely recycled material in fact 92%
in fabric comes directly from recycled
plastic bottles splash sarah has you
covered with water repelling fabric that
dries in under 30 minutes so it will be
the fastest drying pair of shorts you'll
ever own the splash their shorts are
perfect for traveling with a double lock
system ensures you keep unwanted hands
off but now we need you we need you to
back the project so we can bring splash
zero to life and you can get the shorts
will take you truly anywhere back us Val
splash zero go anyway</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
