introducing Starbucks the first sport
watch with integrated walkie-talkie is
specially designed for outdoor
activities
invented during the Second World War
walkie-talkies have always looked heavy
and bulky designed for function but not
for aesthetics we wanted to change them
and develop a product that is different
a walkie talkie that is small enough to
fit into a SmartWatch without
compromising on the technical features
and design
if you're an outdoor enthusiast you know
the situations when you do not have cell
phone signal when it's just not
convenient to dial numbers or open apps
sometimes it's just easier to have just
a button to push and talk communication
is important you don't want to get lost
when you're leaving your comfort zone
and trying to discover new areas
Starbucks is not just a walkie-talkie
but a SmartWatch designed for outdoor
sports enthusiasts Starbucks comes with
a lot of features useful for your daily
life and improving your security
it's important for us to build up a
community of like-minded people so we
have included an app for sharing your
experience with Starbucks Starbucks is
compatible with other walkie-talkies and
can also help to spread your message to
a group of people we are a team of
outdoor sports and boosts lists and it
happened that we got lost in nature we
like to travel to the untouched parts of
nature and found out there are a lot of
places with no phone signal so we wanted
to create something that helps us in
this situation but still is convenient
in daily life and not heavy to carry
engineering and design with a big
challenge we wanted to bring the
technology into such a small gadget and
had to find a solution to implement the
antenna in the wristband we have been
working with different suppliers for the
housing and electronics and tried to
modify details again and again
now we are ready to bring star Vox alive
please support us today
introducing my canoe the world's first
foldable origami canoe traditional
canoes are cumbersome and nearly
impossible to travel with in a small
vehicle we wanted to experience the joy
of canoeing wherever our travels take us
or simply out our back door a canoe that
folds into a compact box was the best
solution my canoe is packed and carried
to any location easily without
sacrificing quality or performance and
will fit any lifestyle my canoe kind of
was able to meet both my requirements of
being lightweight small and compact that
I can put it away in storage but it also
allowed me to versatility to still have
weekends away and go on the adventures
that I like
my canoe is easily assembled at any
location in 10 to 15 minutes every piece
in the kit is used in the building just
really simple a couple of clicks and it
was all time
it was important to us that my canoe not
sacrifice on quality and durability just
to fit into a box
we tested my canoe to exceed
professional standards developing our
hull from a proprietary polypropylene
with a UV treatment that has been rated
up to 20,000 folds
while ensuring quality it was important
to us to make sure that we kept the
experience true to traditional canoes
once again on the water it was exactly
like any other Cunha I've ever paddle my
canoe has already come a long way we
just need your contribution to add
finishing touches and scale our
production to get my canoe into your
hands
