hot tea and so do we
but there is a problem the electric
kettle everyone always overfill it
hitting excess water and wasting energy
research proves at one day of extra
energy use from overfilling Electric
kilos it's enough to light all the
streetlights in England for a night with
Mito we set out to solve this problem
meter only heats as much water as you
need in the vessel of your choice simply
fill your cup with water place it onto
the induction bass and immerse the rod
in the liquid the base then heats the
disc of the rod which heats the liquid
surrounding it giving you the exact
amount of hot water you wanted we
focused on a simple and elegant design
that is intuitive to use
me to adjust to your needs you can heat
milk for a hot chocolate or warm up the
food for your baby
are you having guests over no problem
just prepare an entire a tea kettle for
everyone to share Mito starred is a
graduation project and now a year and a
half later we have our working prototype
we have been working endlessly on the
design and the user experience and the
electronics revolutionize how the
liquids will be heated in the future
over the course of last few months we
want multiple innovation and design
awards and thousands of people reached
out to us asking for meto
now our next chapter begins and we need
your support
it's time to be gearing up for
manufacture and that requires huge
resources Media is a small product but
with the big impact
imagine the positive change we could
make if everybody started using Mito so
let's give a mark in this world even if
it's just a scratch
you
let's face it water can be lots of fun
until we need to drink it sure we know
it's healthy but it just doesn't taste
as exciting as all those flavored drinks
which means we drink a lot less water
and a whole lot more of that job hey and
that's a problem a very big problem so
we decided to put some fun into drinking
water with the right cup it's the
world's first-ever fruit flavoured cup
designed to get people drinking more
water sure it might look simple but it
actually took six years of research and
patented technologies to get where we
are today and we believe it's gonna be a
real game-changer
so how does it work well for starters
our brain identifies flavor using two
main senses taste and smell that's why
we inserted innovative FDA approved
fruit scent and flavor directly into the
right Cup so when you drink water from
it your nose picks up four fruity aroma
your tongue senses the hint of a sweet
taste and your brain yells when in fact
you're only drinking natural water Wow
sounds great but does it work well we
asked ourselves that very same question
so we put the right cup to the test with
our orange flavored prototype
whoa okay Wow
you're kidding me right what's in this
is not just water tastes on something
else
just water it's crazy brilliant just
brilliant now that we know that it works
let's meet the team behind the idea for
years I've been researching and
lecturing about scent marketing showing
how easy it is to manipulate the brain
with smell when I was 30 I was diagnosed
with diabetes and my doctors told me to
drink only water but I hated the taste
that's when I came up with the idea for
the right cup after years of research
and development we've reached the stage
where we need your support to turn the
right cup into reality the right cup is
great for anyone who wants to cut down
on sugary drinks and drink more water
which is basically everybody please help
us change lives of millions of people by
supporting our project on IndieGoGo
together we can make a real difference
and turn the world into a better and
healthier place one cup at a time
let's make drinking water fun again

how it works
bubble cap is very simple to use and
that's the adapter to a co2 cartridge
secure public up to a water bottle join
bubble cap to the adapter and press down
gently with the lever movement then you
hear the gas hissing out from the top of
bottle cap and bubbles are no longer
coming into the water raise bubble cap
off and mix carbon dioxide into the
water add carbon dioxide according to
taste
this is my wife she is an artist she
designed the chorus type of bubble cap
she likes water with bubbles even more
bubble cap is so useful and it is easy
to take along for hiking and other
activities
