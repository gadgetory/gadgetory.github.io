driving while looking down at your phone
is not safe so what if we put our phone
on our windshield that's not any better
if you can't see me than I obviously
can't see you
we're here to provide a safer way to
access the calls text and navigation you
need without taking your eyes off the
road
since 2015 we are highly up and
developing products to help people drive
safer after launching our first head-up
display
we took customer feedback from the
audience easiest to the everyday driver
to help develop our second-generation
product the hudley Wireless
our new head-up display is now wireless
and boasts a larger sharper display just
like before you can customize your
driving experience by casting any app
directly in your line of sight and it
works at virtually any car public
Wireless decreases the likelihood of an
accent by letting you see both the road
and vital driving information at the
same time why not just mount your phone
to the windshield not only does this
block your view but it also forces your
eyes to refocus every time you look away
from the road and down at your phone for
directions hudley caster directions into
the distance eliminating this need to
refocus and increasing your awareness of
what's happening on the road hudley also
adapts your environment automatically
adjust the brightness based on the
lighting conditions outside best part
setup is easy and there is no technical
knowledge required
what really sets hudley apart from the
competition is our 6.2 inch
high-resolution display that uses a flat
panel to achieve a one-to-one reflection
unlike the curved displays on the market
while curved displays magnified images
they also degrade image quality our
product has been engineered to have the
widest viewing angle allowing both the
driver and passenger to be able to see
the information casted we've made no
compromises to color clarity or image
quality and believe that we have the
best head-up display around what's
really exciting about hudley is that it
is a seamless experience just like
everything else in my household so from
Apple Play to Sonos to my nest hudley
fits right in I really appreciate just
the quality in terms of clarity
especially with mounts like this like
you want something to be dead simple
super clear and giant X ugly makes the
driving experience really safe it's it's
one of those things you know if you're
paying attention to the road I think
it's pretty easy to be a safe driver but
nowadays with like technology and stuff
I'm I'm constantly looking at my phone
and I think that's caused more issues
for me than anything else so having what
I need kind of right in front of me
without really obstructing my view or
causing me to look away from the road
has made a big difference while there
are many great apps for hunting we
weren't completely satisfied so we
designed our own app we designed it to
take full advantage of Uglies hardware
advancements your phone now acts as a
secondary control panel with quick
access to programs optimized for a
head-up display
hugly Wireless is more than just a
head-up display it's a completely new
experience designed around smarter
driving we have a new immersive path and
hardware created in partnership with a
leading home display manufacturer with
over eight years of experience we're
back again to help raise funds to help
lower the cost of manufacturing hudley
help us bring an affordable device to
the market the economy of scale we can
get from a large P order is important to
make our project a reality like our last
campaign we're confident that we'll be
able to deliver on time thanks for your
support
on average we spend about 50 minutes
driving per day and we like to listen to
our music while in the car many cars
nowadays are equipped with the USB port
that supports only iPhone with Android
phone you know that there is no way to
connect your phone to the car via USB
connection and get the same level of
control and convenience iPhone users are
enjoying introducing wire lengths a
smart Android USB cable converter
connect it to a car's USB port wire link
will convert your car stereo into a
fully Android compatible system with
wire link all your music is integrated
into the car stereo system all you need
is to connect the wire link to your
phone and play the music use web radio
Spotify Google music or any other apps
of your choice with the best digital
sound quality possible once you are
connected you don't have to pick up your
phone you can change tracks playlists
stations and navigate your music with
car stereo buttons or steering wheel
that makes it easy and safe to use your
Android phone for music while driving my
name is Dmitry Boris laughs I'm a
founder of ramadi as the karate
enthusiastic keep seeing the frustration
that people have while trying to connect

that repeats itself time and time again
my name is Michael Brown old and I'm the
CEO of LFO and my name is Michael J and
i'm the president of LFO for the past
decade we've been creating lifestyle
devices enhancing quality of life for
the whole family

that could possibly prevent children
from being left behind it's called the e
clip and it attaches to the baby's car
seat a seatbelt or even a piece of
clothing just attach the e clip and
switch it on using safe low energy
Bluetooth communication and our Android
or iOS smartphone app Eclipse sounds an
alarm if you accidentally go more than
15 feet from your car without removing
your child or turning off the e clip
eclip can also send a text message to
your spouse parents or friend to remind
them to take the baby out of the car a
tip will also warn you if the
temperature in the backseat is too high
or low ensuring it's comfortable and
safe for your baby no smart phone equip
comes with a Bluetooth Aoife for your
keychain it will sound an alarm if
you've left a baby in the car the e clip
is expected to have a retail cost below
$30 making it not just a necessary
safety tool but in the foldable tool as
well the unique equip app will be
available via the Apple or Google store
so anyone with a smartphone will be able
to use it we have a lot of experience
