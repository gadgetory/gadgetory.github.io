the back of their heads as nice as that
would be I still couldn't get it done
without the help of Argos the world's
first wire free HD smart security camera
I mean with two kids and a husband that
can count as a third I need eyes
everywhere and at all times
something that can be my eyes and ears
when I'm away so I can virtually keep my
eyes here here and even here
hello please leave the package by the
door
Thanks I'm pretty much the most powerful
being in the universe I can even make
cookies disappear now I've a new
arch-nemesis mom calls her new
futuristic sidekick Argos four serves
just one and now they've multiplied and
with the two-way audio capability Oh
what are you doing
officially ruining my cover all I want
is a better sense of security for my
family and home is that too much to ask
I just want my family to be safe and
secure
I'm not worried though they'll warm up
to it don't even think about it
and 14 now almost 15 I'm practically an
adult I'll be driving soon I never had
issues of sneaking out until my mom got
these stupid cameras I get caught one
time and now we have night-vision
cameras really mom I just wanna go with
my friends and not have a curfew is that
too much to ask and now they can see me
in the dark
grounded why are they trying to ruin my
wife well look I enjoy everyone
anybody's life here but I'm not a bad
guy honest I swear my name is wait we've
all got a job to do right I mean it's
just business most cameras are easy to
evade but I couldn't get close because
of the motion census I mean I barely
made it on the steps of Illuminati Oh
time to go ready maybe you're not so bad
after all
Argus has become so much more than just
a wire free HD weatherproof night vision
piece of technology it's become a
functioning part of this family
providing security and protection
whenever and wherever I need it Argus
wire free secure smart
