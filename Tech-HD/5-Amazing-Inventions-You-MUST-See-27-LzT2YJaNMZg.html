podracing is the stuff of sci-fi and yet
say it's a reality fpv flying and racing
is an international phenomenon but
getting into it isn't so easy there are
no really fast ready to fly fpv drones
on the market today and building your
own takes time tons of research and
hours of tuning we knew there had to be
a better way so we made pinkie drone
most fpv drugs are not much more than
carbon fiber and motors but we wanted to
build something clean elegant and
aerodynamic not just another fpv drone
with the drone of our dreams after much
research we decided to go with the blend
of carbon fiber skeleton and a composite
thermoplastic skin this combination make
stinky aerodynamic lightweight and yet
incredibly tough and impact resistant
the ax shaped frame gives tanky the
perfect balance and weight distribution
this means taking is stunningly agile
and responsive thinking may resemble the
drone so you have seen in the stores but
its performance is nothing alike every
flight is adrenaline Pat you can spin
toral and cut through the air or race
across fields with unbelievable speed as
you perfect your piloting skills tanki
will continue to grow with you it comes
with three flight profiles geared
towards beginner intermediate and expert
pilot and a remotely tiltable camera
that allows you to fly slowly and law
and smoothly or really lean in and hit
incredible speeds
tanky was designed with a lot of input
from the FPV racing community to be
supremely competitive on any race track
if you have the skills take you will
help you get that first place finish
every time
the tanky isn't limited to FPV racing
use it to explore and record the amazing
nature around you and experience the
world like never before
and you don't have to worry about
crashing tinky over and over again
because tinky is extremely tough
