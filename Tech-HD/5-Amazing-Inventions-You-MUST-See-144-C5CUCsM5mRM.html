I click started my name is Sharif and
I'm the foul
of Kuna grill an elegant smart and
portable tabletop charcoal grill the
story of una started when my dad decided
to improvise a tabletop grill
he ended up scorching the tabletop he
decided to make a solution that works
and his first prototypes became my
inspiration to create Puna grill so we
sought the help of the best
professionals we could find one a half
years ago we were contacted by from his
dad and they had a really good idea for
new barbecue they said look around to
ask us how we could help them out so
pretty much straight away we started
sort of in a conceptual design process
we started thinking about ideas and
coming up with different opportunities
and looking at the user experience and
finding out how we can improve it so we
looked into trying to create a simple
clean product that was understandable by
everybody that could go in the
dishwasher and also that you could carry
with you to the park or to the beach or
out and about more of a lifestyle
product than a than a heavy sort of a
garden object basically what we decided
to do was to try and tackle one of the
main problems of barbecues which is that
the ground gets too hot is that we tried
to use the lid as the stand for the
barbecue and that raises the barbecue
off the ground and basically means that
the tabletop or their grass or whatever
doesn't get too hot and then also we
decided to put in this little clever
feature where you can turn the top grill
over and that's got some dedicated
skewer locations where you can actually
then put some little skewers on the top
granting their vegetables or meat or
whatever you fancy really amazing out of
this product it's really really good I
think we worked really hard for last 18
months coming up with something that
we're all proud of here as a team I
can't wait to use an outside grilling
and I especially love the green box it's
the same color as my old Volkswagen that
camper
so that'll propose don't be perfect it's
amazing how far we've come in two years
we worked on every detail and overcame
many challenges it's been such a
wonderful journey since that first
incident with the scorch table
Kickstarter we come to you today to
realize a beam we've already raised
money from friends and family but it
takes more the tools are ready
prototype tested and approved and now
we're ready for manufacturing
you
in our backpacks we carry our most
important belongings but sometimes the
most important things are the easiest to
forget
how nice would it be to receive a
notification when you're leaving one of
your possessions behind
lay your backpack alert you meet the
t-track bye
you start by tagging your items and
registering them using the app from
there you can create lists for your
different activities by switching
between your lists the tea truck knows
what you need and you can be sure you're
ready for any situation if you happen to
forget something it will alert you
through its vibrating sensor and it push
notification on your smart phone
we've also included a USB charger so you
never run out of battery and a built-in
lock so you can work from anywhere with
peace of mind
if you forget you're back somewhere
simply check the last seen location on
the app in addition to its tracking
capabilities we've loaded the T track
with features that in our experience
have proven to be consumer favors for
many years in the market Soto was
founded by my father in Colombia and
from the beginning we have been focused
on making high quality products with
innovative solutions the T track project
was originally prototype in
collaboration with Stanford University
have Adriana University and Swinburne
University when I arrived that thought
though I realized that the future urban
traveller needed a product that was both
smart and functional with your support
we can revolutionize the way you carry
your items let t-track worry about your
things so you can focus on what matters
to you
in this beautiful yet unforgiving
environment we are dependent and
functional and reliable tools tools that
will last forever
and never let you down tools are aged
gracefully and improve over time as a
designer and a major I'm constantly
asked why things are the way they are
how they came about and what whoever
made them must have been thinking while
doing so so when I come across something
which has been brought into the world
with little care or no thought it annoys
me my mind immediately starts thinking
how it could be made better to create
whatever it may be we use tools be they
physical or digital they inform and
shape what we make and must play a
fundamental role in our creations when
you have a tool that does a job it's
supposed to do and is perfectly suited
to the task at hand there's a certain
magic this magic is on to inspire new
creations and sow the seeds and new
ideas
although tools which work can be a
source of inspiration
those that don't can equally be an
impetus for creating something better
hi I'm Odin the designer of heaven Havel
came about after I'd broken the lead on
my pencil one too many times
using your everyday pencil sharpener so
I set out to design the best pencil
sharpener I could possibly come up with
the result was Herbert I've had my first
prototypes made and I'm absolutely
thrilled with the results but now I need
your help
in order to put Havel into production so
back Covell today on Kickstarter and
wave goodbye to shoddy pencil sharpeners
forever
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
