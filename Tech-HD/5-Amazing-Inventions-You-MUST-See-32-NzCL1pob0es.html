Tokyo our concept was simple and can be
applied to endless activities we crafted
an innovative group talk app and a
rugged bluetooth earpiece we made the
bonks app very easy to use
one tap starts the group conversation
and it works effortlessly due to the
intuitive minimalist design
balks was custom designed to outperform
out comfort and outlast any
voice-over-ip app or standard Bluetooth
headset it goes anywhere your phone has
reception with completely unlimited
range you don't even need to touch a
button to talk because bonks is
voice-activated

hey there my name is Mike Sternoff these
my friends Devon O'Neill Kyle Johnston
our Kickstarter project is the mag belt
and magnetic belt that fits perfectly to
your waist slide here's how the belt
works there's a floating magnet in the
fixed magnet you put the belt around
your waist attach the floating magnet to
the fixed magnet that's about it you'd
slide the floating magnet and adjust it
to your waistline so if you get super
skinny or chunky monkey still fits great
the mad bout eliminates the problem of
belt overhang frame if you have to trim
or the need to poke new holes starting
now we're offering four different color
belts and buckles you could swap them
out to mix and match so 16 combinations
in total
also if you want a more simple look you
could lose the buck oh and go au
naturale Devon originally had the idea
for the sliding magnet system and his
grandma taught him how to sew on our
antique 1951 Singer sewing machine a
year in several prototypes later
Devon created the magda belt since Devon
can't hand so every belt himself we
partnered with us-based manufacturers it
really is the best belt I've ever worn
it's simple holds and just works I
really like to say it goes from meetings
to mountains please back our Kickstarter
in exchange we'll send you a belt back a
little more we'll send you some more
belts thank you
you

software and hardware to make your life

HD camera with motion detection night
vision internal memory and an integrated
battery we envision frame as the core of
your smart home with the fast-changing
smart home device market we wanted to
create something that you don't have to
get rid of after a year because the
innovation is mostly in the software
imagine
facial recognition motion detection
object recognition everything integrated
into the software platform after coming
up with the functionality of the camera
itself we knew that we needed to have
the best designers preferably in the
world to design something iconic there's
cameras out there really well known ones
like like Dropcam trois that feels like
a security camera and we wanted to
separate the notion of security as kind
of the primary function and really start
talking about people living with this
camera and having it be part of their
lifestyle and people's lives are pretty
hectic at the moment you get constant
text messages at the moment that might
not be the most convenient for you to
receive that message with the sticky
note feature you can record a message
for your loved ones the button has
different colors to it so you can say
Mama's red daddy's blue frame also works
with third-party devices let's say you
have a smart light bulb the camera sees
motion it turns on the light it's easy
to use it's subtle it's not intrusive
and it fits in any own life smart is at
the forefront of a non-invasive smart
home technology that helps you interact
in a more natural way if you support us
now you get an amazing product for an
incredible price and you help us achieve
our vision from all of us at life smart
we thank
this is a box
this is min Dobis who put his dream into
that box
this is mindo gasps dream a perfect
chair made from sixty loose elements
that you can put together any way you
want but the beginning of Mandela's
dream didn't start here you cannot make
anything beautiful without making your
hands dirty as always say for every
architect it's a dream to create the
church in the same way but every
designer in the world it's a dream to
create a perfect chair spin D consists
of 1260 pieces of wood put together by
hand each element is treated with
natural aural which makes it strong
enough to stand both inside and outside
the spindle is simple but the process is
super complicated actually it's the
human spine built into the perfect chair
very flexible and very very strong I
spent many nights building the
prototypes improving the technology
finding the perfect locking systems and
this is the hardest part of the process
making it smooth pitch all handmade and
needs a lot of patience the first time I
saw spin D it was during the exhibition
I touched it as I couldn't believe it it
felt like silk from that moment I just
knew is going to be a big journey we
went international exhibitions we won
international awards we were showing it
not as a simple chair but as a unique
piece of furniture with endless
possibilities spin D comes with a manual
of 25 detailed instructions showing that
you can build any chair it's just long
an armchair or well even your sports
equipment
one thing endless possibilities
to produce this chair it just takes too
long so that's why we're asking for your
support to simplify the process and to
bring this chair from exhibitions to
reality into your home during this
crowdfunding campaign we're offering a
very special edition of spend each year
with the proper endings for everyone
that buys still there on this
crowdfunding campaign we give a lifetime
guarantee because it is perfect
we are ready please help us to make our
dreams come true by sharing our campaign
every bit helps
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
