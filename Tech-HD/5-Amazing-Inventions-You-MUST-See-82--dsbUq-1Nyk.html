locating device it's tiny so you can
stick it on your kids your pets your
bike your luggage or anything important
you don't want to lose it can be found
miles away and lasts up to five months
on a single charge there are a lot of
tracking devices out there that are
supposed to make it easy to find things
so most of us aren't using them why
because Bluetooth devices only work
within 35 feet of your phone you can't
find your kids if they're playing
outside or your luggage if it's lost
halfway across the country and these GPS
devices which have a much larger range
are big clunky need to be constantly
recharged and have large monthly fees
ping is reinventing the locating device
Bluetooth cellular and GPS for maximum
range extremely long battery life
waterproof and durable all together in a
tiny affordable versatile solution one
more thing ping is the only device with
a little check-in button that lets your
kids send their locations to friends or
families with a simple push and if
they're in trouble they can hold that
button down to send you a distress
signal so that health can be contacted
ping the first truly useful affordable
and simple personal GPS locator
sleep it's one of the most important
things to our lives a lot of wearables
track sleep but tracking sleep doesn't
necessarily mean improved sleep but what
if we could change that what if we could
create a wearable which not only track
your sleep but improve your sleep at the
same time at them we're doing just that
and we want to work with you the
Kickstarter community to bring this
project to life we sleep for one third
of our lives but it affects us around
the clock the benefit of falling asleep
faster is that you can get more out of
every day I think the most exciting
thing is that we can change people's
lives them helps you to fall asleep
quicker and this will ultimately more
sleep across the night the development
of them is really based on a lot of
excellent university research that has
shown a better way of improving sleep
but for the first time now spin allows
this to be translated into the home
environment start by placing stem on any
of your fingers before you go to bed
then we'll then accurately determine
when you fall asleep to the nearest
minute the algorithm then implements a
retraining program to allow people to
fall asleep more quickly that has been
used by researchers for the last 10
years this is a simple behavioral
approach to improve your sleep but for
the first time Tim allows us to be
carried out in your own home this is a
way to teach people to sleep better and
from our own research we know that it
works them is about more than helping
you to get the flight quicker then can
also help you take the perfect power nap
research from NASA found that their
astronauts from 34 percent better having
taken power at all
the secret to a perfect power nap is
sleeping for exactly 10 minutes five
minutes won't do much for you and
sleeping for 20 minutes will leave you
feeling groggy once you wake up the
incredible accuracy of sim of knowing
when you fall asleep to the minute
allows you to take the perfect count up
for the first time simmer also collects
your sleep data and provide your asleep
school so that over time you can see how
your sleep is improving here at dammit
was been heads down building for some
time we're a team of researchers
designers and engineers we collectively
have built products that people around
the world use and love a most recent
invention was the retailer which
receives worldwide acclaim at them we've
reinvented the wearable for Fleet our
research is based on a peer review
evidence space this is more than a step
forward this is a quantum leap for how
will you sleep technologies we want to
our design to represent the ability to
disconnect and dream we wanted to
engineer something that you forgot
you're wearing we've done just that
putting the components into such a small
and light package fina challenge we've
gone through hundreds of iteration we've
given our 3d printer a serious workout
with every iteration we've learned
something new and it's definitely
improved our design but journey so far
has been thoroughly rewarding I'm really
looking forward to seeing what's become
we would love to work with the
Kickstarter community as we go through
final design considerations for this
wearable this is your chance to be part
of something where we change the face of
wearable technologies forever we'd love
you to be part of us and you can do that
by clicking the grand button thank you
you
you
and energy
p
ginger you too
me
you
me too
meaning
mmm
you
thank you
in range
how high can you ollie how fast can you
push how long was that last hill you
bought have you ever dreamt of being
able to track your tricks with ride
blocks all this is possible
ride block is easy to set up and
connects directly to your bunk and ride
block is designed to provide no
compromise and experience it shockproof
lightweight so you won't have to work
even when doing the gnarliest trip and
water resistance so that you can use it
in any condition ride block tracked all
your tricks as you skate unless you
check them in real time
ride block measures you're riding speed
the height of your ollie the length of
your gap the pop of your trick the
precision of your flip and even your
airtime nailing a trick is always tough
every slight movement to make the
difference ride blog helps you study
your movements and understand what you
need to improve so that you can finally
land that trick then you can prove it by
sharing it with your friends right block
also lets you challenge your friends
across the globe for example in a game
of skate this way you can compare tricks
and ride block teach the score for the
first time ever you can prove tricks to
friends and different locations with
ride block you can also check out new
spot and see what tricks have been
landed there before so you can compare
your trek and raise the bar with never
been done trick
right block also lets you see where your
friends are skating and what they're up
to
ride block lets you relive your sessions
because it captures all of your tricks
and you can share all this info to your
friends in social media
hey guys I be making long way to make
white dog happen we're both engineers
and skateboarders at the same time but
from where our journey started
skateboarding wasn't easy we come from
India and learning to skate over there
is a challenge challenge is a record of
skateboarding but is against yourself or
against a friend like me Anna be so
challenging each other at the highest
kickflip or the longest ollie but we
didn't really have a way to accurate
detail for the winner war this is how we
created an inventor right Blanc
skateboarding is for everyone and our
dream is to connect a community of
skateboarders and had them improve and
learn new tricks right blocks can truly
make this happen
we've been working on this project for
the past two years and we are currently
in Los Angeles working with local
skateboarders to collect feedback and
the final design right last went to many
different stages of development we
needed to make it small and lightweight
enough so that it wouldn't affect your
performance but also resolute enough so
that it can withstand any trip but the
support of a partners make an LA and
plastic labs we finalized the last
status of the pre-production with the
device that is both reliable emphasize
it's a dream come true to bring white
box to everyone we need your help to
start manufacturing of the hardware that
opposites white blocks and be the first
to join the moment
you
I
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
