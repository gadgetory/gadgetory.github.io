perfect Bluetooth speaker that
incorporates into your lifestyle and
becomes a part of your home amazed by
all the feedback from press we want to
take what is a great speaker and make it
incredible introducing the Aurora
network speaker we re-engineered the
internal layout to maximize power and
integrate new features with the ease of
any device you can control multiple
Aurora speakers throughout the house
synchronize your music in each room or
individualized based on the listeners
preference engineered with powerful
omnidirectional speakers that
intelligently spread sound waves evenly
across the room no matter where you are
doubling both the speaker and battery
power now enjoy louder music and solid
bass with over 24 hours of play time our
wireless induction cover provides easy
charging by just placing your phone in
the bowl the Aurora can also be
controlled with a simple touch sensors
along the rim are intuitive and can be
engaged at ease play control volume and
skip songs
the integrated alexa service makes your
aurora even more powerful how's the
weather today with a high of 22 degrees
and 40 degrees we strategically placed
three noise cancellation microphones so
you can enjoy crisp telephone
conferencing speak freely wherever you
are and never again be misunderstood
while using voice commands our patented
design produces clear 360 degree music
while becoming a nesting surface for
your valuables we also kept the
interchangeable covers so you can
customize based on what you love choose
from over 25 existing variations the
Aurora is a truly versatile system
adaptable for any environment and
powerful for all music lovers
we interact with technology throughout
every moment of our lives why is it that
something so ingrained into our
lifestyle not designed to fit in our
objective is to develop functional
products which are integrated
beautifully into people's homes we've
completed the technical developments and
our long-term manufacturing partner is
ready to go all we need now is your help
in getting us to the funding goal so
that we can start on the manufacturing
process and develop the first minimum
order of a thousand pieces thank you for
your support and be the first in making
this unique sound system a part of your
home
when we began our journey we were
inspired by women who were committed to
their own transformation women of action
who needed support for the changes they
were making in their daily lives after
the incredible success of our first
versions of the undress we knew it was
time for us to evolve so we're back
again with the best version yet
the undressed version three is the only
dress in the world that allows you to
change in three amazing ways change
clothes change sizes and change styles
the undress allows women to securely
change clothes in public without ever
getting naked making uncomfortable towel
changes a thing of the past with its
five patented features you can change
into the undress anywhere in as little
as 30 seconds first slip into the
undress use a soft handle to guide the
front of the dress underneath anything
you want to remove bring the straps over
your head and cinch it secure insert
your hands into the side openings remove
your bottoms then simply remove your top
done want to redress into something else
the undress has you covered simply
reverse the process and you're ready to
go change in and out of virtually any
outfit even a sports bra use it before
or after a run at the studio trailhead
Beach and more you now have the freedom
to do more of what you love and less of
what you don't one of the biggest
problems in the clothing industry is
sizing because women's bodies are very
different most clothing companies want
to force you to fit into their clothes
but what if we could design clothes to
fit you after testing on dozens of women
we invented the ever fit system with
three adjustment points that transforms
to fit every size and every body the
undress is so size friendly that one
dress fits women from extra small
through large we also have a plus-sized
version and for the first time ever a
junior size the universal modern length
of the undress is stylish and functional
for women of various heights with the
undress it's not one size it's your size
not only can you customize your size you
can transform the undress in four ways
where it loose for an effortless
bohemian look which works great as a
cover-up use the cord lock and tie
system to create a sleek fitted look tie
the cords around your waist for a chic
belted look or you can wrap up the cords
to create a classic empire waist
silhouette whether it's a day at the
beach running errands or traveling on
vacation one dress will fit all your
needs also brand new soft padding
provides additional coverage in the
chest lining of the undress optional
easy to clip-on straps provide support
of a shelf bra if needed test it on over
30 women of all different bus sizes you
can now wear the undress without a bra
as a complete changing solution features
like zippered side access openings to
hidden pockets and self packing
capability make the undress perfect for
travel you can even use it as a car seat
cover the undress will come in three
families of fabrics we have technical
sport fabrics that are lightly
antimicrobial and quick drying we also
have unbelievably soft classic essential
solids and exclusive prints that are
limited to kickstarter when you wear the
undress you will feel beautiful
comfortable and
you
recording life is like shooting a movie
and for the one who is chasing
perfection like you the intent shake of
handheld photography is really maddening
as the director of life idea fly will be
the most valuable handheld PA n
photographic stabilizer for now with the
original telescopic arm technology it
takes only one second to complete the
installation and counterweight of the
mobile phone after a key start the idea
fly by axial three hundred and thirty
degrees without dead angle electronic
control rotation function not only can
guarantee the shooting without leaving
dead angle but also lets you easily
achieve stable shooting shooting jitter
will no longer become a trouble idea fly
uses a reliable Bluetooth technology to
tune in with 98% of its handset and you
can click on the capture button to start
shooting in order to eliminate as much
of the shake while mobile shooting is
possible idea flies team spent 200 days
addressing a problem
compensation for jitter and shots a bit
more precise and sensitive eventually we
have achieved perhaps the most sensitive
FOC algorithm in the world now follow
the shooting no matter when you're
running climbing or anything else even
if you deliberately shake the idea fly
in the shoot they can still give you a
very smooth picture stability is not our
only pursuit you can easily adjust the
tilt angle of your mobile phone by using
the control button of the handle and you
can also easily achieve any angle you
want to shoot from
besides the stable film mode idea fly
can also be a key into a lock shooting
mode when you need to lock a particular
vantage point in the shooting but your
body had to move at the same time the
lock mode is your best helper of course
idea fly can also switch the horizontal
portrait mode with single pressing the
button it's highly intensive body design
weighing less than 300 grams but it
allows it to easily carry anything under
six inches and simplify and become
strong excluding fragile and
non-essential 3-axis structures and the
garish but ill-equipped with most of the
equipments app as well as the price of
these fancy concepts the fast sensitive
and powerful idea fly will record your
life in a smooth picture just like a
movie
