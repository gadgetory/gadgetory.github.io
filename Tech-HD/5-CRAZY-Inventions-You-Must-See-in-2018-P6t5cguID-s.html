the water as it passes over the spinning
beverage and this heat slowly melts the
ice the result is a cold beverage for

this tool uses special flats there are
11 inches by 22 inches so they're a
little bit bigger than your standard
1020 flat but they work with a paper
chain that is like an accordion style
stretched out in the flat and filled up
with soil you use this little plate
thing to get the flat started and
basically how this works is it unravels
itself into the soil and so you push
this thing underneath it and that makes
it sort of like a ramp that the paper
chains will unravel from and so you get
your first one going this little piece
is just garbage I use I keep some
landscape pins down here so you start it
off the first few feet of a bed you'll
have to come back and bury in that's
just because I have lots of stuff right
at the end of my beds but if you had
long beds with lots of space at the end
it wouldn't be a problem this is one of
the challenges I have in the urban
setting so once you get our going start
and so it's digging a trench and it's
closing it up as you go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
