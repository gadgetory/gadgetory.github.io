budget and your planet maybe you bike as
much as possible or maybe you've been
meaning to get into it but the reality
on the street often makes your ride
challenging
we wanted to give riders total
confidence on the road by making them
visible from every direction that's why
we designed monkey lights
we've been making monkey lights since
2007
our lights are known for being
incredibly bright durable and fun
in 2013 we kick-started the first video
bike wheel the monkey light Pro since
then we've talked to thousands of monkey
light users around the world they keep
telling us just how confident they feel
when they ride monkey lights were
originally designed to be fun and
visible now we're ready to take the next
step
with sleek new designs that are
ridiculously easy to use with our third
generation of monkey lights you just
ride your bike and they work their magic
all the lights feature our new fully
automatic technology they reliably turn
on when you need them and they securely
lock into your spokes this way you won't
lose your lights and you'll never forget
to turn them on these third-generation
lights also feature our new hub mounted
rechargeable battery the battery lasts
for months of normal usage and it pops
out easily to charge from any USB port
our lights are great for every kind of
bike and any type of rider and now we're
able to make them more affordable than
ever
so why monkey lights well take a look at
this this is how a bike looks with the
traditional front and rear lights now
look at it with monkey lights all of our
monkey lights are clearly visible from
every direction by illuminating the
wheels the moving light greatly
increases visibility even on a crowded
street the speed and direction of the
rider can be seen as well
monkey lights light up the road and make
every ride more safe and more fun our
8:10 combo is a set of two fully
automatic lights it features a classic
look with a bright white light for the
front wheel and a red light for the rear

choose between eight colors and five

happen with a skunk lock skunk lock is a
bicycle lock that was designed with a
built-in deterrent it can actually stop

unique chemical compound into the lock
