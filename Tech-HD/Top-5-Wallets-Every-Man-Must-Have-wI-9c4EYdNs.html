you
the Micra wallet was conceived as a
joint appreciation of minimalist design
as we grew frustrated with traditional
leather wallets only lasting several
months instead of several years as
designers we knew we could do better we
set ourselves a pretty challenging brief
to design a minimalist wallet that was
not only aesthetically beautiful but
functionally superior to anything else
on the market our years of industry
experience enabled us to quickly
evaluate our designs taking them from
initial concept through the sourcing
manufacturing partners mass production
our use of PVD coating would rival most
high-end watches this provides an
extremely high scratch resistant finish
we had concerns about our product
strength so we decided to test it ready
we fitted our wallet with a low-friction
TPU strap this prevents it from sticking
to your clothes holding audio cards
securely you no longer have to remove
them to make a payment one of our
proudest achievements is its full
functionality of a regular wallet
without the bulk believe it or not we've
even managed to find space for your
change we've sourced the suppliers we've
manufactured our prototypes we tested
them to their limits
hello IndieGoGo this is not me this is
room and today he'll introduce you to
our wallet no no not this one
this wallet when we were starting we had
three goals in mind our product had to
be good looking fully functional and
extremely durable after months of hard
work development and improving we
finally created the perfect product
introducing 'invalid made from carbon
fiber which is one of the strongest
lightest materials on planet earth our
wallet is both stylish and extremely
dirt proudly made in the United States
there are many minimalist wallets out
there but we want a thin and
cool-looking wallet that did not
compromise functionality
here you see a demonstration of our
wallet versus a conventional walk with
the same number of bills you can even
try this at home
we designed adjustable rubber clasp for
those that carry a lot of cards or cash
the pass can be easily adjusted
even one bill will not fall out there
are two different wallet sizes for you
to choose from this is the smaller one
it's literally the size of a credit card
the next size up is designed to quick
cash fold it in half and it fits a lot
of it while still being slim and compact
hey guys now your help our product pull
and prototype please help us in any way
you can by shaming friends or family
we set out to create the sexiest easiest
to use minimalist wallet in the whole
world and I think we've done just that
but it's time to find out for yourself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
