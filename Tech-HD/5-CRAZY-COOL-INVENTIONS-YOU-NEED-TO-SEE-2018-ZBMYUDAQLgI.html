one of my favorite things about cooking
is chopping and slicing there's
something so satisfying about the
geometry of it all but when you're
cutting tons of cherry tomatoes or
grapes it can get a little bit tedious
that's why I created the slice X now I
look forward to cutting cherry tomatoes
grapes whatever any excuse is a good
excuse to cut small round fruit now
here's how it works
pour in your fruit of choice slice them
perfectly in half in one easy motion
empty and repeat it's that simple
slice X is so easy to use but don't take
my word for it see what other people are
saying about slice X slice X makes it
easy to cut cherry tomatoes and grapes
along the core just like we do it here
I've cut thousands of grapes for my
girls and I'm about to start again
anything that makes food safer for them
and makes life easier for me is a good
thing
the two-part design makes slicing super
compact so it fits just about anywhere
we've tested numerous prototypes and we
finally feel as though we balanced form
function and manufacture ability in a
way worthy of your kitchen countertop
and the material that we've used is the
same recyclable material that's used in
professional-grade cutting boards what's
nice about that is it's easy on your
knives will it bring a smile and a sense
of satisfaction to you and your friends
who love to cook I think it will I want
you to experience a whole new joy
preparing delicious food for your family
