screwdriver is kind of like the Swiss
Army knife of screwdrivers sure you can
zip in or remove a screw with ease but
you can also light an area strip and
Bend wire and detect a live circuit all
in the palm of your hand the Hammerhead
4 volt rechargeable screwdriver as a
forward reverse ring that activates with
a simple twist once activated the LED
lights turn on illuminating your work
when not in use the spindle locks and
can be used like a manual screwdriver a
circuit sensor is located at the front
of the tool press the voltage detection
button and place the sensor within one
inch of a switch outlet cord or fixture
to see if it is live a light and a
buzzer will let you know if electricity
is present an integrated wire stripper
makes short work of taking off an
insulation sleeve and wires can be bent
using the bending slot on top take the
guesswork out of any electrical project
and use a rechargeable screwdriver that
just does more
the Hammerhead 4 volt rechargeable

hammerhead works smarter
remembering how to smooth out those
joists when you needed to easily fix a
stubborn door or make two uneven boards
flush you now you can do all this and
more with the win electric hand planer
the six amp motor provides up to thirty
four thousand cuts per minute through
even the hardest of woods while most of
our competitors have a maximum depth of
5/64 of an inch the wind planer exhibits
16 positive stops in one 128 inch
increments to fine-tune your cuts
anywhere up to 1/8 of an HD the wind
electric hand planer also comes with a
handy dust collection bag that can be
attached to either the right or left
hand side of the planer an adjustment
wrench with onboard storage a kickstand
to protect your blade a rabbiting guide
to help measure the depth of your
rabbits and a parallel fence for making
perfectly straight cuts the base of the
plate even has a v-shaped groove to help
make chamfering the corners of your wood
easier than ever and if you have a dust
extractor
you can plug it right in to either side
of your unit to maximize the collection
of sawdust and see your work area clean
remember when you had a reliable planer
that gave you years of quality service
remember when
the concealed hinge dig from Craig
offers a fast reliable easy-to-use
solution that anyone can use to install
doors on cabinets or built-ins or to
refresh kitchen cabinets with new
updated doors that's because the
concealed hinged Jake makes it easier
than ever to mount concealed hinges that
give doors a clean uncluttered look and
the jig lets you do it with the accuracy
of a drill press
but using nothing more than an ordinary
drill the jig makes the process easy
thanks to indexing cams and built-in
measuring scales that ensure exact hinge
cut positioning plus a removable guide
for the included carbide tipped bit
using the concealed hinge dig makes it
simple to figure out the two main things
required for mounting these hinges
determining how far from the door edge
the hinge needs to be located and how
far the hinges sit from the top or
bottom of the door how far from the door
edge the hinge sits is called the offset
and the measurement varies depending on
the hinge type and brand usually you
just have to read the hinge instructions
measure and hope for the best but the
concealed hinged jake has indexing cams
that take out all of the guesswork and
uncertainty just turn the cams to the
appropriate setting and the jig will be
perfectly positioned when you place it
against the edge of the door that means
all you have to do is use the concealed
hinged jigs measuring scale to position
the hinge at the desired distance from
the top or bottom of the door clamp the
jig in place and the hinge cap hole will
be positioned correctly every time after
the cup hole is correctly located you
still need to drill a clean hole to the
proper depth doing that usually requires
a drill press and a specialized bit the
concealed hinge gig comes with a
high-quality carbide tip 35 millimeter
bit that's specifically designed for the
task the bit shears the wood cleanly
without tear out four perfect holes time
after time to ensure the hole is
straight that bit rides in a drilling
guide that lacks quickly and accurately
into the jig a stop collar ensures
correct hole depth every time - once the
cup is drilled the concealed hinged jig
makes it just as easy to drill the holes
for the hinge mounting
crews just removed the drilling guide
and used the two holes in the jig to
guide an ordinary 1/16 inch drill bit
unclamp the concealed hinged jig and the
hinge drops into place and mounts
accurately every time whether you're
installing hinges on one door or adding
new doors to an entire kitchen that
means all you have to do is Mount the
door to your cabinet and the job is done
confidently quickly and with
professional quality results using just
a drill with the concealed hinge dig for
