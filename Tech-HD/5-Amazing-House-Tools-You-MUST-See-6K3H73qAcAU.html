the concealed hinge dig from Craig
offers a fast reliable easy-to-use
solution that anyone can use to install
doors on cabinets or built-ins or to
refresh kitchen cabinets with new
updated doors that's because the
concealed hinged Jake makes it easier
than ever to mount concealed hinges that
give doors a clean uncluttered look and
the jig lets you do it with the accuracy
of a drill press
but using nothing more than an ordinary
drill the jig makes the process easy
thanks to indexing cams and built-in
measuring scales that ensure exact hinge
cut positioning plus a removable guide
for the included carbide tipped bit
using the concealed hinge dig makes it
simple to figure out the two main things
required for mounting these hinges
determining how far from the door edge
the hinge needs to be located and how
far the hinges sit from the top or
bottom of the door how far from the door
edge the hinge sits is called the offset
and the measurement varies depending on
the hinge type and brand usually you
just have to read the hinge instructions
measure and hope for the best but the
concealed hinged jake has indexing cams
that take out all of the guesswork and
uncertainty just turn the cams to the
appropriate setting and the jig will be
perfectly positioned when you place it
against the edge of the door that means
all you have to do is use the concealed
hinged jigs measuring scale to position
the hinge at the desired distance from
the top or bottom of the door clamp the
jig in place and the hinge cap hole will
be positioned correctly every time after
the cup hole is correctly located you
still need to drill a clean hole to the
proper depth doing that usually requires
a drill press and a specialized bit the
concealed hinge gig comes with a
high-quality carbide tip 35 millimeter
bit that's specifically designed for the
task the bit shears the wood cleanly
without tear out four perfect holes time
after time to ensure the hole is
straight that bit rides in a drilling
guide that lacks quickly and accurately
into the jig a stop collar ensures
correct hole depth every time - once the
cup is drilled the concealed hinged jig
makes it just as easy to drill the holes
for the hinge mounting
crews just removed the drilling guide
and used the two holes in the jig to
guide an ordinary 1/16 inch drill bit
unclamp the concealed hinged jig and the
hinge drops into place and mounts
accurately every time whether you're
installing hinges on one door or adding
new doors to an entire kitchen that
means all you have to do is Mount the
door to your cabinet and the job is done
confidently quickly and with
professional quality results using just
a drill with the concealed hinge dig for
