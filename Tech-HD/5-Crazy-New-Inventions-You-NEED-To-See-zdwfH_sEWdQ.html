my love if you feel like I do right now
don't say your own
to the other side
my
and idea we believe that the capturing
process should happen seamlessly just
like the experience itself does PETA is
the world's first transformative drone
that appeals true versatility in a way
that you capture your experience whether
it's aerial and held or mounted PETA
transforms the your needs in a matter of
seconds the action cam module has three
screw holes for universal mounting
changing modes is quick and easy with
modular design that magnetically snaps
and twist into lock optimized for the
first time pilots across all ages PETA
is light and small to take with you
everywhere without adding extra bulk
with our vision recognition technology
to target and follow users capturing
with PETA is as easy as throwing it with
a click of a button
our team has deployed a number of vision
recognition technologies across many
different sectors we have been working
days and nights for the last year and a
half to bring the same video processing
technologies to PETA to create a small
yet powerful autonomous drone that
combines all the pros of previous drones
and action cameras
we have completed development and are
now in need of your help to move on to
the manufacturing stage to shed light on
PETA please join us to make PETA a
reality
let's talk about making a professional
livestream definitely not this but doing
this first you need a camera one HDMI
cable a life is boring encoder Oh two
HDMI cable a computer and prepaid
software
then you need a while to set everything
up wrong port I'm sorry
introducing yellow box a revolutionary
smart encoder that helps you do live
stream like a pro all you need to do is
just link it to your camera with one
HDMI cable or even go wireless if you
have a GoPro it's done that's it once
connected simply tap to create an event
setup name time
select pre linked platforms and you're
all set to go
1080 live stream to Facebook YouTube
periscope or other rtmp compatible
platforms one at a time or even multiple
at the same time question can I do live
streaming on door yes Yolo box is super
portable and supports all kinds of
cameras such as DSLR professional video
action cameras
in even drones for different scenarios
including outdoor setting plus yellow
box allows you to work using Wi-Fi
Ethernet or 4G network in all various
ports just to make sure that you're
connected all the time considering all
features look right it's three hundred
and fifty nine dollars only on
Kickstarter and even more we set major
parts of our cloud service for free for
everyone
life story so Backman and the pizza
it's angling ask you well incredible
things going on these exactly that's why
we're trying to make this accessible to
everybody so please try them back us
are we ready yeah ready and action
here we go
you
snores which is leading us
will ever trust
we'll go
through the wastelands through the
highways summer shadow through the
sunrays and
around these walls
we'll go
through the wastelands through the
highways through my shadow through the
sunrays
we'll be number if you see the horizon
so dust
and we'll grow
this is your car and this is Caruso now
you are aware of everything that happens
to your car even when you are not around
it Caruso is a small device that can
replace any modern car alarm system all
you need to do is just leave it in the
car and it will notify you via your
mobile phone of any unforeseen
situations that happen in its proximity
one if your car is being towed away - if
your car got scratched three if your car
windows got smashed four or even if your
car accidentally rolls downhill
not bad right but that's not all you can
also easily find your car in the parking
lot in case you forgot where exactly you
left it all this for only $79 let's
recap Caruso is five times cheaper than
any modern car alarm system it's
Universal and fits any car no need to
waste time on its installation and most
importantly you are always aware where
your car is if your wife is driving it
and if everything is all right with her
and of course your steel steed Caruso
the most clever car security system</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
