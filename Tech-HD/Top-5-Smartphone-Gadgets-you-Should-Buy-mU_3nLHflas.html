backpack the world's most advanced
portable charging solution integrated
directly into the fabric of a bag I
think that it should be easier to charge
your phone in your laptop wherever you
are without needing to find a power
outlet my life is lived on the go I
can't keep my laptop charged past noon
my phone needs to be plugged in before
3pm I must have tried every portable
charging system portable battery most of
them just don't get it done what I
really need is a serious charging
solution that can power anything anytime
anywhere but the portable charging
solution that I needed didn't exist and
I wanted to build it and when I
explained what i wanted to do to some
engineering friends of mine they wanted
to help because they needed it too we're
proud to introduce the ample smart
backpack the portable charging solution
that we needed and we think you might
need to and we're proud to have been
named a 2015 CES innovation awards
honoree in two categories a testament to
the engineering rigor that was put into
the development of this product so I've
been designing bags for over a decade
and the challenge here was that the bag
wasn't just holding your devices but you
are also plugging your devices into the
bag for them to be charged I started to
create illustration drawings where I
would then send them to Tomoko and she
would start engineering the housings
around those pieces and then she would
send them back and I would tailor the
bag design around her CAD date our goal
was to create a design that was truly
intuitive for the user and we wanted the
electronics to almost disappear into the
fabrics of the bag the ample smart
backpack can charge all of your devices
is overnight war throughout the day we
integrated a powerful custom-built
battery that can recharge a smartphone
two to three times there's a USB port in
every pocket and you can add 3 expansion
batteries four days that you need more
power the modular battery is charged
rapidly when docked into the bag but can
also be removed and used separately you
can stick in your coat pocket or your
purse and take you to dinner with you
and you don't have to carry the bag with
to have that backup power when we first
thought about putting electronics into a
backpack we immediately worried what
happens if you drop it so we added shock
absorbers and an extra layer foam all
the way around and we applied a water
resistant coating to all of the exterior
fabrics to help keep the rain out if you
ever forgotten your backpack at a coffee
shop the ample smart backpack can alert
you if you do and we built a mobile app
that will monitor battery levels
connected devices and smart sensors in
the bag or you can use the OLED display
and touch sensor to monitor the vitals
inside of the bag without ever opening a
zipper ample is a talented team of
designers and engineers with decades of
experience launching new products more
importantly though we're commuters
travelers coffee shop dwellers and
on-the-go doers and we needed a more
ample bag we have a plan to get into
production by early summer but we need
help to get there we're hoping to raise
at least 125 thousand dollars to cover
the cost of tooling and raw materials
and as a thank you to our early backers
we're offering a twenty-five percent
discount on the bag and all of the
accessory modules please support us in
bringing the ample smart back back to
life
