three years ago we moved our family to
the islands of Fiji with two young kids
we wanted to simplify our lives watch
our children grow up in a culture far
different from our own and work on
projects inspired by the people and way
of life in this amazing part of the
world I've been designing products for
close to 20 years and for me simplicity
is the key to great design when
designing the emmerich lounger I wanted
to create a truly indoor/outdoor
experience by combining the comfort and
sophistication of an indoor chair with
materials that are ideal for the
outdoors I've designed this chair with
the entire experience in mind how you
buy it how you assemble it in the many
ways you live with it there is no need
to leave home purchasing the emmerich
lounger is as simple as a click of a
mouse or a tap on the screen with no
hardware or tools needed the assembly is
both easy and intuitive in just a few
minutes your lounger is ready to enjoy
the emmerich lounger is about comfort we
created comfort through a combination of
design construction and materials it
starts with a high back panel and a deep
seating area a padded seat lumbar pillow
mesh side panels and an adjustable
headrests provide additional comfort and
support we use a high density charcoal
heather fabric that is both incredibly
durable versatile and soft to the touch
finally the foundation and frame provide
the required strength and stability for
a wife time of enjoyment best of all the
Emmerich lounger breaks down quickly and
without fear of losing any small parts
so you can bring it along wherever life
takes you we are really excited to
launch the Emmerich lounger and with
your support we can purchase the molds
and materials needed to bring this
product to life into your home
wait for it it's simple we need
something we make it we needed a suit
but not just any suit we needed a suit
that looks great and we needed a suit
that's comfortable and adaptable to any
given situation and so we made it but we
didn't just make it we added more we
made a suit that is waterproof
stretchable breathable odor control and
UV protected but wait what about the
environment yes we made a suit out of
the most environmental friendly
materials first we needed a design pen
paper and ideas over two years ago we
started a journey and after dozens of
prototypes crafting cutting suing and a
lot of testing and I mean a lot of
testing
to the point where we finally perfected
the design but we needed the right
material to make a suit that is not only
waterproof but a suit that is also
environmental friendly so we travel the
world looking for the right partner and
we found it we finally found it how do
they do it here is how coffee beans
become coffee ground we mix it with
recycled plastic bottles and make yarn
which then becomes the fabric first we
collect the coffee ground and remove all
remaining oil we then turn the recycled
plastic bottles into tiny flakes and mix
the two of them to then turn them into
what we call master batches which become
the yarn used to make our fabrics all of
this integrates with the latest
technology to make our fabric the most
innovative advanced an environmental
friendly to date mixing spandex
molecular level of 400 nano sized fine
coffee ground high water content
materials well you get the idea so
what's next now that we have everything
ready we just want to share it with you
if we need it you probably need it too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
