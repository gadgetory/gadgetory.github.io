remember when you brought those old
jagged boards back to life remember when
the concealed hinged jig from Craig
offers a fast reliable easy to use
solution that anyone can use to install
doors and cabinets or built-ins or to
refresh kitchen cabinets with new
updated doors that's because the
concealed hinge gig makes it easier than
ever to mount concealed hinges that give
doors a clean uncluttered look and the
jig lets you do it with the accuracy of
a drill press but using nothing more
than an ordinary drill the jig makes the
process easy thanks to indexing cams and
built-in measuring scales that ensure
exact hinge cut positioning plus a
removable guide for the included carbide
tipped bit using the concealed hinge gig
makes it simple to figure out the two
main things required for mounting these
hinges determining how far from the door
edge the hinge needs to be located and
how far the hinges sit from the top or
bottom of the door how far from the door
edge the hinge sits is called the offset
and the measurement varies depending on
the hinge type and brand usually you
just have to read the hinge instructions
measure and hope for the best but the
concealed hinged jake has indexing cams
that take out all of the guesswork and
uncertainty just turn the cams to the
appropriate setting and the jig will be
perfectly positioned when you place it
against the edge of the door that means
all you have to do is use the concealed
hinged jigs measuring scale to position
the hinge at the desired distance from
the top or bottom of the door clamp the
jig in place and the hinge cup hole will
be positioned correctly every time after
the cup hole is correctly located
you still need to drill a clean hole to
the proper depth doing that usually
requires a drill press and a specialized
bit the concealed hinge gig comes with a
high-quality carbide tip 35 millimeter
bit that's specifically designed for the
task the bit shears the wood cleanly
without tear out for perfect holes time
after time to ensure the hole is
straight that bit rides in a drilling
guide that lacks quickly and accurately
into the jig a stop collar ensures
correct hole depth every time too once
the cup is drilled the concealed hinged
jig makes it
just as easy to drill the holes for the
hinge mounting screws just remove the
drilling guide and used the two holes in
the jig to guide an ordinary 1/16 inch
drill bit unclamp the concealed hinge
dig and the hinge drops into place and
mounts accurately every time whether
you're installing hinges on one door or
adding new doors to an entire kitchen
that means all you have to do is Mount
the door to your cabinet and the job is
done confidently quickly and with
professional quality results using just
a drill with the concealed hinge in
