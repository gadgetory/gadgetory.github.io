wake up in the morning feeling like P
the battle against clutter is something
we all face clutter is one of those
things you don't want to think about but
it always seems to creep in over time
making it impossible to find things when
you actually need them like many of you
I spend the majority of my day working
at my desk and find myself reaching for
the same things over and over but by the
end of the day my desk always ends up a
complete cluttered mess because I don't
have a place to put everything I search
for a product that would help me solve
this problem but all I found were those
ugly cheaply made organizers they all
pretty much look the same and thought
out of place in my modern workspace they
just seemed to add to the clutter what I
wanted was a beautifully designed
minimal organizer that could gather all
of my essentials into one central place
something that could be customized or
easily repositioned on my desk
rather than fumbling around with a bunch
of bulky containers so for the past
three years I've been designing just
that after working through dozens of
prototypes and sketches I'm proud to
finally show you the result this is
gather gather is a modular home for your
essentials that is thoughtfully designed
to help you cut through the clutter
it adapts to your workspace and workflow
to make sure the tools you need are
always within reach since we all have
different preferences gather can be
configured in hundreds of different ways
- exactly the way that works best for
you I designed everything using a grid
system which allows each of the top
pieces to be rotated or positioned
anywhere along the base so whether
you're right-handed or left-handed like
me gather can easily adapt the magnets
embedded in the base allow you to attach
additional pieces in multiple different
ways you can even combine two full sets
to create a much larger organizer
I love that gathers minimal form-factor
actually forces me to keep only my
essentials on my desk I no longer have
to dig through my drawer of fifty
different pens to find my favorite one
it's always right there in front of me
the more I've used gather the more I've
noticed its impact on my productivity it
eliminates so many of those little
distractions throughout the day even
though I primarily designed gather to
organize my desk I've realized that
actually works great for organizing so
many other spaces as well I've been
designing products for over eight years
and in my opinion this is the best one
yet a tug monk design is at the center
of everything we do
gather may look simple from the outside
but I've put a ton of thought and
engineering into every little detail to
make it the perfect marriage of form and
function so now after three years of
fine-tuning the details of gather I'm
finally ready to do a full manufacturing
run but I need funding for the tooling
costs so we can make it all happen
with your help we can make gather a
reality
