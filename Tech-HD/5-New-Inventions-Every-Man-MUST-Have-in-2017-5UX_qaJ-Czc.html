rectangles in our lives we used to view
photos and watch video and troll
internet message boards and if in
certain contexts we choose to prop them
up our options tend to look something
like this lots of single position
holders clunky structures loads of
plastic mount we're not seeing today

got this hefty industrial metal theme
going on coming off as sort of a desktop
anchor with a rock-solid feel attachment

landing pad and let the magnets engage

heads with embedded magnets and interact
with these thin metal plates for phones
we have these circular disk plates for
tablets these dual set plates with peel
off adhesives you stick the place either
direct to the device or to the inside of
its case at any time you can pop one
head out of its cup and add the other to
swap out devices if the center lies one
of its core innovations it's a first
ever articulating arm driven entirely by
magnets to steel balls rotating in two
magnetized cups at either end of the arm
give incredible range of motion and firm
holes in any position and then there's
the base the base is made of machined
aluminum with this attractive dark gray
anodized finish
it's hollowed-out core as a space you'll
fill yourself to weigh it down and you
can do that with coins right we all have
excess coins at home and given their
copper and zinc makeup
their weight is spot-on for this and

your screens a bit higher we have these
rubber coasters you can stack underneath
