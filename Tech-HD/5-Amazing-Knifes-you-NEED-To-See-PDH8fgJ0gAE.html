architect you my story begin with my
grandfather was a blacksmith nature was
his primary obsession and inspiration
the after Nashville South African
father's feelings scary one with nature
in his daily routine of work but I felt
back when all the night from my
grandfather crafted the blade for
kitchen knife
tonight one that isn't like the many of
this mission aesthetic but a different
way would begin at the sketch under the
fashion sometimes innovations were 5000
tradition sometimes
how much your fashion design and finally
I stated a complete knife
I called skid skid combines the
traditional and the modern in
environmentally sound holistic appear
and elegant adapted for the means and
challenges of modern Jesus performed and
adjust to the hand economically the wood
pardon contempor but isn't inferior to
the natural wood surface high carbon
content covered with exceptional
allowing the blade sharpen from last
body of the animals more enchanting than
to become static cameras mechanic
introduced to hardwood which invantive
accurate property my grandfather told me
that all organics on the network in some
at a halt phosphide is progressive
creating skid took me back into the past
but also the giant step towards the
future

Oh

we wanted to create cookware that you
genuinely enjoy using and what's the one
item in your kitchen that you need to
make virtually every dish whether it's
for the finishing touches on a small
meal or cracking into a big snack your
chef's knife is at the core of every
cooking experience we created the boule
on chef knife in order to bring you a
beautiful premium knife for less than
half of what you would pay from other
brands hi I'm not the founder of hula I
love to cook but about a year ago I
found myself immensely frustrated while
shopping for a new chef's knife
your choices are either disposable piece
of junk from a big box store or
ridiculously overpriced blade from a
premium retailer leaving you without
many options in the middle the world of
chef knives is out of date the bigger
companies are operating on ancient sales
margins that forced you to pay inflated
price for a premium knife by avoiding
all the traditional retail sales channel
and meeting you directly online we're
able to create an incredible knife for a
fraction of the price the fuel is the
heart of the blade and from the very
beginning we wanted something they both
performed well but was also beautiful
the folded timing of this cable
sometimes referred to as Damascus or
pattern-welded skills as origins that
stretch back in history steel makers
from southern India were once known for
exporting the finest steel in the world
this steel found its way to Damascus
where I became famous it was widely
traded with the various empires that
interacted with Damascus including those
of Eastern Europe where it would become
known as blue let's steal our name
Bhutan is a nod to the deep history of
this view we are evolving the art of
knives by taking inspiration from French
German and Japanese knives making
creating one blade that truly embraces
the history of all of these knife makers
once we had a shape we liked we brought
that into the computer and created a 3d
prototyping CAD but seeing something in
3d on the computer and holding in your
hands a very different experience 3d
printing gave us the incredible ability
to print out and iterate on the design
in a way we could never have imagined
only a few years ago our goal was to
create a blade that catered to all types
of cutting chopping and slicing
techniques
ultimately a large gentle belly and
dropped tick gave us the feel we wanted
on the cutting board then it was time to
bring the blades of life we've
established relationships with some of
the most experienced next manufacturers
and steel suppliers in the world our
steel is made in two cases a region of
Japan is famous for blade knee even the
sharpest knives Rock magic blades made
with a quality steel sharpened better
and hold its edge much longer our blade
begins with the cutting core made of
vg10 this innovative steel combines the
incredible cutting edge of high carbon
steel with the practicality of stainless
steel beyond just being extremely sharp
a next should also be a pleasure to use
we've put a lot of thought into how
people hold their neck and after many
revisions we've designed a blade that's
balanced and comfortable to use
regardless of the size of your hands
some groove in the bolster guide your
fingers into a pinch grip technique
commonly used by professional cooks my
name is daniel all the way i am the
co-founder of urban area
