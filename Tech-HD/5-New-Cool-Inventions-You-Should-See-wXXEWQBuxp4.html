this is beeline moto v-line moto is a
beautifully intuitive navigation device
that change the way you write
nearly three years ago we can kick-start
with our stripped-back navigation device
devices we've shipped that to over 3000
people it's been sold around the world
ever since we don't just ride push bike
now we're back to be like motor we've
taken everything that people love so
much about our first place water into
finding the ultimate navigation devices
folks like these it's high-tech it's
tougher but at its core is that same
concept of kickstart to my storm in 2010
beeline moto attaches to any bike in
moments with the twist lock mechanism
and a variety of different mugs setting
up routes just takes a few taps on the
smart phone app or you can even upload
GPX routes and once you're set up you
don't need a data connection it's very
useful to have it when we arrive in with
a group and you don't always have to
rise in a pack you can have your own
ride and get a destination you just have
to follow one direction it's very easy
we've cut the interface intentionally
really simple there are two modes for
navigation there's route mode which dicy
along a specific route and takes you
through every single turn and then those
compass mode which simply points here
the final destination and gives you the
freedom to choose the route some of the
best parts are being on a bike is that
traffic it might be linked is beyond
freedom moves through traffic and
nowhere and going but also create my own
freedom
I love the simplicity and just being
able to get the information you need
quickly is amazing it's waterproof and
shockproof and has a really sturdy
mounting mechanism the battery lasts for
30 hours of use and is then charged by
USB the display works great in direct
sunlight but also has a backlight for
nighttime lighting and the app will
track all of your rights so you can go
back and see what you've been I think I
love most about belies it only gives you
the information that you actually need
or as I have a phone up there's just so
much going on that you actually lose
track of what's happening it really
brings back the sort of purity of riding
a bike again you just put it on and was
good to go
we've learned a huge amount of
developing one product already and all
that knowledge and experience is going
straight in to be like motor we've now
got a fantastic team behind us and a
really great relationship with our
manufacturer in China we're working
closely with the motorcycle community
and the feedback so far has been
fantastic the line have been excellent
at asking what we want what we need so
very excited that the new products
coming out and work extremely well we're
incredibly excited to bring v-line motor
to life with your support we can make it
happen
thank you very much
rolling just go do the chinstrap up so
we decided one second policy safety
first by now light gives you access to
instant light and power whatever the
weather wherever you are we've created a
really simple easy and efficient way of
generating renewable power using you
anytime we all take access to instant
lights and power for granted but what do
you do for a lights and a power outage
how do you charge your phone when
camping and how about the 1 in 7 people
who do not have access to electricity
this is why we've created now light a
renewable source of light and power
ready whenever you need it
current renewable energy solutions are
either solely dependent on the Sun or
rely on inefficient and awkward manual
charging we knew we could develop a
better solution we've spent years
working on the optimum way to harness
human power
now light combines a highly efficient
dynamo with cutting-edge battery
technology just one second of manual
charging finds a whole minute of life
we're excited to introduce now lights
lets you generate light and power
instantly to get starters just hook up
now light pull once to turn on and keep
pulling to charge just one minute of
pulling generates an hour obliged if the
sun shining attach the 3 watt solar
panel to charge up your now light
now lights has five brightness levels
from night lights to an ultra bright
light and the live power display adapts
to the amount of power you're using and
now I can even charge your devices just
plug in your phone or any other USB
powered device with an additional
satellite you can also spread light
around a room or use it as a task light
our team of innovators and experienced
product designers are driven by the
desire to develop affordable renewable
solutions that can empower people
worldwide just as we develop gravity
light to replace dangerous and polluting
kerosene lamps we're doing the same but
better with now lights we're building
partnerships worldwide to enable us to
reach off-grid homes with clean safe and
affordable power and you can help us do
that through this campaign we're
partnering with the International
Federation of the Red Cross and Red
Crescent Societies to distribute and
test now lights with families in need in
rwanda x' refugee camps our team has
spent years developing now light and now
we've perfected it and it's ready to go
we need your support to help us fund the
tooling and the first production
- can't wait to hear how you use your
wearable health technology is helping
humans live longer and better than ever
but so far little has been done for our
beloved canine companions our dogs
aren't just pets they're part of the
family so why shouldn't there be
wearable health care for them - this is
Wagon the only health and well-being
monitor that can improve and possibly
extend the life of your dog believe us
when we say this is no novelty product
it's a truly life-changing innovation
for dog parents everywhere
why get treks nearly everything your
best friend does throughout the day and
gives you all the data in our handy app
in fact it looks a lot like human health
apps you might be familiar with so
there's no learning curve wag it records
your dog's baseline that way it
instantly alerts you if something seems
out of the ordinary
after all our dogs can't exactly tell us
when something's wrong is your dog's
heart respiration rate trending up
maggot we'll let you know is your dog no
longer lying on his left side
wag it will tell you is your dog
drinking a lot more water and not
sleeping as well as usual wagget lets
you know that too activity levels
temperature and nutrition information
are just a few of the other important
health indicators Waggin monitors these
may seem like small things but they can
be symptoms of serious problems and the
sooner you can find out about them the
better chance your dog has of making a
full recovery plus you'll save thousands
on those costly vet bills wagga also
tracks your dog's location so in the
event that Fido gets lost you'll be able
to track and find him immediately you
can even set up a virtual fence that
lets you know when your dog has wandered
out of bounds you probably won't be
surprised to learn that where dog lovers
ourselves we both suffer the loss of a
few beloved pets and after discovering
that early detection of those traumatic
illnesses could have meant the
difference between life and
we decided that we never want another
pet parent to experience what we did we
decided that pets deserve the chance to
alert their parents when something's
wrong we decided to do something about
it and thus wagget was born we're living
in a world where people are taking
better care of their pets than ever so a
smart collar just made sense we think
wagget is going to completely change the
lives of dogs and their parents and now
we need the help of passionate pet
parents like you to help us bring wagget
to a larger audience once you have a
wagget color you won't be able to
imagine life without it your dog
deserves wagon and so do you
