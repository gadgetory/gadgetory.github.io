in Switzerland it's one or the other if
you live here and have foreign gadgets
you'll know that these free plug sockets
are not your friends
space savers please see conventional
adapters block the other two sockets if
you have three gizmos you always have to
unplug another one first the common
adapter plug just renders the other two
sockets useless like I said coffee or
toast
there's no way to live trust me I know
I'm Sebastian and my team of global
freelancers and I decided enough is
enough since I moved to Switzerland I
faced all the same problems as you are
now
culturing innovation is my passion
that's why I've dedicated most of my
career so far to helping fight diseases
by leading a team within a
pharmaceutical company creating truly
meaningful products has always been a
vision of mine I finally decided it was
time to make a difference for everyone
living in or visiting Switzerland once
and for all without further ado I'd like
you to say hello to my little friend
three doctor the awesome space-saving
adapter block for Switzerland finally
allowing you to use all three sockets in
the Swiss triplet power outlet this
beauty is the result of extensive
research and prototype after prototype
now I don't use the word revolutionary
much but this problem-solving
smartypants deserves it by combining new
techniques with safe durable materials
and a truly space-saving design we've
managed to finally create a
frustration-free adapter that boosts
productivity
while saving time and effort it
integrates seamlessly into any home and
will make you smile every time you lose
the fact that it's the looker is a bonus
I mean I love it even now every time I
look at it trust me you will to 3dep
that was created by bringing the
creative minds of the world together by
bringing the Kickstarter's of the world
together we can spread the 3dr word and
make life in switzerland a whole lot
easier if you pack our campaign we can
start shipping in as soon as a month
we're currently ready for production and
our the process of selecting our
logistics partner while preparing our
marketing assets your funding can make
this possible while changing
Switzerland's future one socket at a
time every contribution no matter how
big or small will help us set up our
supply chain and deliver to everyone who
wants to embrace the 3dr way of life so
yes things are a bit hectic at the
moment but we couldn't be more excited
to finally be making three depth a
reality the alternative well I don't
really want to think about that
Kickstarter's our all-or-nothing
platform if we don't reach 100% of our
code no one gets anything and everyone
will be sad so please make our campaign
and more importantly it's vital to share
with your friends family and network you
can choose your rewards in seconds all
of which are far cheaper than the
planned retail price why wait
get ready to enjoy coffee and toast at
the same time oh well anything really
thank you for your time we appreciate
your support more than we can explain
it's key in changing the way Switzerland
stays charged
imagine if you could see electricity as
it flowed through your home like a
superhero with x-ray vision you'd see
the energy used to cool your rooms cook
your food and light your home and when
it was being wasted rather than used
wisely you'd know right away we decided
you shouldn't need superpowers to see
where your energy goes so we created
glow glow is like a fitness tracker for
your home it gives you and everyone in
your home a sixth sense for how you use
energy so you can make smart decisions
that benefit your bank account and help
the environment glow analyzes your
home's energy usage to understand how
and when you use energy if you're using
more than normal glow turns amber than
red when you're saving money it glows
green and when you have extended high
usage like if someone accidentally left
the coffeepot on or the fridge door open
Lowe sends you a helpful notification
Glo also helps you avoid nasty surprises
on your utility bill by forecasting your
electricity cost just tell Glo how much
you want to pay for electricity each
month and the app will help you stay on
track
getting started with Glo is as simple as
plugging it in and placing our
patent-pending inductive sensor on your
meter using magneto resistive sensing
and advanced algorithms Glo can measure
and understand your home's energy usage
without the need for professional
installation or dangerous modifications
to your home's wiring I'm Ben one of the
creators of globe after buying my first
home I got tired of receiving high
electricity bills I wanted to know where
my energy was going so I could save
money and reduce my impact on the
environment and now I can we've been
testing glowing homes for over nine
months now we need your help to bring
glow to people everywhere so please take
a moment and back our campaign you'll be
the first to receive glow so that you
can start tracking your energy and
saving money right away
we may not all have superpowers but with
glow we can make a difference right here
in our own homes

the past year and a half I've been
selling custom-built game tables they're
high quality and costs two to three
thousand dollars or more that prices
allowed me to offer amazing quality they
are worth every penny but it is also
excluded many of you who don't want to
spend that much on the table the gaming
community is all about including people
not excluding them so I designed an
additional model
it keeps the best gaming features on our
table but makes three changes that drive
the price down
standardization instead of offering a
million different choices
I paired it down to just the most
popular options some assembly required
the table will take you less than 20
minutes to put together
but that 20 minutes will save you a ton
of dough especially on shipping and bulk
order this table at this price is only
available by ordinal so that's why I'm
asking for your help to make that bulk
order possible now it's up to you I want
to make your game night awesome
I want to make everyone's game night
awesome back this project make it
you
in a short way we wanted to sit
everywhere and and anywhere this was
because we had been at an apparel and we
realized people were standing and from
that idea we thought hmmm why don't we
make a simple skeleton that just solves
one problem sitting and that's how the
idea sort of shot off
the chalice chair is a sitting support
for industry workers who have to work
standing it allows them to sit wherever
they are working when I say wherever
they work is because your weight around
your legs and you can walk around with
it and then you can just lock the knee
and sit

guys as part of the noony noony team and
we could say those were like our
extended engineering team sook is was
more say accommodating to startups more
friendly and what we liked about it was
that their relationship with with us was
as an extension to nuni rather than
having this barrier where this is a
