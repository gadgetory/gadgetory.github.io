should how to drop stock that bottomless
pit Carmita triangle should have had a
drop stop that annoying gap between the
seat and center console should have how
to drop stock now you can stop the drop
with drop stop
alright I'm Jeff and I'm mark and our
amazing invention will save you time
money and maybe even your life watch
this money down the drain
make up jewelry cell phone but with
drops up you'll be saving cash in a
flash and you'll never have to search
for anything ever again we came up with
the idea of drop stop after my phone
fell I took my eyes off the road nearly
hit a pedestrian and almost smashed into
a pole
don't drop and drive keep your eyes on
the road not in your gap the singer 2
drops up is his built-in slot designed
to go around the seat belt catch
anchoring to the seat that means
nothing's getting through not a dime not
a toothpick and since drop stop slides
it's always at your side drop stops not
some cheap piece of foam it's high-grade
neoprene built to last look at all the
crumbs and dirt now you're free from
debris drop stop may look too wide but
it's squishy inside which means one size
fits all and since the gap is always a
dark shadow drop stop blends with any
color interior
