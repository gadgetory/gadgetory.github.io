every night there's science behind how
sleep makes us more productive and
prevents disease but I mostly like it
because it feels good I happen to be on
the road tonight for the national speed
cubers excellent and room 214 just
decided it was a good time to re-watch
Rambo
totally understandable
sweet flat but I don't think anyone's
counting on them to give a big keynote
at morning on five sided techniques
that's why I brought my snooze this
little guy do TSA's the Delta between
contaminant noise and ambience and
that's fancy talk for helps keep me
asleep so Stallone doesn't knock me out
of my REM cycle you hear that it sounds
good it's because there's no looping
tracks of crickets or waterfalls no
waves crashing on the beach but I'm the
Midwest it uses real fan but unlike a
real fan I can pack this thing in my
carry-on it's not too cold in the winter
and it uses 98 percent less energy whoa
that's like almost 100
i'm sanna go under mostly bet you think
is just pretty important you
well it's adjustable too you can
customize the tone from light fan to
deep family which is like packing a
billion pants and you can turn up the
volume which is great when you're doing
the five by five including that extra
concentration I used to have to take
amphetamines
and I think we've all been in that
position before
plus you can control it from your phone
you know for all those times you forget
to turn your snooze off before leaving
your house yeah but you think it's noisy
on the rubix circuit
you should try sleeping next to my wife
it's also great for kids studies have
shown that babies are three times more
likely to fall asleep when exposed to
white noise in my own personal studies
it's more like four but hey I'm not a
scientist sleep is important and those
cubers are counting on that's why I used
my snooze okay technically it's not my
snooze it's my brother's snooze I've
stayed at his house and I accidentally
took it with me that's why I used the
FAC anything I like to think of it as a
snooze button for the beginning of my
sleep come on Michael
awesome high-tech intelligent these are
the adjectives that would come to mind
when talking about robots when it comes
to building your own robot expense and
complexity will overshadow all of the
beautiful words our goal is to make
robots more accessible to people for
education and research 7 but arm is our
first product it has 6 degrees of
freedom model after the classic ABB
industrial robot the all aluminum body
six high torque metal digital servos and
optimized control algorithm come into
this accurate stable agile and durable 7
ba arm if you have to seven but arms you
can build this humanoid robot seven bot
arm dual seven bot arm can be a useful
assistant on your desk for a wide
variety of applications using our
computer vision sample codes you can
adjust the parameters to build a real
automated assembly line on your desk
furthermore we make it perfectly
suitable for implementing artificial
intelligence by leveraging our
customized mobile platforms 7 bot arm
can explore much more working space for
your convenience all of our 3d printed
files are open-source with the help of
Kinect or leap motion you can build a
wide variety of applications upon it as
AI robot enthusiasts we could not wait
to test our applications on 7 bot and it
works pretty well we offer multiple ways
to control the robot for beginners
remote control is probably the easiest
way such as using the leap motion sensor
or web control application our
custom-built servos with feedback allow
you to teach the robot to accomplish
simple tasks without coding we also
provide 3d visualization software for
you to program this robot one popular
option is scratch
for more advanced users we provide api's
all of our designs and samples are
open-source there is an old saying in
China it is more joyful to share the
drawing and to enjoy alone we are trying
hard to make these wonderful
applications available to everyone we
need your support and we hope 7 BOTS can
help bring happiness to your daily life

that year little Emma got our new puppy
or that awesome dance I did at the party
our team has developed and operated
mobile applications with millions of
users we've always taken pride in our
ability to create an unbeatable user
experience with anji you've taken this
next
our first product looks like a trackpad
but we've actually packed 20,000 sensor
elements into this form factor each of
these sensor elements can detect the
full range of forces that human hands
are capable of that means that when you
touch this device we can tell not only
where your fingers are but also how hard
each one is pressing it for precise and
accurate enough to even detect bristles
from this paintbrush because we sense
force we can detect touches through any
flexible material we've started
developing these three-dimensional
tactile overlays they when placed on top
of the morph change the device into any
type of interface you can imagine the
overlays include magnets making them
easy to swap in and out in software
inside the morph automatically changes
modes based on the overlay you can
connect it to your computer with a USB
cable and it can even talk to your
tablet or phone via built-in Bluetooth
we believe this product will
dramatically change the way people
interact with technology and we reached
out to a few of our friends to see what
they would create with a sense L'Amour
with essential morph I'm able to work
with the brush very naturally in a
nuanced way for instance if I let go of
the brush too soon the bristles kind of
Swart like sweep off and it picks that
up the tools disappear and you're left
to your creativity and that's what's
exciting
the reason why paper and pencil work
well together is because pencil will
carve into paper that's something that
in the digital world today doesn't
actually really happen all that often
that tactility that extra level of
dimension is is what makes art
designing in interphase is playin SS for
example the drum rack or effects turning
knobs up and down or piano keys and all
of that you know one controller does it
all to me it's appealing for a user to
touch this device and interact with the
physical world in a different way a new
way we didn't have the force sensitivity
that the stencil pad has I just don't
think it would be as magical of an
experience
hello my name is Adnan hoja and this is
that it's big this new device will solve
all of your video stabilization issues
with any kind of video camera the way it
works is very simple you just have to
plug your statics plate behind your
camera and that's it you are ready to
shoot your video as usual but with a
video stabilization quality very close
to the best that it can system you can
go
the principle is very simple the static
speed is recording all of your movement
during the shot then you just have to
have flowed an additional file from the
static speed to a post processing
software that will stabilize
automatically all your videos
deliberately after all this monopoly
foolishness rejected in volatile
volatile design a perishable oscillatory
flow
we have two versions of statics p1 is
made specifically for a GoPro cameras
and it works with GoPro Hero 2 3 and 4

other camera including DSLRs more or
less and even high-end cinema equipment
