founder of the methods games and movies
are something I'm really passionate
about
we have great prints and sound system on
our affordable but still I've always had
the feeling that something could be
improved in the home entertainment
experience something that would let us
be less passive when seated how do you
really feel the thrill of what's
happening on your screen that is why
we've come up with the Merced to take
games and movies to the next level
the magic that said the Murshid apart is
a massive number of movements and
vibrations that literally take you
inside the screen what we're doing at
Emirates is trying to create the world's
best motion device designed especially
for gaming and movies just imagine
seeing some of the most timeless movies
again and living the experience as if
you were watching them for the very
first time imagine playing and feeling
the helicopters engine rumbling
underneath you and the tilting of your
couch when you're on the fly Merced is
ready to use and very user-friendly
you just have to slip it under the feet
of your favorite couch chair a bed and
turn on the app it will automatically
recognize what movie you're watching or
game you're playing and will synchronize
with it instantly then everything can be
controlled from the app you can adjust
intensity of the vibration and set the
height to your liking if you want a
smooth ride or a big shake
our third generation prototype is
functional both on the other way and on
the software side we're still improving
it daily and adding features but to make
this product a reality for anyone we
need you
hardware development and mass production
is a long and expensive process and we
need your support we're looking for
passionate dreamers believers that will
help us make this kid's dream a reality

skiing is awesome and the better you are
the more fun you have introducing carve
the world's first real-time ski wearable
carve is your digital ski coach that
puts world-class ski instruction in your
ears
we've all had skiing lessons before and
they're great but you can't have a coach
with you every time you ski carve fits
into any ski boot and is always with you
analyzing your every move by seamlessly
integrating a thin pressure and motion
sensing insert powered by a tracker with
lessons you have to wait until the end
of the run to hear how you did carve
speaks to you as you ski to correct your
form in real time welcome to your
advanced ski training lesson 5 keep your
weight forward
good job
skiing drills can be repetitive and
boring carve transforms drills into
exciting and rewarding games
Corp has trick recognition to track your
time in the park get detailed stuff from
your session with takeoff and landing
analysis to check if you're balanced
when you should be and aren't lending
too hard
if you're a racing scare you can get a
complete data record to take the
guesswork out of training know what
makes you faster and set targets to
improve and for all levels of skier
carve tracks your stats over time so
you'll really be able to see the
difference carve is made to your skiing
it then lets you share your progress of
friends and see how you compare skiing
is awesome and now we can make even
better
you
more than 300 72,000 people can be saved
from drowning this year that's why it's
our mission at Kinji to provide water
safety hi I'm Tom I got be honest I came
up with the idea of Kinsey after I lost
a very good friend of mine three years
ago he drowned in the lake similar to
this one and it could have been
prevented when you drive a car you put
your seatbelt on when you ride a bike
you put on your helmet but how do you
protect yourself in water we set out to
make the smallest inflatable in the
world and we came up with a convenient
non-intrusive way to provide safety to
all of those in and around water this is
Kim G a portable floatation device that
comfortably secures onto your wrist it's
fast to deploy durable and contained
within a compact design kenji helps in
case of exhaustion or heavy currents or
when this for circulation or cramps
anytime you're on the water even if
you're just relaxing
you'll want a Kinji for you and a friend
we like Kenji because it's small it
doesn't get in your way when you're
trying to paddle out a lot of times when
you're surfing there's not a lifeguard
anywhere near so this gives you a little
bit more sense of security Kim G can
stay inflated for over 48 hours it
includes a compass as well as a whistle
for signaling help in case of emergency
having knowledge and good judgment the
first steps and water safety but Kim she
can be an important aid when you're need
it's easy and fast deploy and its are
even great out of messages
Kim G is durable and the co2 cartridge
is replaceable so you can reuse Kim G as
many times as needed we need your help
to stop production and fight the dangers
of drowning with your support you become
an integral part of our team of
ambassadors and you'll be the first to
receive a Kingsman do it for yourself do
it for your friends surf mates fishing
bodies and your family together we can
revolutionize water safety on a global
scale

it's floating using magnets and it's
powered through the air so how does it
work you line up the center of the bolt
with the center of the base when you see
the light turn on you gently let go and
watch it levitate we want your flight to
last a long time so we use
energy-efficient LEDs that are safe and
don't need to be replaced we crafted the
base from a sustainable source to oak
ash and walnut oh yeah
and just tap the surface of your flight
to turn it on or off when you're not
using your bulb wireless power is good
for other things like charging your
phone we would love for you to
experience flight so back our project
