we came up with is augment the first of
its kind charging solution that we
believe will change the way people
charge on the go creating the charge
module was undoubtedly the most
challenging part of this project working
directly with our industry-leading
and Apple approved manufacturer from day
one we prototype several iterations of
the design to perfect the balance
between charge capacity and overall size
the result is amazing and we've been
able to fit twelve hundred milliamps or
sixty percent extra charge into a form
factor that fits neatly in your coin
pocket another great feature is that the
charge module only takes 60 minutes to
charge your iPhone so you plug it in
power up and put it away once it's
finished augment not just convenient
when you're out and about once you've
used the charge module instantly
connected to your phone plug in the
microUSB cable and charge by the iPhone
and charge module simultaneously the
ordinary case itself is unique in a
number of ways primarily designed to
protect your iPhone case offers
360-degree jeweler protection the
visually impressive and iPhone
transforming square design is driven by
the inclusion of the mounting system in
the base which allows for secure and
seamless attachment of the charge module
but we've also added some personality of
a time and applied a combination of
strong visual elements to create what we
think is one of the most beautiful and
unique cases on the market augment
charge modules can be used with or
without the augment case but for the
best experience we recommend using both
together
meet John John enjoys working on his new
MacBook but you can't plug in other
devices because he only has one port
meet Sarah Sarah also enjoys working on
her new MacBook
but the difference is Sarah uses qs b qs
b is a modular expandable solution for
the connectivity of your USB C laptop it
expands the capabilities of the new USB
C port standard unlike John Sarah is
able to charge her macbook sink or phone
transfer files between devices and
connect your keyboard or mouse at the
same time for every Q's B Sarah connects
a new USB C port is created so she can
enjoy working on her MacBook without
having to plug in one device at a time
our keys B team is determined to put our
efforts into making products that will
have a meaningful role in people's lives
we are now in the final development
stages but making Q's be accessible to
you pledge now and change the way you
use your MacBook forever cues B USB C
