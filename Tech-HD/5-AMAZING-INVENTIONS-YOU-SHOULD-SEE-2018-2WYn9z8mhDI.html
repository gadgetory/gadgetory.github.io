hey come here I want to show you
something teenage bolt cutter
now the guys over at tuff built tools
thought about how can we make this
easier for us it's compact it's easy to
use I mean look how cool this is when I
got my hands on this I thought how
comfortable is this to use so go ahead
pick it up grab ahold of those handles
it's real comfortable fold it out the
weight of it's nice and balanced it has
all the cutting strength as a standard
teen inch bolt cutter does yet it folds
up so it's compact with all the
innovations that went into this tool at
such a great price it's not just a tool
it's stuff built introducing the first
action camera built for day and night
usage this is the Aurora
all right what is a photo
that cool have you ever desired
superhuman power Aurora delivers with
this full-featured ip67 action camera
with an integrated HD o led a personal
night-vision psyonix patented ultra low
light sensor technology she's 20 times
relative performance enabling you to
capture stunning video from noonday Sun
to starlit nights it's a day and night
difference capture your experiences in
every sense of the action with Aurora's
still high speed burst slow-mo
time-lapse are full HD video settings
with stereo audio the aurora is great
for daytime usage but if you find
yourself in the dark we have you covered
with three available modes day Twilight
and night it will make the best use of
any available light not only is a
compact and lightweight it fits
perfectly in one hand for smooth
operation
the Aurora is able to withstand water up
to three feet deep for thirty minutes
even if your goal is getting lost it's
good to know where you are the Aurora's
built-in positioning tools offer an
optional overlay function to keep you on
the beaten path or help you make your

adventures on social media so no one
misses out this is the Aurora
life doesn't stop when the Sun Goes Down
have you ever found yourself camping
hiking or hanging out with friends and
you want to capture that perfect moment
but it's just too dark the aurora was
built for that action cameras today can
do some amazing things but they don't
see well in low-light night-vision
equipment sees great and low light but
you can't do what action cameras can do
the Aurora is a marriage between those
two worlds it's the first product that
provides all the features of an action
camera but can see in pretty much any
lighting situation you can see from the
noonday Sun to the moonless night so
alex has been developing the Aurora for
about 18 months and we're just about
ready to launch but we need your help to
bring awareness to the product ramp
production and build all the accessories
for your life's adventures thank you so
much for your support and I hope that
the Aurora can bring your night to life
you
hey Kickstarter backer you might
remember the smart belt 21.0 from last
year when we broke all crowdfunding
records and became the most funded
fashion accessory in history we are back
with a smart belt to point out you might
wonder what on earth is there to
innovate on a belt or what the craze
could be about we've innovated not one
but a couple of things firstly we
replace the five whole system with an
infinitely adjustable 32 step track
system a perfectly comfortable fit
regardless of how your waist changes
during the day and it sure does regular
belt has five holes one inch apart our
track system has 32 steps 1/5 of an inch
apart that's 500 percent more
adjustability and twice the adjustment
range
imagine having a big meal and not having
to feel tight by just clicking your belt
instead of going one hole up and having
to hold your pants up with your hands
have a run any time make your jeans feel
like a track see take some pressure off
just how much you need to during a long
meeting or whenever our backers say they
never knew their old belt was so
uncomfortable until they got to where
the smartphone one other problem we
solved is wear and tear our staple
innovation is adding a Kevlar core to
our leather belt Kevlar is renowned for
being bulletproof
it makes our belt soft and light but
indestructible it makes it last
indefinitely
it's not bulletproof just incredibly
resilient during stress tests we scored
five times higher than the second-best
our belt will outlast anything out there
we've also sourced the best leather we
use thick vegetable tanned leather
sourced from a small family-owned
tannery in Tuscany Italy completely
eco-friendly resilient and traditionally
tan it's the most exclusive leather
anywhere in the world not to mention
exquisite and elegant in any context it
will come with a serial number
certificate of authenticity and a new
scratch resistant coating we have also
eliminated sizes by letting you cut your
belt to your own exact size</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
