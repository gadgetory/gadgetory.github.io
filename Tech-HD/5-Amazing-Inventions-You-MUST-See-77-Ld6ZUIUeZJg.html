have to carry stuff I want to be able to
remember moments like these forever
that's why the my site 360 is the
perfect solution the my site 360 can
capture everything in beautiful 4k
without needing a big rig or heavy
equipment to get stable shots and if the
trail gets bumpy or the camera isn't in
the right position so my site 360 keep
videos level with its built in
calibration the horizon optimization
ensures level viewing and to make sure
your viewing quality isn't sacrificed by
unexpected camera positioning or tilting
disable calibration minimizes motion
with gimbal Lake quality without the
excess weight and equipment and it's
water resistant so the my site 360 can
capture the entire experience rain or
shine plus if you need to change the
position it only takes a second
when I get to a place with a great view
I know that the my site 360 is getting
the best quality photos and videos if I
missed anything on my way here the my
site 360 has a long battery life so I
won't miss it on my way back
on my way back I can start posting right
away
the my site 360 app uses artificial
intelligence to create a feature called
life log which looks at all the videos
from my hike and stitch is the best
parts of them together into one clip
that way I don't have to go through
hours of footage hi Angie Bunga
off-market pretty my hi 360 is not a
fully 360-degree camera if what you want
is to make a tool specific degree video
you may want to look somewhere else but
what we are hoping is the web of camera
decide for title to capture and we
create a hiking experience we have no
intention of making the best recipie
degree camera out there but I can
confidently say that if you are either
to want to create to a height experience
my site recipe is a product for you

hello Kickstarter Jake here almost three
years to the day after launching our
campaign for the duo coffee
defenestration
Bello is back with our sophomore effort
the stag EKG and electric pour over
kettles with the barista level
functionality are small but mighty teams
launched eggs at the dope table kettle
14 months ago and it quickly became a
favorite for home baristas design lovers
and coffee pros competing in the world
brewers come
so why launch the electric version of
stag
quite simply because you asked for it we
carried forward the two features you
know and love from the stovetop stag
first a weight in the handle moves the
center of mass close to your hand for
more control for and second the fluted
tip allows for the fineness of water
streams during brewing but you can get
these features with our current kettles
we know you're here for the new stuff
after countless design iteration we
landed on a minimalist almost on
assuming base that serves as a podium to
display stag we believe the base itself
should take a backseat to both day and
your kitchen however don't let the
simplicity fool you
dag EKG packs the professional punch no
simple on/off button here folks by
turning the knob you select your desired
temperature and stag does the rest
winner hold mode they will maintain that
temperature for 30 minutes in case you
get distracted
why are we so obsessed with temperature
because your favourite beans deserve
better than about boiling depending on
your bean roast or brew method you need
the ability to lock in temp
to brew your best cop I know Haiti
lowers this doesn't only apply to coffee
drinkers temperature matters for you as
well
damaging at 185 we want you along for
the journey your support will help a
product development certification into
it so are you ready to brew the back up
um Jake that's really awesome at all but
don't the coolest Kickstarter's have
some hyperlocal social disruptive value
add technology like like what oh I don't
know how about an app that lets you turn
the kettle on and off and set the
temperature yeah I'm listening but I
feel like it just needs more you should
partner with those awesome folks at IKEA
who make the sweet connected scale and
brew bar app the total should seamlessly
connect to the app so we can talk to the
Akaya scale and brought the grinder and
remember your favorite coffee recipe
think about it wizard like control and
total mastery over water temperature
dosage and coffee to water ratio with a
push of a button a coffee nerd or cafe
owners dream
yeah creepy voice over guy you're right
we should have to model this daddy kg
and the stat EKG plus powered by a car
but wait there's more in what we believe
is a Kickstarter first we are
guaranteeing delivery in 2017 if we
don't fulfill on this promise we will
include a free watermelon slicer with
every order so do you consider yourself
a patron of the arc a supporter of
innovation and a lover of a fine cup of
joe that support our campaign great
coffee away
you
you
Oh
whether it's work or play these days
our phones are right at the heart of
everything we do so the last thing we
want is for the power to go out if
you're wondering why your phone no
longer lasts the day that's because it
takes less time to recharge the new
dealer and over charging shortens
battery life while reducing capacity

just as problematic with slow charging
or no charging at all

small start-up with big ideas we are
committed to changing your world and our
one innovation at a time first up the
smart protector cable compatible with
both Android and Apple devices the smart
protector allows you to transfer data

and enables you to charge it superfast
themes even when connected to your PC
however your connecting is smart
protected auto shutoff feature means
that charging stops the second the
battery is full no more overcharging and
a longer battery life able to detect
output current and voltage in real time
the smart protector will warn you of
current or voltage is to love and
protect your phone from burnout if
either are too hot compatible with
anything that your old USB cable get
connected you can use this anyway and
gone are the days of wondering whether
your power bank is storing enough piece
for half an hour or a whole day
this smart protector will tell you which
is high-quality flat design the cable is
tangle free and fully reinforced meaning
you can roll it up and take it wherever
you go without worrying about wearing
hair
we have the vision and we of the plant
but in order to make this market sector
a reality we need your support help us
to spread the word by sharing this
campaign with your friends and family
and back us with you pre-orders so we
can reach factory minimums for
cost-effective mass production and
you'll get your smart protector at half
of the final retail price we want to
change the charging world and we need
your help to do it smart projector
