is what we all aspire to all our efforts
all our dreams all our ambitions can we
truly be free can we feel it freedom now
we can
we created a vehicle a tool that will
grant you total freedom freedom up
movement of travel wherever you want
whenever you want an extension of your
will of your creativity of your desire
to be free two months ago I was together
with our chief operating officer to the
organ mountains in Las Cruces to take
some photos and his son said that that
would be awesome
if we could have a hoverboard just to
hover over the rough terrain and I said
oh yeah that's a simple task of course
we can do this and our director said oh
no way you're not he's not possible to
do we actually can do it technology is
there inside this beautifully crafted
airframe we poured all our hopes all of
our dreams all the roads that we
traveled all the hardships that we faced
all this to bring me freedom at first I
was a little nervous to be the first
pilot of dark abort but I'm happy that I
had the opportunity to be part of this
historical moment after the flight I can
say it was a truly amazing experience
and we can't wait to share it with the
world for the first time everyone will
have the ability to fly with their own
personal vehicles this is truly a
revolution in motion but what is arc
aboard when you step on it and listen to
the air as to power beneath your feet
thirty-six high-power electric ducted
fans deliver over 270 horsepower at your
disposal enough to propel you across
land water snow or ice no obstacle is
too high no Road exists to limit you
there's only you and the power to
command all this packed inside a vehicle
slightly larger than a skateboard we
first started designing the shape of the
ark aboard you wanted to put the user
first we knew we wanted the board to
have a friendly and familiar shape we
wanted to focus on the riders experience
we wanted to make sure that they didn't
have to worry about any type
that is why we created the our keyboard
so that you could achieve your dreams
dreams you never thought possible dreams
of flying
al cabo de pata go tradition today
ventilatory attracted a materiality to
the marabou today I windows teach
opposition to the capital R capital
moola a technocratic monomers that the
automobile or register I've seen taken
Tata Chester patina and requesting the
assured she succeeded Kuno some Avenue
data I've always wanted to create a
commercially available product for the
masses so I've put all my experience all
my skills from the past 17 years in
developing aerospace vehicles in this
amazing new product but the creation of
this truly revolutionary product proves
that ARCA is not only able to create
amazing technologies but is actually
engineering the future
