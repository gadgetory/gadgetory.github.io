product we've been developing it's glow
the first smart headphones that glow
with laser light music inherently is a
very expressive medium and having light
synchronize with music makes that whole
experience much better and I think
that's where glow really stands out it's
a pair of headphones but it's also
something that builds up that musical
expression through the form of light the
first time we saw vibrance fiber optical
wire was really incredible that vibrance
is just super vibrant it looks like
something I've never seen before like
something magical the expression
actually went back to her childhood when
the movies we used to watch and hold
squeezed to read what was portrayed
light and lasers as sort of the feature
the first time we were actually able to
see laser wire in the form of vibrance
water and we got the idea that maybe we
can use this to actually create a
product with it and that's where we
thought the idea of a headphone is that
says sort of a natural connection of a
glowing wire with a pair of headphones
and have the wire glow to the music with
glow we've actually provided five
buttons to be able to control your music
prior headphone designs don't give you
that flexibility they're a lot more
complicated because they only have a
single button glow has a tight
integration with the Android platform so
we're able to use and leverage that
platform to do very cool things for
example I can take a picture by hitting
the center button or I could even
trigger Google now and use voice actions
to control my phone it wasn't enough
that we built an expressive pair of
headphones we wanted the audio quality
to be absolutely amazing
we've come up with a lot of unique
designs such as the negative profile
which allows you to even take a nap with
your headphones we also chose a in-ear
design because it's minimizes the
external interference of the sound which
allows the music to be a lot more crisp
and have deeper bass over the last few
months we've been building a fully
working prototype and we're there but
now we need your help to take glow from
a prototype to final manufacturing to be
able to bring this to market it's not
enough that we have a fully working
prototype we need the backing of the
community we need the Kickstarter
community thank you for taking the time
out to watch this video we're super
excited about this technology these
headphones and we hope you're as excited
as we are
you
you
hello I'm Daniel Barrow fan of the most
efficient polish charger ever made the
juice box juice box was founded in the
great city of San Francisco and our team
cannot wait to share with all of you for
the very first time
My partner and I Ted macmillan first met
Stanford University we envisioned a
method that innovated the way we all
charge our mobile devices so we began by
finding the highest quality components
available and assembled them into the
most proficient portal charger on the
market today
once all necessary testing was completed
the first fully functional juice box was
created our team is ready for a
large-scale production and all funding
will be used directly to fulfill future
design and manufacturing while allowing
the juice box become more accessible
around the world charging the juice box
only takes roughly 20 minutes and when
you need it you simply plug it in and
juice box power your phone or tablet for
upwards of an hour and if some design is
compact enough to go virtually
undetected during the charging process
cloth this set we are proud to be
offering the juice box today following
$9 we include a wall charger a microUSB
to charge the juice box and of course
the juice box itself with attention to
detail the microUSB cable we include is
high quality and double shielded to help
prevent fraying and from all of us here
at juice box headquarters we hope we
share this adventure with all of you and
we are also grateful if you have any
questions please do not hesitate to
email our team and again thank you all
so much for helping the juice box become
a reality thanks for watching our video
on the juice box now we'll be just
demonstrating on just how our product
works when you receive the juice box
said you'll get it one a wall adapter
and the micro USB charging cable when
you receive the kit plug the USB cable
into the wall adapter and little plug
USB charging cable into the back of the
juice box allow it to charge for about
20 to 25 minutes and then it should be
ready for use after charging it take
your juice box and simply plug it into
your phone or any lightning combatable
device
today we'll be using an Apple iPhone 6
to demonstrate the juice boxes features
it's just like using any other charger
all you simply have to do is plug it in
and it will start the charging sequence
as always as you can see on this device
it is almost dead but after we plug in
the juice box here you'll be able to
hear the tone the second we plug it in
there and now you can see that the
device is charging there is the
lightning bolt next to the power and
that's it that's all you got to do it's
simple guys thanks for interested our
product
our microUSB version of our juice box
punch is exactly the same as our
lightning version other than having a
different connector at the tip for
demonstration seen a Vizio tablet that
takes a micro USB connection to charge
it all you simply have to do is the same
plug it in and it will be charging
you
in 2006
this the magnetic charging adapter it
revolutionized the charging experience
for MacBook users it's compact simple
and safe it prevented unwanted accidents
and made charging easier but that was
almost ten years ago so why hasn't
something similar been made for our
mobile devices we ventured into tackling
this challenge last year and we call it
snaps with snaps you can charge your
mobile device in the easiest way
possible
for when you only have one hand free
pull you're in a hurry to head out snaps
is all about making your life just a bit
more convenient it also protects your
phone wherever you are
one of the biggest hurdles in designing
snaps was its compact size we wanted to
make sure that it is compatible with any
phone case you might have to achieve
that we custom-made many of the internal
components after numerous prototypes and
countless hours of testing we've finally
condensed snaps into the size of your
fingertip quick simple convenient it
snaps as an added bonus for those who
share the project on Facebook or Twitter
we'll also provide one free adapter with
your pledge
my name is John Paul I'm one of the
designers here at carbon six rings my
wife Claire and I have been married for
about five years
over that time I've gone through a lot
of wedding rings some of them have been
uncomfortable are damaged they would get
lost I'd lose them or they just didn't
work with the kind of work that I do and
I and so I started thinking about what I
wanted in a band and I decided that one
thing that was meaningful and and would
work for my life and so I started
looking at the materials that that I
used and I was learning about and I
found that carbon fiber had properties
that represented a lot of things I
believe were common in my marriage in in
my life the strength of it the idea of
two things coming together to make
something that was durable and strong
stronger than the two things could have
been separately and I looked into some
of the current research has been done in
aerospace and they're using a forging
method that allows for three-dimensional
shapes to be made out of the the carbon
fibers in the resin and we wanted to go
ahead and make the Rings out of the four
carbon process it hasn't been easy it's
a proprietary process that they don't
tell you how it's done
so we've had to do a lot of research and
we've made hundreds of prototypes to get
the right pattern and strength that we
feel is strong unique and meaningful and
I feel like we've done that we're carbon
6 and we hope these rings will be as
meaningful to you as they are to us
you
