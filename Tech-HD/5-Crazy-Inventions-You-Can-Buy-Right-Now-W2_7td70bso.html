the next time your fancier brew hi my
name is Paul this is James and together
we've run the small design consultancy
based in London again hi my name is Paul
this is James and together we run a
small design consultancy based in London
Court - at six we've been working on
puck puck for over a year now and are
finally ready to go into production we
just need your help to get there
hey my name is John Lange Berg creator
of guitar Joe the product that makes
your guitar sound like a banjo I live in
a small town in Massachusetts that
you've never heard of with my high
school sweetheart and now wife Katie and
I run a small website design and
branding firm but really my passion has
always been music so I started my very
first band in junior high all we played
was metal
so banjo was completely outside of my
sphere of influence fast forward to when
Mumford &amp;amp; Sons first came out that's
really when banjo started to grow on me
and in the fall of 2014 I was asked to
play guitar for the church band for a
music night they were having there's one
song in particular in the lineup that
had a Mumford II sound to it so I
thought this could use a banjo it had
the time or money to buy and learn how
to play a banjo so I thought maybe I
could make my guitar sound like one so I
tried searching for guitar pedals but I
couldn't find anything and then I tried
creating my own effects patches and I
soon found that I just couldn't get the
sound I wanted digitally so I learned
that applying a fabric to the strings
actually gave it a really xx banjo sound
I drew up some plans I went to my
uncle's workshop and I created the very
first guitar Joe sophisticated right so
it worked well but I felt it needed
refinement the first step in the
refinement process was to make it look
better so I tried out aluminum and
that's about the time where I met Mike
Mike's fresh perspective on guitar Joe
really helped us to propel the design
and try out all these different things
with the resources Mike had we were able
to really innovate I wanted to give more
control so we made a design that had
three individual dampening zones to give
it a lower profile we tried going under
the strings but due to the limited space
we weren't able to get the level of
control we needed so our final design
was over the strings lightweight and has
individual control for each string
here's how guitar Joe works you place it
on the body of the guitar line it up
with the strings adjust the dampening
pads
and then you're ready to pluck away the
first Kickstarter campaign brought us
all the way through the product
development process now the product is
refined and ready to go it's really
important to me that it's manufactured
in the US so I have manufacturing set up
with a small company in Wisconsin now we
need more funds to mass-produce build
inventory and bring guitar Joe all the
way to market your contributions will
make a fundamental difference and it
will free my inbox at people asking me
why keep changing the release date on
the website every six months
