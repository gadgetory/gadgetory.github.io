protect your phone in any environment
where would you take it so we created
pro shot we want to give people the
confidence take their phone everywhere
with the pro shot case you can capture
the most exciting moments your life
whether you're on the top of the
mountain of scuba diving in the trees
we spent the last year engineering the
most waterproof iphone case available
our highest priority was to make it a
hundred percent waterproof and durable
without sacrificing style the shell is
made from a polycarbonate and ABS blend
and sealed with three aluminum Clips
around an airtight silicon gasket the
case comes with two interchangeable lids
the touchscreen lid allows you to use
your phone as a normal and protects your
phone down to six feet underwater the
deep dive lid protects your phone down
to 90 feet and even allows you to scuba
dive at that depth you won't be able to
use the touchscreen so we've developed
an app that allows you to control your
camera's functionality using the volume
buttons on your phone the minus button
cycles through mode between video
slow-motion and photographic mode and
the top button allows you to take
photographs and videos we wanted pro
shot to complement the simplicity in
portability of the iPhone 6 it's small
enough so it can go anywhere and it's
strong enough so it can handle anything
it's clear durable housing lets you see
what you're capturing in places you
never could before the iPhone 6 already
has a state-of-the-art camera we wanted
to make it better with interchangeable
wide-angle fisheye and flat lenses and a
red filter for underwater you can get
the perfect shot for every moment pro
shot can be easily mounted on a wide
range of accessories on almost every
surface

battery doesn't even last to the end of
the day the bold nut has an internal
battery that gives your phone a quick
boost of up to 30% so you can spend more
time worrying about what matters to you
the bolt nut also works as a standard
USB charging cable and it will charge
off your computer faster than other
cables once your phone's battery is full

super-strong parachute cord so it can
take whatever you throw at it

multiple cables which can get tangled or
damaged the knot comes with everything
you need to get started the distinctive
loop includes both an end to charge your
phone and an end to charge the knot and
both ends lock together creating a tight
seal and giving you maximum portability

when they take a project like the iPhone
and we're creating accessories for it
the most important thing for us is to
not compromise the very things to make
the iPhone the iPhone what we have done
is create an intelligent case that
doesn't jeopardize the sleek and
lightweight body of the iPhone they led
us to create something that we couldn't
even imagine before the lone case
the case becomes a part of your
professional or social image it's such a
simple way to make your phone more about
you it's fun stylish and very effective
the accessories market is overpopulated
with different types of cases different
sizes shapes colors and materials but
what we've done is design an intelligent
product that not only increases the
functionality of your phone but most
importantly the usability it's great
having a case set frees you from the
limits of your phone now not only you
have a smart phone but a smart case it
captures electromagnetic waves from
around the iPhone and uses it to power
the notifications on the back of the
case loon case in the back of your phone
to life the case lights up and
identifies which message type you have
incoming on your device you for your
phone even nose will get an additional
way to receive notifications without
compromising iPhone functionality it's
not just another fancy accessory for
your smartphone the case can work with
you and let you know what's going on in
your life the coolest thing about our
case there with no batteries and no
cords you take it straight out of the
box put it on your phone and you're
ready to go dear Kickstarter's we are

that the uncase technology can open new
doors in electronics and be at the
frontier of technological breakthrough

step forward into the future together
