campaign we're back with the ultimate
wheel reflector flector 360 no air drag
no weight no dynamic imbalance unlike
standard reflectors flector 360 leaves
your wheels performance completely
unaffected its aerodynamic efficiency is
unmatched in comparison to any other
reflector on the market
flector 360s design features a unique 3d
form oval film which perfectly fits the
shape of almost every rim on the market
and gives your bike an extraordinary and
stylish look
due to its sealed surface flector is
nearly indestructible and dirt repellent
Collector 360 is the first bike
reflector with 360 degree visibility
from wherever a car headlight knee hits
you flector 360 will grab the driver's
attention flector helps you master every
dangerous situation in the dark
reflecting the light back to its source
making you visible with a stunning globe
all around no compromise
hi I'm Sam and I'd like to introduce you
to live helmets the ultimate
eco-friendly collapsible urban bike
helmet in the last 10 years I've been a
commuter cyclist in London and I know
what a hassle it is to carry around and
store a bike helmet and Wow let's face
it they don't look that cool and often
the fit is even worse so I designed lit
helmets it can packs down so it slips
into your bag but it also looks great
too as a folding helmet lid gives you
safety with convenience hidden magnets
keep the helmet in its folded state
while the multi piece design
automatically adjusts and molds itself
to your head
airflow is channeled to your scalp
preventing you from overheating
something which is quite common with
other urban design helmets there's a
rear anchor for a clip-on light to keep
you visible when cycling at night while
a fit system allows the rider to further
tailor the fit of the helmet there are
no fiddly clips or locks to contend with
an art design just unfold it and wear it
our color options are bold and bright
bringing safety with color by lying the
ride of the standout in congested urban
environments but we also have white and
black options too for more conservative
tastes unlike most crowdfunding projects
lid has already been through a two-year
development phase which we funded
ourselves after countless prototypes the
design is finalized and officially
safety certified with manufacturing
lined up ready to fulfill your pledges
you won't be waiting long to receive
your lid the use of proceeds from
IndieGoGo will go towards tooling costs
to ramp up production introduce more
sizes and also a kids range lathe is
more than just a product as a brand we
want to be a facilitator and getting
more commuters to ride bikes and cities
with increasing vehicle congestion and
pollution the pinch of global population
growth is being felt the most in large
cities obesity rates also continue to
spiral large cities across the globe are
therefore turning to cycling as a
natural offset to these issues and are
installing cycle lanes and bike share
programs to encourage commuters to cycle
lead wants to do a part to help move
society towards a more sustainable zero
emission future that's why we've chosen
to manufacture
main component of her helmets for
recycled materials I hope that you'll
support our project and become part of
the movement towards a more sustainable
future for our cities by getting on a
bike and wearing a live helmet
I don't know what you want let's have a
bit of fun
my love if you feel like I do right now
don't say you're on the road to the
other side
but you know
reason
but you
Mikey Hatter we're out here in
undisclosed Northern California testing
out the new zero downhill bike the first
production downhill race bike with a
gearbox the main part of this downhill
bike is the downhill gearbox which is a
8 speed Shimano Alphen commuter hub
bolted into the middle of the frame also
uses a standard Shimano trigger shifter
so you don't have to use the old
outdated grip shift like some of the
other gearbox systems out there
in terms of suspension on this bike it
basically acts around a very high single
pivot giving it a very rearward axle
path good bump eating ability we also
use a rate link here to control the rate
of the shock throughout the travel and
based on the location of the gearbox you
get very limited chain growth there's
only a very small tensioner on the rear
axle keeping the bike very very quiet in
the chunder I believe this thing is
pushing 210 millimeters at rear travel
with a nine and a half by three RC for
respect shock one of the downsides to
many concentric rear suspension designs
as well as gear hub designs is they
don't have very good anti-squat
characteristics meaning when you pedal
the suspension Bob's a lot the zero it
actually uses an adjustable mount for
the hub to both change anti-squat
and keep tension on the primary drive
chain allowing for a bike that both eats
bumps very very well but still pedals
well when you're sprinting this bike
also uses standard downhill sized
components it's a 150 by 12 rear-end 83
millimeter bottom bracket spindle so you
can bolt up your favorite downhill wheel
set and crank set you also lose the mass
of a cassette and rear derailleur off
the rear axle thus allowing the
suspension to react quicker making the
bike track better through through turns
and everything else
bike is a pretty standard downhill race
geometry we've got a 64 degree head
angle 1.5 flush-mount so it is angle set
compatible if you want to go steeper
slacker the bike static also has a
sixteen point six inch chain stay as
well as a fourteen inch bottom bracket
the cool thing about the shorter stay is
that because the chain stay grows
throughout the length of the travel in
turns you're right about the static
length of a normal downhill race bike
ride around seventeen and a quarter and
as you go deeper into the travel the
wheel base grows thus making the bike
bike more stable every zerode will come
equipped with a carbon fiber protective
plate that zip ties on to protect the
lower part of the shock it also makes a
bash guard obsolete on this type of bike
with the the final drive ratios as they
are you run a very small chain ring and
therefore increased ground clearance and
can drop weight without having to run a
heavy bash guard to keep your chain safe
cero one is a revolutionary bike
designed to redefine urban
transportation and see your city and a
whole new light it's an electric cargo
bike unlike any other
Cyril one is designed with an innovative
modular cargo system that's perfect for
modern life our modular cargo system
lets you combine three types of aluminum
baskets to fit your needs a flat
platform the large basket and the small
basket the smaller front wheel increases
cargo capacity and increases stability
by lowering the center of gravity the
bike frame is made of rigid lightweight
aluminum and is equipped with Shimano
components for ultimate performance and
reliability
it features Shimano's newest
high-capacity rechargeable battery which
allows you to travel up to 93 miles on a
single charge and the electric motor
supports your pedaling power for speeds
of up to 20 miles per hour a constant
energy boost each time you pedal
our rear rack integrates seamlessly with
a yep a backseat child seat without the
need for an adapter the Sarah one is
equipped with a pram lock and front and
rear lights a step to your frame with an
adjustable stem lets you tailor the bike
for your comfort for businesses the
Sarah one gives you the opportunity to
customize the bike to reflect your
company's branding we put a lot of care
into making a high quality bike with
great components down to the smallest of
details enjoy driving again with zero
emissions and zero problems Sarah one
urban transportation really find</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
