quality of life they've connected us
with everything everyone nowadays
smartphones have been growing bigger our
hands have not now using two hands
instead of one is just a practical
reality it creates issues a lack of
sensitivity multiple touch attempts and
miss clicks what if there was a simpler
way a way to operate with a single tap
as loyal iOS users we spent months
researching and building prototypes that
could enhance the users experience on
the iphone six-plus to resolve these
issues we're proud to introduce a
breakthrough innovation for iphone users
the tap swiftly operate the iphone with
one hand avoiding miss clicks and
protecting the screen at the same time
improve typing speed access web pages
quicker
refresh pages instantly with a single
tab with two buttons that allow for
quicker easier access to applications
drastically improve your productivity
and heighten your user experience
you
yeah I can't see can someone move the
phone cuz I can't see anything hey would
you guys mind scooting in a little bit
right thank you oh I sure miss you buddy
hey Alden where'd you go
just wipe your finger on the screen and
Galileo reacts for photographers and
cinematographers everything from
time-lapse to panoramic projects get way
more interesting
and the really cool thing is we're
releasing an SDK for app developers
photo apps video apps facial recognition
apps game apps really the possibilities
are endless for what Galileo can do
so that's Galileo we're really close to
bring it to market but we need your help
we hope you'll join us
you
Oh
you
introducing the moment case the fastest
way to take better pictures with your
phone first the moment shutter button is
a multifunctional button that enables
half press and full press features just
like a DSLR camera with a press and hold
motion you can lock focus and exposure
on to a subject like never before second
we wanted more fine-tuned controls over
the details we capture by combining the
press functionality of the shutter
button with on-screen touch features in
the moment app we can unlock advanced
lighting controls that were previously
unattainable and mobile photography the
third we wanted a better way to attach
and Carey moment lenses included in the
moment cases our proprietary lens
interface it makes your phone lens ready
or providing industrial strength so you
can leave your lens mounted in between
shots best of all the case knows when
you attach a lens this enables software
features which can make the picture you
capture even cleaner inspired by our
favorite classic cameras we wanted to
combine the craftsmanship and simplicity
of the past with the modern convenience
of mobile photography using the same
process we use in creating the moment
lenses we started with people studying
how they take pictures the tools they
use and the places I travel this led us
to a minimal design that's thin enough
for everyday use durable enough to
handle your favorite adventures and
wearable with your favorite camera
straps moving from handcrafted mock-ups
to 3d prints to machine prototypes we
kept iterating until we had a case that
enabled single-handed operation both
vertically and horizontally most
important of all we thought about this
product as a single system case lens and
app when put together they're even more
powerful than before in order to deliver
on this vision we brought hardware and
software engineering together to design
custom electronics write our own
firmware and build an app from the
ground up we've spent the past five
months working on the moment case you
think you're going to love it
join us
our phones they're not just our positive
there are cameras there are in box to
the Internet they gave you our wallets
and they keep us connected to our
friends and our loved ones anything that
you need thus far similar cases haven't
really lived up to their expectations
all of this it's about to change we've
invented the best solar case ever made a
groundbreaking case that makes you
completely independent of power sources
reach Sonny the best solar case ever
made we used the newest and most
powerful solar panels on the market to
assure them fast is charging speeds
costly our double sided dual pane design
charges your phone more than four times
faster than any other solar case out
there simply have a look at the digital
power meter to check how fast Sonny is
charging it's very satisfying and we
also made Sonny the most solid case ever
it's extremely drop safe sunny has a
beautiful ergonomic design it's very
slim and only weighs a little more than
a regular battery case oh and talking
about batteries sunny has a built-in
battery with a 2,000 milliamp capacitive
this more than doubles the capacity of
your iphone 6
it's a game changer
we went from simple napkin sketches to
countless hours of research and material
sourcing to various prototypes and
samples we really put a lot of effort
into this and we even got the official
apple mfi approval in advance which
makes sunny an apple approved iphone
case so join us in making the most
environmentally friendly the most
sophisticated the most powerful solar
case ever built
you use your iPhone every day but when
it dies is useless what if you never had
to plug in again what if you could use
your phone without worrying about
battery life meat co battery co battery
is an iphone battery case that will
fundamentally change the way you use
your phone co battery replaces
conventional charging with battery
swapping and swapping is easy the case
comes with two batteries to keep one in
the case and one at home charging when
you get home simply swap out your used
battery for a fully charged one co
battery is different than every other
battery case on the market and that it
truly changes the way you use your phone
with other battery cases your phone
actually takes longer to charge with co
battery you simply swap the battery for
a full charge in seconds Co battery
currently supports iphone 5 5 s &amp;amp; 6 with
your help we want to expand to even more
phones I imagine a world where everybody
has a co battery and you never have to
plug in your electronics ever again ever
