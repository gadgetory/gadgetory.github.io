victims of bike theft every year
worldwide
just like I have been twice already but
three years ago we start a journey to
find a solution to this problem we
thought out of the box and King with a
pretty novel concept what would happen
if the bike was its own law we started
testing materials and prototyping we
wanted to create a bike they were safe
comfortable and excellently designed in
order to achieve this we use the best
materials possible without affecting the
weight of the bike by using the laser
technology in laser cutting 3d printing
and laughing we were able to create fine
cities of engineering and design which
were rigorously tested is special as the
word race all of these pieces were
combined to create a wonderful product
we believe this is the future of ice we
have created a bike that the first
glance looks like any other but in less
than 10 seconds it becomes the state is
love you can find your bike if you lost
and if someone tried to steal it it must
be breaking rendering it useless so now
you don't have to worry about your park
adviser you will find it where you left
the durka is compatible with all types
of structures bike parking tents hold up
to 8 inches
we know that writing together is
exciting so looking to yurka is
extremely easy considering that please
also want to steal you will you will
incorporate special nuts to secure them
and to further ensure the effectiveness
of our technology we are working on
creating an awesome Bluetooth technology
between your smartphones and your durka
now it's more comfortable than ever to
park your bike and there's no need for
extra accessories we are not alone in
this great project we work with a great
team each member contributing excellent
knowledge and skills we know this will
benefit many it will change the ways
it'll look at the future of cycling it
is a paradigm shift we believe that the
best idea are the simplest and that in
true simplicity lives people with your
support we can make this a reality
join our crowdfunding campaign at
IndieGoGo dead calm
we are proud to present delight the
intelligent white light this is a
smartphone enabled bike light that will
give you a second chance to find your
lost bike each time you park your bike
the light will tell your phone to
capture its GPS location as a result you
can always check on your app where you
have parked your bike in case when you
return to the area you can't find your
bike simply enable the flash and find
feature and the delights will start
flashing to guide you back to the
location if your bike is stolen you can
report it missing
and now the entire finders Network will
help you search the missing bike we have
added brake light just like the ones on
cars so people behind you are warned
when you stop the dusk to dawn feature
in delight ensures that the bike lights
are turned on whenever required for your
safety and the light is automatically
turned off when you park your bike

worries about any weather condition with
two options all mountain and cross
country it will fit multiple needs pesu
is the ultimate blend of power energy
and speed let it fulfill your wildest
cycling dreams
at first visibility was obvious I
started by designing handlebars with a
powerful built-in headlight and rear
LEDs allowing for a wide range of
functionality the most important goal
was to create a presence for bikers that
would increase awareness for others on
the road I wanted to convey information
about my next move to the rest of
traffic blinkers were a key component
but so was the design of ambient
lighting the rear LEDs allow me to
choose a color for a particular ride or
turn on the visual speedometer which
changes color according to the bike
speed allowing cars to see if I'm
turning or slowing down creates a safer
experience on the road then I realized
that security should continue even after
riding like most people I was used to
locking my bike up but at one of more
peace of mind so it gave the bars a GPS
feature and now I can simply text my
bike to find it at any time these
features were great but designing a
smart bike meant building a software
platform to connect to my smart devices
and for this I brought in another
programmer and engineer to accomplish
the goal
I wanted the bike to recognize me and be
ready to ride when I walked up I also
wanted the bike to safely provide
directions a feature that would keep my
eyes on the road
now we're eager to get back on the
streets with the smarter flight and we
want others to join us we're already
looking ahead at new ways we can improve
the biking experience but for now keep
your eyes out for some frightening
lights and if you're ready to join the
smart bike revolution
we'll see you out there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
