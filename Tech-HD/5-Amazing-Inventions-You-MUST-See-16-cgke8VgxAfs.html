okay so all of us own a few phone
accessories right and some of them can
actually do some really impressive
things but right now if I asked you to
get one you'd probably say I don't have
it with me so most of the time you end
up leaning your phone against some
random object instead of actually using
that expensive tripod that you left at
home so because there weren't any real
solutions we made our own and back in
2013 we launched our first Kickstarter
campaign for the pocket tripod a fully
adjustable stand for your iphone and
holds her device in both portrait and
landscape without covering the school
best part is that it transforms into the
size of a couple of credit cards and
hides away in any wallet or purse until
you need it again people loved it we
raised more than our funding goal by
almost double and even Apple co-founder
Steve Wozniak the laws said why didn't
someone do this before what a great idea
that I wish I thought I put one of them
in my backpack which is always with but
then a few of our very clever backers
realize something that we missed told us
I've got a case on my phone I'm not
going to take it off every time that's
just too much work and someone else said
so what you guys some kind of Apple
fanboys you know some people rock Angela
right back got us thinking can't make a
pocket tripod for every phone in case
model out there there's at least a
million different combinations who knows
so as soon as we ship all rewards to our
two and a half thousand backers we
started working on a universal pocket
tripod instead of limiting it to only
bear iPhones
for months we studied case designs got
feedback from our backers and tested
ideas once we had a universal opening
shape we made it in a range of sizes so
that it fits as many case and phone
combinations possible this is the new
universal pocket tripod does it work
with the Apple silicone case perfectly
how about the Galaxy Note yup works
fantastic and landscape and half way and
portrait does it work with every case
almost unless it's gigantic we've also
created this guide that lets you know
exactly what pocket tripod you need just
by knowing what case and device
combination you have okay but what if I
like it bare but also sometimes with
protection do i need to pocket tripods
nope because whenever you swap your case
or your phone you can also get the
adapters to match their new size good to
go the pocket tripods been used and
tested for the past two years by
thousands of people worldwide
they use it as the primary tripod every
day to take amazing timelapses for
making video calls and even to create
light paintings we've made the pocket
tripod with the highest standards of
engineering materials and manufactured
they say the best camera is the one
that's with you and the same is true
when it comes to tripods the pocket
tripod is now a proven product and with
your help we want to make it one of the
most practical smartphone accessories
for as many people as we can we hope you
join us thank you
there's a revolution happening right now

between listening to music being inside
the music between watching a movie being

taking over the world and it's all
taking place inside your headphones it's

you to enjoy 3d sound using any pair of
headphones waves NX is an application
than you install on your computer or
mobile device and together with the NX
head tracker it will turn any pair of
headphones into a 3d audio experience NX
models human anatomy and uses
psychoacoustic algorithms to recreate
the experience how we hear sounds from
the real world NX takes 3d audio one
step further by tracking your head
movement using the NX head tracker
wherever you move right left up down

precise position and adjust the sound
accordingly waves NX will also let you
hear true 5.1 and 7.1 surround sound on
your regular stereo headphones no matter

to tell you a little more about who we
are since the early 90s waves audio
processors have been used in recordings
and live shows from almost every major
musical artist in almost every motion
picture television and popular video
games our our algorithms are used to
improve the sound of laptops cell phones
televisions and voice communication
enhancing all your media experiences

innovate and push the boundaries of the
audio experience in January 2016 waves

family called the NX virtual mix room
software tool that enables audio
engineers to use headphones and hear the

professional audio experts as one of the
most revolutionary products in the
history of pro audio now we need your
help spring annex to the rest of the
world the 3d audio revolution is already
upon us but we want to partner with you
to allow anyone with a pair of
headphones to enjoy the magic of 3d
audio your pledges will allow us to
expand our development and turn NX from
professional software that only sound
engineers can use to an application that
everyone can use with every device every
operating system in every set of
headphones

used to integrate NX into virtual
reality and augmented reality devices
that are going to heighten our senses
and change the way we hear the world the
way we feel the world and ultimately how
we experience the world we invite you to
join the 3d audio revolution and help us

this is a cool little camera in fact one
of the nice patented features out here
is you don't have to edit your hours of
footage later to get to the highlights
you can set it to record continuously
and then something cool happens you just
tap it and it'll save up for the last
five minutes
did you get that totally got hopefully
like this that
there's something about being in the
natural world it's like magic it has a
certain feeling to it we all love
technology but what was life like before
it it was an era where people had time
to enjoy the outdoors and soak up
Earth's natural goodness today we live
in a world overflowing with technology
that benefits mankind but what about its
dangers from pollution to radiation to
electromagnetic waves technology affects
the way we think feel and even sleep but
what if there's a way to enjoy your cell
phones tablets and televisions without
the harmful effects introducing zen cube
the healthiest lab ever inspired by the
purest places on earth we used our
expertise to create and build something
pure that we would be proud of bring the
benefits of the outdoors into where we
spend the most time our homes and
offices being in a waterfall or the
beach or in the countryside gives off
lots of negative ions which is what the
body needs to feel great technology does
the opposite gives off lots of positive
ions which make us feel tired stressed
agitated himalayan salt is one of the
Earth's riches substances Zen q
harnesses lists to bring the benefits of
the outdoors to you it chemically and
physically transforms a room that has
unique healing effects as n cube is
designed to admit negative ions which
cleans and deodorizes the air reducing
allergies coughing reduces radiation and
neutralizes electromagnetic waves
emitted by technology it's also reduces
static in the air increases energy
levels proves mood and concentration
increases blood and oxygen supply to the
brain resulting in better sleep patterns
Himalayan salt lamps are not new they
traditionally come with their own
problems it often melt your hot to the
touch hes a blatte electricity and can
be messy not to mention they didn't
always look the best zen cube stays cool
does not melt his long lasting not to
mention its style we wanted it to look
stunning they had to inspire relaxation
a sense of Zen the shape had to be
original but had to be big enough to
exhume the right amount of goodness
remind a single block of pink salt
crystal all the way from the Himalayan
mountains wien case it no robust and
sleek outer shell we fitted it with an
RGB LED light source to have a perfect
glow with amazing efficiency the RGB
bulb is controlled by a nap turn it on
or off change the color or intensity
while setting comfortably on your couch
nature isn't just about the way it looks
but how it feels and smells we also
fitted in an essential oil compartment
so you can smell a pleasant fragrance
every day looks and functionality
weren't enough materials had to be top
notch as well the plastic is made of
premium polycarbonate and robust editing
so it will last an even the toughest
conditions

from the best and pure Himalayan crystal
we wanted everyone to have the ability
to add a personal touch so starting from
day one you can choose the color to
match your room we've put our heart and
soul into bringing you the zinc you to
