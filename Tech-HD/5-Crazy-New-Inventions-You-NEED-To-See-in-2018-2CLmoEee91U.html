hi my name is Griffin berry product
manager for Crescent tools and today I'm
going to show you a powerful new
professional demolition and renovation
tool the bulldog bite recipe at the core
of the boulevard is an innovative double
fork design an indexing head
specifically designed for removing deck
boards wood siding and pallet
deconstruction the double four to
provide balanced lift on both sides of
the nail and have gripping teeth to help
reduce slippage boards are removed
faster cleaner and with less effort
compare that to traditional pry bars
which require more force and
repositioning bull bars indexing head
adjust for optimal leverage a closed
angle gives the user fast action for
shorter pulls a more open angle allows
for powerful downward force on larger
planks or when demolition is above
ground level the bull bar has a
patent-pending Center nail puller
offering better balance and more
leverage great when removing ring shank
nails and stubborn lager nails the nail
puller utilizes the round portion of the
indexing head this design acts as a cam
to allow the head to rock against the
wood rather than dig into the material
the result of easy smooth removal
precision tips with gripping teeth are
designed to easily fit between boards
and are wide enough to straddle two
floor joists reclaimers salvagers and
other professionals will appreciate the
narrow blades as they greatly reduce
material damage the bull bar is
extremely rugged the head and 44 inch
knurled handle are made from heavy-duty
steel and an oxidized head and powder
coated handle protect the bull bar from
the elements bull bar the newest
innovation in the Crescent line of

ask anyone who owns an iPhone and they
will tell you there is nothing more
frustrating than drop calls slow data
speeds and constantly running out of
battery did you know that these are all
problems caused by weak signal my name
is Pete peng creator of Firefly iphone
cases which utilizes a patented new
antenna technology invented by my father
dr. Sheng Peng my father is a pioneer in
the field of advanced antenna
technologies has even created solutions
for the Department of Defense which
includes antenna systems for the Patriot
missile three years ago my father my
team and I set out on a mission to
improve mobile communications so how
does the Firefly iPhone case help
improve your signal we have a poor
connection your smartphone searches
non-stop for cellphone towers near your
physical location to make sure you have
the strongest signal possible but this
constant searching slows the performance
of your phone and drains your battery by
embedding our patented technology
directly into the Firefly case it
improves upon your phone's built-in tiny
antennas providing improved cellular
Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity just
how significant of an improvement are we
talking about
check out this speed test and see for
yourself in fact the Firefly case frame
itself is more than just a sleek home
for the signal enhancing antenna it's
wave gel inner liner absorbs kinetic
energy and is built into a shock
absorbing outer guard for reinforced
protection enough to protect your iPhone
from a 12-foot drop on concrete without
a scratch or a straight-up ninja throw
ouch
when comparing the Firefly case to
traditional big store brands it is easy
to see that for about the same price the
Firefly not only provides a high level
of protection but also adds a lot more
value by improving your phone's overall
performance I'm asking for your support
so that together we can bring this
game-changing technology to every
cellphone user we will use the funds to
continue to expand our product line help
pay for custom tooling stock raw
materials higher skilled labor and solve
the King you hear me now problem once
and for all we are so confident that we
will deliver your Firefly on time and as
promised that if we do not we will
refund 100% of your initial pledge we
are excited to be launching on
Kickstarter and even more excited to get
Firefly in your hands and on your phone
to fulfil my father's dream to improve
the world with better wireless
connectivity with your support I know we
can do it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
