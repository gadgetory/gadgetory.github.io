missed
you
hey everyone thanks for watching our
Kickstarter video we hope you got a few
laughs and you like our new product
offline but we need your help
we've got knockabout to the point where
it's production-ready we still need
money for inventory so back us up and hi
host and silver our way and just like
the Pony Express will deliver the goods
get along little doggie
do you have a dog we all love dogs right
there are great creatures and the so
called man's best friend we like to play
with and train our dogs there are a lot
of dark toys out there and a few of them
are really great but a lot of them are
made out of plastic and non-natural
sometimes even toxic materials but what
you really let your best friend play
with those non natural toys we wanted to
make a difference in the making of dog
toys and training gadgets so we invented
curved roof the natural ball launcher
curved roof is an ecological produced
ball launcher which runs completely
without electricity
so no batteries and no charging times
are required it's nearly fully made out
of the regrowing material wood and
designed to work for big and small dogs
too with its four strengths headings you
can adjust it to your dog's needs even
the ball size is variable so you don't
have to buy special overpriced balls for
it but how does it work well it's not
that complicated the roof works like a
catapult
if the dog experts pressure with his
paws on the front lever the ball
launcher has strength and on the maximum
pressure it releases the ball
automatically in the air after the fetch
the dog simply puts the ball back into
the ball launcher now he can fight it
again and the circle repeats with a
little bit of practice Europe will be
able to use cables without any problems
some dogs may need longer
other will learn it faster but for us
the way is to go you're spending time
with your loved pet and through this
training the bount between you and your
dog will grow stronger and stronger the
dog will be fully occupied and happy
after the training and isn't it that
what we want happy and healthy dogs to
make our lives better
we already build it and tested the ball
option but now we need your help with
your support we will be able to buy the
needed tools and rent a workshop to
build Kabul for you so please go ahead
and support us now on Kickstarter and
get glue for a very special price
if the roof may not be the thing that
you want but you're liking the idea
please share this video and a link to
our Kickstarter campaign with your
friends
every hair counts thank you
you
over the past three years Rumple has
been laser focused on designing blankets
and nothing else for different kinds to
be exact all individually tailored to
suit the many needs of our customers
it's the feedback from the Kickstarter
community that's allowed us to grow our
brand and develop our best products but
throughout this journey there's one
comment we've heard more than any other
you should make a poncho and that's
exactly what we did introducing the
original puffy poncho by Rumple
we took all that we've learned from our
blankets and applied that knowledge to
this poncho we've included several key
features that make this the best poncho
ever designed first we've added an
entirely waterproof shell to the top
half including a three panel hood the
bottom panels use the same twenty D
nylon found in our blankets that's cozy
light and durable these panels are lined
with brass snaps to give the garment
structure and keep out cold airflow the
entire thing is filled with a synthetic
hollow fiber insulation that's ultra
warm and machine washable we've added a
kangaroo pocket with two zipper secured
hand patches so you won't lose your
stuff inside the pocket is a key loop
and headphone port so you can vibe out
incognito finally no poncho would be
complete without a hands-free beverage
holder front and center the whole thing
packs down into the front pocket can be
used as a pillow and weighs just 1.3
pounds we've loved focusing on blankets
for the last three years and we're so
proud of how far we've come now it's
time for us to take everything we've
learned and expand our product line of
cozy durable and technical comfort we
can't think of a better place to do this
than on Kickstarter this is where it all
began for rubble we owe so much to this
community and we want you to be the
first to have our latest product please
help us make the puppy poncho a reality
and thank you for your continued support
