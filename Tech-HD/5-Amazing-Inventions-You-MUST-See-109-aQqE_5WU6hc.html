you
this is the camera a band with two HD
cameras that connects to your watch
who's that our train with a south facing
camera hey quick question what time are
your parents coming over the photos and
video chat 7 so you know 630 I'll be
ready how are the earring and an outward
facing camera what do something like
what I meaning no not that for the
amazing and unexpected moment
you share with the world
you
life is about human connection our
strongest bonds are with family but you
can't always be there with them and
calling doesn't give you that same
feeling there are a lot of things you
enjoy doing together that you can see
through a call so we made on me the
robot that makes these things possible
even if you live miles away omni's in
like a phone call or ordinary video chat
you're there in the robot you have the
control to move and look around and this
reads up the other side from having to
stop and answer a call you can just join
in no matter what they're doing no more
phone tag or scheduling a call like a
meeting our testers are using Omni to do
awesome stuff like cook together hang
out for a barbecue or even watch a whole
movie it's the stuff they never do with
Skype or FaceTime because it's just way
too cumbersome and the coolest part is
that none of this was planned at a time
as soon as they got the bot these
experiences just happen naturally we
want to make a home robot that's not
just a toy the something built to last
to be truly useful week after week our
design philosophy has two main parts and
the first is to maximize the human
connection so omni's made to be human
height to give you that most natural
view of the world people on the other
side can look straight at you talk to
you just like normal we really wanted to
enhance presents a feeling that someone
there with you so we designed Omni with
a moving neck in a seamless control
interface week almost met the neck may
seem subtle but we thought it really
makes the experience a lot more gauge a
lot more human so the second part of our
design philosophy is to minimize all
hassle because nothing should get in the
way of the Omni experience setup is
simple unfold connect to Wi-Fi then call
in with just one click there's no
software install we also made Omni super
quiet so you can hang out for a long
time without bugging anyone if you need
to move it around its light you can take
it upstairs move it out in the patio or
pull it up in your car you have to worry
about keeping it charged when you're
finished press one button to auto dog
ami is different right down to its
materials and how we make it we source
the same bowl bamboo and we use sudden
anodized aluminum another cool thing is
that we use additive manufacturing to
build Omni in a scalable and efficient
way we're doing it all in-house to keep
it lean and that means less risk are
even shipping Omni to test users around
the world for over a year we're also
backers like you tired of campaigns
over-promising and under-delivering so
that's why we waited to launch our
campaign until now after two years and
nine generations with prototypes we're
super passionate about bringing families
closer and with your support we can
bring the Omni experience to everyone
join our campaign and enjoy on me with
your own family

breathing technique can also be used to
proactively but deeper focus their
relaxation for me it's interesting to be
wearing a bra and looking at emails and
seeing how my heart is reacting to just
having to filter through emails with
this bra I'm able to monitor my stress
and do things that can allow me to
reduce stress throughout the days and
really know what my triggers are so that
I can change my day as I'm noticing the

impossible without good posture vitally
