years of experience and knowledge

weights to fit all four seasons and we
have cleverly added buttons to attach to
both surveys to make it extra warm for
those winter nights

developing every aspect of our pilot
array and we truly believe it will help
you sleep better our trust and

your favorite foam or gel for a
luxuriously close shave every morning
let me show you how it works first
there's a small screwdriver in the base
that you use to pop the top off your
shaving cream next make sure you put on
the right nozzle this comes with two
nozzles one for foam and one for gel I'm
using gel today so here goes I'm going
to attach the dispenser cap right on to
the top of my shaving cream can and I'm
gonna put the whole thing right in the
base in about two minutes this LED will
turn solid red that means your foam or
gel is nice and warm and ready to
dispense the heated shaving cream

and all standard sized cans but if you
find a shaving cream can that's too big
you don't even need the base you can
just use the top on its own it makes a
