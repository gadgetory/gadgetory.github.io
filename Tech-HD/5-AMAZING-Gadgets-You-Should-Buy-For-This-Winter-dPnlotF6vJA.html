Australia and handcrafted by most
skilled rule our Tizen's with over 20
years of experience and knowledge
we designed the opulence of a in two
weights to fit all four seasons and we
have cleverly added buttons to attach to
both surveys to make it extra warm for
those winter nights
we spent past six months researching and
developing every aspect of our pilot
array and we truly believe it will help
you sleep better our trust and
manufacturing partners are ready to go
and now we need your help to make this
project a reality please support us by

your favorite foam or gel for a
luxuriously close shave every morning
let me show you how it works first
there's a small screwdriver in the base
that you use to pop the top off your
shaving cream next make sure you put on
the right nozzle this comes with two
nozzles one for foam and one for gel I'm
using gel today so here goes I'm going
to attach the dispenser cap right on to
the top of my shaving cream can and I'm
gonna put the whole thing right in the
base in about two minutes this LED will
turn solid red that means your foam or
gel is nice and warm and ready to
dispense the heated shaving cream

and all standard sized cans but if you
find a shaving cream can that's too big
you don't even need the base you can
just use the top on its own it makes a
