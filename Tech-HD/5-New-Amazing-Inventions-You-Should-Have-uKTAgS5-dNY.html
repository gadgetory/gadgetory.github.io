ladder lockdown today I own my own
construction company my mission is to
keep my guys safe my guys are my family
with that in mind I created ladder lock
dogs ladder lockdown is designed
specifically to reduce lateral movement
and prevent ladder kick out it's easy to
use and can be set up in under 30
seconds with these three simple steps
place your ladder lock down on the
ground within the appropriate ladder
safety zone place your ladder in the
saddle ensuring that the legs are

30 seconds and you can ladder with
confidence letter lock down the ultimate
ladder safety are you still measuring in
risky situations do you still need
someone to help you measure lengthy
distances how do you measure objects
that cannot be measured by the ordinary
tape measure here is a new way of
measuring introducing axiom para para is
a to laser measure with smartphone
application and Bluetooth connection for
better easier and safer user experience
the angle encoder coupled with the two
laser measures enables Pythagorean
calculations perras bluetooth technology
enables users to keep track of their
measurements you can quickly and easily
measure long distances with just a press
of a button
without anyone's help you can
conveniently view measured data on the
display screen para can measure up to
180 degrees all distances can be simply
measured from one stationary physician
para is perfectly designed to be easily
and quickly found in any field of work
para eliminates risky and dangerous
measurements into
it can be used by anyone in any
situation regardless of age gender or
experience it can also be used with one
hand saving you your precious time and
energy by using Pythagorean functions
even the height of tall buildings can be
easily measured planning on making
changes to your space use para to find
out the dimensions para is a complete
system that can always provide precise
and reliable measurements para can be
attached to a tripod to fully utilize
our smartphone application when you take
a picture with our app it instantly
triggers the measure button and keeps
track of both the picture and the data
on your smartphone simultaneously you
can then draw on the picture to remember
exactly what you have measured by
knowing all the precise measurements you
won't have any trouble redesigning your
space para is versatile it can be used
in various fields it can even be used to
measure you para can be used by experts
as well as people who are unfamiliar
with measuring para is specifically
designed to be dust proof making it
reliable and any work environment you
can measure curves by simply rolling
Park you can also measure all kinds of
irregular shaped objects with just one
hand
para has a built-in rechargeable battery
that can run for over 14 hours para has
a targeting feature that alerts when it
reaches the distance you've set set the
distance and then extend para and the
beep sound will tell you that you've
reached the set distance this can be
useful for tasks that require constant
spacing like setting up picture frame
difficult measurements or now ease with
para
take para with you anywhere you go the

introducing allow WA 24 millimeter probe
lens the weirdest but most creative in
revolutionary macro tool ever
traditional macro lenses in the market
tend to have a long focal length varying
from 60 to 100 millimetres or even
longer
the subject filled most of the frame and
is isolated from the surrounding
environment our new la probe however
allows you to focus really close showing
a great amount of the details and
texture of your subject at the same time
you can enjoy a compelling wide angle of
view so that more of your background can
be included into your shots for the
first time ever you can easily create a
compelling and unique bug eye
perspective style that no other lenses
can compare to the wide-angle design
also means you get much more depth of
field than a telephoto macro lens when
focusing at close distances you can
start including the habitat or
environment of the subject into your
composition since more of your shot will
be in focus your image can instantly
become very informative and appealing as
macro photographers ourselves we usually
face a problem of not being able to
shoot smaller subjects with our lava
probe you can now take advantage of the
two-two-one maximum magnification to
reveal details that cannot be seen by
the naked eye the focus range covers all
the way from to toe and macro to
infinity
which has extra convenience to video
shooting thanks to the 40 centimeter
long barrel you can now shoot really
close to your subject but keep yourself
and your camera away this allows you to
reach bugs hidden in bushes or capture
lethal animals with ease macro
photography has never been easier the
tiny 2 centimeter lens tip unlocks
endless shooting possibilities you can
now get close to areas nobody ever has
before
and shoot some epic macro photos and
video footage you think this is cool
enough think again in order to bring you
an even more exciting perspective we've
made the front barrel of the Lauer probe
waterproof and dustproof this removes
your last shooting barrier and you can
literally put it anywhere to shoot it's

of your shooting and now it's your time
to get the creative juices flowing okay

designs ever

the entire barrel to deliver an
exceptional image performance this lawa
24 millimeter 14 probe lens is the
world's first consumer grade probe lens
that provides both professional
photographers and videographers with the
completely new perspectives to unleash
the creativity this lens also redefines
macro photography for wildlife

exploring new types of photography it's
for shooting anywhere and for any type
of shooting it's you who have supported
Laur lenses this far and it's you who
kept pushing us across the boundaries of
optical design and creating lenses with
unique capabilities photography is all
about fun and that's the reason why we
