tell you about a new product that we're
gonna bring to market hey Google turn up
the music we've done two successful
Kickstarter campaigns already both of
them have produced products that have
been well received by the technical
community and loved by the people who
took them home and listened to music
through them so over the years I've been
involved with a lot of products that
have supported the different forms of
content delivery from vinyl LPs
to cassettes with Dolby system to CDs
and at my last company the first
internet radios when I started como
audio two years ago I really look
forward to having a clean sheet of paper
after decades of making products and
other companies and it was really great
to start again and do something that had
really not been done before now there's
really an important new way of getting
your content and that's through Google
assistant with speakeasy by Como audio
with Google assistant built-in you can
ask all kinds of questions check on the
weather your commute to work
find a brownie recipe turn the lights on
and off but particularly important to
music lovers is you can stream music
from your favorite sources from around
the world we think you'll love your
speakeasy by Como audio with Google
assistant built-in just say ok Google
play some jazz music turn up the music
what's the name of this song play
youtube videos on the TV wake me up at 6
a.m. set the thermostat to 16 degrees
although the way musical content
delivery has changed over the years
basic acoustics have not changed you
still need to have a robust cabinet you
still need to have a powerful amplifier
and very good loudspeakers so we've
packaged all these together in the
tradition
way of como audio in a very nice little
package that has beautiful wood
furniture has a display so that you can
look at it and tell what time it is has
a battery option so you can take it to
your Terrace or take it from room to
room it has bluetooth so you can
bluetooth from your phone or computer or
other device to it should you wish
although speakeasy as a single speaker
will fill a room with music the ability
to add a second speaker so that you have
a really wide stage makes this rather
unique and the built in 30 watt
amplifier in speakeasy allows you to do
that by simply plugging in the speaker
and to all Como audio owners you'll be
happy to know that you can take your
current Como audio products add a google
chromecast Audio to it and then control
the speakers all over your home using
the Google assistant so Kickstarter fans
if you love music and would like to be
able to access it from all different
forms by simply using your voice
speakeasy by Como audio with Google
assistant built-in is a product for you
enjoy the music
hey Google play me some jazz sure here's
a Google Play Music station called
swinging jazz
a lot of the most meaningful photographs
come from traveling to places that
people have never experienced before in
the effort that goes into capturing that
moment for people to enjoy those are the
moments that I live for those moments
are rarely captured into the best
conditions
adding Riverbanks to my gear kit enables
me to go further off the grid and handle
any situation
Riverbanks is the first module portable
power solution of its kind the main
module has two USB C and two USB a ports
in the supports wireless charging
there's also an LED screen that shows
you how much battery life you have left
how much power your devices are drawing
and what ports are using the AC module
has a standard 110 volt AC port and can
be connected to the main module to
increase my overall power capacity the
versatility of combining both modules
allows me to create a portable
workstation wherever I can charge my
laptop four times camera batteries 18 to
20 times and phone 18 to 30 times the
even when I'm all out of quartz in my
laptop I can use riverbank as an USB hub
to transfer photos from an SD card to my
computer the card jump starter module
could jumpstart my car up to 10 times in
one charge and also adds power capacity
when stacked with the riverbank main
module and this thing keeps me on the
road and on time for the next shoot all
three modules are less than 100 watt
hours each this makes riverbank the
largest capacity power station you can
legally fly with the riverbank can be
used to power the whole team during a
meeting
if you power my laptop and busy coffee
shops where wall outlets aren't
accessible and the extra adapter tips
make riverbanks compatible with most
laptop models and I can recharge it with
Pico flows portable solar panels when
I'm outside so I still have to use to
power my barbecues with friends at the
end of the day wherever I am in the
world
Riverbanks kisi party connected so that
I never miss a moment
introducing one of the most clever and
versatile tools you'll ever use the
orange screw with its simple design the
orange screw is useful in many
environments where other products often
fail they're also made entirely in the
USA from 100% recycled materials by our
family-owned company have you ever
experienced a tent stake fail in the
wind or rain had your Sun shelter blown
over at the beach had your dog yank his
stake out of the ground chances are
something like this has happened to you
that's why we created a better product
one that can easily handle all of these
jobs our patented helical shape has been
rigorously and successfully tested in
various environments soil types and
temperature extremes with coarse threads
and a lightweight yet burly design Ori
screws are unique among ground anchors
and render traditional tent garden and
other stakes obsolete
Orange screws are so easy to use simply
start driving the screw into the ground
and finish it off with a clear plastic
safety cover which doubles as a tea grip
even the most difficult soils are no
match Orange screws are available in two
sizes they're incredibly strong and we
guarantee every orange screw sold it's
time to simplify your gear and use the
one ground anchor that does it all the
orange screw will replace metal dog tie
outs or provide a quick tie-down for
other large animals they'll secure your
RV awning in the wind or keep your tent
or beach shelter securely where you
placed it they'll anchor a tarp over
your tractor ATV or firewood these handy
little workhorses have literally
hundreds of uses
our family created the orange screw to
help make our outings less stressful and
more enjoyable
we truly believe you will love them and
use them just as much as we do
they are quite simply the ultimate
ground anchor
I was told I want less off to having a
baby you'll feel less after a certain
age I'll enjoy less sometimes I'll think
less is normal what if we could turn it
around turn less into more more intimacy
more feeling more passion more desire
more control more sensation more
pleasure we deserved more more more MORE

proven vaginal rejuvenation technology

amazing effect you silk and Hydra in the

canal and so can we have many years of
experience taking professional medical
aesthetic technologies and modifying
them for home use now we've decided it's
about time to address an issue that
women don't talk about vaginal
rejuvenation why this product because
women want it it's the fastest growing

fact so we created the silicon tetra a
product for women by women with
