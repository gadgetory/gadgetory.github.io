hi my name is Albarn and I'm the creator
of mixtape the cassette reinvented so
what exactly is mixtape mixtape it's a
fully functional music player that looks
feels and even plays as a cassette sort
of a nostalgic slash porky cool way to
listen to and share music so I want to
infer to discover some of the key
features of mixtape and then you know
real-time demonstrations you can see
artworks now I'm going to do a real kind
of demonstration the three different
ways you can use mixtapes playback music
a couple of things before you starting
one this is a prototype so you'll notice
there aren't any markings on the device
it's not any branding as well as the
touch panel buttons are not identified
but it's fully functional and should
should work great for the demo also I've
already transferring music from my
iTunes over to the memory card is
inserted in the device and that way we
can just get straight to the dinner so
first things first but I'm go ahead and
select a song and his play on it and
that way when I plug in the headphone
into the jack on the side you'll
immediately start hearing music I'll be
like though and now you've got music you
hit rock I'll then turn on this fabulous
retro bump off and turn on Bluetooth
and then I will put this in very muddy
we scan for Bluetooth devices seeing it
connects the music should start playing
a dimension can't be that I hear
about navigated pieces like so last but
not least I'm going to use this old hay
deck to play it back I'll remove the
covers you can see a little bit better
I'm going to throw this in there like so
good play
a couple of times so there's that
playback as well so there you have mix
tape the cassette reinvented I use it
every day and I love it I hope that you
guys love it as much as I do
