got cut
we need to be precise Oh miss the
moments within the choreography what can
we do different to make this work we
need to rethink how we're gonna shoot
all these action scenes see that yeah
yeah yeah okay
hi this might work okay places everyone
c14 success
and cut Wow fantastic all right here you
oh oh this is crazy
that's so cool oh wow oh wow that's in
lark you know I told you I used to be
the military and stuff and I got a lot
of hearing loss from my job and so this
is like a new new level of hearing
feeling superhero right now a couple my
friends to have like some hearing issues
but nothing like this this is this is
kind of this is nice so plus the VA is
usually pretty good about covering stuff
but if their hearing isn't covered it's
really expensive for them to you know
buy one of these things I'm sure this is
expensive one in five Americans are
disabled what comes to mind when you
hear the word disability why is hearing
impairment so accepted then we don't
take the source of the problem a decent
hearing aid they cost around two
thousand dollars or more people don't
wear hearing aids as a fashion statement
like they do glasses only Union was
founded to combat the two impairments
price and social perception and
eliminate hearing impairment how the
first barrier price here's how much a
decent hearing aid cost today $4,400 and
here's the breakdown cutting down
significantly on the materials and
research expenses we don't use expensive
machines for testing and diagnostics we
kept our margins as low as possible and
after cutting out as many costs as we
could we were still at $500 the second
barrier is social perception we
approached hearing aids from a totally
different design perspective not as a
medical device but as an accessory
we've designed the Olive benchmarking
the latest earbuds and Bluetooth
earpieces over the past year we
developed the next-generation hearing
aid using a smart sound algorithm and
Bluetooth technology we've also
revolutionized the hearing test and
feeding process to make it very easy and
accessible
we reviewed tabs on the only tab you can
set up a customized hearing profile with
sound frequencies optimized for your
ears you don't need a funky looking
medical device or amplifier to hear
better
you just need on olive but in order for
this to be truly accessible $500 is
still too high
our goal is to bring the olive to you at
$100 flap this isn't just a crowdfunding
campaign is crowd R&amp;amp;D campaign in order
to reduce R&amp;amp;D costs I need all of you to
help us paratis the only and providers
with the proper feedback so that we can
create the best hearing experience for
everyone let's hear the world together
you
