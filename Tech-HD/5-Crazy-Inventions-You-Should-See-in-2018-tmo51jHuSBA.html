sober is a feature of furniture designed
for your connected lifestyle with a
refrigerator draw Bluetooth speakers and
charging ports the soberer keeps you
powered up and in the moment technology
has changed over the past 20 years these
days were looking for quick solutions to
solve our problems and ways to simplify
our lives this got us thinking while
everything around us is advanced
why hasn't furniture this is why we
designed a soberer coffee table
Furniture reinvented for your modern
lifestyle so bro uses bluetooth pairing
with its built-in speakers to provide
excellent sound quality
that's cord free you can also set the
mood with the ambient LED lighting
design with the live refrigerator drawer
the coffee table keeps / bridges and
food chill and always within reach
charge your phone and laptop with the
outlets on the side of the table when
you're done roll up your cords and stash
them in the drawers
we're excited to bring so bro to
IndieGoGo we've created a prototype and
have our manufacturing partners in place
all we need is your help to start
production and begin shipping the sober
coffee table
to your living room we believe that so
bro is a future of furniture because it
makes living a connected life more
convenient please back us today and help
make this sober a coffee table a reality
we all have periods it's part of being a
woman
millions of our STIs period products
they give us freedom but this freedom is
coming at a cost 100 billion period
products are thrown away every year
that's enough to circle our planet 260
times most are single-use contain
plastic and unknown recyclable 8 million
pieces of plastic enter our oceans every
day soon there will be more plastic in
our oceans than fish we're rethinking
many plastic problems let's rethink
periods meat D the first reusable tampon
applicator small smart simple D provides
the comfort of a plastic applicator
without the plastic waste wheat
co-founder Dame which makes tampons and
educates girls about their periods but
we realized the extent of the enormous
waste from these small everyday products
after months of hard work and a bit of
science we've brought D to life we
wanted to make the smoothest most
hygienic applicator that was really easy
to use the lipstick size device is made
of two parts in a case that slots
together it can fit any size a tampon
for any woman it's silky smooth for
maximum comfort and our trusty string
lock prevents any snagging so it's
always reliable
each piece is medical grade BPA free for
safe use antimicrobial technology baked
into the applicator helps keep it
hygienic cleaning it just wipe rinse and
go it's that simple just wash it fill it
straight back in your bag fits right
next to my lipstick it's a way to be
environmental but still using a product
that you're comfortable with each D
comes with its own travel pouch for easy
storage there's room for Dame organic
tampons too
even our ten packaging is reusable
nothing goes to waste
Dame is on a mission to rethink the
tampon if Dame consoled just 1000 of
these on Kickstarter that's up to 12
million pieces of plastic that won't go
in our ocean we can beat plastic by
making small changes the best thing
about Dee there are no changes it fits
into your life seamlessly we've already
got the prototype we're ready to go
we need Kickstarter support to bring Dee
to life for women and the planet
robots are here already they are part of
our day-to-day life and in a few years
they will be a basic element in our
lives with thousands of jobs depending
on them that is why it is essential that
young people understand how and why they
are breed and how to communicate with
them robocall is the next generation of
educational robot it uses a smartphone
as the brain of the mobile base from
that moment you can program it with your
computer or tablet
robo-moe can feel just like you do see
colors hear sounds recognize faces
shapes sense when you touch him it also
knows how to talk show his emotions and
of course he can move all this thanks to
the combination of Robo Boost Mobile
base and the existing technology in
current smartphones now available to you
whether you do not know how to program
or if indeed you are already an expert
objects tacks or faces you can also use
speech recognition or some production
gps accelerometers gyroscopes internet
connection
all of these together with the
computational power of currently
smartphones allows you to develop a new
level of projects in education
Robo is an educational tool to use in
the classroom robots will become an
educational element for classes as such
young people must learn to deal with
them and control them in a natural
manner Robo allows you to learn the
future of Robotics now as it has the
capabilities of robots that will
surround your lives
few years time Robo bow allows to
incorporate 3d printed parts to extend
its capabilities so mechanical design is
also part of the educational experience
behind the idea available exists a group
of engineers and researchers with the
extensive experience in the field of
robotics our team is not only being
responsible for the mechanical and
electronic design but also the support
software for its controller the hardware
of robots typically limited us in order
to provide high-level functionalities to
general public robotics with Robo Bo the
latest technology becomes available to
anyone interested in learning how to
program a real
robo-moe can do almost anything you can
imagine just combine the right commands
and see how it comes to life there are
no limits but imagination
Roberto brings technology closer to kids
and makes it easy and fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
