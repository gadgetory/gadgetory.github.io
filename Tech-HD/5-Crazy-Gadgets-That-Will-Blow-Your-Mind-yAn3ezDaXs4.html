time as a series of units a finite
amount of pieces to be put together we
see it a little differently for us time
Xand flows in the most natural of ways
for us time is a gradient
it all started when visionary designer
Hans doner started to wonder why nobody
had ever tried to design time
while in Paris he envisions the passage
of time in a different way as the
transition from dark to light he began
to sketch frantically until finally he
found it
three concentric circular gradients one
ring for hours minutes and seconds a
concept that has since been called the
first design of time was brought to life
with one we have set our sights on the
horizon this device gives you a new
fluid peaceful way of dealing with time
but it was only when the SmartWatch
craze began that we knew our one could
become a reality
with cutting-edge technology and
beautiful AMOLED displays we have
finally realized an aspirational dream
of humankind a time with no limits
modern smartwatches suffer from the
black mirror effect characterized by the
generally blank display and rather than
simplifying people's lives they
complicate them with clutter one does
away with all of that it features the
always-on customizable color display
that is unlike anything you have ever
seen crisp and calming one brings you
into the future without weighing you
down it has taken many years and the
hard work of inspired people to bring
this extraordinary watch to life we
invite you to join our time peace
revolution and redefine the way you look
time add a measure of tranquility to
your life by choosing the one watch a
timepiece designed to give you peace in
time please back us today hey my name is
Gerald I'm going to talk to you about my
new product the X cooler this cooler is
so amazing with its patented insulating
technology and it's 45 quart capacity I
bet you're wondering why this guy is
twirling around trying to make a plastic
box sound interesting
no wonder this part is done let's face
it we live in an age of Bitcoin
Instagram and whatever that is there's
no doubt that times have changed so why
do we still use the same old coolers and
I think coolers
I think infinite quarters
with did 61 quart capacity and chill
divider you can keep items cold for up
to a week it also has a removable
cutting board or reusable plates and
utensils do you say cold up to a week
that's right old timer desi there
along with this powerful 550 watt
blender and do a high-five Bluetooth
speaker other features like a wireless
phone charger you'll be sure to have a
great time with friends if a new cooler
is all you need to start a party sorry
guys I'm in the middle of a commercial
hey man who are you talking to everyone
it's your generous support we can begin
manufacturing and already can travel
from us to you
I don't know about you but I came
introducing the Nils cable Nils is the
first-ever wearable cable bracelet that
doesn't sacrifice aesthetics for
functionality Nils is a charging cable

you no longer have to find your cable in
your pocket or bag the Nils cable works
just like a normal cable but it just
looks cooler take it off your wrist and
plug it into your device to charge it

phone anytime anywhere it's a must-have
cable for your everyday carry get one
for yourself and your loved ones
the Nils cable comes in so many colors
and styles it's easy to match with any
outfit

don't forget your nails cable when you
leave home
please support us now on Kickstarter
other Kickstarter my name is Josh and
let me introduce you to the ultimate
lenses this is what it looks like and
this is what you can do with it
this is how the optimal entered works
grab a lens that you own stretch it on
with only one hand now you can take
incredible photos videos and time lapses
through glass without any reflection you
can also put it in reverse to protect
your camera from the elements which it
in your bag for extra protection or use
it as a lens change we've had outdoors
okay so that is the ultimate lens hood I
came out the idea three years ago when I
was in Japan I was really struggling
both by day especially by night take
photos out windows about any of that
glare or reflection religion is in two
sizes so if you're shooting on a pocket
pointer shoot camera or even a moment
lens on your smartphone
you're going to want the optimal inside
mini everybody else there's a full-size
ultimate lenses now I'm really proud of
this product and it does its job
fantastically well if you're a
photographer or a filmmaker then you
need to have this in your camera bag
however I do need your support to get
this project funded check out the
campaign below for all of the
information and if any questions please
let me know and I'll get back to you as
soon as possible

lens hood thank you for watching and
thank you for your support
