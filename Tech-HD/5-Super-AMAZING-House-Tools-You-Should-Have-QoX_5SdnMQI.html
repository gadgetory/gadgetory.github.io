inch wide and the long-lasting carbide
bit screws through your dingy old grout

$7,000 versus just $100 for a simple
regrouting other grout removal methods

challenging areas and it's safe to the
touch in just a fraction of the time

works Hydra shot is the world's first
portable power cleaner fueled by a 20
volt battery hyper shot pumps from any
fresh water source for pressurized
cleaning anytime anywhere the works
Hydra shot I hate cleaning outdoors it's
a real pain and I bet you hate it too
hoses are too weak to clean and pressure
washers took complicated because they're
big and bulky and sometimes can damage
what you're cleaning now I'm gonna tell
you about a new quick and easy way to
keep all your outdoor spaces and your
gear clean the works hydro shot the
anytime anywhere portable power cleaner
for the first time ever you can
pressurize and use any freshwater source
use water from a bucket a pool or mother
nature powered by a 20 volt max lithium
battery it's a self-contained
self-priming and self pressurizing
cleaning machine you can even hook hydro
shot up to your standard hose and boost
its pressure up to 10 times now that I
have a portable power cleaner fueled by
a 20 volt lithium battery
a whole new concept I could easily and
quickly target and clean all the trouble
spots around my yard in my home until
now there were places and items that I
didn't clean often enough to really
maintain them because there wasn't an
easy tool for cleaning them now I
grabbed the hydro shot get them clean
fast and get on with my day
hydro shots extreme portability lets you
clean in ways you never could before and
allows you to maintain your gear at home
on a regular basis protecting your
investment I love having fun in the
great outdoors but I hate the fact that
the dirt follows me home but now at the
works hydro shop I can take care of the
mess and leave it where it happened
that's because the works hydro shot can
use any freshwater source to clean them
so it's the only truly portable cleaning
tool that can clean up after a day at
the beach grab your water from a lake or
stream or bring the water with you and
you can clean your gear before you go
home saving you plenty of time and your
gear wear and tear you can even clean
your dirty boots at the job site so that
dirt never even makes it into your truck
this is forum card handy pocket-sized
card and meltable bioplastic that you
can use to make fix and modify the world
around you you can mold it quickly and
simply to make little solutions to
everyday problems
when it school is really strong like
nylon so you can make solid durable
solutions with it
and then you can reheat it again and
again to adapt and change and reuse it
because it's handy card size you can
keep one in your pockets wallet
kitchen drawer or toolbox so that it's
there whenever and wherever it's needed
and because you know it melts in a cup
of hot water that might be in a cafe to
fix a broken umbrella all around a
campfire to fix broken tent pole it's
strong enough for quick solutions to
emergency situations like when you've
forgotten a tool for a job or handle
grates on something
plastic has got a bit of a bad name it's
associated with a cheap disposable world
in which things break easily and then
end up in the beam form card is the
opposite of that world when it's very
hot it sticks to other plastics so you
can actually use it to instantly fix
things say a plastic shovel when you're
on holiday there are loads of amazing
applications and we'll be posting more
examples online as the project develops
hi I'm Pete America the designer and
developer for guard low-temperature
thermoplastics have been around for a
very long time and I've been working
with them for the last couple of years
I've been running public workshops to
explore their potential for use in our
everyday lives and I've developed form
card based on these experiences normally
these thermoplastics are supplied in
granulated field which makes them good
to use the granules have to be squashed
together which is messy wasteful and
sometimes even painful this is
restricted they're used to people who
are familiar with making things but I
believe if this material has place in
everyone's kitchen drawer toolbox and
backpack like blues Haeckel sellotape so
I developed it into a flat card form
that would always be around and always
be ready to use the size and thickness
of the card is exactly the right amount
material the quick types of fixes that
are needed it fits in your wallet and it
fits in a cup so you can take it and use
it anywhere you can find it what water
is quick clean simple instant and fun
we've made form card affordable and
everyday product and are now producing
them in loads of amazing colors for
every possible application
I want forum card to reach everyone who
thinks about fixing things instantly
with me breaking just take one out of
your pocket drop it into hot water and
fix things it's simple
thanks for watching and please support
our project forum card melt mold making
men
cutting in so frustrating
taping takes forever there's gotta be a
better way
introducing accubrush the most
remarkable paging system available today
this is a brand new product what we've
done with this product is we've combined
the speed of a roller with the accuracy
of a paintbrush you put paint on the
roller like this roll down roll up roll
down it gives you a very very sharp edge
the secret to this device is a tiny
paintbrush that spreads the paint right
to the edge of the wall where your
roller can't go boil or puts paint on
the wall the brush picks up paint right
here and moves it over to the edge
accubrush works great around crown
molding ceilings door frames window trim
baseboards paintbrush I liked it I want
one get started using the amazing
accubrush hurry order yours today</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
