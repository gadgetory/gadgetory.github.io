that you can put on well just about
anything or anyone this is Joe like most
of us Joe can sometimes be well
forgetful I mean he's only human after
all with the icon phone finder you can
use your icon tagged to help you find
your phone as well just two clicks and
your phone will ring making it easy to
find with the icon app you can create a
geofence to be immediately alerted if
you leave something behind
finding lost or stolen items is as
simple as the push of a button you can
activate the crowdfunding function to
send an alert to any icon users nearby
to put them on the lookout for your item
if your item comes within range of
another user the app will alert you to
your items whereabouts complete with a
GPS location so stop worrying about
losing your precious memories and start
making new ones
icon lost found simple
my first impression of the tick wise
tool is it fits great and it looks good
on my wrist each little point that you
touch it's very specific and I like how
it goes from being a traditional type
function looking down at it to really
being able to interact with it my first
impression was that it was a neat watch
but outside of that I didn't really know
that I'd explore the functionality or
get to use it in the real world
normally I wouldn't consider answering
any phone calls while I'm riding my bike
but with the tick lunch to you just flip
your wrist twice answer the call flip
another two times and hang it up it
tracks my workouts and it fits with my
lifestyle I'm not really what you call
tech savvy but the tick watch tubes and
really easy to use okay tiko we want
sushi I can ask it to find a nearby
restaurant and it shows the rating and
the review and how far away it is
whenever I want to go for a run I can
always track all of my fitness goals on
it it's really important for me to be
able to track how I want to do my
workout if I want to use it by calories
or with distance or based on my heart
rate I was really impressed with how
convenient it was the scheduled task two
meetings responded my voice commands
very easily okay tiko scheduled a
meeting with Bob Williams for 7am
tomorrow I thought was pretty awesome
that you call an uber by just saying
call an uber into your watch and it
would request one for you it's great to
be able to focus on the task I have it
hand instead of having to check my phone
all the time I receive the text i simply
glanced at my watch i can dismiss it
until I'm ready to reply later you know
I don't see how I've really been able to
function without it it's really helped
me be more fishing it's made my life a
lot easier when it comes to my workouts
or even just my daily life okay tiko
house of weather when i'm selecting a
watch it actually matters to me how it
looks it's cute I like it overall I was
really impressed with the tick walks too
it's fast it's intuitive it recognizes
my voice faster than the other
SmartWatch have ever seen so I get to
keep this right
you
feels like you're on a roller coaster on
some parts like it feels like it's
you're moving forward into another world
it's tripping me out right now just
watching this the music and the visuals
and everything that's what people go to
shows and festivals for and now with the
laser doc you can actually take that
element back home with you and throw
that in your apartment your loft or
house or whatever and really give a
different elements at your house parties
it can bounce along with the music and
because the patterns continue to change
it constantly evolves with the song so
it follows the musical Germany's all the
different patterns are super psychedelic
really cool if you're slightly off
balance while looking at this thing I
think you'll be getting a very very
interesting display of lights and visual
entertainment just you have a big
build-up coming up in a drop the lights
going to reflect that the laser is going
to shoot something out its then totally
blow the audience lines the animations
are really reacted to music it also
works well with all kinds of different
music things awesome on the stage and
it's even good if you're just throwing a
house party is hanging out and bite some
people over play some loud music and it
will dance with you the patterns are
awesome the colors are awesome super
fresh super unique it's wicked really
made any party the best party over
Oh
Oh
Oh
what's up kid status my name is Patricia
to vanilla and i'm the founder of scuba
tank
my boyfriend are mean and i have been
throwing water sports and especially
pedaling for quite some years now but
I'm always worried to take on kids Lucas
because fast changing weather conditions
can make a fast return to shore quite
difficult though started searching for
an electric motor to use with our
equipment such as stand up paddle or a
canoe but it was impossible for me to
find a small light and flexible solution
for this reason I asked our me if you
could build such a gadgets and the idea
of scuba jet was born
for the past two years I mean and thus
far a gap who have excellent know how in
software and technical engineering
developed this quartet and also tested
extensively
during the development we have used
kubacheck regularly and had so much fun
together with the kid we have met many
people on our trips who were very
excited about budget too often this beam
asked where a motor can be bought last
year we have decided to make the scuba
jet ready for mass production and
expanded their adaptive system different
adapters give you the possibility to use
the scuba chat for almost any words for
equipment stupid returns are equated
equipment into fast comfortable and
reliable devices
today we are ready for mass production
and therefore started the Kickstarter
campaign
we hope you are excited about our
product and help us to make scoobert at
a reality by the end of this year
