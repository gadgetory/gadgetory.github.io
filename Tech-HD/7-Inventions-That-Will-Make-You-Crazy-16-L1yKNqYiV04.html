innovation
it will really find the way we live
but not to forget the art of Technology
we must describe to extend our curiosity
we need to translate its to love
and happiness we need to translate it to
music
the one who embodies the uplifting
experience of music 3 innovation can
change the world forever
you
huh Levesque is short for
holographic vector display and it is a
volumetric display system it draws
images in the air with light all of us
can be viewed by multiple people from
multiple angles it is a true volumetric
display like the Holograms that we've
seen in movies and science fiction for
so long I can see a future where every
toggle that we control you have is gonna
be a projected volumetric entity you'll
have buttons you'll have signs there's
the human education and planning
whenever you see a movie and there's a
projection it's always being used for
very practical purposes it's always
being used to describe a large
dimensional scene and that technology
does not exist you can freely print an
object but it will take a long long time
and it's not interactive so this
technology you can you can create
landscapes you can create a scenery and
move it and change you can create
designs and see them come to life but
not they can make a building and
actually see it without waiting from a
cat and then modify it again there's
also a future where it can be used as
communication device it is a first step
but it can go far beyond just a simple
display it's a holographic and vector
display okay turn it on by pressing that
button right here yep oh man that is so
so cool at its heart is an Edison
microcontroller and you can load images
to it via a USB or Wi-Fi or Bluetooth
it's basically a computer you can
program it or you can actually code for
it if you're advanced the SDK gives you
all the tools you'll need to get started
right out of the box take something very
simple a point in space as XY and Z can
you take two of those now you have a
vector
you take a group of those now you have
an object the SDK gives you the tools to
manipulate an object in space with
minimal programming skills of the
university can use in effect like this
as one of those things are really
important and this is an application of
physics mafia and computer science I'm
also have to have a lot of experience
manufacturing I designed built protocol
phone booths and streetlights I think
there's a few technologies that are as
disruptive as crowdfunding and as
important as fixed starter in the past
somebody liking with an idea invention
would have to go through a very long
security route to get funding in this
way you know I can reduce an idea make a
product and bring it directly to the
people who will help me develop it in
the future the idea is to get holodeck
enhancers as many people as possible
developers programmers artists to see
what they will come up with and and then
we can develop it further use that
experience and that that mplet to go to
the next phase
what if a stylist could work as easily
as your everyday writing and drawing
tools while offering advanced digital
features like flip to erase perfect palm
rejection hover zoom and more without
ever needing batteries buttons or even a
Bluetooth connection meet flip the
stylus that is as easy to use as the
pencil you grew up with flip uses an
incredibly simple and unique method of
communicating with any Apple device so
you can write on your iPad or iPhone
just like you would with a pen and paper
making flip the most intuitive digital
note-taking stylists ever developed it's
also a very powerful tool that digital
artists will love with flips
interchangeable magnetic tips the
artists in you will be inspired to draw
sketch and paint in all your favorite
apps in the past advanced smart stylus
features like flip to erase palm
rejection and others have required
complex electronics to improve upon this
we powered flip with magnetics our rare
earth magnets produce an exact invisible
magnetic field that is always on just
like the Earth's magnetic field clips
patented software algorithms developed
by our software partner Y advantage use
the hardware already in your device this
sense and detect flips magnetic field
and determine the precise location and
orientation of the stylus so our palm
rejection flipped to erase and other
features work perfectly want to erase
flip knows just flip it over and your
clip is now an eraser want to rest your
palm on the screen while using the
stylus flip knows since we know the
exact location of the stylus we can
perfectly reject any other object
touching the screen want to hover and
then zoom in to generate more detail
flip knows just enable the hover
functionality and we can even detect the
stylus while it is still in the air want
to take notes in a class or meeting but
don't want to reenter your password and
reconnect your Bluetooth stylus every
time your iPad wakes up again flip knows
we sense when you stop writing and
automatically dim your screen to help
save power and then instantly turn your
screen back on when you are ready to
make your next note
flip comes with a free easy-to-use
note-taking and drawing app called flip
notes we also know many of our backers
already have their favourite apps so
we've developed an app developers kit
that allows any note-taking or drying
app to quickly integrate flips features
into their apps we've already engaged
with several popular apps and we'll be
happy to keep adding to the list just
let us know your favorite apps and we
will work with them in addition to
note-taking and drawing our software
partner is developing fun educational
learning apps for kids that can be
activated by flip these apps will be
available on the iTunes Store this is
our third Kickstarter project and we
love that our backers continue to drive
our innovation thank you for allowing us
to turn your ideas into products flip by
link tech smart intuitive simple we
can't wait to see what you create with
your flip
food goes through a long journey which
can take months even years before it
reaches our kitchens every food has its
own story still feeling it understanding
where the products come from it's a
beautiful thing well y'all enjoy
deliciously served meals with fresh
ingredients the recent study from Oxford
University shows that artfully presented
food actually tastes better we combined
our skills to create something useful
memorable and we would enjoy having it
allowed speciali the walnut cutting
board with a removable built in premium
Damascus knife that spins around the
board and makes cutting easier for years
the hunt for the right knife had had us
wondering about that perfect blade that
would work its way through all types of
food items perfectly we got our hands on
Damascus steel a historical metal with
the wavy surface pattern hammered out
with steel and iron and no good things
you a motion perfect teaching experience
and we picked the most preferred wood
for cutting boards by professional chefs
the walnut which the cutting board has
been carved out of is of the finest
grain selected for its durability and
for the splendor that it brings to
speciality
these two facts combined have led to the
development of a unique knife and
cutting board solution that allows for
easy cutting chopping and slicing dicing
and even peeling of delicious foods such
as fruits vegetables cheeses breads
meats and more for presenting them in an
appealing manner with specially a light
cutting board every chop and slice will
be fast and straight cut as professional
chef steel the idea behind speciality is
being sophistication and ambience
together which will amaze friends and
bring something special to any meal our
Damascus knife can rotate around the
board and does not just work its way up
and down but right and left as well we
spent a lot of hours finding a way to
attach a custom knife at a walnut
cutting board that spins it around we
finally developed a built-in brass pen
we made the brass pin and knife
removable so when any of the parts need
to be cleaned
including the knife and pin will be able
to unassembled the whole system is
incredibly intuitive the knife swiveling
along the surface of the cutting board
in order to reach any food item that you
place on it when we designed our knife
we didn't want to have the unnatural
plastic handle so that's why we used
fine goes within our knives handles the
idea is to give value to good quality
food and using it with enjoyment if
you're happy when you're cooking your
food is going to be happy well it's
gonna be more delicious our 17 inches
long Damascus knife can be easily
separated from the cutting board
extra large items whether it's delicious
pizza or gigantic watermelon make an
unforgettable impression on your guests
people not stop asking you questions
about your special a cutting board we
know that there are hosts and hostesses
all around the world just waiting to get
something like this into their homes we
are very excited to bring specially
Ollie to your home and hope you want to
