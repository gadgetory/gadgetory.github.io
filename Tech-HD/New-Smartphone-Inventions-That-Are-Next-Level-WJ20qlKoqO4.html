phone and not only a smartphone's
expensive to replace but having to deal
with lost photos the lost contacts and
the lost apps is simply a pain since
buying my new iPhone 10 the fear of the
water damage phone has now left me with
being around boats and constantly on the
water has been checking my pockets every
time I walk down the dock
I wondered my new smartphone to be able
to float without any bulky accessories I
needed a device that worked the same as
a lifejacket but fits seamlessly under
my phone and comfortably into my pocket
that's when I came up the phone floaty
Foam floaties comes in high visibility
colors so you can easily spot them
dropped off the side of the boat it's
also point enough to keep your phone in
reception so if you lose it and need to
use Find My iPhone you can the secret to
the phone floaty is the buoyancy tested
material and the way that it's stuck to
your phone
high-grade 3m double-sided adhesive make
sure the floaty doesn't come off or
dropped or shaken every minute one
garbage-truck worth of plastic is dumped
into the ocean not only will your foam
floating stop you from adding to the
problem with 5% for the lifetime of foam
floaties will go towards keeping our
oceans and waterways clean starting with
proceeds going towards the ocean cleanup
which is estimated to remove half the
wastes from the Great Pacific Garbage
Patch within five years time our phone
floaty designs are ready to go now all
we need now is your support to get each
of the different models molded and into
production for just $15 not only will
you be supporting a fantastic cause but
losing your phone to the depths of the
ocean will soon be a thing of the past
is picked our Pro it makes your phone
function and feel like a DSLR see every
time a new smartphone comes out it's
always about one thing the camera
they've gotten amazing every small
detail the camera is always examined the
size of the sensor the amount of light
that goes in a new special tech for
pixels and mountains of software and
algorithms as they call it today
ai when you look closely at the efforts
they're made of two different things one
is to make a better camera and the other
is to make everyone's experience with it
a good one that second part basically
means that you and a man who lives in a
cave will have the same outcome point
tap and that's it nothing to think about
or configure so many unbelievable
technological achievements and these
cameras that are even more amazing when
you can control them and they're buried
under mountains of menus some of them
can't even be controlled at all picked
our pro enables photographers to use all
the smartphone cameras incredible
features while maintaining a great user
experience here's how it works
I downloaded the picked our app then I
just slide picked our on now let's say I
want to take a picture of our camera guy
I use this wheel here that controls
exposure then I slowly move the zoom to
the desired spot then a short shutter
press for focus and they're a perfect
professional picture the three P's of
photography I just invented that that's
not even a real thing picked our feels
and looks just like a classic camera it
has a brass body with a satin chrome
finish just like like our Minox besides
looking beautiful that metal gives
picked our the firm grip and weight of a
camera for better stability just like a
camera picture has four external buttons
and wheels for precise control over the
phone's camera and for unleashing its
full potential
to really complete the camera feel and
help take pictures in the Sun glares on
the phone there's the viewfinder it
makes me feel like Annie Leibowitz or
Robert Capa might be a better choice
being a man and all let's look at the
features picked our comes with an app
that detects all your phone's abilities
and in most phones even adds
capabilities that other phones have it
also has advanced video features just
like a real camera every one of those
features is accessible through the
wheels and buttons of picked our take
for example the continuous zoom an
important tool when shooting a video
with picked are I just use the rocker
switch through the app I can even
control the speed of the zoom simple
enough even for the caveman then there's
the shutter release button that easily
takes pictures when fully pressed and
that locks focus on exposure when half
pressed there's the exposure
compensation wheel for better lighting
control it also allows for a quick flip
between front and back cameras you know
up quick selfie between shots this
button here is called the smart wheel it
allows the user to easily scroll between
eight preset modes including full manual
shutter priority ISO and a video mode
offering advanced video features such as
white balance shutter speed and frame
rate the picked our app offers so many
professional photo and video options
just choose I'll go with macro I'm gonna
focus on this fight we couldn't get a
real spider press the button and that's
it a macro shot of a fake spider I can
also use the manual focus on whatever
part I choose because it's a camera on
the top of picked our pro there is a
cold shoe connector for LED devices or a
shotgun light and on the bottom you can
connect a tripod another feature I like
is that picked R has a built-in battery
and it wirelessly charges your phone
when it's in so your shoots don't end up
roughly with a dead battery picked our
pro works with really almost any phone
as long as it has a phone shape and with
most phone cases also its future proof
meaning that whatever new OS or new
Android candy name will come out picked
our pro upgrades to fit it and there's
no setup or pairing process picked ours
app and buttons work through an
ultrasonic wireless system that takes
very little energy with instant
engagement just plug and play this is
the second and more advanced version of
pict are the team behind it has
successfully crowdfunded and shipped the
first picked are
as well as three other photography gear
campaigns this is their best product yet

pictures like pictures are meant to be
taken support picked are and make the
