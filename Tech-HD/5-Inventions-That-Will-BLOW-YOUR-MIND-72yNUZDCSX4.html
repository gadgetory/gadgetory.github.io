night sweats insomnia the list that
keeps us awake seems endless
whatever the reason most people look
over at their alarm clock each morning
and wish for more sleep temperature is a
key element in sleep in fact it's
temperature change that triggers sleep
cycles I'm Todd Youngblood co-founder of
cryo our smart cooling sleep solution is
designed to help you sleep better by
sleeping cooler
the recommended sleep temperature this
is cool is 60 degrees Fahrenheit this
isn't a question of comfort this is how
we can dramatically improve sleep by
sculpting sleep cycles athletes don't
use a fan to recover they use an ice
bath or cryo chamber this is why we've
designed the cryo smart sleep system
with a thermo regulator that actively
cools water then circulates it in a thin
single sized mattress pad the quiet
control unit is small enough to fit
under the bed out of sight our cryo
system allows you to set the temperature
to the schedule you choose hour by hour
and day by day controlled by a
proprietary smartphone app either
manually or automatically the
temperature is adjusted to help you fall
asleep faster and lengthen deep sleep
the warm awake setting maximizes your
last sleep cycle by gently warm me awake
at just the right time by connecting
your cryo smart sleep system to your
Wi-Fi network we can access the
information on your favorite sleep
tracker or fitness
sleep improvement is shown on our app by
compiling sleep tracking data to chart
progress and optimize sleep efficiency
your core body temperature is at its
lowest during sleep but if you can't
maintain that COO or body temperature
you will wake up before you can truly
recover cryo offers a significant drop
in temperature that hacks into the sleep
cycle maintaining a cooler core body
temperature throughout the night testing
by professional Olympic and other elite
athletes has demonstrated phenomenal and
groundbreaking results several
professional athletes have mentioned
they now sleep through the night for the
first time in their adult lives through
that testing we're able to show lower
heart rates better recover times and
deeper sleep cycles resulting in an
increased sleep efficiency by as much as
20% that's like an extra hour of sleep
each night for free cryo combines three
elements track control and change track
using your favorite sleep tracker or
fitness band control using the
smartphone app and change change the
temperature to sleep cooler and enjoy
recuperative deep sleep sleep is
essential at cryo we make great sleep
easy automatic and consistent but we
need your help to spread the word share
how great sleep is now possible
pre-order your cryo smart sleep system

dream deeper and go farther
you
the humdrum the rat the movements
we get caught up in the rat maze
neglecting the importance of
individuality
Buster if
there comes a point on the sentiment
resident extremists
I've got to go
and do it
it's time to simplify without compromise
it's time to take the essentials and
leave the rest behind
de sling was specifically designed not
to take the spot but to vanish from
securely comfortably resting it feedback
but with quick access pockets to support
you efforts it allows you to focus on
life ahead instead of the pack behind
subtly stylish and loaded with
convenience day slaying is the perfect
companion for your trip through ten take
for example the seamless access of every
compartment the sliding strap allows you
to get your things without removing your
back and a power cord pass-through
allows for simple charging on the go
when it's time to hit the trail rest
assured you'll be able to take him up
here they sling expands when more space
is needed you can more than double its
six litre bottle throw cavernous 13
liters where you can fit a full change
of clothes and easily add more camera
gear not to mention keeping things
organized but the uniquely designed
whisper pods which creep your belongings
and adhere to the inside of your pack
when you're in the white nothing should
stop you least of all a little weather
the day slang is rugged as it is
functional zippers are watertight and
the whole path is weatherproof
in your gear safe from the elements when
it's time to take a breather during
moments in the Sun you'll be resting
their feet more than your back
that's because day sling offers maximum
comfort with its internal load
optimising system so get out there and
take on the adventure it's time to chase
the path ahead
how do you know if the pillow you're
sleeping on is garbage warnings what
you're about to see is actual actual
garbage I'm as shocked as you are ah so
that's how you know if the pillow you're
sleeping on is full of garbage
unfortunately expensive or cheap most
pillows on the market are simply
terrible and this is exactly why the
real-life comfort scientists that
brought you the revolutionary purple bed
with their inventive genius to work on
designing a completely new kind of
pillow
presenting the purple pillow the only
pillow designed to perfectly respond to
your individual sleep type Oh
interesting
huh but before we get too far into the
purple pillow let's take a quick look at
what's inside other pillows on the
market you see for years pillow
technology has refused to grow up like
your brother who's still waiting for his
Hogwarts acceptance letter they
basically take some loose softish stuff
and put it inside of a bag this is a
problem though if the inside of a pillow
is just loose fluff no matter how you
shape and shift your pillow to fit your
neck as you sleep it all falls flat this
is the reason that no matter what your
bedtime pillow looks like your morning
pillow looks like this the half pipe a
u-shaped gulch caused by a complete
evacuation of the pillow fluff to either
side the wedge the flattening of fluff
resulting in no neck support and basic
sadness the untamable bulge caused by an
overstuffed or / firm pillow results in
the ninety degree next sleep position
and a future job as an evil henchman the
curvy girl these curves are always
either too much to handle or that just
isn't enough for true neck support oh
and it's memory foam so no thanks others
though have tried to fix the problem of
loose fluff with this memory foam but
memory foam has its own problems
it starts softish then as it warms the
cells compact it loses its shape and
becomes a hot sweaty break unlike any
pillow before it purple pillow uses a
patented comfort grid system that gives
locally but not globally and even the
design the grid itself is specially
engineered to sync a bit more in the
center where your head rests while
remaining comfortably supportive under
your neck where you need it I mean just
look at that beautiful neck alignment
and it doesn't matter if you sleep
backside or undecided the purple pillow
will give you the exact support you need
every time
and that there is the magic of science
everybody but what if you find you need
more or less support well for those who
crave adjustability the purple pillow is
equipped with an adjustable air booster
that you can raise or lower to your
exact comfort needs it's a completely
new sleeping experience it doesn't feel
like the pillows of old it's got kind of
like a blobby feel like sleeping on the
belly of a friendly fat man trust me is
it good thing also we've said it before
weight is quality and the purple pillow
is quality and its adjustability makes
it the perfect pillow for everyone yup
that's 80 comforts per minute
comfortable so you can go ahead and take
all your old pillows and burn them
actually don't because many of them are
full of toxic chemicals that we just
don't want to breathe and hate to all
you chronic pillow flippers always
craving the cool side of the pillow
well you are always sleeping on the cool
side of the pillow
it reads much cooler and post sleep
temperature than the competition if you
or someone you know sleeps we'd love
your support pledge um down here purple
