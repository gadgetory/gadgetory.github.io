the Golden Hour is that 60 minute window
between when a service member is wounded
to the time the helicopter comes and
flies them back to base so they can get
immediate medical attention but before
that helicopter arrives this is the item
that saves American lives and troops
direct is providing it in the moments
after a service member is shot there is
massive bleeding and what the xstat does
is it injects little pieces of gauze
into the wound and coagulates everything
so that service member does not bleed
out before that helicopter can come and
get them back for treatment but what
this is doing is its new and it's
innovative where they're East because
gauze wrapped around and stuffed in this
is the item that is actually injecting
it down in there and stopping that
bleeding servicemembers medics the docs
have contacted us from the Middle East
asking for this item specific these cost
about three hundred dollars each and I
can't open it up because they're sealed
for sanitary purposes that's about three
hundred dollars each and we're ship more
than one let's just say over to the
Middle East to where our Special
Operations units are fighting Isis we
purchase these and we save lives with
these because of your support give today
at troops direct org Facebook Twitter
Instagram follow us there help us keep
our troops alive and safe we'll talk to
you soon
you
as father to two boys and an engineer I
look for ways to develop my kids
imagination
so I began developing a toy that would
combine creativity and technology that's
where follow grams comes in we invented
a smart projector that makes learning to
draw fun and simple your child will
become a true sketch wizard with our
unique step-by-step system easy-to-use
controls allow kids to choose from
hundreds of drawing and they can use
follow grams to learn to write numbers
and letters too kids can also capture
any image they like and instantly
project it on paper with the follow
grams app
hi my name is shit father of two and
father of flycatcher we'd better follow
grams which is a unique device that
connects to an app and teach your kids
how to draw and write Kickstarter we
need your help we spent the last year
building and testing programs on generic
team and manufacturer partners are ready
with your funding wouldn't start
production so if you press like us the
monkeys to grow up creativity then beg
us and share this project with your
friends thank</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
