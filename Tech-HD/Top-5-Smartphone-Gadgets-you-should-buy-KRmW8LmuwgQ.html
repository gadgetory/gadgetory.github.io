we use our smartphones for everything
but it seems like the battery can never
keep up before long it's at 1% and on
the verge of dying
now you might carry a charging cable
with you
but sometimes there are no power outlets
nearby and even if there were the chief
cable that comes with your phone isn't
always reliable but think about the
power sources that are all around us all
the time everywhere you look there are
people with smartphones and tablets each
with their own battery what if there was
a way for our devices to connect with
each other and share their battery life
well now there is
with any link the only charging cable
you'll ever need on one end there's a
microUSB connector for Android phones
for iPhones just slide on the attached
lightning adapter the other end has a
standard USB connector for wall chargers
and computers the cable itself is
protected with tangle free nylon for
extra durability but what really makes
any link so unique is its ability to
share battery life between devices
here's how it works
hidden within the USB connector is a
pop-out micro USB I just plug this end
into my phone she plugs the other end
into hers and just like that her phone
is charging pretty amazing right no wall
outlet no batteries just one amazing
cable any link works with more than just
phones if I have my tablet on me I can
use its large battery as a power source
to keep my phone charged I just connect
the two using my any link cable throw
them in my bag and I can charge my phone
on the go with any link I can stop
worrying about my battery life and enjoy
my social life if my battery is running
low I know I can count on a friend to
lend a charge but any link goes beyond
just passing on battery life connected
devices can transfer files too with any
link you can quickly transfer your media
to another device without using up your
data so I can transfer files cards from
a friend or plug into an outlet
all for the same price as a standard
Apple charging cable our friends are all
different and so are their devices
Android iPhone tablets smart watches
even Kindle it doesn't matter any link
lets us connect our devices so we can
stay connected with our friends
you
smartphones

and comprehend things but on an average
