down and recharge and so do our devices
and charging them can be quite
cumbersome introducing slice charge now
you can conveniently charge the full
range of Apple products iPhone Apple
watch and air pods all on one elegant
and very thin charging base slice
charges the world's thinnest
three-in-one wireless charging base in
fact it's so thin it's thinner than any
iPhone ever made so why is it we can
make it so thin other charging bases
cannot actually charge your Apple watch
they require that you take your Apple
watch charger and install it into their
charging base the slice charger base is
designed with standard Qi wireless
compatible charging capability and it
works with a separate and unique
protocol only used with the Apple watch
the first of its kind
we built both technologies into one base
because we built both of these wireless
charging technologies into one charging
base we could build it thinner than
anything else available currently the
iPhone 10 comes with a power supply that
can supply 5 watts
however the iPhone 10 with slice charge
through the Qi wireless protocol and
safely supply up to 18 watts more than
doubling the time it takes to charge the
first 50 percent of the battery
for the air pods we have a really unique
solution this simple looking synthetic
leather case may look ordinary enough we
have managed to hide all of the
electronics within its 2 millimeter
thick skin it even has an indicator LED
to show that your iPods are charging in
an effort to make this product
accessible to as many people as possible
we set the starting price at only 39
dollars three times less expensive than
the accessories it replaces slice charge
the world's thinnest three-in-one
wireless charging base

take care most of things of snapping but
we couldn't have Wankel photos unless

totally a perfect a man with your genes
whose fault was always missing part of
buildings every time wanna have more
background while you are filming or
taking selfies I wanna have a good for
photo without anyone being ops
new shoes release did I almost see
Brenda a purely professional
I'm Thomas Grove a and together with my
team at Saifu we develop functional
fashion we asked the question what's the
simplest solution to carry our switch
around town it needed to be attractive
easy to access protective well-organized
and just the right size we started with
the shape and needed to be wide enough
to hold the switch without removing the
Joye cons the height needed to be the
same height as the switch but the depth
it needed to carry more than just your
switch
we designed a removable Center divide
that protects your screen holds 12 games
and is held in place by magnets with the
switch and divider in place there's
still enough room for all your daily
essentials whether that's 5 amiibos or
your phone wallet keys USB charger and
even your passport and boarding pass for
those who like to gain while on the go
magnetic snaps on the cloth version and
classic brass does on the leather
version make opening and closing the bag
of snap we also wanted to add an extra
layer of protection for the occasional
accident that's why we lined both bags
with the same impact foam we use on our
motorbike jackets
since this bag is so simple we knew it
needed great craftsmanship and materials
to stand out our leather bag is a
hundred percent leather inside and out
and handmade by skilled artisans
our cloth bag is made with a durable
waterproof fabric and complemented by
magnetic buckles and custom metal
hardware I take my switch bag with me
everywhere even when I'm not taking the
switch we hope you'll support this
project and become a backer today so you
too will take your switch with you
everywhere you go thank you for your
support</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
