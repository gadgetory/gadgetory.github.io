we r power practical we design and make
practical power products Kickstarter is
where we make our ideas a reality and
we're back to announce our latest
innovation the jewel The Jewel is a
smart mug designed to keep coffee or tea
at the temperature you set all day long
here's the issue coffee is brewed
between 195 and 205 degrees but most
people enjoy their drink between 120 and
150 degrees that's a big difference if
you drink coffee or tea you probably
have a collection of the mugs we have
dozens and we tested them all ceramic
mugs cool too quickly leaving only a few
minutes in that ideal drinking range we
also have the tongue scorchers insulated
mugs that keep your drink too hot for
too long enter the jewel designed to
cool your drink quickly to your perfect
temperature and then keep it there to
the last drop setting your favorite
temperature is as easy as twisting the
bottom pick a spot between 120 and 150
degrees once the temperature set plug
the coaster into a USB port phillip the
jewel and place on the coaster the
jewels lid is just as important to
keeping your drink at that perfect
temperature as the technology that
powers it the lid has three settings
cooling sealed and drinking the lid and
the coaster work together to keep it
just right when the light is amber it's
too hot with a simple turn of the lid
the jewel quickly vent heat and cool
your drink if your drink is cooled off
the light will turn blue twist the lid
to seal this will trap heat and the
jewel will warm your drink to the
temperature you set when you're on the
go if you feel mode to keep it hot and
prevent spills
when the light goes white the temps just
right twist the ledge drinking position
and enjoy when the jewels on the coaster
it will stay at that perfect temperature
all day long the jewels coasters were
designed for both work and play with two
models one for the home or office and
one for your car whether you're
commuting to work at the office your
house or off to the next adventure the
jewel will deliver you that perfect cup
every time our Kickstarter backers have
played a huge role in our company and
are ultimately what brought us to life
we feel very fortunate to be part of
this new wave of business and look
forward to seeing you all again please
