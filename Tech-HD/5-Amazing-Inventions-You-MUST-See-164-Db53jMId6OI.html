magical and how it works we couldn't be
happier I turned out developing new

time-consuming activity after 18 months

two years ago we set out to change the
way backpacks are used we redesigned
everything every seam buckle and we
released Joey and you loved it all your
support inspired us to challenge
ourselves even further so we started
thinking about today's wallets let's
face it wallets are either bulky and
uncomfortable or way too minimal so we
came up with something new to combine
ten crafted traditional materials with
an innovative design meet Jin Jin has
just two compartments you can access
everything you need in one swift motion
the stainless steel clip can hold ten
cards twenty bills with any combination
of the two so there's no wasted state
coin it has a pocket that holds
everything from coin to key to u.s. DC
we've also given Jin a concealed drawer
for small items you need to keep safe oh
and once again we've got your back
Jin comes with an RFID blocking card so
forget about your information being
stolen everything about this wallet thin
and light we make out of leather or
microfiber so you can choose the style
that's right for you Jin is tiny but
it's got room for everything you need
everyday everywhere this is our second
campaign and once again we're ready for
production we just need your support to
make it happen
