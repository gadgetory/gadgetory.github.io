I'll see you in a bit so you might not
been able to hear that but using Ori I
was able to have a call and that's
because Ori is a voice assistant bring
that turns your finger into a smart
phone all through just a touch of the
ear but why that's because the way in
which we're using our devices is
changing changing from a world where we
use screens and touch to one where we
talk now Ori uses bone conduction and
bone conduction has been used in many
medical grade devices we package it in a
way that ascends vibrations through your
finger directly into year so only you
can hear and that allows you to hear and
talk to just your finger hey man that's
music thanks to bone conduction and the
dual noise cancelling microphone you can
hear and talk even and loud places
so check this out or is perfectly
private and discreet using it makes a
futures like a secret patient Inori is
more than just a neat gadget for taking
and making calls because behind it is
powerful voice artificial intelligence
her friend Siri and Google assistant it
puts them exactly where you need them
think about all the different things
that you can do and one of my favorite
translation all we have to do is just
motion upwards and say alright how do I
say where are the burritos in Spanish
understand lost burritos and just like
burritos come in different flavors Ori
comes in three different colors I
guarantee you there's an Ori ring for
every outfit and every occasion
and even better or eat a splash-proof -
look guys I know how popular you are
and that's why you have the Ori app
because it helps you filter out
everything else and there's four LED
lights that tell you what kind of
messages are coming through come on
let's hit the streets to see what people
think of Ori
it's amazing
thousands of people have tried or it and
we're finally ready to start making and
sharing the origin with the rest of the
world and with everything that's
happened I can't help but think of our
inspiration my dad he also happens to be
visually impaired Ori doesn't just help
the visually impaired access something
they've had difficulty before
smartphones but in turn they have
inspired us to use our devices in new
natural screen freeways I really want
our venture in darkness to power the
screen free revolution thanks for
watching guys remember to pack us today
because one day with Ori you too can
find your voice
this is the shift cam to a compact multi
lens phone case that helps you take that
perfect shot without all the heavy gear

to allows you to slide and snap between
six camera enhancing lenses in one
portable iPhone case wide-angle to help
you photograph the world just as you see
it

perspective macro you're never too old
