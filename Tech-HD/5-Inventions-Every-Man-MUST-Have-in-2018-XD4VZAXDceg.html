I've always been one for new gadgets the
latest smartphone the loudest speakers
the first ever mp3 player but these days
my priorities are a bit different I
don't just want gadgets to play with
anymore I want them to help me look good
too so when I discovered the Philips
beard trimmer 9000 I knew I'd struck
gold it's the only trimmer with pop-up
laser guidance so creating sharp edges
and perfect symmetry is easy plus that's
a frickin laser styling goes a little
something like this
the laser guidance makes sure I stay
within the lines so I don't get too
carried away creating my style
you see I don't think I'm alone in
finding it a bit of an art form other
trimmers couldn't get to every part of
my face and add in detail was a job for
the barber now all I need to do is twist
the dual head from trim to detail and
bam hello handsome even the length of my
hair was hard to get right before but
with the precision zoom wheel in the
beard trimmer 9000 I can choose anywhere
between point four and seven millimeters
then cut the perfect style every time
what's more taken care of this is just
the start there are no fiddly
attachments it's simple to clean and
100% waterproof so to clean the trimmer
you simply rinse it under the tap plus
the ladies love the laser well they
certainly like the style it achieves
finally a gaming mouse that puts full
control in the palm of your hand
LexA is a mouse specifically designed
for gamers of all levels so whether you
play in professional gaming tournaments
or you're just a weekend gamer LexA is
designed to be a versatile mouse for
gamers everywhere Oh awesome the mouse
is super smooth and this is something a
lot of companies can't get Alexa plows
easily allows you to perform complex
tasks and multiple dimensions with
increased precision usually you'd have
to stop in order to switch through your
items in your inventory but when you're
using the joystick you can just simply
just scroll through your items so it
does genuinely give you an advantage
when you're playing your game like
Minecraft lexif provides six degrees of
freedom via two joysticks and one laser
glide sensor it works by tilting forward
backward and side-to-side the mouse
moves with your hand and it goes with it
that's a very big plus this mouse but
actually a competitive advantage in
gameplay the laser sensor lets the user
control the mechanical gliding at very
high speeds while maintaining the best
accuracy the tilting allows you to have
more three-dimensional movement all
within the mouse itself so you can
combine multiple movements into your
Mouse seamlessly it has a joystick on
the side so if I'm playing and I want to
zoom in to shoot someone it
automatically goes into the zoom mode I
don't have to like double click on the
mouse I'm kind of shot out are they
gonna give you lexif shape is designed
in a way that buttons are very
accessible while still providing a solid
feeling the sides are covered in the
finest rubber enabling a strong grip
when needed it's comfortable it's smooth
I wasn't ready for it
the lexif gaming mouse also provides a
separate model specifically designed for
left-handed gamers what truly sets the
Lexus apart from its competitors is its
conveniently positioned joystick on the
side of the mouse along with its
internal mechanical two axis joystick
which allows users to operate the mouse
to tilt or to use as a joystick offering
two options in one this mini joystick
features mechanical feedback forces that
only regular-sized joysticks used to
offer making
this the first of its kind the joystick
allows me to go through the entire map
which is actually really cool it's great
it's gonna make a massive difference in
big games oh yeah you can use the
joystick a little smaller here Lex
control panel allows you to customize
and configure the settings specific to
what you're comfortable with providing
you with various shortcuts and once you
configure the settings you won't need to
configure them again our goal is to
bring the Lex amounts to gamers
everywhere but we need your help please
support our campaign so that you too can
take advantage of the innovative
features our gaming mouse will offer you
elevate your gameplay with LexA</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
