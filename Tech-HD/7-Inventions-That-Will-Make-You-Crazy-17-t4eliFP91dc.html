hi my name is Nam Wafaa
creator of magma world's first sports
bottles that doesn't mix him for you
magnetically I spent many months
perfecting the Magdalene bottle design
we've also spent time thinking how to
best present this amazing product to you
the kickstart community during our
production meeting we thought maybe we
could show you some cool slow-motion
shots like this one of a runner
gracefully striding towards a magical
sunset anxiously awaiting her perfectly
blended Magdalene Jake you go girl
or this one of fitness models lifting
heavy weights or taking sips from our
ultra convenient and portable mixer
bottles or doing twisty exercise moves
behind it but at the end we figured
let's just show you a simple demo of
Magdalen in action and what makes it so
unique simply strap the blade into place
and it will firmly attached itself to
the bottom of the bottle you can leave
the blade in at all times or easily
remove it for thorough cleaning avoiding
bad odors germs and bacteria especially
when you leave your bottle in the car
one of the most unique features of
Magdalene is the invented bottom magnet
which keeps the blade in place and
allows for a completely sealed bottle
this design allows for a contact free
operation between the powered base and
blade no more leaky rubber seals no more
holes simply add your favorite protein
powders or energy blend and you're ready
to go the powered bases 12,000 rpm in
order ensures smooth and even blending
with built-in thermal protection you can
rely on problem-free
daily use the power base is equipped
with a USB port you can get more than 15
mixes on a single charge
we even got an amazing fitness coach to
test out Maclin and give us an honest
opinion hi my name is Stelios character
sadness I'm the owner of shred core
fitness in Franklin Square New York when
I was first introduced to the mag 1 I
was completely blown away by power
portability and its uses once we reach
our goal we will commence tooling and
place component orders we have every
part completed including factories
sourced and on standby we want to get
maglin into all your hands but this
could only be possible with your support
the goal pledge now and be among the
first to get your very own mag blend
mixer bottle let's start a revolution
with mag 1
