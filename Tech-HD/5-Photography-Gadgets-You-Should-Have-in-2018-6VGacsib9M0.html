hi I'm Bob from Blackmagic Design and
today we're going to talk about the new
Blackmagic pocket Cinema Camera 4k it's
our next generation 4k camera it
features dual ISO it records at up to 60
frames per second in 4k 12 G capable as
well as 120 frames per second in HD with
the dual format for ISO we can go up to
25,000 600 so it has incredible
low-light capability so the idea here is
that this camera is flexible in terms of
size but also has all the functionality
we have a 5-inch touchscreen back here
so we can go through all of this
settings that people are used to in our
Ursa mini pro because it has the same
interface it's the same Blackmagic OS
and it also has a USB C output so that
you can record directly to a disc so if
you record directly to a USB C
compatible Drive you can just plug it
right in to resolve and go it also has
the ability to plug in with the mini XLR
and a microphone on the side here it has
a full-sized HDMI outputs and go out to
monitors headphone jack it features four
microphones we have an internal battery
so it's the L six battery from Canon
it's got a micro 4/3 mount it's a full
Micro Four Thirds sensor the other thing
that we have is the ability to shoot
high frame rate it's got an even a high
frame rate button right on the back so
you can instantly go right into high
frame rate with 13 stops of dynamic
range and not only shoots high frame
rate but it's an HDR capable camera and
it shoots 4k both in pro res and 12 bit
raw it's not just a cinema camera it
also takes stills so you can take 4k
Stills and 4k video at the same time for
$1,295 you get this incredible camera
plus a copy of DaVinci Resolve studio
and for more information you can go to
