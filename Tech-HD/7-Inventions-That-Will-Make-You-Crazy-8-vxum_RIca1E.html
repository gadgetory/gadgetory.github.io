we're starting it's a heated apparel
line we know there's other heated
jackets on the market we know that
they've tried and failed why another
heated jacket when we thought well we
thought we feel better
we started Arabian because we were both
active I wanted to have something that I
could wear from the climbing area all
the way back down to when I go back to
work and we thought well hey why not
create a jacket that we both like and
that fits our lifestyle we wanted to
come over the jacket that would solve a
few problems one of them that you could
wear anywhere it's your all-in-one
jacket we felt like it needed to be
cost-effective and we felt like it could
be something that you can wear in a
layer or you can wear alone and that
would cover the temperature ranges that
you needed throughout the season and
throughout the day we designed our
jackets to literally go from negative
four degrees Fahrenheit all the way up
to fifty five degrees Fahrenheit along
with the coat you get our battery which
is patented to have a few technologies
in there one of them is Auto cycling and
basically what that does is it gives you
the ability to have the longest battery
life that we think is on the market up
to 10 hours on low in the 12 volt system
you got a pocket on the inside of the
jacket and within that pocket you've got
a 12 volt adapter and all you need to do
is plug it into the battery set the
battery into the pocket and zip it up
and you're good to go
with our 12 volt system the down jackets
you get the jacket itself you get the
battery the 12 volt battery that comes
along with it you get the charger and
you get a set of lightweight gloves that
also heat up power up to 12 volt system
you press and hold the button down for
about five seconds and then to turn it
off
you hold press and hold for about five
seconds and then it goes off the battery
also charges in 90 minutes you can
actually charge your devices up to six
time
and we've given you a buttonhole through
the pocket on the front of the coat
where you can plug in your phone and
then on the other side it comes through
the buttonhole and then you basically
just plug in it in the battery and
you're good to go instead of having to
carry around another battery or any
other situation you have it they're
ready to go whenever you need it if your
phone runs out your iPad runs out or
another device you know we've even
considered calling this code the phone
charging code because that's such a
useful feature that people know so we
built gloves that didn't require battery
that you can connected right into your
code and controlled from your code and
the gloves are thin so you get the
dexterity that you need and they still
go to formula we decided to add the
touch screen ability to our gloves which
makes it super convenient in school if
you're in a situation where you're in
your down jacket our down jacket and it
rains we've given you a water-resistant
coating so that you can get to where you
need to go without getting wet these
jackets are built to be washed and throw
them around chuck them in your washer
one of the problems we wanted to solve
was the durability of the jacket the
jackets that we found on the market just
weren't there so we wanted to build in a
serious variability and
we stand behind that way we give a five
year warranty on the heating element of
the heating system so if you have any
trouble we're gonna take care of it any
season you're gonna need a jacket
one of our jackets could be the solution
and with the range of jackets that's
we've given you we have a hooded down
jacket a non hooded down jacket we have
a down vest and a gray Heather hoodie
we're pretty stoked about how these
jackets turned out we designed them to
be the kind of jacket that you could
wear anywhere we think they're simple
and clean
hey guys I'm Kyle welcome to my
Kickstarter I want to share my
inspiration with you now this looks like
a normal motion land but let's see what
happens when I put this magnet to it
that liquid is magnetic but how is that
possible
it's called ferrofluid and it's a really
cool example of nanotechnology
here are some other cool examples
you
when I look at ferrofluid I see so much
more than just a little novelty I see
potential I see this whole world still
waiting to be discovered
magnetic liquid is this really strange
thing that my previous understanding of
science led me to believe was impossible
but then there it is right there in
front of me daring me to question those
assumptions that previously led me to
doubt its possibility and to me that's
powerful
you
it's really fun really fun I think it's
crazy how everything just flops together
and then away and then gloves together
okay guys there's two basic products
that we're offering here today
there's the inspiration and the thinker
now the inspiration is the ferrofluid
motion lamp and the thinker is the small
plastic display that has the permanently
magnetized ferrofluid inside now the
thinker does come in coloured versions
you can actually add the color blue for
an extra $24 you can also add the color
gold so guys this is really important to
me this is a fun and educational product
I want to bring the market
we've been using our computers like this
for the past thirty years this doesn't
work great in every situation and our
computers don't look like this anymore
or this they look like this or even this
a keyboard and mouse don't make sense
anymore it's time to get your hands
dirty with just just lets you control
your computer with your hands
for example Photoshop adjust the
contrast a little less
okay now the brightness yep perfect
save that let's take this a little
further add a logo bring it down lower
little to the right great if you have
two of them you can even type
we take the raw data from every
accelerometer gyroscope and magnetometer
and pass it through advanced motion
processing it sometimes your friends can
get annoying quick hand gesture takes
care of that
just connect your iOS or Android device
so you can connect to almost anything
like your lights and your music
change the music
perfect lower the volume a little
perfect my name is Charles Harris and
I'm the creator of the expand shoe
lacing system it all started with the
help of the pillow product design team
our system had to be easy enough to be
used by five-year-olds and strong enough
for triathletes we wanted a minimal
design with a wide range of use and I
feel we conquered exactly that there's
two key elements that define the
expanding system the first element is
great aesthetics
up close our laces have a very cool
unique look to it but when you step out
into the world they look like every
other shoelace out there and would never
be spotted with 24 colors to choose from
we're sure you'll find exactly what
you're looking for the second element is
control when you combine our lace
anchors with our zero memory elastic
laces you get full control over the fit
and feel of your shoes locking the laces
into that setting you can set a relaxed
fit for casual shoes or a snug fit for
your athletic shoes you also have two
options for installation you can install
the Lakers behind the tongue of the shoe
and trim the excess lace for a stealth
look or you can use our specially
designed lacing clips with your lace
anchors installed on the outside of your
shoes for a more athletic look much more
streamlined than the other systems on
the market so that's it guys that's the
expand shoe laces system we're ready to
rock all of our manufacturing molds are
complete we rent over a thousand
testicles with our shoelace manufacturer
ensuring the quality and consistency of
our products now we're turning to you
guys for your support and with your help
we're gonna be able to place a huge
initial purchase order and launch expand
laces
hello Kickstarter
I'm modern from infinity TV and I'd like
to introduce you to this new product
we've been making we call it the helium
it's a battery power bank but it's also
a solar charger in one product we really
like this product because it encompasses
a few things that we we need in our
daily lives we often run out of power
with our smart phone so we need to
charge it so most of us carry around a
battery bank in our pocket so we can
charge the smartphone at the end of the
day but the problem with any battery
bank is that it will run out of power
well not so with the helium because it
contains a large solar panel and with
that solar panel you can reach out
anywhere you go
with Hylian you can take the power of
the Sun with you when you go there
happily no limit to what you can use
Siri inform bring it
camping bring it hiking bring it to
nature bring it out in your environment
at infinity P we work with organic solar
cells organic sources are relatively new
technology on the market but they do
have some key advantages first of all
they're super thin secondly they're
really really flexible that means
they'll fit perfectly into a product
like the Delian where no other type of
solar cell would really make sense the
other advantage of this type of solar
cell is that it's fully printed they
made an ordinary printing machines and
all of this we do in-house at infinity
to be the road to bringing Helion to
Kickstarter have actually been a long
road for us we've been through multiple
prototypes I have some of them here the
one I hold here actually won an award at
the Royal Chemical Society and we've
been iterating slowly up ever since then
so we had some key design criteria when
we designed it one was we wanted a
battery inside it we wanted it to be
able to charge the smartphone from the
battery wanted to be able to charge the
battery from the wall rock but we also
wanted to have the solar panel inside
and optimize the space for it in the end
we ended up with the design that we both
really liked but there's also directly
optimized for injection molding so it's
ready to go into production
you
how many times a day do you type in your
password can be both easy to remember
and secure enough to protect your
computer well choose a short and simple
one and your online security can be
compromised
choose a long one and it's just not
convenient and we aren't talking just
one password here right how many do you
have one for local account
one for the mail one for the Facebook
don't you just hate the need to memorize
every single one of them they may seem
to be necessary evil to ensure your
privacy but in reality all protection
you need isn't the tip of your finger
fingerprint identification is not a new
technology for years it has proven
itself to be a reliable method of
securing valuable things from military
facilities to smartphones but as of now
in order to use it you either need to
buy an expensive laptop with
pre-installed scanner or a separate
skimming device and all of them are just
too big and clunky they rely on old
swipe technology plus if you need to use
your device you have to plug in or
connect USB cable and then disconnect it
and keep it separately but here is
another way I present to you the I touch
ID it's the first fingerprint scanner
that is secure and efficient on the
inside while being small and compact on
the outside yes I touch ID the world's
smallest USB fingerprint scanner ages 6
millimeters thin is easily the world's
slimmest scanner it is incredibly thin
you can plug it in and keep it plugged
in forever
the body of the device is made out of a
single piece of aircraft aluminium with
hard anodized finish and laser-cut
sapphire glass when creating I touch ID
our priorities were security reliability
is a usage
compact size and best quality materials
all these are parts of a new philosophy
of using a fingerprint scanner for
computers I touch ID has no buttons or
cables you just plug it in and start
using skin of our fingerprints takes
only half a second and the fingerprint
data is stored inside the eye
RJD security call where it cannot be
accessed by anyone so a touch ID you'll
be able to access your computer's user
account your Facebook Twitter Instagram
or any other web site online accounts
that you previously would lock onto the
password and all of it with just one
touch you can use much stronger and
longer password 12 or more symbols
without any problems just put your
finger on the eye touch ID and you're in
you don't need to worry that people
around you your classmates colleagues
business partners buddies your wife or
husband would see your password your
private photos videos documents and any
other information will always be
protected even from hackers from North
Korea the eye touch ID is compatible
with both Windows and Mac operating
systems everybody has a unique
identifier which gives you the new level
of security and ability to encrypt your
data or communication with two level
authentications with just a touch of
your finger I touch ID is might
withstand both digital and physical
dangers the devices impact scratch and
water-resistant so it will always
maintain its functionality and outlook
we touch team truly believe that I touch
ID is the best alternative to passwords
and the best fingerprint scanner of its
kind
you
cities are increasingly large and
sometimes noise and smoke polluted with
so many cars I believe in bicycles not
only is the best mean of transportation
but also the most beautiful that's why I
decided to quit my job and devote my
life to this urban icon hi I'm Carlos
co-founder of Frasca and we work to
provide design and innovation to the
urban cycling community I wanted to
create a helmet my wife would like to
wear I remember her words what can I do
with a helmet after I park my bike it's
too bulky definitely I do not like
sports helmet for biking to work they do
not match my lifestyle safety is a must
our unique helmet cross the field ax
represents the balance between safety
functionality and style now what makes
it awesome is its unique and patented
trait it falls in one second reducing
its volume by more than 50% for easy
storage in any bag or backpack to
develop his smart and sexy product
cluster teamed up with two great
partners Polytechnic University of
Valencia to resolve the impact
absorbtion anthropometrics and comfort
design and cul-de-sac creative and
design partners for product
reconstruction we wanted to make this
product into an icon since the beginning
the challenge was to create a piece of
art in a product with high technical
specifications on a screen a timeless
piece where they say follow the function
has its own personality
Costa Parra is clean with flavor and
communicates is benefits in a very
visual way that's why it's been awarded
with a red dot design award 2015
it is important to look good we provide
a helmet with many options like leather
so that's Gluskin it's our property
first batches of helmets have been
produced and double certified for the US
and Europe we need your help for setting
up mass production and make it available
to all urban cyclists across the world
we hope you like adventure and support
us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
