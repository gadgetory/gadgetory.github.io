tens I tends is the world's first FDA
cleared 10 device that works with your
iPhone or Android device tens is a
technology that's been around since the
70s it's a proven medical device
technology that sends tiny electrical
signals through your skin to your nerve
endings to intercept pain signals from
reaching the brain the eye tense keeps
track of your pain reduction Delta so
that you can graph and figure out what
settings work best for your unique pain
condition the itens is available in a
small wing for joints or small body part
areas large wings for your back or other
large body part areas or a long strip
that can be used for the sciatic nerve
or other long treatment areas such as
tendons one of the most unique things
about the i-10 is you're only replacing
the peel and stick gel most other 10th
devices you're replacing the whole
electrode by only replacing the gel it
becomes significant cost savings for the
user using the device is simple peel and
stick the electrodes place on the paint
site and launch your app the eye tense
is wearable it's actually doing
something wearables to date or gathering
biofeedback or data and extrapolating
those results the itens was created to
build on existing wearable technology
and usher in a new phase of wearables
that are actually treating the body
this is Andy Andy always forgets where
he's parked his car have you ever had
his problem after a long day of shopping
in the mall can't remember where you
last parked or when you've gone to a new
building and can't figure out which door
to exit to find your car so we came up
with a solution
thanks to Bluetooth smart we've
developed an embedded system to detect
exactly when you turn off the engine
this is yeah the VLE smart parking Yap
uses your car's battery as the power
supply so when you turn off the engine
you have to text it and automatically
pinpoint your car's location on your
smart phone and with this smart design
problems of current solutions disappear
and it doesn't end here yeah reminds you
of your parking meter so you won't
forget that you're running out of time
it also helps you save your parking lot
number and take a picture or video from
your car
not only is Yap smart it also has a
standard price gap is only $29 yup -
nine we could set the price higher but
we want everyone to never lose their
parked car again thanks for helping us
make yab a reality
i'm patrick designer of the rock
espresso maker I want to explain how I
make a double espresso using our
award-winning non electric coffee
machine for this demo I'm using coffee
that's pre ground specifically for
espresso machines let me explain why the
grounds are so important this is the
steel filter basket which holds the
coffee above it sits the rubber seal and
above that the water cylinder the filter
basket is held in place by the chrome
porter filter but it's the coffee itself
which creates the back pressure needed
the great espresso not the metal filter
so when you load the filter with coffee
make sure you tamp it down to create a
smooth even surface of coffee without
cracks or gaps I also warned the filter
before adding the coffee lock the Porta
filter into place and sit your warm cup
centrally on the base now pour in hot
water just off the boil I like to
slightly overfill the chamber to create
a bit more pressure smoothly raise the
arms until all the water has passed
through the seal
gently press down the arms to pre infuse
coffee and pause to let the coffee swell
now lift the arms to the top then push
down to squeeze the water through the
pressure you feel is essential to
extract all the lovely oils and flavors
ideally the extraction should take
around 20 seconds if the pressure
lessens raise the arms and press down
again gently ease off when the cup is
full your double espresso should have a
nice fine layer of crema on top which
varies in color depending on the type of
coffee you've used because I overfilled
the cylinder I'll squeeze out the
remaining water into an old mug and
chuck it the grounds have already given
up all their loveliness the dry grounds
left in the filter can be knocked out
into a bin if you have a garden they
make great compost so that's how I do it
but remember the ROC espresso maker
allows you the freedom to make coffee
the way you like it
you
this is heads
Ellis active noise-cancelling headphones
designed for today's busy and noisy
lifestyle any environment where there's
a lot of background noise going on that
you just need to create your own sense
of tranquility pop headspace on I use
them when I'm traveling to cut out the
background noise turn on the active
noise cancellation and you're in your
own headspace we've had a DJ recently
started using them and tell us that for
the first time his ears are no longer
ringing at the end of his sets the
problem you get with a lot of active
noise-cancelling headphones today is
when you have them at lowish volumes you
can hear a hiss in the background so XD
audio eliminates the hiss we've
successfully completed a number of
IndieGoGo projects our most recent
project was the dams incisor a small
bluetooth speaker we learnt a lot from
the size of campaign and we've applied
what we learned taken it forward with
headspace so this a headspace I have
here is production ready so don't delay
get into your own headspace
you
you
come on
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
