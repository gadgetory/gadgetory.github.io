fast-charging magnetic adapter on
IndieGoGo the support and warmth
received from the community in making
the project a success was overwhelming
where technology is always changing and
people's needs constantly evolving so
now we are back with new Kinect 2.0 we
have developed it based on the feedback
we have received and the experience from
our first product here are some of the
key advances in the new version stronger
magnetic cable
compatible across multiple devices
fast charge your phone from laptops and
stop unauthorized access to use view
connect just insert the pins into your
phones
and you can use a single cable to charge
any of them slide the button to enable
fast charging and data protection mu
Connect has lots more to offer simply
connect your phone protect your phone
from accidental damage never lose your
cable in the dark stays connected no
matter what you do
reversible so you don't have to fiddle
with your phone compatible with all
phones we have finished prototyping we
also have done extensive product and
user testing to make the best possible
product now we are ready to start
production we need your help to bring it
to the market
help us by funding us on IndieGoGo
very interesting
Wow incredible
hi I'm Michele Oh Beto
today I'm fat one of the first I fight
wireless earbuds tear out your exact
earring profile Swiss audio high-five
wireless earbuds perfectly designed and
engineered to let you enjoy superior
music perfectly secure and comfortable
in your ear we combine Swiss precision
and audiology technology our aghoris
touches the best song quality the most
personal Sun expands and the best
economic fit Swiss Re OH - iam sound
quality has a unique sound signature
with powerful bases and crystalline
highs we successfully reached a perfect
frequency response by using the
best-in-class balanced armature speaker
together with high performance
electronics we've been working with
professionals in the music industry like
Tony Mom realm and Tony Remy they gave
us regular feedback on prototypes and
helped us get closer and closer to the
ultimate superior sound experience I
remember about two years ago I was in
Italy in the city of Verona during a
concert and after the concert I was very
fortunate to meet one of the cofounders
of Swiss audio so they asked me to be
like a role model or let's say a mentor
that could work with their engineers and
they would throw ideas back at me and
I'll throw ideas back at them to make
sure that this was the best that it
could be I couldn't hear the difference
between the the studio monitoring and
these in earbuds in fact they're so
small the fact that you can get such a
great bass response from them was
incredible as well in order to make the
listening experience more personal we
integrated sound profiles and a seven
band EQ in the companion application
with audiologists we created an
audiology test as part of the companion
app the test takes a few minutes and you
create your unique hearing sound profile
it is the ultimate personalization of
your Swiss audio - wireless earbuds our
Swiss audio algorithm will compensate
any hearing loss in selected frequencies

LeMay adequate personalized a procedure
we developed an audio transparency
algorithm in real time you can adapt
sound from the outside world around you
while listening to music
adjust your listening experience with
numerous environment presets the
challenge we faced on the ergonomic side
was to find the design that best fits
for each customer
we used perfect mix between the ear

prototypes and the professional
experience of our audiologist vltava

now I love making barista quality coffee
for my family and friends I can't
believe how much coffee I was wasting
before it looks amazing in my kitchen
and is so quiet to use it's simple
controls I get the right amount of
perfectly ground coffee every time 25
years ago I started designing premium
coffee products this is where my passion
for creating excellent coffee began
since then I've learnt the barista
quality coffee can only be made using
exactly the right quantity of really
fresh ground beans I became frustrated
because the perfect fresh grind is so
difficult to achieve with current
grinders due to issues such as retain
grind inconsistent yields and Hoppus
full of beans going stale I soon
realized there was nothing on the market
that addressed these problems so four
years ago I set out on a journey to
design the solution the niche grinder
it's simple to use all you need to do is
weigh the exact amount of fresh beans
you need for your next coffee drink pour
them in here close the lid and switch on
and watch all your beans being quietly
ground by the large professional conical
purse you then get all those same beans
freshly ground here meaning your grind
is as fresh as the beans you use it's
simple environmentally friendly and
quickly produces precise quantities of
fresh ground coffee saving you money
saving your coffee saving our planet the
niche grinders unique no retain grind
design is further enhanced by large
conical burs quietly delivering the
coolest freshest grind possible
the stylish design and premium materials
elegantly complement your kitchen it's
total cord storage keeps your workspace
clutter free we have also added a clear
safety interlock lid giving peace of
mind whilst you watch your beings been
expertly grounded the infinitely
adjustable grinder makes it easy to
produce a complete range of coffee's
including expresso pour-over and French
press I have moved the idea forward from
initial sketches and detailed computer
designs to over 30 fully working
prototypes I've been joined by a wide
range of experts and we've engineered a
patent-pending new product we have
combined this classic design with all
the features you would expect and more
to bring you a coffee grinder like no
other
we are working with skilled craftsmen
using the highest quality materials and
hand building high performance grinders
here in the UK we're now at the stage
where we are ready to start manufacture
this is where we need your help to fund
the first production and make niche a
reality so if you're passionate about
getting the best tasting coffee back our
campaign and be the first to own the
niche grinder thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
