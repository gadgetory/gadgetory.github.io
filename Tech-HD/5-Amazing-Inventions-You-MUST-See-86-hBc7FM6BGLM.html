shake me run chills up my back make me
remember the butterflies the downs and
the hives
let me hear and make me feel but do you
really know the feeling of sound we want
you to know to finally heal that is why
we created flex sound Horus partition my
name is Mary and I'm the CEO of flex on
systems we've invented a completely new
way of experiencing sound taking you
beyond just hearing alone in feeling it
physically as well
our flick sound room will help you to
feel sound the music on your skin and
body like David
for a center we've only been listening
to sound the tools and devices have
evolved and sound has become incredible
but it is still just audio but we know
there's so much more to sound see sound
is not just a hearing sensation it's
full of crumbles rolls and vibrations
it's a library or human nuances that you
could actually physically feel it is why
we love those deep sensations at the
movie theater all the power of the sound
of nature or the feeling of someone's
voice against your skin when you are
close flex sound fumu is a smart cushion
that simultaneously creates great sound
reproduction and physical distributed
vibration from the same source this
means that as you hear audio through
whom you feel it with your skin and body
unlike loudspeakers that radiate
vibration into air almost element
radiates vibration through fall
providing a soft near field listening
experience such a multi-sensory
experience
enhances emotions created by the context

music we Affleck some want you to enjoy
your favorite entertainment to its
fullest
whether you love music movies gaming or
connecting with a loved one far away
homo adds a whole new dimension the
sense of touch and that makes all the
difference or is the second product of
Lexar systems and the world's first-ever
consumer device with the fields of
Technology
we are from one of the world's leading
design tech countries Finland we have
poured our years of expertise from
different fields into whom and are very
very proud of it uber is a fully
finished product ready for immediate
mass production with our trusted
contract manufacturer and all we need
now is your support to be able to start
the production when you back us now you

which will stop shipping already by the
end of February

back us now and finally start feeling

amanda is a maker a practitioner of tech
wizardry and DIY magic and this maker
just got a new magic wand this is the
new optimist the optimist is a modular
three-in-one machine
that includes a 3d printer a laser and
CNC mill it assembles into two
configurations and creates finished
products this machine can make anything
except waffles so we designed the
Optimus for people like Amanda she's
full cool ideas and wants to create
something new the way that it's been
though if you wanted to start making
you'd have to strike a deal with the
devil to finance a lot of machines and a
huge space to use them and unless you're
Tony Stark this situation is about as
convenient as a harpoon to the face not
convenient at all so we changed that and
created one flexible machine with three
essential tools that fits on your
desktop
this machine was forged in our small
team of makers engineers and designers
and we're driven by this idea that
making could be more fun easy and just a
better experience overall
so with that thinking we made the
Optimus simple to operate anything
and along with this machine we've
created an app to control it and also a
simplified 3d design program so Amanda
can start making fast while it's easy to
use this machine was built for
professionals who require top grade
tools this is what we're all about and
with quality in mind we built the
Optimus with all metal parts this
ensures that it's going to be reliable
sturdy and that it could bring your
ideas to life year after year
the modular design enables the whole rig
to quickly transform back and forth in
just a few minutes and the modular
design means it's easy to manufacture
and transport and because you don't need
to buy three separate machines you'll
save money then maybe you can buy that
waffle maker too
we know firsthand about the excitement
of holding your own designs so while
others may not get while you make Tinker
or cosplay we do and we want to help you
make more stuff now you can bring the
optimist into full production we have
successfully built and tested 20
machines now that
