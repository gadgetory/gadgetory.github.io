age-old problem of dried on gunk just
press downward and high-pressure water
jets upward powering away remnants
before they have a chance to dry the

pre rinse clean pint glasses or bugs it

detached
the doc case adapter turns the single
type C port into four on your 13-inch
MacBook Pro and five on your 15-inch
MacBook Pro on top of this the HD
