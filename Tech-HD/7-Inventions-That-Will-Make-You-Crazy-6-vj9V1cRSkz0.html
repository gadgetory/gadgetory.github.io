the ginzvelo is a human electric hybrid
vehicle you might go huh let me explain
it is powered by you as well as a 500
watt electric motor and 48 volt battery
ginzvelo will change how people travel
in cities and suburbs if you live in
cities you know that having a car is a
big bird public transportation is
time-consuming walking is slow and
riding a bike can be very inconvenient
you can get rained on they're strapped
to deal with that's why we created
Gainesville imagine effortlessly gliding
through the city in complete comfort
while being in the reclined position and
going really really fast because of
Gainesville is construction it makes it
much safer to be in traffic than being
on a regular bike it is weather
resistant so you can drive in the snow
in the rain pretty much in any inclement
weather the electric system is powerful
enough to take you up steep hills as
well as give you a range of about 75 to
100 miles without public ins velo is so
aerodynamic that you can maintain a
speed of 20 miles per hour without
breaking a sweat you can also push it
over 30 miles per hour if you are so
willing you get hot when you paddle so
we took that into consideration air
comes up under you swaps over and exits
out the back in a low-pressure area
during testing we found that it's very
efficient and we did not get very hot at
all for safety ginzvelo includes a full
set of LED high-powered headlights los
turn signals and brake lights most of
the ginzvelo running gear utilizes
regular bicycle parts if you have any
maintenance issues or something brights
in the future you can easily replace
them and keep on going
we designed against valve to be easy to
get in and out of since ginzvelo is
designed for community we designed the
rear storage area to fit one large
backpack or a few bags of groceries my
first started this project I water in
gainesville to be as much of an american
company as possible the body of ginzvelo
is built and floored the windshield is
manufactured in maryland and the
hardware is made right here in Virginia
at Penn State I answered ginzvelo into a
business competition I got to the finals
that's when I realized my dream could
become a business reality with your help
ginzvelo can change how people travel in
cities and suburbs during the business
community ginzvelo is a great
advertising opportunity I was riding in
DC today I got a lot of attention you
can put your logo on the ginzvelo right
around any major city and you are bound
to get hits we are already in talks with
companies with you body wraps they are
willing and able to wrap ginzvelo in any
logo that you would like
you
you
I like ice in my lemonade in my whiskey
morning coffee okay my juice and I like
ice cubes in my teen and tonic hello
Kickstarter my name is Kim I love ice
cubes a simple thing that makes no
strings just a little bit more delicious
that is why I'm excited to introduce the
icebreaker a new convenient way to make
juice and enjoy ice cubes in your daily
life just fill freeze and dispensed
without any hassle thanks Kim my dream
was a closed system that can easily and
conveniently make and dispense ice cubes
for everyday use it became the
icebreaker with the help of a tool or
friends I've been working hard on
solving the issues that are cure when
waters frozen inside a closed case we
have developed a number of prototypes to
thoroughly test the product during the
development we have not take 5-10 and
they're very proud of the final results
but we need your help to finish the
development and to set up tooling so
that we can get the ice breaker to the
market
introducing barb and the first high
fidelity bone conduction headphone a
truly groundbreaking product which makes
your social life scape compatible with
your private soundscapes place it around
the back of your head pair it to mobile

dream with a bat ban was to create a
truly surprising an unconventional sound
experience bad bound talks directly to
your inner year freeing your outer year
so you can stay connected with the world

for almost a year on a design solution
that embodies the compelling qualities
of bone conduction sound the result is a
discrete intuitive and minimalistic

home and to control his features from
your fingertips
our team has work extremely hard to
source a right and logical components in
order to provide the finest sound
experience while keeping the product
smart lightweight and feasible and just

conversations with manufacturers all we

sanctuary the masseria was born out of a
love for nature and the miniature world
of terrariums for me the process of
collecting designing and creating mini
escapes as a relaxing one and flora
always adds a sense of calm and
stillness to any space sanctuary is a
designer gift that keeps giving an
alternative to a bunch of flowers or an
activity you can share with children and
Friends perfect for small spaces
desktops bookshelves bathrooms and
kitchens your sanctuary will come with a
set of tweezers mr. microfiber cloth and
a template to cut your mas to amass
Aryan design allows you to maintain a
controlled environment so no matter what
your climate you can enjoy a bit of lush
nature on your desktop the form had to
remain simplistic and true to the
function so the desired proportions were
important the base is just high enough
to mask the soil the top allows you to
view the moss and has a teardrop form to
direct any condensation that forms on
the ceiling back onto the foliage mas
doesn't absorb water and nutrients fire
its delicate roots like other plants the
roots are more of a holding structure
and their drink instead through their
tiny legs which is why the lids teardrop
form is such a valuable feature moss in
nature uses the wind to propagate so
similarly you can add some air flow to
your masseria by rotating the lid for
sanctuary this ventilates the root area
and avoids fungus and mold forming if
the closed environment is particularly
warm all varieties will display
differently we've designed a plastic
insert that presents the moss and
collects water around the perimeter that
will eventually evaporate back into the
system you can also fill the base with a
small portion of water to keep the
environment hydrated moss is everywhere
in so many varieties if you take the
time to look around your local urban
areas so no need to take moss from
protected and national parks go on a
relaxing walk around your neighborhood
and gently collect a nice lush piece of
moss for your sanctuary even brown dry
moss can be returned to life within a
few hours of deep hydration you can
clean them off before you use it but
sometimes you get exciting surprises if
you just let it be like mushrooms and
exotic flowers popping up amongst the
tiny leaves
every space can benefit from a little
bit of greenery if you've wanted to
liven up your office desk but just don't
have the time to care for a plant then
sanctuary is for you
you

from our long meandering experiences
makers we've learned the following but
if the work is well done every detail
thought out every rough patch polished
and every seam complete and the peace
will last a lifetime that if the parts
are crafted with an insane attention to
detail and no expense spared in
fabrication then the final piece will
excel and perform that if the aesthetics
are conceived of first and foremost as a
result of function then the piece will
be striking we learned that sharing the
manufacturing process with the absolute
best in the craft creates a vibrant
community of craft that grows to make
the very best again and again and again
above all we know that the true magic of
the piece is the concert of all of these
and that's why coal is a revolution in
the art of the dream Carrie
