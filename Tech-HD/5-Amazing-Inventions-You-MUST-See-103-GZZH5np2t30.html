but today we just mostly poke at the
screen fingers and hands are incredible
why are we so limited introducing Vella
an innovative device that instantly
turns any surface into a smart interface
the world at your fingertips once
connected you will be able to control
different hardware devices or software
applications by using simple gestures
Vella will make your life more
convenient use it to control music light
temperature or any other application you
have in your mind you are only limited
by your imagination and you only need
one valid device to control multiple
devices or applications you can use our
presets like letters to read your own
gestures according to your preference
simply assign gestures for different
scenarios and switch between them just
by moving your hands our human hand is
fantastic they can not only feel but
also manipulate things in a versatile
way the current smartphone technologies
are just putting everything into small
tiny screen which highly limits and
constraint the interactive areas of our
hands Vella works on any surface so you
can clip it anywhere you like or even
design your own control pad unlike other
devices Vella gives you tracking and
multiple texts to action features so you
are not limited to just what action but
if different patterns to assign for
different actions it is super easy to
use and really works for everyone if you
are a developer you can try new ideas
and figure out different customized
applications with our well-designed API
to track the human gestures Vella uses a
special sonar technology that is
nowadays widely used in military cars
and drones it transmits signal pulses
collects the reflective energy from your
finger and then translates it into the
performed action our team has been
focused on sensing techniques for
couple of years we are passionate about
making tools which are just human needs
by amplifying human capabilities turning
any surface around you into a remote
control enables many potential
possibilities in our daily lives we have
been seen lots of products in the market
but we have not found any of them
capable to track and to recognize with
high probability with Weller attracts
your finger with the finest precision
and transform it into customized action
Weller brings magic to your daily life
you

music inspires us fuels our workouts our
adventures and our dreams built to
ignite your passion catalyst provides
the perfect wireless sport earbud
experience it's a symphony a form
function and fashion icon in my own
world like there's no chance of than
pulling out there so pretty our mission
with catalyst is simple we want to
create a product that will enhance the
lives of active people who love music we
sought out to not only solve the issues
that we're keeping people from even
wanting to try wireless earbuds but to
create something totally unique and
special in the process we brought
together a team of experts in
engineering ergonomics acoustics and
hearing sciences together we produced
innovative solutions with never before
seen or heard technologies to make
catalyst the most complete wireless
sporty-er but ever to create an
immersive listening experience we
equipped catalyst with a precision-tuned
hybrid driver setup pairing to balanced
armature drivers with two dynamic
drivers the balanced armature drivers
isolate high-end frequencies well the
dynamic drivers act as a built-in
subwoofer providing a base that you can
feel do these things really hit it sound
incredible I have beats and I would buy
these hand over fist sweat and water
damage are the number one reason earbuds
break so we went ahead and coated every
single internal part of catalyst with
proprietary hydrophobic solution this
makes catalyst so sweat proof you can
dump them underwater for 30 minutes and
they'll still function like new
everyone's ears are different and
getting the right fit is essential we
addressed fit instability on three
fronts first we worked with one of the
most esteemed PhD audiologists in the
country to design an earbud housing
that's smaller which in turn lowers the
center of gravity in your ear and fits
both large and small ears more come
we developed a weightless stabilization
system that melds with the natural
curves and movements of your body the
stabilizers take the stress off of your
ears fuse to your neckline providing you
a feeling of weightless freedom we
developed two different low-profile
earbuds stabilizers each organ amelie
optimized to comfortably lock into your
ears in total catalyst provides a
hundred and forty-four unique
combinations of stabilizers and ear tips
allowing you to achieve the perfect
custom fit for your ears I don't see
them ever falling out they fit so well
to ensure that catalyst keeps up with
your active life we specifically tooled
three batteries including a mobile
charging clip that magnetically attaches
to catalyst to provide you that extra
juice when you need it most catalyst
provides two and a half times the
battery life of the most popular sport
earbuds on top of that we used a special
noise isolating microphone that's been
specifically tuned to identify isolate
and eliminate background noise so that
your voice will be crystal clear in any
environment the bottom line is that
wireless earbuds are ugly we built
catalyst knowing that our customers
wanted something that not only meets
their needs functionally but it makes
the right statement how do I time around
these things are really really sharp
really clean at every turn we work with
fashion bloggers to ensure that catalyst
exudes that transcending class with
which you live and be the perfect
accessory for your journey this project
is the culmination of seven years of
research passion and love every single
detail has been considered and catalyst
delivers on all fronts we need your help
to bring catalyst to life back us now
and be among the first to get catalyst
at an exclusive discount through
kickstarter together we can transform
the future of wireless earbuds
you
whoa
you
you
we develop this product for people with
an active lifestyle those who carry a
backpack those who ride subway those who
ride their bike commuting to work those
who are adventurous growing up in
Colorado I found a real passion for the
natural world I want to live healthy I
want to eat healthy I want to have that
food with me all the time we've made a
reusable container that you can take
everywhere with you it's super
convenient it's wonderful to have and
it's worth its weight when you carry it
around the majority of trash that I
create is from food waste wax cardboard
styrofoam plastic things that get thrown
away it's all packaging I want to do
everything I can to prevent the natural
world from being stuffed with trash what
does it mean to live in a world where
we're conscious about the way we create
waste there are ways to reduce it we
developed a product that doesn't break
easily is dishwasher safe and food safe
is approved by all the science
foundations for food and it can clip
easily to your backpack so it makes it
highly portable it holds 33 ounces
that's a big enough meal for any size
and shape I've look forward to how
convenient it can be to have home-cooked
food anywhere
I tried at first carrying food in for
instance Tupperware I constantly look
around for a container that won't leak
and none of them fit that bill they
always have some amount of liquid coming
out of them the green traveler allows
you to carry delicious healthy food with
you you can pack any food you want or
non-food items it won't leak it'll keep
water out and you have four compartments
to choose from you get to experience
home-cooked food from anywhere anyone
who packs lunch for the day needs a way
to do that without creating waste the
green traveler is food safe dishwasher
safe liquid tight and you can clip it to
your backpack we see this as the most
convenient way to carry food with you
students can take it to college adults
can take it to work it can be used for
food it can be used for other items as
well first aid supplies mothers can pack
all the things their baby might need go
to a food truck or hot bar without
generating any more wasteful packaging
we're providing a solution for healthy
and sustainable lifestyles we are a team
of engineers and MBAs we have experience
taking businesses out into production so
we're confident if you fund this that we
can watch it we can help change the
culture in the way we consume food we
want you to have a healthy waste free
meal anywhere you are help us raise the
capital for injection moulding so we can
get the green traveler out to everyone
join our campaign to show how much you
care about having a convenient reduced
waste lifestyle
