seconds push it into the soil select a
plant in the app and voila

or account required I don't even need to
open the app not only does it tell me
when to water my plants it also monitors
soil and air temperature and ambient

features of audio devices day by day
standard earphones today are equipped
with conjoined audio drivers and
circuitry
this makes conventional in-ear monitors
pre tuned and limited to coast
customization since interpretation of
music is limited here and modular design
is needed to allow flexibility in sound
signature and performance introducing
modular ears the in-ear monitor that
enables users to change the circuit

bright mates and discernible highs and
lows

balanced armatures to provide an
excellent non compromised audio
experience not only is it compatible
with EDM and chorus modules it also
comes with two unique modules of its own
Symphony and reference modules so far we
have finished multiple working
prototypes but with your support we can
accelerate the process of raising
