you to both hear your music and hear the

practically any helmet perfect for your
days out on the trails or the slope
so why would anyone want headphones that
allow them to hear their surroundings
they're safer and they're more social if
you are a runner or a cyclist out on the
streets versus if it allows you to hear
oncoming traffic such as that car that's
coming up behind you
skier or snowboarder versa fit allows
you to hear others on the slopes to
avoid collisions working out in the gym
versa fit allows you to talk to your
workout buddies without having to turn
off your music or take out an earpiece
playing with friends and don't want to
stop your music to talk to them versa

combining the best design aspects of bed
phones with silicone ear pads sweat

a Wire free workout versa fit headphones
can last up to 10 and a half hours on a

week's worth of workouts our custom 23
millimeter drivers have been retuned by
one of the best acoustical engineers in
the world to offer deep bass clear
treble and no sacrifice in sound quality

drivers like flat and snug against your
ears using infinitely adjustable memory
wire ear hooks ears come in all shapes
and sizes so why air hoax can be
adjusted by hand to any ear and then
readjusted for perfect comfort without

I was never a morning person
you just have a feeling of dread
thinking oh man I'm gonna be so tired
you hit the snooze button hoping that in
ten minutes you'd feel more refreshed
but it never really came you never
really felt that way and you just kind
of muddle through the rest of your day
what would it be like if you could wake
up on your own without her own alarm how
would it feel what would you do that's
what we set out to do with the up light
the up light prepares your body for
waking up and helps reset your sleep
clocks so you start waking up naturally
just think this is every day of your
life every single day should it be a
natural stress-free experience
