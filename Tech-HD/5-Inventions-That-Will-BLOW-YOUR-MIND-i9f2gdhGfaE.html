time we are going to kick your brewing
experience from here to right about here
two years ago we brought you
one-of-a-kind coffee mug the code mug
thanks to you we falling even deeper in
love with coffee and we discover that
manual technique in combination with
technology produces by far the best
results for coffee brewing we combined

you follow the brewing guy
or create your own with a built-in smart
scale you'll find the perfect ratio
between coffee water and time and by
tuning the valve you'll set the right
drop flow for your brewing methods
play with Gina and discover three
different coffee techniques explore

now imagine yourself brewing and
discovering all shades and tastes a
coffee bean has to offer
with Gina you can also save your
creation and share it with the whole
community
copy burning can truly be a special
experience every single time with every
single cup coffee Lawler's we need you
to bring Gina alive
the fourth ask is let her in friendship
all great achievements have one small
thing in common a measure because to
measure is to understand and to improve
it's the starting point to human
ingenuity a dimension that drives
progress so enact this precious deserves
respect it deserves accuracy it deserves
the same obsession and love that we
would stow upon the things that result
from it this is the progress that
measuring deserves this is dimensioning
hi We're instruments and we are
craftsmen product team here has built
some really cool products over the years
but today we're launching something
really close to our heart natural
reaction to modernizing measurement
would be to just add technology to a
tape or a ruler but we don't have the
same mechanical constraints and we
certainly don't use them in the same way
we can do a heck of a lot better we
build zero one into an elegant writing
engine three to be exact
ten pencil and stylus these are things
you likely have in your bag or your
purse we built it for designers for
architects for engineers or craftsman
makers and even though simply putting up
pictures we wanted to still want to be
honest it's it's a measuring instrument
but also to writing instrument
so that new one is balanced and feels
natural
it's an emotional security tips path
bonds and minds sweating hundreds of
small parts to their feet finish
building tools fixtures or to enable an
experience that's natural you just go
over animals and bad you can measure in
millimeters inches whatever suits you
lot search and share results person
receiving came in life change units on
the other end you can actually read
scale drawings and roll it over complex
surfaces and get the lengths of
materials you can set up a grid or even
just get a rough measure without
checking your phone I really love
measuring my niece Abby and seeing the
way she's growing throughout the months
you can share it directly on Facebook
it's kind of like doorframe measurement
but for the 21st century isn't it we've
designed the zero one engineered it
tested it and set up manufacturing we're
days away from being able to ship but
what's more we've hidden a few gems
inside you see zero one is a dynamically
evolving instrument this is where we
need your help over the next few months
the team here will be creating
functionality that will enrich how we
think about dimensioning if you back us
now not only will we ship zero one in
pen pencil and stylus form it will give
us fuel to keep releasing features that
redefine how we capture and use
dimensions and bring them right to the
devices would shipped back us today and
we'll start shipments December first
it's got your name on it
sitting we do it for over nine hours
every single day and because of the way
we're doing it 90% of us will get back
pain in our lives
seriously when we hunch and slump it
affects our mood our happiness even how
optimistic we feel look at yourself
right now
how are you sitting how's your back and
your neck probably not too great huh hi
my name is Catherine and I started
working on my posture two and a half
years ago when I started having terrible
sciatica pain I have spent so much time
and money on doctors visits therapies
special pillows and all these ridiculous
products but I couldn't find anything
that just worked so for the past year
I've been creating a real solution with
the most amazing designers and
prototypers and dozens and dozens of
people with really bad backs it was
important to create something small
enough I could fit in my purse
and something effortless so I could just
count on it working in five seconds flat
something reliable and something that
would help me improve my posture even
when I wasn't wearing it this is better
back it allows you to effortlessly sit
in perfect posture easing back pain and
training yourself how to sit use it when
you're sitting at your desk on an
airplane watching a game or even when
you meditate basically use it anytime
you have to sit you don't have to go far
to find people with bad posture or back
pain a friend a parent someone you work
with or even people you meet product
testing around San Francisco every
Friday here's what people think about
better back
so let's kind of elaborate I feel Bonnie
feels awesome it's so easy to just sit
up straight this could sound weird back
and like feel my my body you know I can
feel my hey my organs not being squished
I can feel that it's right here but it's
not like oh I have all this on me it's
just like I am just like relieved
pain-free I'm sitting straight upright
it's like it forces your torso to stay
upright where can I get one of these can
I have this one simple it's easy I put
it on and I feel immediate relief so
that's how it feels and this is how it's
actually helping betterback gives you
better posture it allows you to not
fatigue the muscles that you use when
you're sitting down so when you do stand
up your posture is literally changed
good posture can change who you are it
affects your attitude it affects your
decision-making good posture changes who
you are literally sitting correctly over
time does more than stop slumping stress
on your spine it also retrains your
body's natural default posture so
whether you're standing or sitting
without better back your posture is
greatly improved let me show you how it
works better bag zips itself into a
portable case throw it in your bag and
unpack it when you're ready to sit wrap
the back pad around your back and the
knee straps around your knees all
there's left to do is to pull on the
adjustable leg straps to stack your
spine into perfect posture so if you're
going to spend nine hours of your day
sitting you might as well be doing it
right when you're pain free and your
body is perfectly aligned you feel
happier more confident and you regain
your ability to focus on whatever it is
you want out of life
you
I could think of a lot of lot of ways to
use them and to be able to practice at
home when you get that feeling you use
what I play I mean recording in like
GarageBand or logic or anything this is
much easier than to to press a keyboard
or anything like even if you're
traveling you can have them play like
have your headphones on and play
something we love drumming and we want
to be able to let drummers play anywhere
anytime so we've developed free drum
free drummer lousy detective drumming
experience from a soundproof studio to
your sofa the outdoors or any place you
can connect to a smartphone it gives you
the intuitive experience of drumming
with the maximal movement just slip free
drum onto your drumsticks pair it with
your iPhone and take them anyway it's
that easy over the past year we've
worked on finalizing our prototype to
bring this idea into reality we've
worked with mechanical engineers
industrial designers and professional
drummers to give you the best drumming
experience possible we have worked on
great features like double kick pedals
and opening the hi-hat in the package we
include two free drum sensors and four
straps two for the sticks and two for
your feet so that you can mix and
combine the units as you wish we have
worked really hard to get that free drum
as small and lightweight as possible
using the latest Bluetooth Portico
standard to eliminate latency and still
maintaining an excellent battery life
freedom is powered by a high-capacity
lithium polymer battery that I will
charge fully in about an hour free drum
speaks MIDI and that means we're
compatible with the vast majority of
music software we've working prototype
as well as the aesthetic and technical
design in order to take this to
production now I need your help to make
freedom a reality
for all drums we started this
Kickstarter to get your support for our
first production batch and we have
packed this campaign with rewards for
every test we invited to be a part of
our journey support our campaign until
everyone you know about freedom thank
you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
