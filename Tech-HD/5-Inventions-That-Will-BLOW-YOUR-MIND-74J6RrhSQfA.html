impact all of our lives
globally seven million people die each
year because of exposure to air
pollution due to climate change flooding
hits coastal cities six times more often
now than in the 1960s and politicians
take a global human issue and make it
political
it's like record record cold and I keep
hearing about global warming now they'll
say he doesn't understand this is a
worldwide problem oh no I don't
understand let's do IQ tests now we can
either accept that or we can get to work
here's the problem we need everyone to
investigate climate change and air
pollution in their own communities but
the equipment costs thousands of dollars
and climate change is a complex and
global problem in the face of
overwhelming odds were left with only
one option
we're not the science that out of it my
name is Clifton Roseville and I'm the
founder of pocket lab we believe anyone
can be a scientist and that science
doesn't just happen in the lab we've
delivered thousands of pocket labs to
educators worldwide and now we're
putting our focus on climate change and
air pollution we have launched the
climate education initiative the
initiative has three parts one anyone
can be a citizen scientist by collecting
their own data on emissions and
pollution using pocket lab air 2 users
can contribute to science through
mission mode where data can be shared
with researchers through the pocket lab
software
the data will be open-source and freely
available 3 you can help educate the
next generation this Kickstarter will
make it possible for schools around the
world to use pocket lab air we have
spent the last year developing pocket
lab air a state-of-the-art sensor to
measure carbon dioxide ozone particulate
matter and atmospheric conditions that
affect climate pocket lab is wireless
portable and rugged so it's ready to go
anywhere you can use pocket lab air to
measure emissions and air pollution in
your environment then you can map that
data to your GPS location and you can
join a network of thousands of citizen
scientists doing climate change research
we need the smartest people of the next
generation to take on the biggest
problems we'll find a solution if we can
inspire more young people to take on
climate change instead of inventing the
next snapchat teachers students and
citizen scientists love using pocket lab
because they can explore the world
around them in ways that were never
before possible help us size the out of
air pollution and climate change we're
back on Kickstarter to ask for your
support to find educational outreach and
manufacturing purchase your pocket lab
today and share our project with your
local community to get more involved
