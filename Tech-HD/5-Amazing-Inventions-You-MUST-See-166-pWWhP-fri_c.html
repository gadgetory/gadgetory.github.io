we live in an age of on-demand movies
can now be watched anywhere anytime on
various devices such as mobile phones
tablets and laptops but with that
there's a problem none have been able to
capture the magic of a cinema movies are
losing their magic but what if we could
have the comfort of watching films at
home but with an experience that would
exceed that of a movie theater
introducing Samara the world's first
fully immersive personal cinema a
headset that brings you an IMAX like
movie experience in the size of a book
while a normal cinema on average gives
you an angle of around 54 degrees the
scenario screen is considerably larger
and on par with a 70 degree angle of the
IMAX screen to guarantee the image
quality on a super wide screen Samara
uses groundbreaking dual 2.5 k displays
with a resolution three times that of a
cinema and eight times that of an iPhone
7 plus
thriving such high resolution is beyond
the capabilities of any existing mobile
processors in the market unlike existing
products which split a single screen
into two and only use the central part
of the screen
Samaras dual screen architecture
utilizes up to 95 percent of the screen
area which achieves four times the
sharpness and fully alleviates the
screen door effect
sanera is also super easy to use it
works like any Android smartphone you
can install your favorite streaming apps
like Netflix or HBO or play from a
microSD card it also works like a TV by
simply connecting the headset to a
blu-ray player gaming console or a
computer with a simple click sanera
upgrades your conventional entertainment
to an immersive and cinematic experience
because a comfortable experience using
sanera has always been one of our top
priorities we designed an ergonomic
hands-free arm to take the weight off
the headset the burden free arm can be
easily adjusted 20 position and can be
attached to different surfaces it allows
for a new way of watching movies Burton
free truly immersed in the movie without
discomfort
besides video the audio has been
fine-tuned so we create the acoustics
and sound effects of a movie theater the
scenario 3d mode is easy to turn on and
provides more vivid and flight or 3d
images than those in theaters without
the need for 3d glasses it is a much
better way to watch 3-d movies
