drone you finally deserve thanks for
watching
as a freelance photographer my job
literally takes me everywhere and
there's been more times than I can count
when you just aren't able to set up your
shot beforehand because of a difficult
angle bad lighting or poor gear until I
got the photo promo go truly the most
versatile flexible camera mount it's
flexible durable easy to use and easy to
carry creating the perfect shot on the
go is way easier now that I can set up
my angles anywhere I need to it takes a
lot of the headaches around scene
preparation out since I can wrap the
Mogo around anything really and get a
good photograph on the go and the kit
comes with a variety of handy
accessories like the UFO tripod giving
you even more customization and variety
so you can attach and use almost any
gear you want from phones to cameras to
GoPros
it really is something you can bend it
alter it stand it wrap it and trust it
to get the shot you need wherever you
are I've even seen it used in creative
ways outside of photography just
recently I saw it assembled as a simple
setup for a live stream it took her no
time was intuitively easy and she got
great results from it she also uses it
as a tablet and phone mount so that she
can watch video and chat at the same
time who doesn't multitask these days
it really has unlimited customization
endless uses if you're creative with it
takes no time to set up and is so easy
to pack away and bring with you
as a mere four I spend most of my day
outside or in artsy locations so I need
to be very comfortable my gear have to
be adaptable to the first time I use
photo probe I was surprised how easy and
fast it was to set up you feel almost
natural and it turned out to be a great
help the tripod legs are extremely
flexible
I can wrap them around anything from the
branch to a railing and get some really
creative shots and there Charlie where
poop don't jump slow or loosen up in the
rain or after use making them reliable
for every in theater or exterior time hi
my name is Alex and I believe this is my
third or fourth project on Kickstarter
this is one of the ones that I spent a
lot of time on it and I believe it has
merit I want to tap into the EDC market
which is everyday carry so I created
this survival multi-tool which I call
Nomad like I said it's a survival
multi-tool and everyday carry it's
composed of 3d printed parts sandwich by
a back and front stainless steel plates
that are laser-cut they're attached all
together with stainless steel rivets to
endure rust and oxidation has many
features a carabiner clip a bottle
opener with dual function it's a bottle
opener and a wrench at the same time it
has a compass it has a blade momentary
flashlight for emergencies ferrocerium
rod it has a split ring to hang keys or
any other things you might want to hang
to it on the other side you'll find a
scraper that slides out the scraper
itself it's a mini tool that has a
quarter inch bit adapter it has three
different size not adapters ranging from
small
medium and large it also can serve as a
flathead screwdriver goes back in place
when you need to start a fire
you basically swivel out your
ferrocerium rod take your scraper out
scrape scrape spark spark and you start
a fire when you're done you close it
turn it around put your key back in
place or scraper and you're done like I
said has a carabiner where you can hang
it in any belt loop backpack or wherever
you want to hang this too it's very
lightweight and this is a very cool
multi-tool as many functions and this is
nomad hope you guys like it and hope you
guys can back me up very cool item thank
you hope to hear from you soon
