right there don't you know that plastic
straws are bad for the environment what
is this oh if you're gonna suck suck on
this this is final straw the world's
first collapsible reusable totally
badass trough straws are supposed to be
convenient right so we decided to do
something about it this is final straw
final straw builds up to the size of a
car key and fits in a sexy case final
straw is small enough to fit in your
purse or pocket but if you don't have
pockets you can just Oh where'd it go if
you can remember your keys when you
leave the house you'll remember your
straw it fits on your keychain so
there's no way you're gonna leave it in
your car and there's no need to worry
about keeping it clean included in each
straw is a specially-designed squeegee
simply pull it through the straw to make
sure it's squeaky clean final straws BPA
free dishwasher safe and with our
patented design the ends are soft so
it's safe for human children and their
adults there you go little buddy this
straw may seem small but because of its
size it's actually very harmful to the
environment
straws can't be recycled so they're
often left here in the ocean where they
hurt and kill my friends in the sea
thank oh go be free since you've hit
play on this video we've discarded this
many straws in the US alone pretty bad
right included in each straw are some of
these little cards next time you're at a
restaurant leave one with the bill and
let them know to only serve straws upon
request there's a movement happening and
you can be at the front of it together
we can make a really big impact and save
our oceans one straw at a time this is
final straw suck responsibly
design starts with a fluid process of
laying down the first lines seeing your
ideas and concepts take shape for you
it's imperative to capture the essence
of your idea and to be able to
communicate it clearly and quickly tools
that aid this process that allow you to
focus on your work or a requirement not
a luxury wrote EO have created a new
tool is an extension of the creative
process
the interaction is refined and not
your eye follows the rotation and the
way the line is formed immersing unity
in your world
great outcome is the result great
process
ro ta and roti o+ seamlessly integrate
into any designers work for me
moving is a challenge between time and
space they will always been the best
companion in transporting people and
live unique journeys but never before is
being changing shape and function
revolve is been designed and invented
with him to be the first modular wheel
which will open new frontiers for the
present a future of disposable vehicles
the space is getting less and more
busier in the speed of light quicker the
constructing the mobility starting from
the wheel is a new challenge that can
bring new and more efficient vehicles
for everyday life large wheels are
required all human powered
transportation for performance and
efficiency the wheel folded renew each
space up to 60%
with rebels you will be able to travel
everywhere and easily carry the wheel
between trains aeroplane and cars with a
simple action you can open and close the
wheel it's unique excellent structures
allowed to have a solid and an iconic
design in both open and closed
configurations the ILS tyre allow the
unique compactness and modularity
patented mechanism is being rich after
years of several unread 3d models and
those are no physical prototypes in
order to get the most efficient and
accurate folding mechanism the
wheelchair can benefit from large wheel
easy to store everywhere at any time
compact and solid revolve allow the user
to safely use the wheelchair in every
condition with a modularity never seen
before
potentially designed for bicycle and
wheelchair revolt as the flexibility to
be integrated to future foldable
vehicles revolve the wheel in a new form
hey guys let's be honest the world does
not need another car Eli is a new breed
of automaker and we want to challenge
the idea what a car can be we started
with a few simple goals to empower short
trips to have a design that makes sense
for modern cities to have a minimal
impact on environment and most
importantly to be affordable by everyone
while I was studying architecture in New
York I realized the biggest disruption
to urban design was the elevator by
empowering vertical movement
elevator transformed cities that's when
I realized a simple vehicle has the
power to reshape or communities I'm
proud to say we have accomplished that
and so much more we reinvented an NIV
category and created the most compact
intuitive and energy-efficient vehicle
we like to think of Eli Darrow as the
iPad if conventional cars were laptops
it provides a radically simplified and
superior experience for local trips and
the best part is Eli's era only cost 1/3
of a normal manufacturing was in my
family's blood from lawnmowers to golf
carts so I know it's a rare opportunity
to be able to create something that can
have a profound impact in people's
everyday life whether you're going to
the gym grabbing some food or going to
the market Eli Xero makes it easy to get
from A to B
this is the first time a product like
ours has been launched on IndieGoGo
we're excited to bring our product to
life on the community you built now is
your chance to change the future
transportation and join our campaign
