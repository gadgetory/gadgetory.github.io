motorcyclists represent about 2% of
vehicles on the road so we created the
first connected brake light to keep
these millions of people as safe as
possible
it's called Cosmo connected it's a
detectable and autonomous smart hub an
accessory that combines a rear brake
light and a mobile application our
objective
hello the motorcycle drivers to feel
more pleasure and freedom on the road by
increasing the level of safety we
developed a product range that brings
many brand new safety features to
writing first Cosmo shines bright red
when writers decelerate whether braking
or not providing a visual warning to
other drivers next if there's an
accident the Cosmo app ensures that
rescue arrived at the scene in timely
manner it detects that the driver fell
and automatically alerts emergency
services and notifies the friends and
family it includes GPS coordinates so
they can be found even if they are low
at night or out in the middle of nowhere
with the app writers can choose who gets
notified at any time
Cosmo is responsible for protecting
users and reassuring the loved one we
worked with the best designers and
engineers to create an efficient
easy-to-use reliable product that works
in all weather conditions

Cosmo is removable so that battery
charging is easy and it doesn't get in
the way of storing your helmet it uses a
magnetic base glued to the back of the
helmet and this ensures that the brake
light stays on the helmet in normal
driving conditions but falls off in case
of an accident
Cosmo has 8 hours of battery life in
standby mode and 3 hours of battery life
fully lit it's designed to fit the curve
of every helmet type
but our plans don't end with motorcycle
Cosmo Connect is Wilson and realm

vehicle outdoor activities such as

suitable to all forms of mobility and it
builds user communities around the theme

both oculus and Google have shown us how
incredible virtual reality is but
imagine if you can take that technology
and share it and experience it anywhere
you are we wanted to take this concept
even further and so we've been working
on products that we're very excited to
share with you today
it's called stigma the world's first
pocketable
and accessible VR AR phone case
virtual reality has come a long way
since it's introduced right here on
Kickstarter
with the oculus rift this is an
incredible device that allowed people to
experience virtual reality for the very
first time then Google introduced
cardboard to tap into the power of the
mobile device to make VR more accessible
imagine anywhere you go VR content just
moments away
imagine be able to share those virtual
reality experiences with your friends
with your family on the front lawn or on
top of the mountain and that's what's so
exciting because technology that is
accessible something that you could
share with your friends and family the
technology that is most meaningful and
that is our vision that is figment over
the last eight months we continue to
revise and iterate on our design our
design includes soft touch finish so it
has a fantastic grip it also features
scratch resistant lenses so you know the
last a very long time and lastly we use
6000 grade aluminum which makes pigment
strong and durable we wanted to focus on
functionality not only does it have VR
but it also has a are by exposing the
camera in the back and on top of that it
also acts as a great kickstand we've
gotten this far and this is where we
need your help we need to be able to
ramp up our production and get this
awesome product into your hands
thanks for watching this video

everyone
