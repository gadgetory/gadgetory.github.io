hi welcome to the latest county tom
video today we'll be showcasing the
micro grappling hook it's designed for
soldiers overseas to defeat tripwires
many of you may be aware or familiar
with a pocket grappling hook
designed by yogi robotics this is the
micro grappling hook
you'll notice some very very similar
design that's purposely done you know
this is the pocket grappling hook is a
proven winner the microgravity look is
brand new and it's designed to be thrown
either with 550 cord it will accept 550
cord or something lighter such as
fishing string and the best way to
deploy this is with a pocket fisherman
or a fishing rod something where you can
get some kinetic energy like those
provide so it's small like a like a
fishing lure it's all stainless steel
construction you can add it add extra
weight if necessary by adding sand or
water into the body body that's entirely
up to you there's an o-ring along the
top here to keep the keypad and keep the
moisture out but it is all stainless
steel construction including the spikes
so corrosion should not be an issue and
the spikes just unscrew this is all 300
series stainless steel so it holds up
real well and little spikes all go in
there cap goes on you can leave this
attached to your fishing rod if you're
overseas or it in your pocket very very
small very light there you come shipped
with a piece of foam inside to prevent
the any any noise from them rattling
around but I don't think you're going to
find that being a problem so just put to
deploy it you either attach it to now to
your to your line whether it be 550 cord
or fishing corridor spectra whatever
what-have-you screw that back on
and just screw your spikes on and I
think this is a very very little clever
device and that hopefully it will be
saving some lives very soon initial
order was for 200 pieces so I'm sure if
those 200 pieces go there will be
additional orders and of course as most
things accounting Tom sells when we have
to have a contract or something we sell
out extras on the web so if you look
over in the comment section on the right
you'll see where to where to purchase
this as far as a link right to the web
page but there it is real small real
light will we'll get you some more
information as it appears thank you so
much and we'll look forward to seeing
you in our next video
take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
