technology by launching the Fort Knox

pushing your foot off to the side that

clip back in just hover the shoe clip
over the pedal and the magnets will draw

the only clipping pedal that has an
infinite float no matter how far you
twist your foot to the side it won't
unclip in order to keep the adventure

new pedal with enough support we will be
able to produce the ball pedals at a low
cost these savings will be passed on to

when I wrote a bike for the first time
they had an electronic shifting I
thought it was the coolest thing ever
I can now experience two of my favorite
things at the same time my passion for
riding and the great use of technology
the electronic shifting has been around
for a long time but it's so expensive
that only professionals could afford it
I knew there had to be a way to make it
affordable and it had to fit almost any
bike it had to be easy to install it had
to be Wireless it had to connect to a
mobile device and had to do things that
had never been done before or what's the
point so I created the Ector it's a
wireless shifting system and it's smart
let's watch a few things that it can do
Multi shift press and hold and jump two
or three gears
hold a bit longer and you shift the
entire range you can configure the press
time to your liking intuitive and fast
with the semi-auto function you only
need to press up and down and the ex
shifter will automatically shift your
front and rear derailleurs to the
optimum gear ratio think of it as the
automatic transmission and a car take
your mind off shifting so you can enjoy
your ride
manual mode the remote has four
configurable buttons each button can be
assigned a function for example if you
are left-handed you can easily invert
the standard settings for a one by
system you could have the right side on
manual shift in the left side for multi
shift mode X shifter is universal it
connects to your existing derailleur it
fits any bike any frame any brand of
derailers and it works with the
precision of plus or minus ten microns
next shift er can be used on road bikes
mountain bikes tandems recumbents hand
cycles and even dropper pulse
anyone can enjoy the advantages of ex
shifter
the X shifted design is done we've been
testing it for months this design is so
robust that even 3d printed prototypes
are working perfectly Wireless shifters
cost thousands of dollars and are very
limited in what they can do the Exeter
starts at only $200 and does everything
the others do and a lot more where as a
final stage of development please
support our campaign and help us deliver
this amazing product to everyone
biking gives us a feeling of freedom for
many it's the best way to get around
what's not great is getting sweaty and
tired luckily every bike owners dream
has come true easy bike a super easy kit
that instantly turns any bike into a
powerful electric bike affordable
lightweight and simple to use

electric bikes for only one hundred and

cruising around easy bike is perfect for
you once you have used easy bike you

we sent an email last night for Santa
Cruz
asking if I would go out and give their
new reserved carbon wheels a test
basically tried to test them to
destruction which is going to be pretty
interesting
I'm gonna really drop my tire pressures
down
yeah it special license to just go mad
seems like it's alright for my son in
the forest pretty hard so getting just
about a pastor it's really run they're
not well suited
very tough - don't beasties may be shy
180 feeling I don't know if in the world
to do on this does that make you fat big
set get over the tray
on one one month on bum bum bum
got our flat back tire very justified
because I absolutely smashed it into the
stairs I'm it's smashed all day I'm just
gonna leave a claw I'm gonna this kind
of session these stairs for a while
how does it start life
don't dead stick it's completely fine
it's not even it's not even like
lies announced that is insane I don't
want to need to do to break that how
many would be like a square bought when
I amazing
oh wow they're going yeah I think one
one of those instamate be gone yep
we did come on a mission to brick rim
and I managed to I can't even imagine
how hard I'd have to do with tires on
like proper pressure
yeah it's taken basically raw I'm dying
massive excessive stairs and smashing
into them up the way to actually crack a
can these things so far as I'm concerned
they've definitely passed the test they
need to walk back though</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
