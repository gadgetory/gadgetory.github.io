every day you need it to access doors
and show your identity
we tested more than 50 badge holders and
found many problems however you still
need to carry a badge with your wallet
and keys to work which can be
inconvenient
at gobo we decide to make things simple
introducing gobo badge holder in wallet
we over engineered the construction to
make it durable and easy to use the
cover is made by high-strength
polycarbonate to fully protect your card
the enhance structure on the back
increases strength while reducing weight
the manganese steel clip allows you to
carry the holder anywhere you want
the clip is secured by a reinforced
structure to make sure it consists in
any situation the metal spring holds
cards securely even when only one card
is loaded
all engineering processes have been done
with the gobo badge holder and wallet
and we're ready to go into production
now we invite you to join us help us
bring this project to the world thank
you
has been my passing for the last 20
years it has allowed me to visit
incredible places all around the world
connect with nature it has provided me
with constant challenges in new
experiences and it's been a source of
energy to keep going
a few years ago I realized that there
was nothing in surfing similar to what
already existed for other sports like
running or cycling so I decided to
create a glossy
mccandies our reality has been my focus
for the past three years of classic rock
I'm Miguel and I want to present to you
the glassy zone
the zone is the ultimate waterproof
device to build by surfers for surfers
start today with the glasses sewn see
how well you slept
check your local sports and read the
latest forecasts because the platform is
designed to integrate that way up and
the band together so you can enjoy a
seamless experience that helps you serve
more be healthier and ultimately improve
satellite is a crucial element of all
living things and a surfers without a
sunny day at the beach so we decided to
include a unique sensor in the band so
you know exactly how much sunlight
you're receiving
turn on surf mode and let the band do
the rest
the band will capture how many waves
erode how fast it went and how long you
battled during your session create goals
for yourself or challenge of friends
surf more often catch more waves ago
faster paddle longer the glasses zone
makes getting better easier
our engineers have been perfecting the
glassy platform for three years we have
over 100,000 downloads and we are going
fast
for the past year we'll be working
quietly on the glassy zone even more
impart the power thing to Asia to finish
the development now it's finally time to
start manufacturing to do so we need
your support and help us bring the
glasses sewn to the world by already in
use today we truly believe that this
band is a great tool whether you are
just beginning or you've been surfing
for years we are committed to helping
you improve your surfing and get
healthier and ultimately have more fun
to be split like and share I will tip in
water soon
you
hiya Kickstarter my name is James and
this is the Jackfish it's our slightly
new product it's got all the essential
tools you need for going to work and
traveling outdoors we've been working on
Jackfish for the last 18 months and we
carrying a Jackfish in our pocket for
the last year all over the world want to
be working traveling exploring after 35
prototypes we came up with a new design
that was fully mechanical and spring
loaded it would hold the cards in place
and you can eject the movies this new
mechanism would last a lifetime
we're a family run business and we've
been designing a manufacturing high-end
video and photography gear for the last
15 years
so Kickstarter we have a great team and
we know you gotta love our product but
we need your help to reach your funding
goals we could start at minimum order
quantity with our factories but bigger
than this we want to create a Jackfish
previously we have future products lined
up we want your input to help us sculpt
them if Jackfish is going to be a
Christmas gift please leave the
information below you have a special
login section on Christmas Day but
people can customize their Jackfish to
their lightning and get exclusive videos
on survival we look forward to seeing
you in the back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
