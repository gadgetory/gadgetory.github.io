hi I'm Adam today is kind of a big day
for me
and that's why I've wallet
you
while he's connected to my club and
sends me instant notifications whenever
I leave or forget it behind which
happens a lot that's not even the best
part
I never even have to charge wallet to
swap out the battery whenever it's time
for a new one if I ever lose my phone I
just tap my wallet twice my phone will
start ringing yep goes both ways
you
you
you
you
you
oh don't you love my card inside
oh yeah while he lets me know if I leave
my card buffer so I'm always covered
you
I
Oh
you
introducing
world's first speed wallet we call it a
speed wallet because how you deal with
it is super fast to take a bill out
simply open this lap choose the one you
want and pull it up it's really that
simple to put it back in simply slide it
in to get your four most used cards
simply pull these two tabs rest of the
cards can be easily accessed by opening
the wall and pulling them out
we made it rfid-blocking in just one
side so you can keep your information
secure but still be able to use an
access card when needed we also made it
one of the smallest and slimmest around
so you can keep it in your front pocket
and barely notice it's there
after that we realized that a pocket
fiddle had to carry bulky keychain so
probably with normal keychains that your
keys point everywhere poking your jeans
and scratching other stuff in your
pockets we thought there has to be a
better way to carry keys and that's why
we signed the Frenchy key
it features a flat design because that's
by far the best shape to fit every
pocket it's so slim that you want to
jail it's there it also holds up to four
cards so you can use it as a card holder
all our products are handmade of
top-quality capstan the same material
most luxury brands used because of its
smoothness and resistance</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
