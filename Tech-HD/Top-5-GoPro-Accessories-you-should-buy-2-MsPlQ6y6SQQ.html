support for copra thanks to his
three-in-one slot and polyhedron bottom
slopes provides a trend a different ways
to precision copra and it is even
smaller than a GoPro housing no tripod
is needed any longer slopes provides an
arrival precision speed select a
supporting surface according to the
market angle insert or Cobra into a slot
and you are all set
if one direction is in depression the
offers it elevated or need to do is to
cog in place which could be finished in
two seconds slopes has trendy settings
to meet all your needs seven lands give
pitches a portrait ones and four rows
any want to keep it flat on the ground
the be afraid of scratching football we
can use it this way slopes is obviously
we can use it almost everywhere to their
peers more peace of platform the whole
world would be a tripod slopes can also
provide off a Lobel coin with a faggot
that avoids issues like low quality
audio recording lens layer and
overheating if you have to go pro you
can utilize the slope side joint from a
dual gopro cds december slopes can also
benefit the post composition two
pictures shot with the same bottom
service could become as idiot perfectly
due to the same view angle slopes the

we're the creators of airdog the world's
first autoflow action sports drone this
aerial camera gives sports performers
the solution they've been needing
incredible footage with unbelievable
ease and accuracy
we're a group of innovators who are
passionate about action sports we use
gopro cameras to capture our own sports
action until now you needed somebody to
follow you around and to film you but
the performance never looked as good as
it actually felt that's about to change
action sports deserve the explosive
power of mind-blowing action shots
aerial perspective and super smooth slow
motion
airdog is a quadcopter that
automatically follows the rider and
captures the action using a GoPro camera
airdog fives and follows making sure
that your every move is perfectly
captured y can find yourself two
stationary videos or a ground level
perspective the air dog takes things to
a whole new level it's a totally
hassle-free way to get unreal footage
you don't need remote control skills you
don't need to operate the drone you just
need to concentrate on your best
performance air dog does the rest you
don't have to worry about framing the
shots or getting the right angle air dog
has a gyro-stabilized gimbal that will
do everything for you it's never been
this easy to look this good on camera
air dog lets you show the world what you
care about
how you kick ass and what extreme sports
are all about
you
on a time a single spin mount can be
used to expand on the capability of any
existing GoPro mount allowing it a level
all good shots or pan the camera around
to capture a new angle it's also ideal
for adding pan tilt and your angles to
any GoPro compatible pole or handheld
grip with snow spike a modular design
allows you to quickly swap lower part of
the mount over for the 120 millimeter
spike can now easily imagine your camera
on surfaces like snow and sand we use
the tapered design to wedge the mount
into cracks and holes and in spots the
tripods don't fit in some situations a
single spin now it's not enough to level
the shot spin down complete combines its
no spike with to spin mounts this
combination gives you an extra degree of
rotational freedom and a huge range of
movement in pitch roll and yaw in most
cases this allows you to easily level
the camera regardless of the snow spike
orientation
hi my name is Sergey
welcome to the fotokite lab our goal is
simple to make a real film in easy and
safe you've probably seen many drone
projects by now already what's different
this time
it's the tether the tether changes
everything unlike a conventional drone
there's no piloting no smartphones no
joysticks no GPS this thing is just a
no-frills
aerial camera the technology comes from
one of the world's leading aerial
robotics research groups here in
Switzerland we actually already used
this technology to build our first
product the fotokite probe used in
broadcasts in journalism today with that
experience we set out to build something
a bit more compact and affordable the
fotokite fee let me show you how it
works twice the fotokite point it where
you wanted to go give it a twist and it
will fly there like a kite
it always produces tension on the
feather it uses this tension to figure
out exactly where it is relative to you
if you want to control it in there use
the electronic leash hold down the
button and rotate your wrist that will
change where the photograph lies
relative to you it's always following
you it's always connected to you
so if I move they'll move with me and
this will keep working anywhere in the
cave on the boat and no matter if you're
in a horse summer or the bike</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
