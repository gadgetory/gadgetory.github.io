before I gave that lamp as a present my
friend decided I'm going to take some
pictures put it on the internet send it
to a design website and forget about it
and one day just get this email telling
me well we've published your lamp go
have a look on our website see if you
like it and there it is it just exploded
was everywhere comments it was published
on other websites links there there
China Russia America I had lots of
emails from people and crying about it
the craziest one was actually from
architects in London who were building
at the time a very large hotel in Abu
Dhabi and they wanted 900 lamps I mean I
fell to the ground could move very
exciting with very Theory depending on
the funding there is something I really
would like to do is get people involved
with this project bring them in get
their own creativity mixed with my
products and make it something new
expand it and again bring it to another
step

dimmer switches give people the freedom
to adjust the brightness to any level
but more importantly it also saves
energy the fact is there are far more
regular light switches out there than in
the boards we decided to create a light
bulb with a special dimming feature
built into it allowing you to adjust the
brightness with any regular light switch
giving you the freedom to maximize
energy savings in any room introducing
the Nano leaf blue the world's first
dimmable light bulb that doesn't need a
different metal leaf bloom is not needed
dimmer switch short will work in any
regular household light switch turn the
light switch on to beginning the light
fading up then click the switch off on
to lock in the desired brightness even a
kid can do it by dimming the light bulb
down the energy savings is exponential
at full brightness the Natalie Foom uses
10 watts of electricity at half
brightness it only uses 2 and a half
while electricity in night mode it only
uses half a watt of electricity here at
Natalie our goal is very simple we want
to maximize our benefit
through meaningful product innovations
that everyone can use nano leaf loom
allows people to save even more
electricity in the most convenient way
possible with an embedded microprocessor
not only bloom detects the on-off signal
from a regular household light switch
allowing you to control the brightness
to any level we want to inspire people
to adopt more energy-efficient products
into their everyday lives and we realize
the best way to do this is actually
create products that are simple and
convenient to use by anyone banana leaf
bloom although it's designed to be
dimmable you can simply turn it on and
off just like a regular light bulb
banana leaf bloom has a special feature
called night mode by turning the switch
on/off on it engages the light at about
5 percent of the full brightness and it
also only uses a fraction of the
electricity Nataly bloom perfect light
for all of life's moments
it all began with light and an honest
desire to change the way we see the
world I believe we are ready for
something new I believe we can do better
I believe in a sustainability that saves
the environment without reducing our
quality of life there exists a beautiful
balance in nature that we can tap into a
harmony between science and art where
great products are born let me show you
Firefly is a new breed of light and
elegant lamp small enough to sit in the
palm of your hand a light that can
illuminate the places you care about
without disturbing the people you love
putting the light where you need it when
you need it and you can take it anywhere
you can feel the power of firefly even
though it uses very little energy light
up a room with less than one watt of
power
what makes Firefly so incredibly
different is the passively cooled laser
technology no more energy consuming
fluorescent bulbs or even LEDs laser
light produces no shadows no glare on
television screens and blue light is
more soothing to the human eye to create
something that is genuinely advanced
it's important to break away from the
past start new if you maintain that
separation and allow yourself to
rediscover the possibilities then you're
left with a truly unique product
a lamp design that actually addresses
the needs of its users and gives them a
diverse set of applications from home
lighting to performance pieces
entertainment safety or communication
we've taken Firefly this far and with
the help of the Kickstarter community we
can complete the manufacturing process
we're grateful for all of your support
and helping us tell the world about
Firefly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
