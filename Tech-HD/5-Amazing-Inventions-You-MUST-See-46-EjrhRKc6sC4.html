Orlov pulse alright good job

text with a random and secure temporary
passcode that is valid only for the
length of birthday your delivery arrives

registered service providers they will

passcode valid for the scheduled
delivery down your small business is
closed but you still need to get
deliveries gate lets you not only
control who comes in but it also keeps
track of each person who comes to your
door and notifies you if you choose
the challenge of gay was to create a
system within a single easy-to-install
device gay was created by a team of
successful engineers who were leading
projects at Sandia National Lab Qualcomm
and Google after two years approached
typing gate teamed up with the
award-winning design firm box clever to
create a product that is not only
functionally robust a beautifully
designed gate is easy to install secure
and easy to use
gate protect him what's inside and
connecting what's outside security

today we want to introduce you to the
phantom air the world's first tunable
wireless in ear monitor we've all seen
lots of wireless in ear monitors come
through these hallowed halls or
Kickstarter but let's face it how many
of them sound good so that's why we've
used our own titanium 7 millimeter
dynamic drivers that have been
award-winning since we began we've been
working on this project for a year to
make sure that when we release this
product is ready and you can use it
straight away so this is the phantom air
2 little tiny wireless earbuds sync to
your phone via bluetooth you've got
three hours of uninterrupted CD quality
audio but surely the most important
thing is how it sounds
is it really portable does it stay in
your ear properly do you have the
ability to recharge it on the go and
when you do have the ability to recharge
on the go how many times can you do that
the phantom air solves all of those
problems but first and foremost above
anything else
these are the best sounding wireless in
ear monitors you will ever hear so with
all things within our product range
these days where for a filter system so
if you're a bass set there's a filter
for you if you like things more neutral
there's a filter for you and if you like
things with more emphasis on the higher
frequencies there's a filter for you
the reality is is there is no other
purely wireless in a monitor that allows
you to customize the sound to your taste
all we're concerned about is three
things with this product first it must
sound the absolute best that it can the
absolute best secondly it must connect
with your Bluetooth device flawlessly
and thirdly you must have a good battery
life to make it usable but when the
battery does where you have your little
tiny charging station plug them in and
you're good for a day twos worth of use
everything's there everything's built
our designs are done our PCB boarded on
our batteries are done everything is
ready to go we just need your help to
make it a reality
please join us on yet another journey
with Trinity audio and let's make this
the greatest wireless in air monitor
available today thank you
