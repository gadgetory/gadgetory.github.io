you
we started this journey three years ago
to make your phone work more like a
camera because it's creatives the camera
has become our common tool in an era
where it's nearly impossible to get lost
but Cameron's buyers us to try it is our
compass our anti GPS device it leads us
to explore and discover in highly
personal ways it gives us pause in a
world that is speeding up around us it
reminds us that when hits likes and
comments fade away we're in the presence
of something bigger
we are moment and we believe that the
future photography is in typography
hi Kickstarter we're back three years
ago you backed our first project at the
moment lenses a year later you enabled
us to make the world's first case for
mobile photography and today we need
your help to introduce the next
generation of moment products this is
our most ambitious project yet
introducing not one but three new
products photo case the battery photo
case and our brand new wide lens these
are the best products we've ever made
and we think you're going to love them
the more we shoot the more battery we
require constantly on the go we don't
always have time to find a wall plug or
space to carry a pocketful of cables and
power bags so we created a new type of
battery case one that brings power and
photography together like never before
with 2500 and 3500 milliamp power
batteries these cases are powerful
enough to double the life of your iPhone
7 and 7 plus the two-stage DSLR like
shutter button enables focus lock and
rapid shooting in the moment app or
faster capture in the iPhone camera app
shooting moving subjects just got easier
with a redesign lens interface you can
now rotate and click a moment lens into
place and if you're shooting on the 7
plus you can now mount our glass over
either lens on the phone unlocking even
more creativity but it's the strap
attachment that truly turns your phone
back into a camera if you love to take
pictures this is the battery case for
you
the photo case is everything we love
about minimal photography adding only
three millimeters in thickness to your
phone this is the thinnest lens
mountable case you've ever made it's
slim and unobtrusive in your pocket yet
readily available when you want to shoot
and just like the Profoto case we have
included our new lens interface and
camera strap attachment turning your
phone into an even better camera to all
the customers who ask for a thin
non-electronic moment case this one's
for you
when Apple introduced iPhone 7 they
change the landscape of mobile
photography their use of high-speed F
1.8 next generation 12 megapixel sensors
an optical image stabilization brought a
new level of image quality to your
pocket in order to deliver the best
quality imaginable our only choice was
to redesign our glass from the ground up
this glass a sphere improves on our
already class-leading distortion
correction and maintains razor sharp
images on iPhones f 1.8 aperture in
order to accommodate the larger iPhone
aperture we made this lens slightly
bigger enabling us to take advantage of
every photon without compromise a larger
lens also makes the optics more tolerant
to misalignment so unwanted dark corners
are a thing of the past our new moment
wide lens is without a doubt the best
lens we've ever made
each moment products start with the
customer inspired by travel the new
moment cases were still in subtraction
realizing that thickness is everything
we design a custom battery to maximize
power and reduce physical size we also
dramatically improved the tactile feel
of the shutter button trying to make the
precision the feedback of a professional
camera using the Lightning port allowed
us to remove Bluetooth for more reliable
connection we then study soften the foam
language and expose a variety of
textures to make one-handed shooting
easier everything we learned from
creating the first moment case has gone
into making this one's our best work yet
we're now ready to bring these new
products to life but we need your help
this is the most technically advanced
project we've ever embarked upon which
means that the tooling and manufacturing
costs are significant the money we're
raising goes directly towards covering
these costs as we move from a prototype
through production with your help we can
take the next step in making your phone
an even better camera join us
mobile technology companies do their
best in order to provide well designed
and well function products and we all
know that a great design comes at a cost
battery can get smaller an audio jack
can be considered too old we decided to
take an action and since almost all of
us using a case to protect our precious
iPhone we decided to redesign it say
hello to the sweet case with an extra
battery extra memory and an audio jack
now you can do more the sweet case can
get you an extra of 256 gigabytes of
memory extra battery will double your
battery life up to 42 hours of talktime
30 hours of internet use 28 hours of
video playback and 120 hours of audio
bring him back the legendary audio jack
to make anybody that is passionate about
good quality audio happy again we added
a kickstand on the back so you can now
rest your hands and conveniently enjoy
your iPhone outputs
all of these features have been squeezed
into amazingly well-designed 4
millimeter iPhone case now we need your
help we want to finish up our last
prototype and AB and start a mass
production so please back us up on
IndieGoGo
our loon case users loved its power of
illumination but they've been asking us
for more designs and colors we started
creating looking for ideas in everything
seeking advice from our clients and
partners the light gave us unlimited
possibilities and we did not want to
stop creating something unusual
something exciting and sometimes
surprising we have the best feature ever
the light and this is what makes Spectre
unique developing illumination
technology that shines bright and lasts
for ages was at the core of our mission
Spectre is clearer and more vibrant than
what came before we utilized a brand new
polycarbonate materials blend that gives
more transparency and rigidness to the
case we increase the duration
illumination takes place added animation
and broadened our lighting palette our
first generation product changed the
iPhone case industry but it was just a
first step on our journey we developed a
solid production base and production is
what we've been up to for some time now
think sketch discuss build test and do
it all over again lots of late nights
and pots of coffee
unlike our first project a Spectre is
almost ready the only thing we're
missing now is your support join us and
help us create the future of wearable
devices loon case was just the first
step let's make history
and do it again
hey Kickstarter this is Noah with
istabilizer
and this is a professional xenon flash
for iPhone in all these years of taking
smartphone photos we've been missing a
crucial element to capture an incredible
photos that's lighting xenon flash is
the industry standard for professional
photographers smartphones come with a
standard LED because they're cheaper to
produce and they consume much less
battery but a xenon flash is up to 1,000
times brighter than the standard LED
flash that comes on the iPhone low-light
images on a smartphone produce a lot of
noise and a lot of grain a xenon flash
virtually eliminates all the noise and
grain and even motion blur from the
photos that you take we've designed the
flash shell to be able to clamp directly
onto the phone with or without a case or
you can thread it on to any standard
photography gear with a quarter-inch
thread this includes tripods
articulating arms and any other
photography gear like that this
flexibility allows you to get creative
with where and how you set up your
lighting xenon flashes are famous for
their ability to freeze a moment and to
prevent blur the flash shell is
controlled through an app that allows
you to use the front or rear camera it
also allows you to determine how strong
the burst of flash needs to be for your
specific shot you can get between 200 to
400 flashes on a single charge and it
only takes just over an hour using a
micro USB to charge this we've spent a
considerable amount of time and energy
and resources into research engineering
prototyping tooling and everything to
get to where we are with the flash shell
but we need your help to take the flash
shell from the stage of development it's
a full mass production
the $55 pledge will include the flash
shell and the free app for your iPhone
or iPad aside from the standard $55
pledge we're also offering three bundle
pledges the bronze pledge includes the
flash shell and our smart flex flexible
leg tripod this will allow you to get
very creative with your Lighting's since

shell to the flexible legs and then wrap
the flexible legs around virtually any
surface the silver pledge includes both
of the bronze items plus our Bluetooth
pocket shutter remote that can activate
the flash and the shutter from up to 40
feet away again increasing your ability
to get creative with the shots that you
take the gold pledge includes the flash
shell the smart flex tripod the shutter
remote and our mini standard sized
tripod that you can use for your smart
phone or the flash giving you
