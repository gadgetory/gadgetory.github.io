solution that would lift your bike for
you wouldn't require physical strength
and would save floor space it's all
possible and it is here it's parkus how
it works
Drive in the front wheel when the wheel
is fixed hold the saddle to lead the way
and let parkus do its job to remove the
bike just grab the saddle and pull
firmly towards yourself many bike
enthusiasts face a problem a lack of
storage space all the available by
parking devices that solve this issue
require great physical effort so parkus
was invented as a solution the idea was
born in 2014 and developed for over a
year by the end of 2016 a fully
functional product was created parkus is
a solution that can be used by everyone
from teenagers to the elderly it also
saves at least 40% floor space and it
looks stylish
parkus it's easy fun and simple
you
know the feeling so do we
in fact 50% of active cyclists will have
their bike stolen this is even worse for
bike wheels because any thief with a
wrench can remove your wheels in less
than 30 seconds right now you need to
carry multiple locks to fully secure
your entire bike one for the front wheel
and another for the back wheel and frame
but this sucks because who wants to
carry multiple locks and then lock them
every single time you ride don't forget
that means multiple keys locks and all
your books binders backpack and laptop
the new solution to this madness is nut
lock nut lock provides one time
installation bike wheel security this
innovative product works by replacing
the bicycle wheels existing fasteners
with custom engineered ones that can
only be removed with a unique key in
your package you install it once and
that wheel is now protected yeah
just one time nut lock helps you
outsmart fees by fully protecting
against commonly used theft tools
it also removes the need to carry an
additional you lock or cable lock to
secure your entire bite keep in mind nut
lock only protects your wheels so you do
still need a you lock or cable lock to
secure your bike to an external object
we've custom engineered over 37 designs
and prototypes to deter theft as much as
possible new variations are being
created by the day making it practically
impossible for a thief to get his hands
on all the different nut lock
combinations and if you ever want to
remove your wheels all you need is the
key that came with your package just
throw that key on your keychain and
you're good to go
security has always felt good but it's
never looked this good so grab the nut
lock lock your nuts and celebrate by
popping yourself a cold one Cheers

the edges using an extra robust anti
skid silicone strip its 3d molded shape
matches the wreck perfectly the optional
front panel enhances the appearance of

eco-friendly cuban√≠a

same angle to the ball and preserves you
the other components even the packaging
