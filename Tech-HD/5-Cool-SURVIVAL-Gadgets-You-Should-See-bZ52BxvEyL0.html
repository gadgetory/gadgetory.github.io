from Kanak outdoors to fill your vessel
unroll it and make sure the cap is
secured in place remove the slider and
put aside hold the top open by holding
both the edges or by pinching the red
left while keeping the top open scoop
water until full fold the top of the
vecto over the red lift and fit the
slider on again while making sure it
engages the three tongue the slider
locks into place with a soft click to
confirm the slider is locked the window
should be clear for filtering remove the
cap and screw on the filter just make
sure the vector is not too full
you can squeeze filter or use a coupling
to make this gravity system thanks for
watching see you on the trail
when you're trying to go as fast as
light as possible obviously weight is a
huge factor but days like that also
demand that you stay fully hydrated so
that you can consistently be performing
at your best those two things really
conflict because water adds a ton of
weight
we designed the trail shop micro filter
to help you save weight essentially it
gives you a full day's water supply at a
mere five ounces and fits in your pocket
when a trail run I like to carry two
small water bottles when those are empty
I can use the trail shot filter to drink
directly and instantly from a stream
along the trail then I can quickly fill
up my bottles with clean water and get
going again or if I'm wearing a
hydration pack I can connect it straight
to my hose and fill up my reservoir the
trail shaft filter is so tiny it fits in
a stash pocket alongside my bars and
it's quick to deploy you just dropped
the pre-filter in the water and start
filtering it treats a liter of water in
60 seconds the trail shop filter uses
hollow fiber technology that meets the
highest standards for removing protozoa
like Giardia and Cryptosporidium and
bacteria like e.coli and Salmonella so
you have reliable water all along your
journey the filter cartridge has a 2000
litre lifespan depending on water
conditions which for me is seasons of
water at MSR our goal is to design
products for simplicity and
functionality giving you everything you
need and nothing you don't
another essential is the ability to
signal for help the star flash signal
mirror is over 90 percent as reflective
of glass yet weighs less than half an
ounce to use the star flash mirror
reflect light from the Sun or another
source such as the moon or a flashlight
under your hand bring the star flash
mirror to where the bottom rests on your
cheek like this as you look through the
aiming circle you should see a
holographic image of the Sun in the form
of a fireball take the star flash mirror
and your head and turn it towards your
target and put that fireball on your
target as long as that fireball is on
your target they should see a reflection
from the star flash mirror the star
flash mirror is virtually unbreakable
eliminating the chance of its shattering
and causing injury
let alone becoming useless also the star
flash mirror is outstanding for water
environments because it floats star
flash mirror can be used with pinpoint
accuracy it can be seen in excess of 100
miles away especially on a clear day
over water</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
