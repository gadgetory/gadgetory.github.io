days at home when the heat is simply
unbearable leaving you feeling as though
you too could be melting away with
quillo
you can cool your room down by 10
degrees you can easily add ice to a
dedicated ice compartment to cool your
room down even faster
most other swamp coolers and air
conditioners are super loud and noisy
the quilo on the other hand super quiet
its soothing ambient sound of water
streaming and the amber mood light from
the water level indicator ensure that
you sleep well while staying cool the
quillo even comes with a sleek
minimalistic remote control so that you
can operate it from across the room as
far as 12 feet away it's so simple you
don't even need an app for it even when
the cold winter months usually leave
your skin dry you can continue to use
quillo as a humidifier quillo naturally
humidifies the air to rehydrate your
skin just be sure to fill up the tank
with water what's more with the
detachable power cord the quillo is
extremely compact lightweight and
portable making it easy to store when
you don't need it as you can see the
quillo is a fan and evaporative air
cooler and a humidifier all rolled into
one when you add water in the tank
quillo evaporative cooling technology
rapidly reduces the temperature of
incoming warm air creating a refreshing
cool breeze cooler not only naturally
cools and humidifies a room but it's
also energy efficient compact quiet and
portable it's surprisingly powerful the
first batch of quill o's are already
under production you can get your quill
O's through this campaign at a super low
price so everyone can see the
life-changing benefits of having aquilo
in your home as we head towards mass
production we need your support to get
the word
about a breakthrough new product I love
you ting great food and I love sharing
great food that I made cooking can be
stressful especially when making new
food cooking for a family or
entertaining guests how many times have
you made a recipe well once but can't
duplicate the results the next time when
you serve to friends hi I'm Chris we
wanted an easy way for aspiring cooks
like me to make food perfectly every
time so we created the Paragon induction
cooktop a critical element of cooking
food rightist temperature Paragon takes
the guesswork out of cooking with this
wireless sensor that communicates the
precise temperature of your food to the
cooktop the cooktop uses a constant
stream of information to adjust the
burner power level so that your food is
cooked to perfection you just set the
temperature and walk away one of the
coolest applications of Paragon
precision cooking is called sous-vide
it's a method that's been used in top
restaurants for years because it
produces consistent results with very
little supervision simply seal the
ingredients in an airtight bag and place
them in a pot of water attach the
magnetic temperature sensor set the
desired temperature and press Start you
can use the optional Paragon mobile app
to find the right time and temperature
for your food in three simple touches
Paragon maintains precise water
temperature to cook food evenly
throughout and once it's done cooking
briefly sear and serve with sous-vide
you can achieve edge to edge medium-rare
medium well or whatever you like with
Paragons precise temperature control you
can be sure that food will be cooked
perfect every time I got into barbecue
because I have a serious passion for
consistency one of the key factors of
achieving restaurant quality is time and
temperature control and that's one of
the reasons I love the Paragon we wanted
to design a simple counter top cooker
that is both functional and elegant I
don't like having extra stuff in my
kitchen so I wanted to develop an
appliance that can do several things and
do them well Paragon is versatile it can
deep-fry sous-vide sear saute are just
maintained food at
in temperature you can remotely check on
the progress of your food and even get
notifications when it's ready
Paragon will hold food at the right
temperature until ready to serve so you
can focus on what you want to do with
the Paragon induction cooktop you can
easily master the art of precision
cooking Paragon is coming about through
collaboration with a community of
designers engineers and food scientists
who are fueling the evolution of home
cooking using our open source API
community members are already working on
additional applications like brewing
beer and making candy and it's just the
beginning with your help we will improve
the app lower cost of production and
enhanced features I've been developing
appliances for over 13 years and Paragon
is the product that I have always wanted
I'm excited to finally bring it to
market so that you can enjoy it too by
backing us on IndieGoGo you will become
one of the first people to master the
art of precision cooking
water is the fundamental source of life
and we all want to be sure we are
drinking the best water possible mitr
created the world's first smart water
system that delivers you safe and
healthy water inspired by nature mitr
reproduces the natural water cycle
through evaporation
condensation
and mineralization meter brings you
healthy water directly in your kitchen
healthy waters to things clean purified
water and enhanced with minerals
Mitter gets rid of everything bad and
puts a lot of good in it
MIT has been designed and tested going
through a thousand hours of 3d printing
for working prototypes just to arrive at
the final model and to make sure that
you get healthy water meters proprietary
purification technology first removes
all the contaminants like bacterias and
viruses even hormones and nitrates water
from it is 60 times cleaner than from a
picture filter and three times cleaner
than a reverse osmosis system after
purification the waters and hands
through a mineral cartridge you can
personalize the water you want to drink
soft with low minerals crisp high
mineral water and alkaline with high pH
the result is always a perfectly
balanced mineralized water of your
choice maybe you're like Anna and she
wants what's best for children Mittal
helps difficult health even safe water
she also cares about the environment and
meter allows her to get rid of all
plastic bottles what I Katherine who
cares deeply about her health and
well-being she's obsessed with tea and
with meter she's sure it will always be
the perfect temperature
or maybe you feel more like Philip who's
passionate about his performance the
minerals and nutrients and the water
flow meter will help him with his diet
and this training he's also a technology
infu beers with an app that tracks and
monitors the water quality and
automatically since new cartridges
whenever you need them this is what
meter offers the right healthy water for
you
