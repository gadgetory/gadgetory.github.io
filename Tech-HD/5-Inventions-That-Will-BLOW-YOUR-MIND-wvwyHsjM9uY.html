and creator of the sky camp in 2009 my
family and I hit the road and covered
58,000 miles all across North America
over three years I was traveling with my
wife and two daughters and we weren't
satisfied with the comfort of a
traditional tent or the time to pitch it
we settled on a pop-up trailer but it
was a drag and a pain to set up after
going back home I founded I camper and
after many tests prototypes and
improvement on our previous three models
my team and I are proud to have found
the answer introducing the sky camp the
world's first expandable hard shell
rooftop tent as featured in tech insider
The Sunday Times Lonely Planet insider
design G gadgets Mashable Asia and
Business Insider the sky camp is truly
exceptional it is a treehouse dream come
true
except that it is bigger mobile and more
comfortable it is made for life on the
road so you can take off whenever
stopped wherever and fall asleep looking
up at the stars the sky camp is of the
highest quality so you can keep camping
in your rooftop tent night after night
waterproof tent fabric a fiber
reinforced hard shell top aluminum or
stainless steel metal components to
prevent rust we did not sacrifice
quality for price the sky camp is
perfect for a family trip or a road trip
with friends it consists two adults and
two children or three adults the
extension floor folds out to reveal a
comfortable king-size mattress made of
high density memory foam pillows and
bedding can conveniently be left inside
the tent when you close it worried about
weight I can't partake safety seriously
the floor is made of aluminum honeycomb
panels that are extremely strong and can
hold up to 900 pounds the sky camp
weighs only 150 pounds including the
ladder and mattress so two people can
easily mount it within a few minutes its
Universal mounting system and
lightweight make it compatible with most
crossbars or roof racks we know how
difficult and annoying it can be to
pitch a tent open a pop-up trailer or
soft top roof tent only to have to pack
it up the next morning day after day the
sky camp can be set up easily in less
than a minute one person can open it on
his or her
and closing it is just as simple you
love your car and we wanted it to look
just as good with a rooftop tent mounted
on it the sky camp fiber reinforced
hardshell is aerodynamic lightweight and
available in glossy black or white want
more customize your sky camp by adding
an awning to protect you from the rain
or Sun an annex room to hang out in or
store gear a rack to keep your shoes dry
and away from bugs and animals hanging
storage shelves or a wind deflector the
sky camp is my dream come true
and now I want to share it with you
embark on your own journey and follow
your dream back this project and help
travelers around the world grow closer
to people and nature
Oh
you
me
Oh
you

hi I'm Jessica banks I'm a scientist
roboticist and founder of rock paper
robots design an engineering firm out of
Brooklyn we make kinetic furniture
what's kinetic furniture well it's
basically the core that move like these
levitating tables or this bouncing one
or our latest ally chair
inspired by experienced living and
working in New York see this is our
office but this is our office the city
inspires us informs us and acts as a
constant reminder of the diversity of
people and problems that we have to
consider when we design plus the
responsibility we feel to not create
more come see what we mean
Alex I retract the two inches so it's
ideal for small spaces it's flat packs
for transport and we all know how
important that is
it's lightweight so it's easy to move
around
Sargeras and built-in lumbar support so
it's super dummy after a long day on
your piece
and because the Tara body is made out of
aluminum and the default amber is made
out of PE it's great outdoor environment
and because we're fans of personal
expression oli is customizable the
Tambor the flexible flatted feet part is
interchangeable so you can swap it out
to suit your style and just for our
Kickstarter backers we're offering some
limited edition finishes for your chairs
including an awesome silkscreen by our
talented friend would be no extra space
no problem
store your Ollie chair on the wall like
a work of art and of course the chair is
perfect for home - all we can be your
primary seating or accommodate your
space for extra guests so storing the
chair might seem like sleight of hand
manufacturing it doesn't take magic it
takes money that's where you come in by
supporting our Kickstarter campaign
you'll be the first to get your butts on
the ollie chairs but far lower than the
expected retail price and you'll be
supporting a female run manufacturing
company that's will manufacturing so
thank you from all of us at rock paper
robot support Ollie and let always
support you and don't forget to share
the chair cab on here Diala chair get
yourself the Kickstarter
I love to barbecue and I love to grill
there's just something about the taste
Hickory mesquite alder and cherry mmm
juiciness you get from a slow cooker now
I just use my feet grills wood pellet
grill I can smoke grill bake brain roast
and barbecue all-in-one I have to say
it's my new secret weapon the grills
automatically moves wood pellets into
the electric burner at a consistent rate
for even heating the fire never touches
the food keeping it from unwanted
charring after plugging Z grills in just
tells me grills whether you like to
smoke or cook providing that great wood
flavor with the ease and convenience for
the gas grill using a gas grill you just
don't get that natural wood flavor and
aroma and charcoal grills are just too
messy it's difficult to control when you
start or stop looking after my prep it
straight into the Z grills and smoke and
cooks all in one place besides the
convenience of smoking and grilling at
the turn of a dial I can also make this
delicious wood-fired pizzas the Grouse
digital temperature control makes it
easy for me to step away for the more
important well more fun things now that
you know all of my grilling secrets get
one for yourself at an amazing price get
yourself in Z grills the lead 900 today

we'll have I think Oh five engineers
exactly with a clear goal make cycling
safer it's amazing to see how many
people have join us to the beginning of
our journey we have been one year
working on our first product
malinka we cyclists are the most
vulnerable users of the road to wheels
to balance notes ashes to protectors and
we still need to use our hands to
communicate with cars blinkers is the
one thing that was missing for cycling
speaking safer and to be a natural power
controller it starts with a regular bike
light that you know the blinkers
actually packed everything you need to
be seen on the street and respected by
everyone else in the world with blinkers
cars will always know when you are
turning and when you are braking
a laser projection makes you even more
visible and allows cars to understand
better what is your space and what is
fiercely blinkers were designed to fit
in your life it has no buttons turns on
a schematic luckily blinkers also have a
powerful battery and it's very easy to
recharge blinkers is the ultimate safety
solution for sight
IndieGoGo it has been a long journey but
it takes all the people that have join
us that we made it so far with a
successful Kickstarter last year in
which we use the funds to take the
product to the level we are now you team
up with Suki a top swiss engineering
company for the technical development of
the product in which we take linkers to
a state that is ready for serial
production and that's not what we
consider oh we need your support with
the last push two winters and make it a
reality
let's make cycling safer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
