more about garage it is it our friendly
community page what a beautiful day the
sun is shining and the future is looking
bright
however even with a life as perfect on
this if you look a little beneath the
surface
did you see what happened there the
world is a little bit improved a bit
more carefully for me and my family with
v-ray just remember three numbers one
size and 99.9 with one-time use for
duration of only five short seconds you
can eradicate the 99.9% of bacteria
let's give it a try Ceres blue light
this light indicates the area that is
undergoing sterilization you'll be
shocked by how dirty household items can
be v-ray is essential for keeping
sensitive items such as kitchen utensils
and children's toys rechargeable and
cordless v-ray can sterilize just about
anything in this belief about various
areas Asian power the Rays announced
sterilization is provided to a unique
high reflectivity material that directs
and focuses Phillip certified lamps we
scientifically proven germicidal effects
despite its power v-ray is also safe
with patented safety features that
prevent exposure to your eyes and skin
now do you believe in various
sterilizing a cut designed to be simple
to use introduce the power of v-ray to
keep your items term free
no need to only use very at home with
its horrible design burek answer lies
all areas of your life bacteria can be
anywhere
luckily with v-ray we can sight back
with a UV power of the Sun find your
brighter future with very
achieving sustainability in the textile
industry has its challenges but none
more urgent than organic cotton I've
worked with textiles my entire life I
find incredible creativity in the
problem-solving of sustainability
because you really put consideration
into everything you do the materials you
use the people you work with the
resources that they come from we have
the opportunity through design to look
at those systems in nature and integrate
it into production systems that emulate
what nature does
organic cotton production is declining
almost 50% in the past decade yet
somehow every year retailers report
sales increases in organic cotton
apparel and home textiles even the
largest brands can be victims of organic
fraud an organic certification is no
guarantee it's not the fault of those
brands it's the fault of the system to
solve this problem we created altaira
pure and along with it a new system to
go beyond certification sure I'll Tara
pure is certified organic but that's not
enough we verify using global standards
to ensure no pesticides and no GMOs we
show you everything from seed source to
fabric finishing compounds to pesticide
analysis we have no secrets with each
product your production number allows
you to see every aspect of this process
we also verify Altera Pure's social
sustainability will fund community
projects with the help of organic
village coordinators in India our social
project seek to impact the lives of the
people who grow our organic cotton with
the goal of strengthening the organic
farming base
like a classic Oxford shirt this tight
weave percale provides a crisp and cool
fabric with a freeing sleep and no
clinging like with some sheets made from
t-shirt materials and since we don't use
softeners or pre washes while Tara pures
comfort will actually improve through
the years just like the heirloom sheets
of generations past we didn't start out
to air up here to make a ton of money
we started this to make a ton of change
we've produced the fabric now we need
your help to complete production and
deliver the final product the funds from
this campaign will not only go for that
production but launch the social
projects for the organic farming
communities we are offering exclusive
gifts to our backers and our believers
after you support this project please
help us get the word out by sharing this
video with those who value integrity and
sustainability so thank you for your
support we believe that I'll tear up yer
will provide you with the healthiest
sleep of your life thank you
