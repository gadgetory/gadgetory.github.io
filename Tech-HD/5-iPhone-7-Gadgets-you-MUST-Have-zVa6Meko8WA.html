of course but we also wanted something
useful we understand that some people
love their music to them it's very
important more important than taking
their medication often but what pairs
well with music oh that's right
headphones yes what people decide to put
into their own ear holes is a very
personal choice and it's a choice we
should all get the chance to make not
one that should be made for us that's
why we made fumes it's a case made
specifically for the iphone 7 and 7 plus
but it's not just a case it's also the
first case with a 3.5 millimeter audio
jack to lighting adapter built-in it's
time to rock out with your are set
that's right with fuse you can use your
favorite earbuds or headset that you
already have with the iphone 7 adapters
on rock and roll rubbish having to wear
the same earbuds as everybody else isn't
rock'n'roll airports god bloody rock and
roll you know what is being able to do
whatever the hell you want with your
gear
fuse is an iphone case something Apple
CEO Tim Cook says every iphone 7 user
should use but it's so much more than
that Apple is trying to kill the
headphone jack and that's something that
affects all of us there are dozens of
uses for the port beyond music there are
credit card readers thermometers
microphones adult toys and even blood
monitors some people even use it to make
sure they don't die you don't want this
grandma to die do you of course you
don't and neither do we now all we can't
say that Apple remove the audio jack
because it wants to kill people
obviously we can't say in this very real
specific scenario the fuse is a device
that can quite literally save lives and
unlike the galaxy note 7 it won't
explode burning you and your family
alive this isn't even a note 7 I know
that because I put in my contract I'm
not gonna hold a note settings I like my

introducing the world's first magnetic
connector for iphone 7 because apple is
combined the audio jack and the power
jack into one connector on the iphone 7
we are now able to give you a magnetic
connector to connect your data audio and
fast charging in a single click it's
never been working me magnetic
connectors are vastly superior to
mechanical connectors not only are they
way more convenient
they're also far more resistant to dust
water and other contaminants all this
added reliability can greatly improve
your peace of mind
our engineering team has worked very
hard to make this connector as small as
possible we have also developed a tool
board connector that works with Android
and Apple devices we've already
successfully completed a pilot
manufacturing run of over 1,000 units we
have done extensive testing to ensure
their reliability over extended use
if you're interested please contact us
now for our early review so please
support us and make this a reality you
cannot do it without you
you
you
you
you
we all love listening to music on our
smart devices they hold thousands of
songs and they're easy to use but
cramming so many features onto one
device comes at a cost and that cost is
sound quality meat and I am the world's
lightest battery-free micro headphone
amplifier for your iphone ipad and ipod
devices it's also the world's first
headphone amplifier using Apple official
c68 audio lightning adapter and it only
weighs 7 grams minion size stylish
design and meets all your needs for high
quality music on the go and I am
amplifier for I devices that makes music
sound amazing the high quality
components in amp I am will give your
music a greater sense of space enabling
you to hear more clearly the separate
instruments voices and melodies detail
is greater so the subtle nuances in
vocal intonation or the way a note is
played can be heard more easily grip on
the lower frequencies will also be
better so bass notes should sound more
tuned for driving their own rhythm
rather than just being heavy and loud
all of this leads to a more emotionally
engaging and therefore enjoyable
experience with amp I am listening to
the music simply becomes more fun it's
easy to set up amp i am just plug the m5
I'd light nning connector into your
iPhone iPad or iPod then plug your
headphone jack into amp I am that
sit that's simple and now you can listen
to music the way the artist intended if
rumors have it that the biggest hardware
revisions of the iphone 7 are predicted
to Center on the removal of the 3.5
millimeter headphone jack and future
iphones are released with just a
lightning port amp i am would allow you
to continue to use your favorite
headphones and will work as an
alternative to whatever apple provides
for compatibility with standard
headphones with amp i am you're ready
for the iphone 7 and beyond whatever
you're doing jogging on your way to work
or just chillaxing enjoy an exquisite
listening experience studio quality
music that's clearer and crisper anytime
anywhere with em I am was very good
extraordinary oh it's really cool you
can really tell the difference trouble
the base it was all very clear much
clearer than before
we're not lot better
cool
