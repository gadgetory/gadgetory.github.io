warm gentle and luxurious Cirrus is like
showering in the clouds
wow that was a phenomenal experience I'm
totally blown away I'm really impressed
it was an amazing shower they say that
it's like showering in a cloud it really
is
Cirrus is a revolutionary showerhead
that elevates the bathing ritual into
the stratosphere our atomizing cloud
maker nozzle technology produces a mist
so find that it totally envelops you and
by creating a mist so fine Cirrus
reduces water and energy consumption by
75% compared to conventional showerheads
meaning you'll see a rapid return on
your investment Cirrus also purifies the
water in which you'll bathe our easy to
replace nano filters contain three
layers of mineralized stones which
enhance water quality by filtering
impurities reducing chlorines adding
minerals and balancing pH levels each
nano filter lasts two to three months of
use for an average family you can also
choose from our range of organic
essential oil aromatherapy infusers
simply add an infuser each time you
shower for a completely invigorating
experience personally I'm not really one
for the aromatherapy but my girlfriend
is she says it's like having a spa our
essential oils are both colorless and
soap free meaning they do not perfume
your hair or body or discolor the water
so how does Cirrus work our eco-friendly
cloud maker water atomizing technology
delivers a consistent spray by splitting
the incoming
stream into myriad nano droplets
creating a mist that is both
all-embracing and highly efficient well
be honest I was a little skeptical about
the water savings but I've been using it
for about a month now and I've seen a
significant drop in water consumption I
can see this thing paying for itself in
no time and Cirrus does not compromise
rinse ability in fact foamy shampoo
rinses out of your hair easier with
Cirrus thanks to its optimized water
distribution I'm really surprised if
anything the shower rinsed off the
shampoo on my hair faster than a normal
shower which really surprised me because
my hair is really thick Paris is
designed in France and uses Chrome and
flight polycarbonate to produce a
stylish unapologetically modern bathroom
shower heads
it's made with standard universal
fittings and installs in seconds it is
adaptable to any bathroom and setup is
both tool lists and foolproof the
installation is the easiest thing in the
world I'm no handyman it took me seconds
to do it if I can do it anyone can do it
I have been managing to complex
logistics of production and distribution
for major retailers and businesses since
I arrived in Asia ten years ago we have
a team permanently based here in Hong
Kong so we can closely monitor the
development and production processes and
importantly to keep a keen eye on
quality control you can count on us to
deliver on our work so where's the catch
the catch
now I'll take even longer to get ready
now if you'll excuse me
serious like showering in the clouds
as a kid I love the fun and freedom of
riding my bike two wheels my own power
and the possibilities for adventure were
unlimited but as I got older I realized
I was writing less and less my wrists
neck and groin hurt or went numb every
time I rode more than a few miles as a
doctor who has reviewed the medical
research on the subject I knew those
symptoms can mean serious trouble I also
knew there had to be a better way my
name is Jim Parker I'm the director of
cruise bike my wife Maria and I decided
to invest in an alternative healthier
bike design we helped start a new
company called cruise bike and for the
past 12 years we've been testing and
improving our various models to make
them faster healthier and more fun in
2013 Maria raced 3,000 miles on a cruise
bike to win the rates across America
between us we hold dozens of cycling
records especially in long-distance
events and that's just the two of them
people in the cruise flight tribe have
lost weight gotten in shape traveled the
world and commuted to work and raced
farther and faster than they ever
thought they could now we've focused our
effort into creating a healthy
affordable bike that is all about
freedom years of writing racing and
innovation have led to a simple elegant
new design introducing the cruise bike
t-50 the healthiest most comfortable
most affordable bike ever for your body
from the pain of a traditional bike so
you can ride more get in shape and enjoy
the simple pleasure of a bike ride our
unique front wheel drive design
harnesses the compact drivetrain of the
traditional bicycle it connects your
upper body and core to the cranks so you
can climb and accelerate like you would
on a traditional bike it delivers a
tight turning radius it also fits on
most trainers so you can exercise
indoors it's about the same length as
traditional bikes and all the components
are standard the t-50 won't cause the
discomfort and pain that a traditional
bike can in addition to being amazingly
ergonomic you can share your t-50 with
your taller and shorter friends thanks
to the adjustable front tube and you can
take your t-50 anywhere since it fits on
standard bike racks and works well with
a variety of bags and trailers making it
ideal for bike packing camping or a trip
to the market
the t-50 gives you freedom you decide
what to do with it since Chris bite
began making bikes 12 years ago we have
produced them in small batches which
makes them costly with your help this
Kickstarter campaign is going to change
that if we're funded we will be able to
meet the order requirement for a mass
production run of key fifties taking
this bike a sustainable product in our
lineup and fulfilling our mission to
bring the freedom and joy of cycling to
more people there is no better time than
now to jump in and help us build a
better bicycle so click the green fact
this project button and free yourself
and others to enjoy the simple pleasure
of a bike ride
Oh
hearing protection should be a concern
to all but these plugs aren't created
solely for avoiding hearing loss we've
created plugs that you'll want to have
for those times when you need to
minimize distraction focus more intently
sleep more deeply and simply control
your environment better while other
plugs may reduce sound they're awkward
and unattractive design is far from
something you would want to wear in
public the tulip tip on the XP reactor
and the XP defender has been designed to
fit so comfortably that they can be worn
for long periods of time when warm
properly they fit inside the ear which
makes them discreet with minimal
visibility the XP defender has the added
capability of allowing you to easily
open and close the sound bound with just
the push of a button
imagine the power to quickly and easily
reduce bothersome noise around you and
then quickly disable them for full
hearing capability as one of our five
senses the ability to hear is a precious
gift that we need to protect
unfortunately
we take our hearing for granted and as a
result one in three people in America
over the age of 65 has hearing loud
sounds can occur long-term damage to
your hearing as a sound enters the ear
fluid is pushed through the cochlea
which contains 80,000 hair cells that
convert vibrations into electrical
pulses these pulses are then sent to the
audio receptors of the brain when
exposed to loud noise the hair cells in
the cochlea will receive a reparable
damage causing permanent hearing loss
for you
these innovative plugs are the stylish
and convenient solution for hearing
protection and reduction when you needed
the most support this product today to
receive these innovative ear plugs at a
discounted price and before the rest of
the market does thank you for your
support
hi I'm Marcus and I'm Greg we are two
young students Lina later from Slovenia
we would like to show you an awesome
project to make we're going to make your
summer days by dispute your friends even
more fun this is skipping skipping has a
simple yet a very appealing design its
surface is flat and round just like the
flat skipping stones we used to throw
across the water if kit it's made out of
natural rubber which gives it enough
solidity to make it skip on look but
it's also flexible and soft to prevent
any injuries while playing
that's why Skippy it's also ideal for
indoor use and you can throw it around
in the pool during winter without
anywhere we made Skippy in four
different colors so you can choose the
one you like the most and you don't have
to worry about losing the side of the
toy the one in a bigger group using
multiple Skippy's makes playing even
more fun

with your friends by the seat in the
pool please don't hesitate to back

holidays even more amazed thank you
