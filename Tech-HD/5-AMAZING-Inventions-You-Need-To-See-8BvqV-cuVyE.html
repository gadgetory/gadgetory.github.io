boast is a patented reusable stainless
sleeve with electronics that slips over
your new or used batteries and extends

batteries
not to mention convenience of fewer
trips to the store

core is at the center of water our
passion is to create the world's most
beautiful and functional hydration
products that filter
store and enhance the water you drink
we're obsessed with great design in both
form and functions and we strive to
innovate in everything we do while
making the world a better place we call
our customers water advocates because
together we're celebrating and
treasuring water the one thing that
connects us all hi I'm Eric Barnes toph
founder and CEO of core water and we're
here in Aliso Viejo of course
headquarters the core naba is a
revolutionary filtering reusable water
bottle it's unlike any filter bottle on
the market we asked ourselves how we can
match the style convenience and taste of
bottled water and after 18 months and
dozens of prototypes I think we nailed
it core nava it looks cool it's easy to
drink from and provides great tasting
water right from your attack we chose to
make our filter out of coconut shells
which are converted to activated carbon
activated carbon has been used for
thousands of years to safely purify
water other filters are often made from
coal which can contain heavy metals
coconut is not only safer but it's a
renewable resource
our filter lasts for about three months
or approximately forty gallons of water
that's equal to nearly three hundred
plastic water bottles that aren't going
into a landfill and it's saving you as
much as four hundred dollars not spent
on bottled water to make it really easy
to break the bottle water habit or
offers for the naba filter subscription
right on our website you can also buy
replacement filters from a retailer that
sells nava with most bottles a
mouthpiece and drinking experience are
complete afterthought with the nava we
test it over and over to create an
amazing
ergonomic spout that feels great on your
lips we also strive to optimize the flow
a lot of filter bottles require you to
either squeeze the water out or you have
to suck really hard like a Hoover vacuum
to pull the water past the filter so we
created a concept called easy flow which
optimizes water flow between the
cocoanut filter and the straw to deliver
incredible tasting water but with great
flow the Corps Nava also features our no
worry cap with just a press of the
button cap opens to allow you to drink
and it stays out of the way until you're
ready to close it which provides a
hygienic chamber which essentially
protects the spout when not in use from
germs and dirt so the Corps Nava also
contains our technology called easy
clean easy spill to demonstrate with
just a twist of the wrist the cap comes
off and I can also show you how to
change the filter and it reveals a wide
mouth opening that's easy to get in the
dishwasher and clean
change the filter simply twist the straw
pull it out and you can see inside here
is our coconut carbon filter just place
it in there and you need to get a new
one let's draw back in the cap quarter
turn and your novice back in action it's
really that simple
all core vessels are made from health
safe materials but don't contain BPA or
violence and that includes the Coronado
it's made from a material called trike
bpa-free
extremely durable I love the novel
because it's my traveling companion I
can take it through the airport empty
and fill it up on the other side with
stuff water and you know therefore
giving me fresh tasting water and saving
me money from purchasing bottled water
our mission is to celebrate treasure
water and through our thirst for giving
program core gets back to critical water
causes like ocean protection and the
global water crisis to find out more
about this forgiving visit course
website at core water calm
you
it's noise which isa leading us is all
will ever trust ya know I don't always
we'll go
through the wastelands through the
highways from a shadow to sunrays
we'll go
along the way melodies we haven't played
I don't know
I go in around these walls to create a
song
we'll go through the wastelands through
the highways through my shadow through
the sunrays
and we'll probably number if you burn
them to see the horizon
and will grow in number see the
this is much more than just a simple
timepiece our new watch presents one of
the most challenging to make mechanisms
ever created in watchmaking history a
Swiss maid taught beyond based on the
traditional system which was developed
by the master watch maker abraham-louis
Breguet at the end of the 18th century
by continuously rotating the escapement
around its own axis the movement
counters the effect of gravity this is a
challenge that doiis has overcome last
year Raphael founder and designer of
twists with the help of many backers
created the most innovative Swiss made
watch in crowdfunding history
an international award-winning watch
granted at the European Parliament and
this year we want to go even further
together we can create the greatest
crowdfunding timepiece ever at the top
of the range
rs1 and rc1 tobias but the twist our one
collection has a watch for every watch
enthusiast automatic watches with twist
signature and innovative time display
system and exquisite quartz models
each and every one is a limited-edition
swiss-made watch be part of the next
step in crowdfunding watchmaking pledge
