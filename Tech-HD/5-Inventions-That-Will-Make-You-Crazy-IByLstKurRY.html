launched our first product that siesta
for here on Kickstarter the response was
incredible and with the money raised we
delivered the world's first heat and
light blocking tent with built-in fans
thank you so much to everyone who backed
our last project the feedback has been
amazing and over the last two summers
happy customers have clocked up
thousands of hours of extra sleep thanks
to our heat and light blocking fabric
now we're back on Kickstarter to launch
our next game changing product the
siesta - a compact lightweight two
person backpacking tent that's
dramatically cooler than other tents and
sunny weather and keeps you warmer in
cold condition we took all the knowledge
and experience we gained from making the
siesta four and developed a brand new
heat and light blocking fabric with a
core of 20 denier nylon ripstop it's
incredibly lightweight and durable the
waterproof fly enables exceptional
comfort by blocking infrared ultraviolet
and visible-light
while the inner mesh can be fully closed
to keep out dust and cold drafts when
designing the siesta - we wanted a
completely freestanding structure with
an awesome strength to weight ratio so
we integrated a full length trust pole
that extends right to the ground the
unique profile also allows orientation
towards the Sun so the doors are always
in the shade this enables maximum
ventilation without direct sunlight
entering the tent and if you've room in
your pack why not grab the optional fan
and enjoy even more airflow
game-changing comfort across hot and
cold temperatures while being compact
and lightweight with top-quality
aluminum fittings makes the siesta - the
most versatile backpacking tent ever
made we've already proven our production
processes so you can be sure of
world-class quality and reliability
so if you'd like a seriously badass tent
please back our project share with your
friends
what's in your pocket right now your
phone wallet maybe even your car keys
they're all stuffed you want to keep
safe especially from the water a few
years ago I was at the beach and I
wanted to go for a swim but I had my
phone and my wallet with me the only
option I had was to take dry bag
everywhere I went or hide it I decided
to hide it at the beach and go for the
swim and I came back to find everything
was stolen in fact the only thing I did
have left the shorts I was wearing but
that gave me an idea what if the shorts
that I was wearing could actually keep
my valuables dry even in the water
is certified to over a hundred feet
underwater
the secrets near magnets the world's
strongest permanent magnets when you let
go they snap together it's a crane
instant waterproof flop
the reason it works to this incredible
death because it's simple science on the
water the water pressure pushes the
magnets even tighter together
reinforcing the silk that means in the
roughest conditions to stop
hey Kickstarter so we've got everything
lined up these factories and
distribution and everything else but now
we need you over the last few years I've
been through many prototypes and now
I've got to the stage we're ready to
release the shots
