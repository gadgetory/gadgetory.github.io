seems fun good looking it fits in many
places it's not the chopstick nothing to
liquor not the traffic and no ninja but
what the hell is it oh it's locked
well you can plug it in something and
you can only plug things in Wow awesome
but it seems so simple there must be
something really special about it so
that every idiot on this planet can plug
it everywhere anywhere
hi i'm andrew and i'm the creator of my
Powermate the passionate traveler I
always take lots of technical devices on
my journeys it doesn't matter whether
you use them in Africa Asia Europe or
America these gadgets meet electricity
and their batteries want to be charged
but the problem of them is the different
plugs and sockets at some point I got
sick of all these multi adapters which
fit in less than 30 percent of the
sockets worldwide and not to mention the
power instabilities the countries like
Kenya Mexico India they burned down
several camera charges and mobile phones
during my traveling so I decided to
invent my family this little dude can be
blocked at all the 15 different sockets
you can officially find on this planet
and it will protect your devices from
power surges for an integrated resistor
protection three different pairs of
adapters allow you to plug my power me
in just every circuit simply combine the
right editor with a flexible leg in
order to make it fits to the particular
systems an unlocking pin is included for
the UK sockets the USB for it allows you
to use the mate as your new flash memory
better you can quickly store your
pictures from your smart device even
without the laptop my power may flex to
the ultimate irreal is way more of us
than standard plastic adapters and won't
break that easy furthermore the adapter
has a water inlet to cover the most
common standards
with this invention you don't need to
worry anymore if you took the right
adapters for your journey under my power
mate you just get any there this product
simple reasonably priced and practically
the more you support my project the more
you can make this little mate for you so
keep on traveling and thanks for
checking out making
you
hmm
you
we all live our lives on the go but in
today's world our phones tablets and
even watches require constant power you
could carry around a brick sized power
bank or be constantly on the lookout for
a power outlet but what if there was
something better a lighter smaller and
smarter option introducing tag by Sol
Pro sulfur was founded with one goal in
mind and that was to make renewable
energies very convenient ways and bring
them mainstream Sol protag is integrated
with highly efficient SunPower solar
cells that recharge the internal battery
in a matter of hours by connecting it to
anything that you have by just hooking
it into this these little bumpers and
hooking it on your backpack you're
charging just by walking outside you're
getting more energy into the battery and
then just the size and weight making it
so easy for anyone to use it anything
yeah the contacts of this to that size
blows me away
tag features a clean attractive design
that is water and dust resistant it
attaches neatly to any bag giving you
hassle-free solar charging capability
when you're out and about or on-the-go
something like this grabbing solar
energy charging up your phone
keeping your Bluetooth headset charged
can be done off of sunlight that you
don't even have to think about tag
weighs less than 2 ounces is the size of
about four credit cards stacked on each
other it can work with any existing USB
cable and could be recharged quickly
from any USB port or on-the-go by the
Sun with the built-in solar cell now
what we need to do is we need to give
this in many hands as possible we want
people to be using this and that's why
we partner with tracker the world's

and nest offering all the features and
functionality of a standard tracker
device
well tracker is so thrilled to be
