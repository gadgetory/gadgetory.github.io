frosting but what's better is sharing it
with someone else and with the same
concept we designed the magics power
donut for you to share the power with a
slicer compact and light that you can
slide your pocket logics para donut
simultaneously Paris up all five easy
sockets and two USB ports for the fast
charge and the best thing is they won't
conflict with each other like they
always do
we solve this problem with a
revolutionary new design that allows the
folks to fit perfectly next to each
other
Magic's unique cable stomper makes it
easy for you to adjust the length of the
integrated cord
keeping your travel space neat and
organized
John Deakin grew and everyone who asked
for a logic charger with a UK EU or an
au plug type last time we hear you
that's why we designed the logics power
Babel similar to the magic Sparrow donut
for this time with universal sockets
when you have so many devices that need
charging it makes some sense to buy five
or six travel chapters well there's only
one wall socket what you want is
something that adapts all your devices
at the same time we have the perfect
solution MAGIX adapter integrated with
magic spell bagel or donut and this is
the world's first universal power
extension become adapter designed to fit
in your pocket
we complain that there's not enough
electric socket and USB charging station
at the airport in the hotel the reality
is we need power strips while travelling
but we don't bring them reason is simple
power strips on the market are way too
bulky and none of them can keep the long
messy cord under control plus they're
enabled adapt to different socket types
the idea of merge experiment and bago
which is the universal socket version of
donut is to create something elegant and
powerful with a personal touch and
paying attention to all the small
details
we at dyno equipment would like to
introduce you to Trek the world's first
modular camera slider system designed
for smartphones you can bring the truck
with you no matter where you go we
wanted to create a product that was
sleek portable easy to use and gave you
complete control on the go one of the
many things that makes our products so
unique is the magnetic quick connections
for the tracks and the legs these
connections allow you to effortlessly
connect straight and curved track pieces
to set up any attractive figuration that
you want by introducing curved pieces
into the system we open up the door to
shots that are previously too hard or
too expensive to achieve
Scott and I both have degrees in
mechanical engineering from the
University of San Diego as well as a
love and a passion for the outdoors and
adventure
so being engineers as well as
photography enthusiasts we set out to
create a product all the features that
you really want we spent countless hours
designing testing and iterating our
product in the USD machine shop until we
had something that we knew we loved and
trusted once you are confident in the
product we built connections with
suppliers and manufacturers to bring
traffic to life our first units have
already been manufactured and assembled
here in San Diego and we couldn't be
more excited that the products in your
heads Trek has already been tested and
validated in the field as well as our
supply chain is already set up and ready
to go now we just need your help to get
funding for our first production run so
we can finally get Trek into your hands
by supporting our campaign today you can
be one of the first people to experience
Trek
Kirstin I like to thank each and every
one of you for supporting us on our
journey we know you guys are going to
love the product and we can't wait to
put it into your hands and see what you
guys come up with from all of us at dyno
equipment thank you
you

on-the-go world your travel as a part of
daily life where our bodies are under
constant physical strain leaving you
tight sore and stressed and when it
comes to looking after your body few
things are as powerful as foam rolling
but anyone with the bulky foam roller

for business a long-haul vacation a trip
across town to play sport the ultra
portable neo fit roller goes with you
everywhere if I'm rolling to be part of
my fitness routine and work in
professional sports industry for almost
10 years I'd often spend six months a
year on the road on enough planes four
or five times a week my back and my body
will always really stiff tight and sore
and the more I traveled the more I
needed my foam roller which would sit on
the other side of the country my Landrum
just when I needed it most it didn't
make sense to me that just because we
travel we compromise our health and so I
decided to do something about it and
created near fit roller simply if you're
on the go and care about your health neo
fit roller is for you just wrote in your
bag and get on with your active life but
it's not just convenience we've created

adhesions and stiffness it's deep into
painful trigger points to maximize
recovery and performance and enhances
joint health mobility and flexibility
made from ultra strong lightweight
durable materials neo fit roller can
handle up to three
150 pounds while weighing less than 2
pounds it's all part of an innovative
patent-pending design that expands to 12
inches and collapses to just four inches
in just seconds with one easy motion
behind me Oh fit roller is a team of
world-class award-winning engineers and
designers that have worked on
multimillion-dollar brands for more than
a year our team has put in thousands of

the Orion 360 smart music system the
intelligent system for those of
discerning tastes Orion 360 is a
wireless Bluetooth enabled music system
it is stylish compact and it's easy to
bring with you to wherever you go we
named it the Orion 360 because it gives
you uncompromising 360 degrees surround
sound this is the result of around a
year's worth of research and development
we're very proud of the final product
it had the right form factor to include
six powerful speakers dual drivers and
in builds long life battery and an
advanced gesture control technology
sensor system while still be compact and
mobile we've spent the first five months
to come up with a design that is both
stylish and powerful with advanced
sensors for touchless operations to
maintain a sleek design we have removed
all the buttons they'll write 360 is
powered by advanced gesture control
technology that's right there are no
buttons just like the jedis you can
simply use your finger gestures to play
pause skip control volume and even
attend to phone calls now that's
incredible the Orien 3 system has 6
powerful speakers located around the
device to get into perfect 360 degrees
musical experience the Orien 360 also
takes your presence when you're into the
room and automatically jumps to standby
mode
you learn how to use a finger gesture to
start playing easy
we've developed many designs before
designing on the Orion 360 that was
mobile and easy to take with you the
Iranian 360 comes with a powerful
central vortex subwoofer for a better
musical experience the batteries are
charged through a smart contactless
charging plate under the device and take
three to four hours to charge the
Iranian 360 is an absolutely beautiful
design is small lightweight and mobile
and it comes with a battery box for
hours of operation as a product designer
there were a lot of challenges we were
designing the best music system that is
not only stylish and powerful but also
had to be future proof we needed help to
find the manufacture in golf around 360
and bring it in your hand so you too can
enjoy a truly revolutionary music system
the funds will be used towards
manufacturing electronics sensors and
metal casings from high-grade aluminum
we have established agreements with
reputed manufacturing partners in Hong
Kong and Taiwan to help us with our
manufacturing and large techniques
help us create a revolutionary music
system and be part of a success story
