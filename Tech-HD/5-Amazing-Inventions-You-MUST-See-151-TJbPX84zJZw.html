hate her just look at that gorgeous
straight hair she has and she does
nothing to get it that way
me and Katie who's also my friends just
not my best friend but you know it's
true
we have curly hair now we're proud of
our curly hair we just sometimes prefer
it straight so we tried many hair
straightening brushes and hated them all
they don't work well they burn your hair
or they're just plain ugly then there's
Babu the only brush that's actually good
just a few quick brushes before I leave
the house and my hair is as straight as
I want it and unlike other brushes it
works perfectly how come these guys Stan
and more childhood friends and
entrepreneurs when they set out to
create Vavoom
they met with girls many girls and ask
them what the perfect brush needed then
they created a brush using the girls
advice is there a lesson here about
listening to girls
maybe Vuh Vuh is amazingly built the
space between its bristles has been
precisely calculated and measured so
it's great for all types of hair the
heating plate of a voo is bigger than
other brushes so you cover more hair
with every brush and the bristles are
arranged in two lines each with a
different height to help detangle hair
and since every hair type requires a
different temperature to achieve
straightness Babu comes with digital
heat controls but good
not like the crap brushes obviously made
by evil men out to torture us Dannemora
also learned that other brushes only
have a heating plate painted with
heat-protective color that's why they
burn your hair
FUBU uses a special technique that
covers the entire plate with a ceramic
coating the tips of the bristles are
temperature protected and no they won't
fall off after one use and there's also
a protective back to guard your hand
from the heat
so yeah it's safer actually it's just
safe Babu's bristles sit on a flexi
plate so it adds kind of a massage
feeling while you brush I love that oh
and it also looks great because you know
style and me we go way back right Katie
damnit Katie you are so not supportive
that's why you're not my bestie so if
you two want your hair straightened in a
matter of minutes with the best hair
straightening brush get Vavoom it's the
best choice
you
you
the vibe is a magical product that
allows us to experience infinite new
world from the comfort of our own homes
however as game-changing as it is
discomfort can be a real issue heat
buildup the vigorous gameplay can
quickly spoil the experience we're
passionate about VR and wanted to solve
the problem so we created the vibe until
well it's not quite that powerful but
the feeling of relief is the same the
live in show was designed to be easy to
use effective and maintain a compact
form factor allowing it to disappear
into the headset and let you focus on
gaming first as we set out to find a new
solution we explored many different
pathways we experimented with countless
fan types and built iteration after
iteration of prototypes to focus on
parking air into the headset it didn't
take long to realize that most users
experienced problems with dry eyes high
noise levels and low airflow in the end
we discover that dissipating the heat
generated across the forehead provided a
much more substantial benefit than
forcing air into the headset itself our
goal is to create a product that you
couldn't go back to VR without and had
no annoying side effects it had to have
a minimal noise footprint work reliably
be convenient to use and it's stolen
under a minute with no modification to
the headset it also had to be
lightweight and nearly invisible in the
end we've succeeded with the vive and
show the rigorous scientific play
testing we've engineered the best
possible solution to meet these
objectives I'm not even kidding is so
much
and pleasure off easily not to mention I
kiss my head cool so let's go huge this
is clutch hand this crucial need to have
this up back up currently we're in the
pre-production release phase of the
project in order to make the vive and
show affordable for everyone we need
your support and vacuum back us to make
this project a reality turn a sweat
soaked face mass into a thing of the
past
thank you for your support
you
