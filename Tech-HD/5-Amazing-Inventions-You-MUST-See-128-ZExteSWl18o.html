hi my name is yogge apiece visco and
I've been working with consumer goods
for more than 15 years I've always tried
to see how I could improve and make life
easier for the inducer as a private
person I love to prepare and make food
and always end up in the kitchen using a
chef's knife as a result I've spent some
time talking to some professionals about
how to make a perfect knife two
important thing with the knife is that
it's the domestic steel which is 68
layers of Steel pressed together and
then the balance in the knife when you
have it in your hand it's very important
that you have a good balance which is
important for example when you cut bacon
and if you cut in a salon it's very
important that you call it a nice clean
cut otherwise you get pieces of fat out
but this is a very nice clean cut we
have here so for me as a professional
it's a incredible good sharp knife that
I can keep for a long time based on
Tommy's many years of experience in his
input I have been in dialogue with the
industrial designer yahuda des personnes
who has several years of experience in
designing consumer goods we discussed on
how to make different designs for the
knife we set out to make improvements to
the chef's knife we wonder the knife
that has a great functionality is light
and have a good balance and is optimized
for the production
designing a knife has to combine the
graphic aesthetics with the use of the
hand the knife has to have a visual
balance both when is hanging on the wall
and lying on the table has to allow the
user of multiple hand grip and at the
same time having issue that preventing
it from slipping out of your hand the
blade is made so that it cuts right to
the end of the place using the full
length the bolster is sloped for comfort
and proper grip so now we need your help
with your contribution it would be
possible to launch this knife concept
and as a member you will be able to get
a premium quality knife at a very
competitive price and also be able to
give other end users the opportunity to
get this unique knife concept
Jagex after my name is Julia I'm an
Italian product designer and this is my
colleague Marco
it's been two years that we focus our
work and passion on light drawing
inspiration from natural and physics
observing the fundamental laws that give
life to our universe we design
equilibrium a lamp based on the balance
between gravity and magnetic force it's
by playing with magnetic attraction and
experimenting with optics lenses and
light diffusion that we arrive at the
concept behind our lamps that's how it
deliverables board equilibria is aligned
with no structure when the two ends are
closed the magnetic force in between
them becomes strong enough to challenge
gravity letting the lamp magically
floats in the air
thanks to its design equilibrio can have
a more diffused light when the two hands
of the lamp are perfectly aligned this
allows the light to spread from the
bottom to the top part you can also get
a more direct light by simply taking the
lower power with you
from this concept we try the desk
version keeping the same sense of
lightness and simplicity thanks to the
magnetic attraction equilibrium is a
very interactive life and creates an
entertaining and appealing sense of
magic imagination to cast away with a
series of equilibria lands unique like
mold that can be used as a separate in
our homes and workspaces equilibria wall
can be customized in shape size and
number of lights in the last few months
we've been working with engineers and
technicians to develop a simple yet
stable design from the prototyping stage
to the finished product we learn through
many steps improving both the electronic
and the mechanical features
we truly think the choice of eye quality
materials mixed with the experience of
Italian craftsmen will make equilibrium
the perfect lamp for your home now we
are finished engineering and we are
ready for production we just need your
help
to bring this dream alive hi thank you
for watching this video together we can
make it happen
hi I'm Andre from HOH studios or group
or product designers with years of
experience in the alcohol and Bartel
industry our mission has been to create
innovative tools that elevate the
cocktail experience and we just came up
with our best product yet alchemax
here in Seattle our design team has been
working at alchemy - the past two years
developing a totally new approach to
liqueur infusion and carbonation that
will revolutionize your home bar we've
poured over every detail to make sure
that each step of the process of making
new and amazing flavors simple and
incredibly rewarding alchemist sets the
stage for you to explore a whole new
side to crafting cocktails you can now
transform a single bottle of liqueur
into an infinite number of flavors like
jalapeno infuse tequila vanilla bean and
rum fresh-picked lavender and gin or
even gummy bears and vodka so how does
it work Alka mix is simple to use and is
engineered to deliver a consistent
result every time you use it if your
fresh ingredients prepped in place in
the chamber pour in your favorite spirit
assembly is fast and intuitive gently
place in a nitrogen cartridge and twist
the top tightly to instantly release the
nitrogen into the chamber starting the
rapid infusion
giving it a gentle shake in waiting two
minutes allows the bubbles to work their
way into the ingredients and when you
release the pressure the bubbles burst
out of the ingredients pulling the
flavors into the spirit makes about 8
ounces of infused liquor or about four
cocktails
you can even carbonate an individual
cocktail for some extra fizz and pop
simply pour in your drink into the
chamber carbonate with our co2 cartridge
and garnish and serve
we have brought alchemax from an idea
sketched on a napkin a few years ago all
the way through the design process to a
point we are incredibly proud of as you
can see we've been testing it non-stop
to make sure it's absolutely perfect
we've all hosted our own parties and
wowed our friends and family with the
incredible flavours we created and now
we are coming to you Kickstarter we are
here to bring you Alka mix before anyone
else we're looking for the pioneers the
experimenter is the rebels who share our
passion for the new and undiscovered
we've done our part now it's your turn
pre-order Alka mix today and elevate
your cocktail experience</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
