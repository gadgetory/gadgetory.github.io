in search of the freshest air with wind
she doesn't have to anymore wind is the
world's first personal air quality
system that generates fresh and clean
air that's portable and is simple to use
its built-in sensor monitors the air
quality around lily and adjusts its
power to filter more or less wind helps
Lily keep the air around her clean and
fresh even when she's traveling wind
works by creating a bubble of healthy
air around it dirty air is drawn in by
vents pulled through a medical grade air
filter and clean air is propelled out of
the top wind can filter things like
allergens dust pet dander smoke pretty
much anything except that Lily can
adjust the amount of clean air wind
releases by simply twisting the wind app
allows Lily to check the quality of the
air around her gain insight about the
air she's filtered and check the air
quality of her friends and family win
knows when Lily's filter is used up and
can automatically ship a replacement
filter to her home and the air quality
tracker can even detach to keep Lily
aware of the air she's breathing while
she's on the go wind blends seamlessly
into Lily's life allowing her to breathe
easy no matter where life takes her what
we breathe matters we all have
experiences or know of loved ones who
have been affected by poor air quality
whether that's from allergens germs
smoke or industrial pollution I founded
wind because I've watched for too many
years as my relatives in Beijing
suffered from poor air quality the air
problem goes way beyond China and we
want to enable everyone no matter where
they live or where life takes them to
enjoy a healthy air environment wind is
designed not just to clean the air but
also understand the environment
that can proactively take care of any
problems and to do both wherever the
user goes past 18 months we've been
working hard with an amazing team of
engineers scientists and designers to
bring wind to life today we're proud to
come to you to get your support so we
can launch the product spread the word
and grow the community thank you
you
from a very young age I got interested
in plants my dad was a botanist so he
wrote a lot about plants and worked in a
botanical garden and as a kid I would
look at plants in and see them as like
many universes and there's so much we
don't know about plants about a year ago
I began exploring these concepts of
levitating plants and what's so cool
about magnetism is a force that we we
can't see but we can feel we're
levitating the plant from ground in
midair and rotating so that it gets
sunlight from all different directions
the idea of a plant not needing soil to
grow really fascinates me and that's
when I got interested in air plants air
plants are plants that grow from the air
they don't require any soil they they
literally take particles from the air
and get nutrients from them
I wanted to create an experience for
people in their homes where they can
enjoy plants but in a new way
houseplants don't always have to be the
same what happens if I levitate this
planet in the air will it grow
differently will grow more who knows
maybe we're going to discover a new way
of growing plants
you
your skin tells a story it's the story
of how you live your life outside
connected to the things that matter to
you but if your skin could ask for
something it would ask for protection
because there are over 1 million cases
of skin cancer per year in the united
states alone the problem with sunscreen
you can't see if it's actually
protecting you sunscreen is like an
invisible armor so how do you know if
it's worn off how do you know if you've
applied enough to protect your skin hi
I'm Dave founder and creator of
sunscreen sunscreen ur is a special
camera that shows you the UV rays that
sunscreen blocks when you look through
sun screener protected stand appears
dark unprotected skin appears lightly

water sand or sweat has worn away your
protection whether you just need a quick
look at your kids skin or you want to
check your own protection sunscreen ur
has you covered I love spending time
outside with my family but I've always
been concerned about skin damage my goal
in creating sunscreen er was to find an
easy way for my family to protect
ourselves while we enjoyed the outdoors
so I took technology that was previously
only accessible to scientists and made
it accessible to all of us sunscreen er
is easy to use waterproof and durable
it's smaller than a granola bar yet as
powerful as a multi-thousand dollar
camera it's perfect for everywhere the
beach the soccer field your favorite
fishing hole even the golf course and it
helps us protect our skin and our loved
ones from sun damage your skin story
should be about doing the things you
love protect it with sunscreen ur
electricity generated by hydropower
hydroelectricity the conversion of
sunlight into electricity solar power
the extraction of electrical power from
air for wind power all these methods are
