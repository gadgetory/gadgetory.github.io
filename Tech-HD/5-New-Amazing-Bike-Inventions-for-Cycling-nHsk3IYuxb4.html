know what to do with and while we love
our furry friends we don't always have
the time or energy to give them the
exercise they need introducing leash
bunny the safe way to bike with your dog
and give him the exercise he craves our
biggest concern was safety we needed to
make something strong enough that the
rider wouldn't get pulled off the bike
if the dog darts or stops we started
with stainless steel because it's
extremely durable and won't break if
jerked we then added a spring to absorb
the shock no matter how much stress was
put on it but we didn't stop there
we designed the bracket with plenty of
room to keep leash bunny out of the way
so you're free to pedal like normal
we even sourced a flexible leash to add
in some extra gift the combined approach
of leash and spring allow for maximum
shock absorption as your dog learns to
run or trot next to your side to use
simply introduce your dog to the leash
bunny and start by attaching to the bike
and then walking next to your bike after
10 to 15 minutes you'll get the hang of
it and you can begin riding take
frequent breaks until you get to know
your dog we even make it patio friendly
with anchor points built right into the
leash for easy tie ups when you decide
to stop or take a break no longer think
of walking your dog as a painstaking
task that will consume hours of your day

manufacturing partners ready to go and a
