hi my name is Alex and I believe this is
my third or fourth project on
Kickstarter this is one of the ones that
I spent a lot of time on it and I
believe it has merit
I want to tap into the EDC market which
is everyday carry so I created this
survival multi-tool which I call Nomad
like I said it's a survival multi-tool
and everyday carry it's composed of 3d
printed parts sandwich by a back and
front stainless steel plates that are
laser-cut they're attached all together
with stainless steel rivets to endure
rust and oxidation has many features a
carabiner clip a bottle opener with dual
function it's a bottle opener and a
wrench at the same time it has a compass
it has a blade momentary flashlight for
emergencies ferrocerium rod it has a
split ring to hang keys or any other
things you might want to hang to it on
the other side you'll find a scraper
that slides out the scraper itself it's
a mini tool that has a quarter inch bit
adapter it has three different size not
adapters ranging from small medium and
large
it also can serve as a flathead
screwdriver goes back in place when you
need to start a fire you basically
swivel out your ferrocerium rod take
your scraper out scrape scrape spark
spark and you start a fire when you're
done you close it turn it around put
your key back in place your scraper and
you're done like I said has a carabiner
where you can hang it in any belt loop
backpack or wherever you want to hang
this to it

multi-tool has many functions and this
