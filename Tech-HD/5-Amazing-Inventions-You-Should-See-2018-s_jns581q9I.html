what small things would you carry it was
easier to carry them more importantly
what problems could you solve if you
were prepared with a few key items
we're lever gear we designed tools that
are easy to carry multifunctional and
built to last so you can get stuff done
so when we set out to design a tool to
carry small things there was no way we
were settling from ordinary pillbox
introducing the clip system a series of
tough versatile tools designed to clip
easily on your keychain and fit great in
your hand first up is the pitfall a
micro carry case that's far from
ordinary pockets and bags aren't
designed to carry small items they get
lost dirty or even destroyed existing
keychain pill boxes are almost always
cylinders we get it they're easy to make
and cheap to produce but they don't fit
well with your keys and they're either
too small to hold anything or too big to
carry around our first insight was to
flatten the canister so it nests on your
keychain but still has the internal
space to carry a wide range of small
objects the cat mounted tray helps you
access and organize your items dual
magnetic hex bit sockets transform the
bit vault into a small yet powerful
screwdriver just carry the bits you need
and you're always ready the custom
gasket seals the bit vault tight and
quick release clips lock the lid in
place the bit light maintains all of the
functionality of the pitfall that adds a
bright rechargeable flash it's perfect
for quick access to light when you need
it most
there are three brightness levels for
when you need a lot of light or just a
little it recharges with any USB source
so you never need to buy batteries as we
developed a clip system we quickly
realized that we didn't want it
permanently attached to our keychain so
we added a carabiner style clip for easy
attachment the screw on belt clip
provides quick access to your tools
and doubles as a key hook or a third
hand we designed the container but you
make it the product you want whether
you're a cyclist and need a few bits for
a long bike ride or you're heading out
on a first date or maybe you just want
to be prepared for whatever the day may
throw at you carry what you need and
leave the rest at home
just clip it and you're ready for your
next adventure hey Kickstarter we've
been developing the clip system for over
a year it's an obsessive drive to create
the best small carry cases on the market
we've been designing testing and pushing
the limits of engineering and
manufacturing to create a product with
maximum functionality in a tiny easy to
carry tool now we're ready to make the
bit light and the bit vault a reality
and we need your help to get the
manufacturing lines up and running we've
built this company with the support and
enthusiasm of our backers and with your
help we can continue our mission
empowering you to get stuff done you can
help us by supporting our campaign and
also sharing it with anyone you know who
could use a better way to carry small
stuff we've had a lot of fun thinking of
small items we could carry in these
products we'd love to hear what you'd
like to carry in the comments below
