excuse me
I don't know how to buy this ticket
it's very karaoke near here
take me to Los Angeles
it cost less to keep my home warm by
including for items rather than warming
it up with a heater heating has always
been regarded as a damp utility some
people may have chemists at in their
home but after programming it once most
forget about it and never touch it again
this made us realized that a thermostat
is a widely unloved product and we
decided to change it
so we tried out different prototypes in
order to come up with the best design
the one is simple elegant and practical
we presented our first prototypes to the
people and asked for their feedback and
direction was wow what is it people find
it really fresh
illusion consists of smartphone app for
iOS and Android devices central unit or
a bridge and services one for each room
so how it works the information about
desired temperature goes from smartphone
to central unit that disturbs the signal
to every room equipped with ecozy
thermostat you can SAP the precise
temperature for every room and eCos you
will remember it with ecozy there is no
need to hit up an empty home whenever
you are on the vacation or on a business
trip so you greatly save on your energy
bill EKOS a hidden solution installation
is so easy that you can do it on your
own the most responsible but let easy is
because a thermostat installation
approach your water radiator take off
the old terrorist possibly you would
need some additional instruments to do
this take one eco Zotero set out of your
starter kit and tightly attach it to
your water it need switch it on it
should find the eco as a central unit
that should be previously connected to
your Wi-Fi
now said the West temperature pressing
on the lab to set the temperature them
and on the right to heat it up once you
decided on the West temperature the
thermostat will remember it you can
change it end time manually or remotely
through the app now perceive two other
rooms and follow the same easy steps
the idea of intelligent thermostat is to
help users save energy and thus the
money through much smarter home heating
system the coolest thing about a cozy
and that it does exactly that
without compromising unfortune allottee
design or comfort finally thanks to
ecozy there's an intelligent solution a
solution which empowers the consumer
saves energy that looks real great a
truly modern solution for the modern
times
dear bakers we arrived in France to
bring a cosy into the mass production
user help we can make it much faster and
you can really help us to take a step
forward thank you so much for watching
this video and for supporting cozy
spread the word on social networks and
remember Headey home only using it
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
