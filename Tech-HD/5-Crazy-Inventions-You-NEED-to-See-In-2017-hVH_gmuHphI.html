hardware solution that turns your iPad
into a true wireless second display to
create a workspace that frees you
wherever you go
Luna delivers stunning image quality
with virtually zero egg turning your
iPad into a touch Mac that works over
Wi-Fi
Luna sets up in seconds and instantly
works with your existing Wi-Fi simply
plug it into any Mac USB C or
DisplayPort install the Luna app and
you're off and running
no antennas no waiting and no hassles we
developed Luna because we knew there was
a better solution than relying on
software to turn an iPad into a second
display software apps literally hack
your graphics card delivering a glitchy
and unreliable picture they trick your
Mac into thinking and displays attached
when in fact they get no benefit of
graphics acceleration or metal GPU
support
so unlike software apps Luna harnesses
the raw power of your graphics card
giving you the full benefit of its
graphics acceleration delivering
stunning second monitor that's 100
percent wire free in addition to acting
as a second display Luna also acts as a
complete extension to your Mac allowing
you to use it directly from your iPad
with full support using external
keyboards Apple pencil and Apple touch
interactions it literally allows you to
turn your MacBook or iMac into a
touchable device designed and developed
by the creators of Astro pad the
award-winning drawing app used by major
animation studios and product design
firm
you
you
introducing the arrow SmartWatch with a
360 rotatable camera with the camera
right on the bezel you can capture a
selfie in one moment
twist then shoot a video in the next and
since you always have a camera on hand
you can snap a quick photo and upload it
without breaking your day and who wants
to carry a phone all the time keep your
hands-free and snap amazing shots on the
go but capturing high quality video and
audio on a small device can be a big
challenge at arrow we've created a high
def camera and microphone that fits
within a tiny footprint making it easy
to capture any moment at any time and in
stunning detail
this is the world's first SmartWatch
with a 360 rotatable camera arrow
we've all seen this and the magnetic
charging cable that promises to change
your life we've all bought one only to
find out that it fails to do what it
promises and most certainly never lives
up to its own hype
but that's until we created Mac more the
perfectly engineered charging cable that
chose the game for your MacBook and
other devices mag Bowl is the future and
unlike other charging cables that uses a
unique l-shaped connector which takes
force directly away from the connection
point ensuring your cable gets
disconnected safely and that your
devices are safe from trip hazards and
other accidents the l-shaped connector
also ensures that your cable doesn't get
in your way when you are busy using your
phone and charging at the same time mad
bull mix charging simple quick and easy
with a perfectly balanced high-powered
magnet keeping your hands-free and
allowing your focus on the things that
matter most we even have a mag Bowl USBC
power cable a high-speed 2 meter
charging cable that guarantees your
MacBooks safety as well as your peace of
mind
our three-in-one cable is compatible
with all devices lightning Android and
even USB C meaning one cable for it
everything we wanted Magpul to be the
most durable cable on the market which
is why reinforced it with kevlar you
know that stuff they put in bulletproof
vests and even in the armor of military
vehicles meaning that when you aren't
charging your devices well you can use
it to pull a car
mad boy the only magnetic charging cable
you should are guaranteed shipping

Yanis I love taking naps on the couch
yes I do man and in the studio we have a
founder of a fantastic new concept that
makes nothing even more valuable shall
welcome great thing explain something
about this marvelous new concept well
that converts the energy into
electricity for recharging small
electronic devices okay can you tell
something more about it how does a must
charge your phone well the technology
used
it's called piezo electricity which
converts the vibration of the earth
displacement during your breathing into
electricity although it's very promising
we don't have enough technology yet to
generate enough power for a smart phone
but we can use it in different
applications such as pacemakers all
other devices priest watches a lot of
applications we can do well it's sounds
terrific
actually but would you recommend this
when running or sleeping well I think
both occasions are ok of it sleeping
you're generating less energy the
concept behind
Irina's it's also aiming to motivate
people for a more active lifestyle so if
you run you gonna generate more energy
that's ok now does it look like because
when you're running or at home with your
loved one does it spice up your love
life what should I just wear it when I'm
home alone well that's a pretty good
question actually
girlfriend is a geek and like sci-fi
movies I think it's very good thanks for
being here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
