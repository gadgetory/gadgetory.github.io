hi guys my name is Alex I'm co-founder
of next thing I'm holding a phone case
that will change your life next pack is
a modular smartphone case that allows
you to customize your phone to do more
than to allow you to do more with your
phone how does it work
slide your phone into the next pack case
add some modules access the app and
enjoy the unique features in each module
provides we've already created 12
modules to get you going and there's
more to come
the next pack is the first phone case
that allows you to switch Hardware
between Android and Apple devices this
means you can trade modules with friends
and family and experience the different
features each module provides if you do
choose to upgrade your phone all you'll
need to do is change your case and your
modules will always work with you from
the first idea it took us about two
years to arrive where we are now we were
originally inspired by brainstorming
cases that allowed you to add one new
feature to your phone and we thought why
not make one case that allows for many
features that you can customize for your
lifestyle we have an experienced team
with members spread across the world all
bonded together through our passion for
next pack we've been working around the
clock to collaborate on each other's
time zones and get our device to where
it is today what comes out of this
campaign is just the beginning we are
currently working on additional modules
for the near future
but even more importantly we are
building a community for developers to
thrive and meet the needs and wants of
next pack users think about an app store
for modules that can enhance your phone
whenever we show it to someone we get
some crazy ideas for future modules what
about a tiny lipgloss or a little blush
night vision camera 3d camera walkie
talkies to talk with your friends per
box a fingerprint scanner a game
controller a baby monitor a light
detector for my boyfriend you see this
really is just the beginning we need
your help to fund an X pack to bring it
to you but more importantly we need your
ideas to call the future of the next
pack so if you're as excited about next
because we are pledge today pledge today
there's a gazillion things on the market
that say they'll tune your guitar
I just tried this out and this thing
really really works this thing can get
deaf and get you right on money I'm a
fan really cool little product I love it
can operate without the smartphone but
with the smartphone it's even more
intelligent I really love it I think
this is this is the stuff flying concept
it's fantastic because I actually played
12 string guitars you know how bloody
difficult it is to keep a 12 string in
tune this is come along at the end of my
career
thank you you will this device actually
tunes the guitar for you of course not
just a demonstration this is one of the
first things I've seen that is sort of
shockingly cool not only does it do what
it says it's supposed to do but offers
like crazy amount of new features that I
hadn't even actually thought of you're
gonna love it
America first but you know can we just
say roadie tube second four years ago we
invented the award-winning roadie tuner
and helped tune more than 2 million
strings today we're proud to introduce
roadie to &amp;amp; Rohde bass to use rhodium

on the peg and pluck
just like that you're in tune and ready
to play roadie 2 is the world's first
stand-alone automatic guitar tuner each

most-used alternate and open tunings
even in noisy environments roadies
built-in vibration detection allows you
to tune perfectly it makes getting in
tune faster and easier than ever before
and this makes roadie the most versatile
tool that you can put in your kit bag
for bass players roadie bass sports an
even stronger motor bigger battery and
special programming to let it handle low
frequencies it's not just a tuner the
optional mobile app can be used to
create custom tunings custom instruments
