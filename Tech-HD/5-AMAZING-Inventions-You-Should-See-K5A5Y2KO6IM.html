finding the right shape where can be a
challenge some women wear two pairs just
to get the results they're looking for
while others complain that even a single
pair squeezes their ribcage so hard that
it's difficult to breathe
how can a product be too strong and too
weak at the same time it's because all
shapewear products have the same flaw
they squeeze uniformly rather than
targeting each part of your body with
just the right amount of compression
introducing sculpt wear a smarter
shapewear alternative that
differentiates between areas where we
want support in areas where we need to
be comfortable this is achieved with
targeted panels that have specific
directional fibers creating the optimal
combination of smooth compression and
soft release wondering how it works
sculpt wear smoothes the abdomen with
stretch crisscross panels that gently
create a flatter appearance and a
smoother drape to fitted dresses and
shirts
unlike shapewear sculpt where never
rolls down flexible structures and the
side seams keep the garment in place
ensuring the best performance and adding
support for your posture our
patent-pending boost bands provide
gentle compression through the upper
thighs and boost your buns giving you
that fit and lifted feeling in your
favorite clothes still using the old
fashioned way to measure sizes and
distances measuring by yourself
is always difficult
you get all sweaty it's hard to know how
to do it right either way it can be a
waste of time and effort feeling
frustrated and bothered now you have a
better measuring choice the eye pins
spatial ruler run the eye pin spatial
ruler app plug the eye pin spatial ruler
into the iPhone headphone jack then you
can easily measure spatial dimensions of
course you can save the measuring
results and also instantly share them
it makes the discussions between you and
your designers or even your mates easier
never again worry about picking the
wrong size of furniture snap the
furniture you like and get its size for
the IP and spatial ruler app
you'll know if it fits your home right
away
you can edit the same places in
different times and spaces which saves
you time make furnishing easy and with
no more mistakes create lovely and
comfortable living spaces on your own</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
