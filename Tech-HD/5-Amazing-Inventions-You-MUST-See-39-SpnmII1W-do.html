you
you
you
we were properly hydrated we feel better
think better look better we just are
better level is not just another fitness
tracker it is the first and only
wearable to measure your hydration
letting you know precisely how much
water you need to feel and perform your
best level also measures your heart rate
slave quality calories activity and mood
and can integrate all of that
information to show you what kind of
improvements you can see both in your
sleep and during exercise almost all of
us at some point during the day are
dehydrated and those little gaps and
staying up when your hydration needs
have consequences you could lose
concentration and could have an effect
on your mood it could affect your sleep
when you first wake up in the morning
your first thing should be to go grab a
glass water you'll find it may be only
as much coffee and you definitely won't
need as much food water will level set
actually just how hungry you are so it
prevents overeating by drinking more
water you suddenly have more energy what
do you have more energy for working out
and when you're working out you have
better endurance your joints and your
muscles don't hurt as much and you don't
feel as much pain the effect of that
workout is continuing on throughout the
day you're wearing more calories now
that you've done the work out studies
have shown if you were hydrated
throughout the day it's better for you
sleep and you're going to be more rest
in so you have to see all of this as
part of a whole what I like about level
is it gives you the data and says this
is how much you need to get balanced in
life level was designed for twenty four
seven where and can learn your activity
and hydration habits not only trending
them but identifying patterns that are
keeping you from your best
most consumer wearable devices can only
measure a fraction of the metrics that
are important to us so we focused on
research we turn to the world of medical
devices where accuracy and precision are
tightly monitored now we've developed a
revolutionary red light technology that
can look ten times deeper into the body
measuring 10 times when any other sensor
can all with industry-leading accuracy
we're excited to return to Kickstarter
with level our mission is to
revolutionize wearable health and
performance no matter if you live to
train or trying to live we can't wait to
see what you'll accomplish by measuring
what really matters
imagine not being able to use your hands
put your hands behind your back and try
to use your device how much would you
give to be able to use just one finger
right now to boost one is that one
finger there are many people all over
the world struggling every day to use
their hands due to illness or accidents
this makes it really difficult to use
modern technology solutions such as
smartphones or tablets so which one
consists of a mouthpiece and a tube
inside the tube is a function that is
activated by a single blow from your
mouth this function works just like a
finger on touchpad devices it's very
easy to use to push one you simply grab
the mouthpiece with your mouth and have
some air into the tube to activate the
function because you use so little air
from your mouth to activate it you can
easily use to boost one several hours a
day we've tested it on users and we're
getting extremely good responses but we
need your help to make it widely
available for everyone help fund to
boost one so you can make a difference
for people who can't use their arms and
hands
