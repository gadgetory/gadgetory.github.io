think better look better
we just are better level is not just
another fitness tracker it is the first
and only wearable to measure your
hydration letting you know precisely how
much water you need to feel and perform
your best level also measures your heart
rate sleep quality calories activity and
mood and can integrate all of that
information to show you what kind of
improvements you can see both in your
sleep and during exercise almost all of
us at some point during the day are
dehydrated and those little Ghats and
staying up when your hydration needs
have consequences
you could lose concentration and could
have an effect on your mood it could
affect your sleep when you first wake up
in the morning your first thing should
be to go grab a glass of water you'll
find that maybe you don't need as much
coffee and you definitely won't need as
much food water will level set actually
just how hungry you are so it prevents
over anything by drinking more water you
suddenly have more energy what do you
have more energy for working out and
when you're working out you have better
endurance your joints and your muscles
don't hurt as much and you don't feel as
much pain The effect of that workout is
continuing on throughout the day you're
wearing more calories now that you've
done the workout
studies have shown if you were hydrated
throughout the day it's better for your
sleep and you're going to be more rested
so you have to see all of this as part
of a whole what I like about level is it
gives you the data and says this is how
much you need to get balanced in life
level was designed for 24/7 wear and can
learn your activity and hydration habits
not only trending them but identifying
patterns that are keeping you from your
best
most consumer wearable devices can only
measure a fraction of the metrics that
are important to us so we focused on
research we turn to the world of medical
devices where accuracy and precision are
tightly monitored
now we've developed a revolutionary red
light technology that can look 10 times
deeper into the body measuring 10 times
what any other sensor can all with
industry-leading accuracy we're excited
to return to Kickstarter with level our
mission is to revolutionize wearable
health and performance no matter if you
live to train or train to live we can't
wait to see what you'll accomplish by
measuring what really matters
imagine not being able to use your hands
put your hands behind your back and try
to use your device how much would you
give to be able to use just one finger
right now to boost one is that one
finger there are many people all over
the world struggling every day to use
their hands due to illness or accidents
this makes it really difficult to use
modern technology solutions such as
smartphones or tablets
so which one consists of a mouthpiece
and a tube inside the tube there's a
function that is activated by a single
blow from your mouth this function works
just like a finger on touchpad devices
it's very easy to use to push one you
simply grab the mouthpiece with your
mouth and have some air into the tube to
activate the function because you use so
little air from your mouth to activate
it you can easily use tubes once several
hours a day we've tested it on users and
we're getting extremely good responses
but we need your help to make it widely
available for everyone help fund two
plus one so you can make a difference
for people who can't use their arms and
hands
you
so many people these days spend their
entire workday looking at computer
monitors our eyes are tired and hurt
leading to visual dysfunction our eyes
are designed for active movement and
looking into the distance but when you
look at a computer you focus on small
letters on a monitor and this strains
the eyes existing eye problems can
worsen and lead to very serious
conditions like retinal detachment or
even blindness after two years of
development based on scientific research
we are proud to introduce our unique eye
relaxing glasses eight seconds is the
only system designed to relax the I
gently shimmering lamps at the edges
enable the eyes to quickly in actively
move to the sides and especially

compensate for defects like ordinary
glasses our glasses interact with the
internal eye muscles and instantly
relieve stress and high fatigue pain in
