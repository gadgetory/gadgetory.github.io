worry you'll come back to find it's been
damaged broken into towed away or even
stolen are you ever concerned about your
loved ones while they're out on the road

break-ins and assaults across the u.s.
what if you were able to receive an
instant notification on your smartphone
if any of those things were to happen
and at the same time receive a video of
the event as it's occurring now imagine
if you are able to prevent these things
from even happening what would that
peace of mind be worth to you

the auto I the first app that uses new
smart camera technology that instantly
connects users to their automobiles our

impact occurs and 15 seconds after as
well it then immediately uploads the
video to our secure cloud server and
syncs the auto eye to your smartphone

ever wonder what you noticed most people
driving a luxury car around town what
people notice the most is the head-up
display inside of these high-end cars
you know those futuristic little screens
that show your speed and navigation and
your field of vision not only are they
super cool but they actually make your
ride safer and more comfortable the
problem is you have to shell out
thousands if not tens of thousands of
dollars for a car installed but what if
there is a way to get that high-end
experience but note the high-end price
head introducing putter it's a
simple automotive accessory you put on
your dashboard that uses the smart phone

affordable heads-up display utter
fireworks with literally any car just
place it on your dashboard download our
sister out not me place it on the cradle
and start driving having a special
coating means you can use it in any
light any time of day you can keep your
eyes on the road at all times
thanks to Natalie how do I protect a
beautiful UI with full voice guy to turn

speed limit of the road you're currently
driving on projecting in front of your
eyes making it way easier to avoid those
pests
and your Hut if I automatically alerts
you when the red-light cameras coming up
unlike maps on your phone you can even
download a whole country map ahead of
time and navigate a hundred percent
offline using satellite no internet
signal required so you can always count
on it no matter where you go and if you
want to use another navigation app you
can modify supports any HUD design back
we think everyone should have the
opportunity to have a safer driving
experience that's why we are making it
available to the Kickstarter community
by getting everyone to pledge and bulk
upfront we can get a volume discount and
invest in better production which means
a better product for everyone this
ultimate means is that we can offer it
for less than $50 to our kickstart
backers and you can have a safe and
futuristic and navigation experience so
what are you waiting for let's how to
buy your car
we know that more than 45% of traffic
accidents happen at night and are mainly
figures of the failure the Laughlin card
to flight are managed automatically by
the powerful intelligent system when two
cars meet the intelligent system
automatically monitors the luminous
efficacy to ensure safety the
intelligent system automatically
monitors the land temperature and can
reduce the power or turn off the car top
light as the temperature rises when a
vehicle breaks down you can turn down
the brush flash function when a battery
voltage is lower than eleven point five
volt the lamp will automatically reduce
the power but when the voltage gets to
11 volt the lights will automatically
shut down the user is free to choose
from low lightest draw light through the
remote control the radiation distance of
loaf of the car top light is more than
1,000 meters which is a wider range of
illumination and can help the driver to
find the danger ahead of time
laughing car top light is to guard and
partner for your trip
every day 80% of Americans driving on
our roads can't see behind them when
they're parking so we decided to look
into why more people didn't have parking
sensor solutions available on their car
and what we found was that it was too
expensive or is much too difficult to
install you practically had to be a car
guide to install it herself so we made
the world's simplest and easiest
solution yet to hit the market
introducing bent cents the world's first
smart parking device
the embedded ultrasonic sensors can
detect any object within three meters of
the car's front or back blind spots we
use an accelerometer detect when the car
is backing up and then use bluetooth to
automatically launch the app on the
drivers phone we've designed a
completely seamless experience that
requires no interaction on behalf of the
driver the device itself installs in
less than five minutes with absolutely
no wiring and only four security screws
to prevent that it's so easy
your grandma can do it
the device itself knows when your car's
backing up and immediately launches the
app on the drivers home cladding
audio-visual and vibration alerts for
objects and your client spots
so what did you do when you find
yourself stuck in the snow putting on
chains is dirty and slow you try and
push but still no go and it's so
expensive to get a tow don't worry just
go to the trunk for your trusty zip rip
and go and get where you need to go
got the back wheel here blocked as you
can see go ahead
I mean you're already like a foot down
good job keep going still on there you
go
still on brother I mean it's eight-inch
down
Mini's out of there
