world's first smart camera to defy
gravity the unique stabilized levitation
technology coupled with advanced
wireless resonant charging capability
allows the moon by one ring to not only
endlessly levitate above its stand but
noise ously rotate in any direction with
a simple swipe of your finger
leaving no spot unnoticed we have
equipped the camera with the latest
generation Full HD c mo sensor with a
pixel area much larger than that of any
ordinary home security solutions
combined with a bright wide angle lens
the moon by one ring captures
considerably more light than an average
home monitor camera resulting in
incredibly crisp and clear images even
in dimly lit conditions - built in
precision microphones on each side of
the lens automatically detect the
direction of incoming sound and adjust
the cameras field of view accordingly
making sure it captures every moment we
have also integrated a high quality
loudspeaker and an additional third
microphone for HD noise cancellation so
you will not only see and hear what
happens around the camera but can also
communicate making the moon by one ring
a natural choice for video calls both at
your home and in your office for over
two years our team has been dedicated to
designing the moon with a single goal in
mind to create the most advanced and
versatile smart home solution in the
world to achieve this we have opted to
combine the major home automation
standards of z-wave ZigBee and Bluetooth
smart with a beautiful easy to use and
feature-rich camera giving you an
unparalleled flexibility in building or
expanding your very own smart home or
office the moon by one ring has
temperature humidity co2 and light
sensor integrations so it will not only
notify you whenever it's a good time to
let in some fresh air or turn on the
air-conditioner but it can share this
information with other smart home
devices
additionally thanks to its integrated IR
blaster the moon by one ring can also
control your legacy appliances like the
air-conditioner stereo system or
television integrating them into your
personal internet of things all of the
crucial electronic components are
integrated directly into the camera so
you can also use it independently from
the base unit the built-in battery
enables up to five hours of autonomous
operation while the USB type-c port
makes charging on-the-go fast and
convenient we've engineered the moon by
one ring as the most sophisticated smart
camera for your home and office support
our project and make the dream of a
truly flexible and easy to use smart
home come one step closer
damn that's smooth it's really just the
fact that you can just throw a camera in
between these little spots and crack so
you've never been able to do before
it's insane priceless really hi I'm
Andrea from viral where we aim to make
the impossible film shop possible
introducing the next generation cable
cam we enable easy filming in places
even drones can't go
this is the viral light the first-ever
portable and easy to use cable count the
light kit is the perfect extension to
your existing camera setup the viral
light is foldable making it easy to
carry with you in a backpack and with
the intuitive mounting system it can be
set up in less than three minutes we
wanted to create something that will
make people go wow how did they do that
when they saw the video going through
windows through cars really Packwood's
or other places where you would never
imagine flying a camera but at the same
time keep it so simple that anyone can
use it
even though it's the first time
operating a cable cam you would
definitely be successful
the viral light goes faster to follow
the action of high speed and slow enough
to capture the perfect time-lapse shot
and the battery will it last up to three
hours with lights indicating how much
you have left
that is so cool exactly the tools that
we needed in the sport it takes less
than a minute setup and your way to go
get the bangin shots just like the pros
with our background from arranging and
filming extreme sport events and
festivals we have seen that more and
more filmmakers from beginner to pro
level are seeking new angles when
capturing their most extreme and
memorable moments on video that's why we
wanted to make viral light available for
everyone and compatible with any camera
and stabilizer up to three point three
pops have to admit the first few times I
used it I got a little bit carried away
of the speed and it was gonna go as fast
as it did which is pretty damn far it
always came back up and kept asking for
more even shooting films professionally
for about seven years and I've never
seen a product I can do that
with our strong team of engineers
filmmakers and athletes we're bringing
this product to life here on Kickstarter
we've iterated and tested the product
with lead users from all over the world
and the product is now ready for
manufacturing but we need your help to
press play on production back us today
and you can start to be creative with
your filmmakers and to make that
impossible shot possible
you
here we go
hi kids Dada we're the team behind
garden space like you we've all tried
and failed at growing our very own
vegetables at home so we decided to
create garden space a robotics smart
camera that helps you grow food at home
food is a huge part of our lives can we
all want it to be fresher and better
tasting and as you've heard from friends
and neighbors the freshest best-tasting
food is that which we grow in our very
own backyards lucky for you and you're
in a farmer garden space is air to help
garden spaces smart camera monitors
waters and protects your garden for a
three pronged approach to food growing
grapes
allowing aspiring and experienced
growers like yourself to enjoy the full
payoff and benefit of growing first
there's the monitoring garden space has
a unique 360-degree camera that monitors
information on plant health and growth
rates so you know exactly what's
happening in your garden and because
it's done by a camera it can look over
the your entire garden no matter its
shape or layer all you have to do is
follow the planting guide on our mobile
application or simply tell garden space
what you've planted the second thing
garden space takes care of is watering
garden space knows what you're growing
as well as the weather and using a
thermal sensor the water stress of your
plants so it knows exactly how much
water each plant needs and then
automatically waters them for you no
more worrying about if you're under or
over watering the third thing garden
space does is protect your garden
sensing when uninvited guests sneak into
your garden for a midnight snack

hi I'm fen and I'm Joel and we believe
that everyone can make music music is an
incredibly creative outlet so we at
vendor music are rethinking musical
instruments so everyone can easily and
affordably play music the vendor es1 is
an electronic saxophone simply turn it
on place your fingers on the paths blow
into the mouthpiece and you'll be making
music in no time the inspiration behind
the wind or es1 started when my son
Andrew wanted to play music he started
on the clarinet but kept making terrible
squeaks and squawks and was very
self-conscious about making mistakes
after about a month he gave up playing
music entirely so I thought to myself
you know there's got to be a better way
the VIN Dori s1 is excellent for both
teaching and practicing sound this
instrument is so many things more easily
than a traditional saxophone flute or
clarinet it takes almost no effort to
play the right note it also has really
cool built-in sounds that are both fun
and engaging for kids and more advanced
users this instrument has all the right
features and is in the right price range
for me to recommend it to all of my
students and peers
anyone can play the vendor is one right
out of the box with a vendor es1 you can
play with anyone you can play with
friends with your family or even start
your own band the skills learned on the
vendor s1 will translate directly to a
saxophone clarinet or any other
woodwinds
it will help you expand your creative
endless and express yourself musically
the wind or es1 uses the same fingerings
as a saxophone clarinet or flute it has
a headphone jack so you can practice in
peace without bothering your parents
roommates or neighbors you can also plug
it into an app although it has its own
built-in sound you can connect the es1
to your computer and make it sound like
anything you want like a piano a drumset
or even a cat's meow it also uses a
rechargeable battery so you can take it
and play it anywhere we want to make
playing an instrument affordable and
accessible to everyone
so we're asking for your help to make
the vendor es1 a reality we've done all
the engineering we have working models
and used by students and musicians now
we need the funds to manufacture the es1
and bring it to market we believe that
everyone can play a musical instrument
join us and help us make music more
accessible by sharing this message and
making a pledge</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
