domestic security device that will
change the concept about water safety
measures one up makes it easier for you
to be part of the solution by making
water safety simple and preventing
accidents because it inflates on water
contact you can use it in two different
ways you can throw it easily and safely
from long distances or you can directly
enter the water with one up and swim to
the rescue zone if
when you purchase one up you'll receive
the self inflating reusable float a
carabiner for added convenience a

the world's smartest makeup organizer
and ultraviolet cleaner brushing is a
portable battery-powered device that
lets you neatly store up to 15 brushes
at a time while reading them of 99.9% of
their bacteria thanks to built in
ultraviolet lights simply place your
brushes inside Roisin close the lid and
the UV lights automatically turn on for
a 5-minute cleaning the white light
indicates that 4 sheen is on and the UV
lights are activated while the red light
indicates it's time to charge machine
you can even store accessories in the
bevel on top which also doubles as a
dust cover to keep your brushes fresh
and ready to use every day kübra sheen
is the perfect companion for your busy
morning routine because it not only
keeps things organized but it helps your
brushes stay fresh with just the push of
a button storing brushes in a
traditional makeup bag or leaving them
on the counter exponentially increases
the amount of dust particles and
bacteria living on your brushes even
with moderate usage your brushes
accumulate skin related infections that
left unchecked provide a breeding ground
for germs and while you should regularly
wash your brushes with water to remove
the visible signs of usage this isn't
enough to keep your brushes clean for
daily use
that's why machine targets the particles
and bacteria not visible to the naked
eye the UV lights and Roisin are a
hundred percent safe to use and can be
found in professional makeup sets around
the world and with the built-in timer
you never have to worry about turning it
off simply polish your look place your
brushes and brushing and it does the
rest and now we're incredibly excited to
bring Roisin to life with your help

molded and we're really excited to be
brushing to life with their help with
years of experience in product
manufacturing we're ready to make
brushing up our order everyday makeup
routine and we can thank you guys enough
for supporting us on this journey ahead
Roisin makeup made fresh in the 50s the
basic t-shirt Rocha like carnac Heights
becoming one of the most timeless
fashion garments in the world with while
technology is all around us
the t-shirt is still made in the same
old-school way unprotected cotton gets
dirty and smelly easily we want to
create clothing that is made for an
action-packed life if great technology
is all around us why not use it to make
t-shirts that repel stains smell and
body odor at leftwards we create
garments engineered to last a lifetime
we use seven unique treatments to create
the most advanced garments in Europe
developed in Switzerland produced in
Portugal and designed right here next on
our journey started last year when our
dress shirt became the most Beck's Dutch
special project in kickstarter history
since then we clean our jobs and went
all-in on sourcing the greatest couple
technologies with a mission to make life
as easy as possible without compromising
on the quality and design it took us one
year to get a t-shirt right look we're
finally ready the outside repels liquids
in the earth at the same time the inside
absorbs fluids and wicks away moisture
so you sweat a bath right through the
fabric we also added silver particles to
the yarn so that bacteria is killed
before it turns into body odor our milk
in Portugal only uses 100% soft long
staple cotton and together with our
designer we use data from 67 thousand
men to design the perfect fit to us it
represents the perfect marriage between
style and performance be free to buy as
fast as you want without worrying about
body odor present big plans to achieve
without worrying about sweat stains
visible sweat stains become a thing of
the past
and when the glove is going off on a
Tuesday we guarantee the bishop will
party harder than you do and still be
friends anymore
being on Kickstarter one year ago truly
changed her life back then we work from
our living room
now we've sold 5000 shirts and we have a
lovely office in a red light district of
Amsterdam it's time to watch nest buy
less and wear more we are still young
startup and need your help please backer
campaign today and help us create the
most innovative garments in the world
hey I'm Alex founder of music towel I
would like to introduce you to the
smartest softest and most durable towel
ever made mizu combines world-famous
Indian cotton with pure silver -
naturally eliminate bacterial growth
thus eliminating that musty towel smell
once and for all
this works because silver naturally
carries a positive charge upon contact
with bacteria silver strips an electron
from the bacteria's membrane preventing
its reproduction and destroying it but
what about other non bacterial
contaminants that could be harmful to
your skin and your health well if you're
like me you'll do anything to stop from
getting sick what most people don't
realize however is that towels can get
dangerously contaminated when we shower
cleaner faces or wiper hands oil sweat
and residual soaps contaminate our
towels and they don't get removed unless
it's washed meanwhile your towel gets
laced with more and more contaminants we
don't see this happening because micro
stains cannot be seen with the naked eye
in response we created music a smart
self-cleaning towel with contaminate
detecting technology when mizu sensing
areas get contaminated by oils sweat
residual soaps or bacterial metabolites
the color changes from blue to red to
remind you when the towel needs to be
cleaned the color change is due to a
special dye made from a unique blend of
natural plant extracts mizu is made off
the back of quality components xinchang
cotton has excellent water absorbency
while still remaining light and airy
each of these towels also has a twisted
yarn weave which minimises dry time
promotes the circulation of oxygen and
also remains ultra soft and comfortable
Mizzou is Japanese for water and water
is very important in the creation of a
towel
EEMA Bari Japan is the towel making
capital of the world
and their secret to success is metal
free soft water
we use the same soft water in our
production process to give me zoo a
luxurious softness and luscious
absorbency Mizzou is also easy to clean
just place it into your regular wash the
color will reset back to blue and the
cotton quality will unlock and get
softer over time lastly we have a
message to the Kickstarter community
that is tired of being let down by
project creators Mizzou's prototype was
loved by thousands of our trusting
backers at the beginning of this year
back in Asia
unlike many crowdfunding campaigns were
prepared to fulfill our backers orders
mere weeks after completion of the
campaign
that's because Mizzou towel is a
completed real product that we have
painstakingly concept tested prototype
and perfected for your homes and
Families your pledge as a backer will be
used to secure our first minimum order
quantity of Mizzou towels back us today
on Kickstarter and get your hands on the
world's first self-cleaning and
contaminant detecting towel at an
unbeatable price will not be able to
offer in the future thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
