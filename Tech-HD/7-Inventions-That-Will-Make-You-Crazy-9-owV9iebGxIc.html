noise cancellation that detects the
unwanted snoring sound and generates a

sulfites are an essential preservative
in winemaking
they're the reason we can enjoy wines
from all over the world because without
sulfites the wine would never have
survived the trip from the vineyard to
your glass but when you're ready to
drink the wine that job is done so
removing sulfides with Bulo lets you
bring the wine back to its original
state as if you were drinking it right
at the vineyard
this is how Allah works you pour your
wine through and the sulfides are
retained on a filter material while
everything else in the wine just flows
right past completely unaffected that
selective sulfite capture and it's
important because we want to maintain
the original taste and character of the
wine and only remove that one thing
sulfides
we know that aeration can be really
important for line for red wines in
particular it boosts the flavors that
are already there but we know it's not
as necessary for white wines so willow
had to have the option of turning the
aerator on or off wine is unique because
it works in so many different settings
we can drink it socially we can have a
glass by ourselves we knew that and
designed Bulo to integrate into a glass
carafe or decanter if you're serving an
entire bottle but if you're looking to
have just a single glass for yourself it
rests on top of your wine glass as well
when developing gulo we've worked
together to make sure that
lulo always preserves the integrity the
character and the flavor of any wine
I didn't doubt that it was possible I
did doubt whether it could be done
without hurting the life but now those a
reality we can take sulfides out of
wines the first product to do that and
it's a risk I'm glad I took
we're introducing a new concept of

my name is Mallory Smith I'm a beach
volleyball player and recent Stanford
grad has a degree in human biology while
I was there I had the chance to learn
from dr. Craig Keller and dr. Dennis
kromm
in 2003 the Department of Defense
through DARPA commissioned dr. Heller
and dr. Graham to find a solution to the
overheating problem plaguing our
soldiers at home during training and in
the Middle East after extensive research
and years of testing they invented the
core control Pro model the first cooling
device to use the proprietary r-tx
technology the patented r-tx technology
cools your body from the inside out
through the palm of your hand it safely
reduces your core temperature in just a
few minutes professional sports teams
health and weight loss experts industry
leaders fire departments and sports
medicine professionals were impressed by
the military success so they jumped on
board and began using core control Pro
to cool down and do more avek or is now
offering for the first time a consumer
version the new r-tx is portable and has
the same function as the core control
pro model but at a fraction of the cost
just build the r-tx with ice
insert your hands and flip the switch
cooling starts within seconds when
you're hot even before you start
sweating your body naturally cools off
by selectively radiating heat through
the palms of your hands
the r-tx turbocharges this natural
process cooling you up to five times
faster
whether you're exercising working
outdoors trying to lose weight living
through a heat wave or just plain hot
and sweaty
the r-tx lets you pull down like the
pros for the IndieGoGo community the new
consumer r-tx can be ordered for the
exclusive price of $249 more than thirty
five percent off the MSRP and seventy
five percent less than the pro model the
r-tx will usher its users into a new
world where overheating will not prevent
you from being cool and doing more
because sometimes being hot is just not
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
