every amazing creation begins with the
clash of two very different elements how
is glass created how do we get to see
beautiful rainbows how do you create a
peanut butter and jelly sandwich in our
case two life partners who love design
and Technology atera owns the design
house and David high tech entrepreneur
with lots of business travel mileage
this is their creation introducing
samsara
have you ever wondered about the future
of travel
imagine a future in which your luggage
is constructed from the same material as
airplanes super cars and yachts inspired
by leading manufacturing breakthroughs
we created the first aluminum alloy
smart suitcase we live in a world of
continuous movement creativity is
everywhere and we are no longer limited
by geographic boundaries
we developed a user-friendly mobile
application that connects two sensors
within the suitcase
these sensors notify you if the suitcase
leaves your presence or was opened out
of eyesight our application will also
allow you to control the LED light
within the suitcase which will assist
you in the dark
and monitor the battery life powering
your samsara the hardware will enable
you to charge your electronic devices
via a USB C cable it will also allow you
to charge your mobile device up to ten
times our team of engineers and
designers created our patented product
for maximum durability so your samsara
will endure the test of time our luggage
has a sleek ergonomic design with a flat
top that allows you to work and stay
connected no matter where you are our
unique wheel design maximizes packing
space and allows you to move
effortlessly across any surface
we thought of you our user while
designing this one-of-a-kind item that
links classic style with cutting-edge
technology imagine opening your suitcase
in finding your travel necessities built
into the product including convenient
packing bags toiletry bag garment bag
and even a compact gym bag if you
workout on your trip
we chose natural aviation aluminum to
keep the suitcase extremely lightweight
and strong for an easy journey samsaris
forward-looking creative team
collaborated to rethink the essence of
travel specifically for your needs
samsara means continuous movement and we
ask you to join us for this exciting
journey and support the creation of a
new and better way to travel
what do plants eat no spassky fruits and
seeds and some eat little insects why is
the sky blue when white light from the
Sun passes through our atmosphere the
blue and violet wavelengths are
scattered making the sky appear blue to
us hi I'm Sarah and this is my little
one
Ethan he's always curious about
everything and asked hundreds of
questions each day we want to encourage
his curiosity so we can explore and
learn more about the world so we invited
this cuddly little fuzzball into our
lives
meet Lu Bo an incredibly smart robot
powered by the most advanced interactive
technology woo bo is both playful and
goofy and thinks Ethan laughs all the
time a small team of graduates from MIT
and Harvard curates exciting things
about the world and shares them with
Ruvo so we've always liked a
knowledgeable and kid-friendly search
engine who not only answers questions it
also inspires Ethan to explore more
Bluebell creates an imaginary space to
experience different possibilities so
Ethan can be anyone and work on anything
no wonder Ethan asked me so much about
being a dragon trainer lately Lu Bo
always knows how to spend an independent
and creative afternoon so Ethan never
runs out of fun activities to choose
from sometimes where Bo helps take
Ethan's fun ideas one step further and
brings his imagination to life
whoo bo is always a patient friend who
helps even to make and create new things
sometimes when Ethan's friends come over
will Bo gets playful and invites
everyone to get up and move around
whether it's a whole afternoon playing
charades or a completely new idea
gooble always keeps up like a fluffy
partner in creativity that's only the
beginning of what whoa Bo has under all
that fur like a launch pad for learning
Weibo has more than 40 different skill
sets and since we bow is connected to
the Internet his skills are always fresh
and always growing I can also set up
daily routine reminders so in an
encouraging way whoo Bo turns routines
like brushing teeth and cleaning up into
engaging challenges and as Ethan starts
practicing these routines on his own he
always had someone sharing him on with
Wu Bo every morning is a blast and every
bedtime is a breeze and the stars were
blinking at us why the stars blinking at
us hey rube oh all right well good night
you two
here we go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
