this week we've got a unique take down
22 long-rifle survival gun by Henry
repeating arms its the AR 7 an AR as
those of you who have m16s no stands for
Armalite rifle and that's because this
rifle was first designed by Jean stoner
at Armalite and it was first released in
1959
now the AR 7 has gone through five
different manufacturers over that time
but today Henry brings it back in a form
that's probably as good or better than
it's ever been
it has some really unique features one
of which is the molded plastic stock
which is hollow and allows the entire
action to be broken down and put inside
it and then the stock itself is filled
with foam so that once everything is
sealed inside the gun actually floats so
you have a semi-automatic 22 long rifle
and the entire thing can be put inside
itself and made to float so that's a
pretty tall order for a survival gun and
it's always been kind of in a class by
itself as far as even takedown survival
guns go but there's usually you have the
two pieces and they have to be put into
a case but in this case the case is the
stock now even though the design is
fundamentally the same and in fact a lot
of the parts interchange the magazines
interchange across all those
manufacturers the Henry is a little
different in that it adds a few
refinements one of which is an extra
magazine storage compartment in the
buttstock so it can actually store
two magazines they do have to be removed
from the action so you can get the
action in two magazines inside and then
in the in the front the Henry adds a
bright orange front sight insert which
is a little easier to pick up through
the aperture rear sight the front sight
is adjustable somewhat for windage and
then the rear sight is adjustable for
windage and elevation also the Henry has
a slotted three-eighths with rail for
tip off or 22 style rings that can be
added to this gun now of course a scope
couldn't be stored in the buttstock so
you would have to carry that separately
but at least it can be added to this gun
so with the Henry AR 7 you have a very
self-contained a lightweight repeatable
in that semi-automatic 22 long-rifle
survival gun that can carry a few rounds
on board and it's so compact that it can
be put in any plane boat vehicle or
backpack for that matter and that really
puts it in a league of its own for more
guns of the week visit American Rifleman
