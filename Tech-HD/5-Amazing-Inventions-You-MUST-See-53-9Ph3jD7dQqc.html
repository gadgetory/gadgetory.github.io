Tiger power is a compact self-watering
rotatable garden power that can fit in
any home apartment or office Tiger tower
brings the joy and health benefits of
gardening
closer to home hi I'm daya and I'm Sarah
via father-and-son team who brought the
tiger tail to life so everyone could
enjoy fresh and organic produce grown at
home we used to live in the Maryland
countryside where gardening was an
important part of our daily life we grew
fresh fruits and vegetables in our
backyard and enjoyed the results in
every meal we loved their family
transfect garden together and always had
plenty of fresh and organic produce to
share with others all throughout the
year when we moved to the Bay Area we
had to say goodbye to our home garden we
quickly missed the joys and benefits of
having fresh produce so we began working
on what would become the title Tower
people who have been big cities have a
limited space so we knew we would have
to build up we began with the tower idea
to accommodate for gardening in
apartments offices or patios where
efficiency is key we also know that
people don't have a lot of extra free
time so we created a system that
automates a lot of the gardening work
and requires minimal daily attention we
built three layers of plant boxes to use
space and sunlight in the most efficient
way possible for even distribution of
sunlight we had a 360 degree rotation
which also allows you easy access to all
the plants for interior rooms we
included LED lights to deliver the best
spectrum of light for optimal plant
growth watering is very important but
easy to forget so we made the target our
self watering internal sensors can
detect when the soil is too dry and can
activate the included water pump to
distribute water to each plant box the
tiger tower can connect to regular
garden hoses to make refilling the
included water basin a breeze the
rotation watering and lighting can be
controlled manually or automatically
scheduled using the built-in motors and
sensors you can get as specific or
creative as you want through the target
our mobile app you can discover new
plant ideas or growing combinations from
others through the app you can even
download specific growing schedules for
your ideal mix of flowers or organic
produce and let the target our take care
of the rest
we begin the agenting to build a taiga
target number
types at each stage in the process we
include up on the design and the
features our prototype Towers have
demonstrated the value and joy of having
a compact home garden that requires a
minimal care we tested our design in
homes backyards and offices and it's
been a wonderful addition to every
setting we place today with the tiger
tower you can grow all the organic
produce you want for your family
regardless of where you live your pledge
gets you the photog entire system which
includes the tire on wheels with nine
full-sized play boxes water base and
pump LED full-spectrum lights
integrated sensors for water and light
control the taggert our mobile app and a
starter kit including seeds and planning
instructions after closing this campaign
and listening to your solutions we will
submit this model to be manufactured and
delivered to you next year
we're excited to share this project with
you and with your help we're even more
excited to make it a reality
Plus today to get your Tiger tower at a
Kickstarter discount and to bring the
amazing benefits of home gardening to
your family office or classroom got it
