going places can either be annoying or
really amazing we create solutions for
the leather over the past year we've
built something that we truly love and
we know you will too but call it the
start board thus our board tracks your
body's natural weight shifting simply
lean forward to accelerate no demote
needed the board's motion control system
is based on intelligent weight and
motion sensors you are the controller
the powerful jewel hub modus lets you
reach top speeds of 20 miles per hour
we designed a removable battery pack
that has 13 miles of range on a single
charge it contains the same with
themselves powering a Tesla range
anxiety no worries
the start bor√•s battery can be swapped
on the go but of course we want you to
be safe so we developed an intelligent
braking system that brings the stock
board to a full stop once you hop off it
also stops it from accidentally rolling
downhill we've been working on the stock
or for quite some time now many
sleepless nights of optimizing software
algorithms tweaking hardware features
and adjusting prototypes after a few
months of actual usage durability and
stress system the stock board is now
ready for production please support us
so you can get your very own stock board
at an unbeatable price
you
you
Carl and Emily like longboarding but
when you carrying it under your arm it
becomes a hassle so we took to the
streets and crafted something that
beginners to pro boarders love and
called it boredom
the patent-pending mechanism will
guarantee no 12 in wild codes or doing
tricks the Canadian maple deck and a
back seven bearings are reinforced with
an aircraft grade aluminum hinge capable
of supporting 400 pounds to keep your
hands safe the hinge has a built-in
protection apparatus board up only folds
into your hands when you press down on
the front nose of the longboard or it up
offers you the calm rush of surfing the
streets while easily storing in your bag
in your locker or your office now you
can fit it in and travel anywhere with
boredom do you like it like it I love it
we hope you all like it too
hi there let me see J well going to
school I kept seeing what my friends
were going through and wanted to make a
longboard that had that familiar feel
the same functionality but was a whole
lot more portable
that's when Ben showed me what he was
working on I travel quite a bit with my
son and I saw him with up and others
struggling with long boards and Airport
and buses so I wanted to build a him a
foldable studying room board that won't
pinch his fingers and want fold while
doing trick which is standard I'm not
very engineer with the extensive
manufacturing and the design experience
so I hit the joint board with feedback
from France amateur skateboarders and
professional skateboarders finally our
vision has become a reality
we already manufactured a small batch
that we've been testing out now we need
your support to scale production to ship
you a longboard you'll love it's going
to be an exciting ride so let's go board
up Florida the longboard that
stand-up as independently as you do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
