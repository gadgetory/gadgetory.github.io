Oh
you
I love exploring the world with my
little companion he watches me carefully
following my every command he's always
waiting for me to take him outside
he loves to travel with me he's always
curious to see what's around the next
corner and thanks to him my travels make
much more sense meets turtle my
four-wheeled friend
and me TAS we're a team of both
engineers and travelers for some time we
thought about a solution that could help
people just like us develop their
passion of creating and let them easily
share all the adventures with friends
and that's how the idea of turtle was
born turtle is the world's first earth
rover a remote control open-source
platform capable of working in harsh
terrain turtle is the ideal travel
companion helping you to rediscover this
beautiful planet in real-time allowing
you to reach new and unseen places with
the design inspired by NASA turtle
easily overcomes all terrain obstacles
made of strong aerospace grade materials
turtle drives slowly and steadily making
it a super stable and reliable mobile
platform driving turtle is just like
playing a video game but in real life
the only device you need to control the
rover is your smartphone or tablet if
something strikes your eye snap a
picture or record videos whenever you
like then share them with your friends
one Rover provides infinite
possibilities if you want to upgrade it
add more cameras or sensors no problem
thanks to turtles multiple waterproof
slots and open source software you can
add whatever you want to give you an
example we've included a robotic arm in
the price of the rover kit exclusively
for you our Kickstarter family turtle
can be used in both professional and
personal scenarios inside the case
there's a special watertight compartment
for your own electronics waterproof
connectors in an upper mounting plate
allow you to mount just about any type
of equipment on your rover turtle is
waterproof easy to transport and can be
driven for up to four hours all turtles
features were designed with the greatest
care by us a group of people who like to
create stuff we made turtle to be a
reliable open platform that you can
adapt to your own needs
the only real limit is your imagination
ass turtle team we believe that everyone
should be able to expand in their
passion and experience wonderful
adventures after over a year of
development turtle is almost ready but
we can only launch this product with
your support
join us and become a part of turtle
family are you ready to start an
adventure
you
we all know flippers are fun whether
it's at the beach on the boat or on
vacation somewhere warm however we also
know the problems they can cause when
we're trying to get into and out of the
water it could be walking across the
beach trying not to trip over your
flippers while trying your best not to
look silly or maybe it's when you
struggle to climb a swim ladder and you
realize that wearing your flippers
probably wasn't the best idea my name is
Lee
that's me behind the wheel and that's my
10 year old daughter she had struggled
with swimming for years and after her
last attempt at swimming lessons she was
left feeling defeated and upset and like
any good father I wanted to help so we
tried flippers but the problem we
quickly ran into was she was always in
and out of the water playing with her
friends and that involved the hazards of
walking and climbing with them flippers
have been around for 75 years and we've
lived with these problems because up
until now there hasn't been an
alternative and at 10 years of age I
couldn't expect my daughter to start
wearing water wings or a life jacket
with her friends when I couldn't find a
suitable solution for her I decided to
come up with one on my own and that
solution was tail fins an innovation
that has taken a traditional flipper
back to the drawing board with its
patent-pending Hydra wing design we were
able to get rid of the long front fin
that had caused all those problems in
the first place and still provide
stability and speed and with the Hydra
wings placed up and away from the ground
walking is now a breeze and climbing
swim ladders has never been easier tail
fins has taken into account the complete
user experience and we can say with
confidence that getting into and out of
the water has never been easier and
we're certain that tail fins will be a
success but for that we're gonna need
your help as the creator of tail fins
the journey up until now has been
amazing but the highlight by far was
when I saw my daughter's from the length
of the pool for the first time she was
wearing her tail fins so please be a
part of the tail fins story by backing
our campaign and making a pre-order of
this fantastic product
you
today we introduce synapse where we've
spent the last year looking at ways to
themelis Li add a device to your
clothing research led us to a material
which works much like velcro but is soft
and perfect for integrating into
garments and that is exactly what we did
synapse where is a device and a line of
clothing that gives you the freedom to
place the device where you like on your
body the artistic patches you see are
made by tokyo-based brand-new new and
can also be worn on our garments so what
is synapse where it is a creative
focused environmental and motion sensor
we also wanted to make a platform that
could be used for your own creative
pursuits this is why we will open source
everything we make whether for live
performances or everyday fun we hope you
will support us and make synapse wear a
reality thank you
you
lete miles a musician a visionary
artists who happens to be deaf two years
ago
miles had the desire to see sound and
create a visually compelling light show
by transforming sound into light feeling
inspired miles founded Audio Lux devices
a team of entrepreneurial deaf and
hearing engineers who designed a highly
responsive sound visualization system
that can accurately portray rhythm tone
and dynamics in the form of light
introduced in the Audio Lux one compact
Hardware controller that analyzes
real-time audio across seven different
frequency bands to map sound
visualizations with LED pixels audio Lux
technology is simply plug and play
no VJ software or computer required if
you're creating a visually compelling
light show that accompanies performances
it no longer needs to be complex or
expensive Audio Lux one can control
hundreds of addressable LEDs which can
be installed anywhere even in
instruments and the gear you already
have this is standalone technology for
musicians artists and anyone who wants
the next generation sound reactive light
display for those who like to tweak an
experiment the hardware can be
reprogrammed
thanks to open source software
contributions from the growing Audio Lux
community this is really just the
beginning of a bigger dream and vision
miles and his enterprising team are
developing a whole ecosystem around
audio Lux technology including products
to easily install LEDs anywhere your
inspiration takes you and tools to
quickly map sound visualizations to your
custom lighting designs
Audio locks devices is a young and
successful deaf owned business that has
been building innovative products for
some of the biggest names in the
entertainment industry with your help
Audio Lux device is going to continue to
innovate and deliver technologies that
cross the boundaries between the senses
back us today and experience the delight
of sound made visible
