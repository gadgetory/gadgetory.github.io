rhythm the concept is simple light
controls your natural sleep-wake cycle
news will empower you to make the most
of natural light during the day to stay
active energized and alert and it will
help you avoid harmful blue light at
night preparing you for a good night's
sleep we design the product the tracks
light in the same way as your eyes the
loose app gives you essential insights
and actionable feedback that will

modern living back in sync with nature

Lucinda's charge at night you can also
measure the light surrounding you while
you sleep hi cakes Bella my name is
Christina would you naked eye you
conjure up swear the delight you receive
is healthy or unhealthy and this is why
you need lose my team and I have been
working intensely with leading software
developers hardware engineers scientists
doctors and designers to develop an
accurate affordable and user-friendly
product for you this kind of technology
has previously been used in scientific
research a highly specialized medical
products but never in everyday personal
use we are now bringing loose a light
measuring wearable to you we're now
ready to bring you to life and we need
your help lucha's a technically advanced
project which means that the tooling and
manufacturing costs are significant the
money we're raising goes directly into
moving from prototype to production our
world-class manufacturers are ready all
we need is your support to start so join
us today support our Kickstarter
campaign and together let's bring modern
living back in sync with nature
you
I've been a firefighter for almost 20
years now in the captain for the past
four I'd sadly have attended calls where
we've had fire deaths and almost always
it's related to smoke or toxic gases we
fight fires but it's smoke that kills
saver is an emergency breath system that
has the power to save many lives most of
us have smoke alarms but what happens
after they go off how do we protect the
ones we love we've created this product
with one purpose to save lives saver is
the first personal home safety device
designed to prevent the inhalation of
smoke and toxic gases during a fire
allowing you and your family the time
you need to escape safely seven people
die every day from home fires 80% of all
fire fatalities are due to smoke
inhalation for every minute you were
trapped in a fire your survival rate
decreases seven to ten percent and after
the first five minutes your chances of
survival are less than 25% unfortunately
people have a false sense of security
when it comes to dealing with a house
fire people don't realize they have as
little as two minutes to escape a
burning home before it's too late
also people don't realize the long term
health implications from a house fire
inhaling smoke and toxic gases can cause
cancer and other respiratory diseases
the saver emergency breath system has
the power to change all of that
saver is easy to use and can be
activated within five seconds simply
remove the plastic cover apply the nose
grip remove the orange cap bite into the
mouthpiece and breathe normally
for children we recommend they hold
their nose with one hand and breathe
with the mouthpiece savers triple filter
technology removes smoke and dust carbon
monoxide secondhand smoke and toxic
gases with every breath you take savor
is the only household product of its
kind in North America we believe that
saver will become as common as smoke
detectors and just as important to the
safety of your family lives are
depending on this product getting out
there and we need your help
every saver is a life join us and let's
create a safer home for the people we
love
my name is Tom Heiser
I'm from Heiser defense I'm here to
introduce our PS 1 pocket shotgun it's a
410 tune it's this one's chambered for
two and a half inch round you loaded
here single shot it's stainless steel or
titanium it's got a storage compartment
in the bottom you can store 45s or
cleaning kit or whatever else you need
to put on the bottom and it's all
stainless construction we machine and
and manufacture all the parts in st.
Louis
we're just located south of st. Louis
and peevly Missouri this particular gun
here we shot over 5,000 rounds through
it and we're still shooting it today
without a fail all we did is clean the
barrel and that's all we did and we kept
shooting continuously in two and a half
days over 5,000 rounds but that have
failed we've been in the manufacturing
business over 50 years and we decided to
venture into some firearm business
diversify and we said let's come up with
something really different and radical
let's come up with a pocket shotgun and
that's what we did we're going into
production now in November time frame is
run when we gonna start delivering the
gun and we're gonna have the guns we're
out the 499 price range is where it's
gonna start and then be chambered for
two and a half but we will be coming out
with the 410 for a 3-inch shell also
you
leading us
through we stands through the highways
some eye shadow to sun rays and
I phoned away melodies we haven't played
Gerwin around these
you can put it in your pocket just walk
around with it sing just be free just
walk wherever you want and you can have
your fix with you instead of like dude
back lining control how long the effect
is cool people think I'm just moving
around and acting silly onstage with an
extra loyalty of using my emotions to
control my vocal effects you get to play
with it and it immediately more natural
singing we all do it whether it's in the
shower or on a big stage it's one of the
greatest things to do and believe us
when we say we have something that will
take it to the next level
there are many professional singers
using sound effects on top of their
voice but why are more singers doing so
well because effect controls are often
packed with sliders knobs and switches
have complex software into the mix and
it instantly becomes hard to understand
a singer needs to be free and expressive
they need to have an instrument that
follows their movement not the other way
around and that's why we created to do
it you get an instrument that lets you
add effects to your voice by simply
twisting and moving it around and around
and around
this is not a revolutionary idea this is
a natural next step for singers and
vocalists it's an intuitive instrument
that does not interrupt your workflow
and will become an unmissable part of
your singing either on stage in the
studio or practicing at home so how does
it work the wiggle automatically
connects to its app in the App you
select a style or genre so you can get
started straightaway sing into the
built-in mic of your phone or tablet or
use it with an external one hold the
wiggle in your hand or attach it to your
microphone please then turn the wiggle
and you'll hear the effects spray it
away
export our ready-to-use effects in the
app or link it to your favorite studio
software over the last years we've been
developing the wicked with a small but
very dedicated team in the Netherlands
you might know us from our previous
Kickstarter campaign two years ago our
project was successfully funded and got
picked up by many great artists
including some of the biggest lifx in
the world with the amazing support the
feedback of musicians and singers we now
proudly present the wiggle clip a
product designed and tested by artists
or artists it's compact
intuitive and can be trusted on stage
even the big ones but most of all it's a
product that will take same to the next
level</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
