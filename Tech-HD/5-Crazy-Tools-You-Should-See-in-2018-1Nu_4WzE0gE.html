we'll go
the wastelands through the highways from
a shadow through the sunrays and
we'll go
brewing is passion passion for
ingredients techniques and tastes and
for every batch the skill is added new
elements recognized reacted on and not
necessarily improved but understood we
wanted to understand the process in
detail that's why we develop playdough
Plato is a reinvented airline it's a
tool for beer brewers the tool that
continuously monitors the ongoing
fermentation process
it measures the beers gravity and
temperature gives you a unique insight
in the fermentation activity at any
given point and calculates the alcohol
content without touching the beer
whatsoever knowing the amount of co2
generated during the fermentation allows
us to calculate these key parameters
play-doh is designed to optically
measure the co2 flow through the glass
clear Triton airlock making a truly
non-invasive data is gathered calculated
and sent to the online cloud using Wi-Fi
Plato gives you more than just instant
and historical data it analyzes the
ongoing fermentation and generates a
report unique for every single batch
share disgusts and analyzed data to
increase the understanding of how
temperature changes mashing techniques
or strains of yeast affects the
fermentation and tastes play-doh doesn't
make beer for you lets you understand
you
colors are an important part of creating
the perfect image but with uncalibrated
equipment the same image can appear very
differently on different screens that's
why we created global color a simple
fast and effective color management tool
that makes it easy for everyone to
display stunning pictures with perfect
colors whether you want to print out a
landscape photo in true-to-life colors
or optimize your screen for a more
intense gaming experience with global
color your images will come to life
revealing their true colors on your
screen our aim is to make this pro
technology available to everyone with a
passion for photos global color
calibrates your display and ensures that
all of your devices display your images
in their true colors
to make this possible we've developed
our own sensor and technology made in
Germany and we even went one step
further we are proud to offer you the
first distance measurement color imager
for end users worldwide our
revolutionary technology combines
long-lasting glass filters professional
sensor technology and the highest
quality glass lens optics from now on
you can place the sensor in front of the
screen and the ambient light of your
surrounding will also be measured by our
sensor the surface of your display is
protective as there is no contact with
the sensor anymore by performing a
distance calibration the user achieves
an even more natural result this way the
sensor can measure the colors under the
same circumstances as your eyes are
seeing them it works with a single click
it's fast easy user-friendly and precise
everyone benefits from a maximum level
of detail correct colors optimal
contrast and dynamic range whether
you're a hobby or professional
photographer an agency web designer or
simply someone who works closely with a
monitor with global color distance
calibration tools you don't have to
compromise between affordability and
high quality we've created a solution
with the community for the community it
is easy to use and brings lifelike
colors and high res detail to every
monitor
get your global color suite today please
don't forget to share it with your
colleagues interested in experiencing
digital colors that are true to life and
support this project now
