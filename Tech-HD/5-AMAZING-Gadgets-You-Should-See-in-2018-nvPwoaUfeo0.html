may already know the importance of but
also how difficult it is to find a ramp
that allows your dog to get onto and off
of the bed easily and safely only first
got crew so I searched online for bed
ramps all I found were heavy industrial
looking ramps bulky foam blocks or steps
which are actually not a good idea if
your goal is to protect your dog's back
because you see one in for toxins get
intervertebral disk disease
Crusoe being one of them two years ago
he had surgery for a blown disk which
probably happened from jumping it cost
thousands of dollars and resulted in
months of recovery time and was
heartbreaking to see him like that a bed
is a dangerous place to jump from
especially for dachshunds but also any
small breed however ever since I built
him the ramp he uses it 100% of the time
and I never worried about him being on
the bed anymore plus he can come up and
down as he pleases the design of the dog
will ramp has been refined over the past
couple years it's adjustable in height
from a foot high to over 37 inches the
railings are removable and reversible so
you can poori on the ramp any way you
like and it can be folded down entirely
to less than three inches high so it can
be stored under a bed or upright in a
closet and to make the ramp extra sturdy
I came up with this little safety rope
which is so simple and yet incredibly
effective simply place the rope under
the mattress with the wood block on one
end and with the other end tied off to
the leg of the ramp this isn't going
anywhere and is 100% stable and secure

you
cold brew is known for how smooth it is
how rich the flavor is you really get to
experience the bean you're using and it
makes that first sip that in the morning
it just a flavor explosion is so smooth
you're really experiencing your coffee
making homemade cold brew has a lot of
advantages over buying it out at a
coffee shop or buying it in a can or you
can even buy cold brew concentrate but
those things are really full and a lot
of additives and chemicals to make them
shelf stable so we decided to come up
with our own concept of a cold brew
maker that looked good that fit in your
fridge that could serve cold brew
straight from the fridge and that made
enough cold brew to get to people
through an entire workweek the kobra
want a proprietary design has some
really great features to it one of them
is the custom glass jar is made to be
compact enough to fit in your fridge but
also large enough to hold more than a
week's worth of cold brew and the filter
is actually custom built to hold enough
coffee to make the necessary cold brew
but also we shaped it down so that it
wouldn't affect the flow rate of the
spigot inside in addition the lid as
well is very high quality stainless
steel makes it airtight sealing just a
very overall sturdy but aesthetically
pleasing design so when you back our
campaign you get the cold brew on tap 2
which is our new innovative design and
then you also get an awesome ebook that
covers tons of different ways you can
use cold brew so it just makes colder a
really fun interactive drink that you
can incorporate into your life in more
ways than you probably even knew you
could most people don't know this but
the coffee you use to make cold brew
should actually be different from the
coffee used for hot coffee so we work
with a micro roaster to create a special
batch just for cold brew for a cold beer
on tap so that's one option you can get
when you back us and I really think
you'll like it it's literally the best
cup of coffee we've ever had if you
haven't tried cold brew yet you have to
you're gonna love it and if you have you
already know it's the best thing ever
making homemade Kolber is always gonna
give you a really smooth less bitter cup
of coffee which is one of the reasons we
like it so much and why we were like
having it on hand seven days a week
say hello to the past when Steve Jobs
introduced the iMac g3 20 years ago he
said it looks like it's from another
planet well welcome back to the ones
that paved the way for us it's beacon we
work tirelessly to create a simple phone
case that ignites the fun and
individuality of the iMac g3 and
embraces the things we've learned from
the past we wanted to capture the design
and style of the original who was
consciously designed a bear a nostalgic
look to the iconic iMac g3 with air
cushion technology in a dual layer to
ensure slim protection for the iPhone X
the result familiar but extraordinary
the classic Siwon bears one of the
memories that we once loved connecting
and shaping us to be who we are bring
back the past and remember where it all
started the classic Siwon by speed
a few years ago saw my photography
friends would ask I've noticed a change
in your fly's photography we have the
same equipment but the quality of light
you're getting is superior
what are you doing different well I
finally switch to a modifier some have
tried to make it own but are always
embarrassed walking around with this
homemade contraption it always falls off
at the most inappropriate time so what's
your secret which one did you buy I was
unhappy with the size and the light I
put every flash modifier I used not only
were they not visually appealing most
them would strain waste light everywhere
some were too heavy too awkward and
would even deform as a knife went off we
could do better I knew exactly what I
wanted
Cobra flush modifier was too filmed so I
partnered with a design engineer to make
a modifier that was going to be
redesigned from the grind up introducing
the Cobra flash modifier that was
designed for flawless integration with
your flux the heart of the Cobra is a
forward facing front reflector so the
light can be controlled not sprayed
everywhere
Kobra has an easy transition of
switching from horizontal to vertical
in his light inflexible and packs away
easy and the Cobra only weighs four
point three ounces it comes with a
unique multitasking silicon pad which
not only grips and holds the Cobra it
fits almost all fly sets including the
poplar Wireless 8200
I was amazed to find the difference the
cobra made not only were the skin tones
softer but also offered greater coverage
from the flesh using the Cobra flush
modifier soft one of my biggest problems
the problem of using direct flash and a
dark environment and events people would
always complain about being blinded by
the bright intensity of direct flies the
Cobra flash modifiers solved this
problem by converting a harsh flash into
a soft diffused light
with your help on Kickstarter
the Cobra flush modifier will be
available for you to take your flash
photography to the next level
