plexidrone we have thought about the
things that people don't really think
about how do you improve drone
technology how do you make it accessible
to everyone how do you inspire people to
create using drone technology at riku
robotics we believe technology should be
building bridges towards new levels of
creativity and productivity rather than
barriers and the Flexi drill is one of
those technologies a drone that you can
snap together and take apart in less
than one minute and when you're done you
just put it into your hardshell backpack
and take it anywhere that you want to go
the plexi pack is something we designed
in order to carry everything you need to
capture all the great shots that you
want and carry it with you everywhere
you go anywhere you can go with a
backpack you can take the flexi go get
the plexi drone you can carry more than
just a camera with very simple payload
clips are able to just snap on whatever
it is that you want to put on there it's
so simple
another unique feature about the
plexidrone is that it has a retractable
landing gear you will no longer have any
kind of junk in your shot you never have
to crop anything out at the bottom it's
just gonna be clear beautiful 360 view
on the plexi drone gps follow me is an
amazing feature all that you do is press
follow me on your mobile device on your
phone or your tablet and it's as easy as
that it's gonna be very very easy to use
everybody has a smartphone now great now
you just saved yourself eight hundred
bucks for a controller aside from that
you're also able to control more than
one of them at the same time you will
definitely find no drones that you can
control using our swarm technology it's
completely new something you won't find
anywhere else that means that you're
able to view the same scene from
multiple vantage points you get the same
shot with one user but many drones our
drone is equipped with an ultrasonic
sensor at the front it'll flash its
lights and give you an audio message to
let you know that
as a pack you don't have to interpret
blinking LED light because it tells you
in its own voice the initialization
sequence completed are you even going to
use me the plexidrone is going to
unleash new dimensions of creativity and
productivity and take your camera to
places that you never thought were
possible in order for us to realize our
dream we need your support any support
that you could give to us to bring the
plexidrone to market would be extremely
valuable even just sharing our story
with your friends what we're here to do
is to reimagine what drone technology
means to all of us plexy drone is ready
you
good morning everyone Michael did you
see the game last night
it's okay we've all been there before
starting our days tired and cranky where
we can't live without coffee or energy
drinks struggling to get one night's
good sleep but I was lucky enough to
find a solution to these problems and
I'm excited to share it with you today
it's rest on a smart device that helps
you achieve your best sleep hey Leo wake
up that's not how you use it oh no no
one of the many awesome things about
rest on is that it's not wearable it
would be ironic if a sleep monitor makes
it harder for you to fall asleep right
restaurant is designed to guarantee you
the most comfortable natural and free
sleep the magnetic lid does not only
help to fix the device easily on your
sheet but also turns on the device
automatically when it's locked
it is Wireless and paper-thin you won't
feel its presence at all in your sleep
well information such as your heart rate
respiratory rate and body movements are
accurately collected and analyzed
it is closer to your heart when you rest
on it the sensors are placed right under
your chest where all of your vitals are
this is one of the reasons why Reston's
accuracy and benchmark medical devices
and surpass any wristband be inaccurate
and non wearable at the same time
requires the most cutting-edge
technology and design in the industry
rest on is equipped with medical grade
paper-thin sensors which can capture all
the data needed for monitoring and
managing your sleep you can easily
review all your sleeping information on
your smartphone using the rest on app
along with personalized advice it's like
having a private sleep consultant right
at your fingertips you will know exactly
what you need to do to improve your
sleep with restaurant restaurants
innovative family cloud allows you to
share your sleep data with loved ones no
matter where you are you s'posed the
west coast of North America the Asia
well everyone shall we get back to work
we need to make sure that the first
batch of rest on gets out in time for
the holiday season
Michael give Guyot it would be my gift
to everyone this year hi I'm David Horne
CEO and co-founder of sleep pays please
support us on IndieGoGo now and make
rates on the best gift ever a gift to us
so we could continue to improve user
experience and a gift to your loved ones
in yourself not just a gadget but better
sleep thank you so much
you
you
embrace is designed to be a gorgeous
wash in a medical quality device it's
made of leather and metal it's very easy
to wear and it is a ring that
illuminates time but hours in minutes in
today's world the nonstop action is
tough to achieve the right balance
embrace makes it very easy to monitor
physiological stress arousal sleep and
physical activity you can see are you
doing at work while running during
dinner or sleep
you can sit embrace to give private
vibration alerts you can learn or to
reduce stress and feel better you can
also send an alert to a friend or a
loved one you can learn about yourself
in a way that is easy to understand but
embrace does even more
our device is designed to detect
unexpected seizures bracelets designed
to save lives for a lot of people with
epilepsy seizures can seriously hurt or
even kill people and we need an alert to
intervene one in 26 people in the US
will develop epilepsy at some point
during their lifetime everybody with
epilepsy should be able to have a device
that alerts a friend or a family member
to come help at the time that they might
need it
this device will measure both movement
and physiological signals the
combination is likely to be very
important for detecting potentially
life-threatening seizures these sensors
and algorithms were originally developed
here at the MIT Media Lab we learned
that combining the stress data we could
sense from the rest with the activity
data led to the most accurate seizure
detection
we have been working on a medical
quality wearable for many years our III
sensor is being used by the top
physicians and scientists in the world
to acquire clinical quality data for
their studies no other device on the
market today can do anything like this
now we are making embrace so that
everyone can benefit from our technology
we've done a lot of work with a truly
passionate team that believes in this
project many of you have asked for
otherwise like this new we are also
thanks to IndieGoGo in the Epilepsy
Foundation but we need your help and
support to make this product our reality
together we can make the difference in
the lives of 3 million Americans and 65
million people worldwide they live with
epilepsy this is what we'll do for every
murse you buy will donate one for
Charlie suffers from epilepsy and they
cannot afford the device so you get a
gorgeous and useful watch and a child
gets a better life because of you
my name's Jeff barrel seven years ago I
got together with a group of really
smart engineers and we developed a
product called the Drobo with the goal
of making safe expandable storage
available to everybody a year ago the
same team got together we've been
developing a new product we call the
transporter the transporter is the
world's first social storage solution it
allows you to share collaborate and
backup files transfer files anywhere in
the world to whoever you want right
within the storage device itself there
really was no easy way to do the things
that transporter does for for sure you
could maybe use the cloud but it's
really expensive and the more data you
store the more you pay privacy's are
concerned who has access to the data and
how many copies of it are there how safe
is it and when you need it back you have
to download it all again so we designed
transporter with a number of goals in
mind
first of all privacy we wanted all of
the data stored on the transporter to be
completely private only you and the
people that you specify have access to
the data or visibility into what the
data is secondly monthly fees everybody
hates monthly fees and every sharing a
collaboration solution that we could see
had a monthly fee component we want the
transporter to be a solution that you
buy and you own - you know exactly how
much it costs right up front
data transfer solutions tend to be
extremely complicated we wanted a
solution that's is easy to use something
like Facebook literally with the
transporter you just invite other people
to participate they accept the
invitations and that's it there's no
more complexity than that
let's say you want to backup your data
today with a hard drive you have to
actually physically backup to the hard
drive and then take that somewhere else
drive it over to maybe your sister's
house or take it into your workplace or
carry it with you with the transporter
this is all automatic the transporter
will backup data from your computer
automatically and then transfer it to
another transporter located wherever you
want once it's setup there's nothing for
you to manage the transporter makes it
easy for even large groups of people to
collaborate on the same data whether
it's a social group or a working group
it's like one hard drive being shared
between a whole bunch of people but you
all have your own copy of the data
getting access to all of your data
wherever you happen to be in the world
has been a challenge historically this
is also something that transporter helps
with with our software on your computer
or on your mobile device you can access
your transporter wherever you happen to
be and there's no Geographic limit to
this either people in different
countries can participate just as easily
as people who live around the corner
today there are thousands of
transporters in existence people are
using them to do all sorts of things
from collaborating with co-workers to
accessing files remotely and even
automated off-site backups if like us
you would like a private storage
solution with no monthly fees that you
own and control then please consider
getting your very own transporter today
