I'm smelling your pocket hi I'm Adam
creator of the fizzy pan where does the
Fidji pan you might ask the Fidji pen is
the world's first fun to play with and
discrete fidget or why do you eat a
Pidgey pan let's take a look at Paul
Paul is about to kiss this beautiful
young woman but then because of this
oversized fidget toys a totally really
limit don't let this happen to you how
many times this happened to you or
people around you you're fidgeting with
things and it's distracting to every Tom
Dick and Harry let's see a day in the
life of Paul and see what happens
ha stop Dicky hope he doesn't get nap on
that one
oh great got dumped by my girlfriend
kicked out of school and I just killed
Carol excuse me sorry
I'm not dead yet a quiet grandma making
a crowdfunding video
now get out of here
did you just self edit your own curse
word Pablo you really think I'm going to
put myself behind bars and say curse
word on crowdfunding video now get out
Wow
hope it doesn't get sent to the dean's
office so fidgeting got the best of you
huh
you're almost to pull my finger psych
you'll thank me later
oh geez wait what's on your pocket
Oh
so why did we create the 50 pen research
has shown that when we're experiencing
anxiety or boredom fidgeting is the
body's natural mechanism to help us stay
focused present and in the moment so the
reason we created these fidgeting
features embedded inside of the pen is
that so people could fidget more
discretely you know there's a lot of
other fidget toys out there but the
problem is they're too large and they're
too distracting to others that's why we
believe that fidgeting is for anyone who
wants to stay focused relax and have fun
of the process also research has shown
that people with a DD ADHD and autism
can greatly benefit from fidgeting we
believe that habits such as nail-biting
leg shaking and finger tapping can be
channeled into the Fidji pen to help
people stay cool calm and collected
thank you for supporting us share this
campaign on social media we'll give you

my name is DJ Brunner and I'm one of the
founders of free cast we have created a
wireless live streaming system available
for all creators I also want a
production company called anthem films
and I've worked in nearly every role in
film production wireless video and live
streaming is a tool all filmmakers can
use to benefit their productions my name
is Clayton waha I'm a co-founder of free
cast I've also been skateboarding my
entire life and I co-founded the record
label outlet I'm always looking for
opportunities to help take content
creation to the next level being a
filmmaker you have a lot of moments
where you realize how lucky you are I've
traveled the world and I've worked with
amazing artists like Selena Gomez
Lindsey Stirling and ASAP Rocky a few
years ago we started asking is there a
better way to share this experience what
if we could livestream from any camera
how would that change film production we
decided to create an affordable solution
that could change content creation
forever
during our beta test phase pre cast has
already changed the way we think about
wireless video and live streaming we
have three free cast models standard pro
and universal standard and pro kits work
with gopro cameras and our universal kit
works with any camera with HDMI out you
can also livestream from any DSLR or an
HDMI camera to your social network the
free cast app lets you watch live record
footage and live stream in real time you
can view your footage on any iOS device
as well as any monitor with HDMI in you
can also be your footage up to five
hundred meters away from your camera
we've been using free casts and three
basic ways to cast your iOS device to
cast the production monitors and of
course to cast your social network
it's lightweight and we designed to
deliver professional quality video at a
price that even the smallest budget
productions can afford we are ready to
manufacture and we want your help
reading precast to life so you can cast
your world more freely
