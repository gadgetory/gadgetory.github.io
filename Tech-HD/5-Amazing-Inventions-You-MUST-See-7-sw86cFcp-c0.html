entering our homes and helping us
automate daily tasks but I find myself
thinking there has to be a more natural
and accessible way to control the
devices around us if the goal of
automation is to simplify our lives why
does it feel so complicated our goal is
a company is to solve this say hello to
naki naki is a small elegant device that
instantly transforms ordinary surfaces
in your environment and to remote
controls using naki couldn't be easier
simply take it out of the box pick a
place to put it select a surface to
attach it to and then define all the
things you'd like Nike to do naki can
control a wide variety of devices around
us but the true beauty of our technology
is that what it can do is only limited
by your imagination
put one in your living room or the
kitchen or even your bedroom I mean
imagine rolling over in the morning and
tapping a simple pattern anywhere on
your nightstand to snooze your alarm and
start the coffee maker without even
opening your eyes you just bought 10
more minutes in bed and you'll
definitely want to put one in your kids
bedroom it's exciting to think of how
naki will spark their imagination as
they figure out all kinds of ways to use
it using Wi-Fi which is proven to be far
more reliable and would better reach in
Bluetooth you can enjoy using naki from
anywhere the number of devices and
software that naki interact with is
rapidly growing every day it currently
includes nest Phillips you lifx smart
things IFTTT and more but even if you're
new to the smart technology world you
can still use naki for simple functions
around your home
other technologies that rely on sound or
voice control can be unreliable and
confusing to use they can be triggered
accidentally and don't always work into
expected our patent-pending technology
uses non acoustic sensors it's able to
distinguish deliberate tap or knock
patterns from random vibrations in the
environment the beauty of our product is
that it makes any regular environment
into a user interface think about the
surfaces around you so many of them
serve one or two purposes add a knock
you to them and you instantly have a hub
for automation we carefully chose every
material and finish Funaki we've gone
through series of different tests and
prototypes to make sure that naki blends
in in your environment and also looks
beautiful on your surfaces we're doing
our first production runs here in the
USA because it's important for our
entire team to be there on the ground
floor ensuring that we're manufacturing
the best possible product we're excited
to bring naki that Kickstarter it's not
some far-fetched idea we've finalized
our designs we have beautiful working
prototype and we need to raise funds to
actually get it in a production and
immediately start shipping them to your
door we couldn't be more excited about
how this product is going to change
lives and bring joy to people everywhere
naki accomplishes what technology is
supposed to do instead of taking over
our life it enhances it allowing you to
put more thought and effort into the
things that really matter tap into the
world around you with the magic of naki
I came up with the idea for a translator
when I met a French girl that's really
where the story starts I was on vacation
and i met this girl it was difficult for
us to communicate because she didn't
speak english very well and even when we
tried to find a solution like using some
translation app to communicate is
horrible look if you are speaking and
our phones are in a face like this
forget it this is the wall we're out of
this real world interaction but this in
your ear just right back in it Lil D I
don't put this in your ear just missin
oh hey i put in here comes up yeah okay
can you hear me French leave amid all
filthy bitch was a nobody falls day yes
I can hear you talk Fred causes fists
but this is awesome but how you do it
yeah it's translating translating
this little wearable uses translation
technology to allow two people to speak
different languages but still clearly
understand each other simply put when
one person speaks the other here is it
in their language developing the pilot
has been an intensive process our team's
been work on over two years andrew is
original co-founder and overseas prior
development I'm an electrical engineer
and expert and manufacturing we also
have mechanical engineer software
engineer PhD and machine translation as
well as an industrial designer our wide
breadth of experts has allowed us to
develop a product from the ground up we
wanted to create something that hugs the
curves of the year without being
obtrusive something snug but fashionable
to wear in the process we just decided
to throw in an extra earpiece for
wireless streaming music that means the
full system includes two earpieces and
its accompanying app it's from the app
itself where all of the languages are
uploaded to the earpiece it's kind of an
end-all solution for the traveler or the
international professional that's what
we're doing here at Waverly labs it's
simply the most advanced communication
wearable
they say IndieGoGo campaign helps us
finish what we started we can get the
ear pieces along with this portable
charger manufactured in delivered within
a year the app works on sone if you just
want to use the app or basic translation
and we'll have the app out by late
summer first for our backers here in
indy gogo but for the full experience
you really want the earpieces too it's
the dream you know a life untethered
free of language barriers it's just that
it's no longer dream anymore it's real
you
what's up I'm Pedro me and my crew
Astrid in hacen got two problems every
time you see a squirrel we have to chase
it sometimes we run so far we get lost
did you know that every second a dog
runs away and never comes back darn
those squirrels I have a heart disease
that no one knows about I try to tell my
humans about it what they don't
understand why I'm saying it's time for
change I wanna keep me and my crew safe
so that we can continue hanging out in
the park this is out Tracy is an
accessory that you put on my dog collar
it'll track my position and also measure
my health condition if you use it simply
turn on your base and attach the Tracy
tracker to my color now you can see
where i am at the tracy app anytime
anywhere in real time you can also
create safety areas if i would ever walk
outside the safety area you would get a
message from the tracy at tracy can also
measure my activity like when I walk
sleep play run drink and eat you can
also teach the app new activity specific
for me like when I wave at you using
this data Tracy will help you detect
early warning signs of disease so I can
stay healthy and live longer also tracy
has the longest battery life in the
world and its smallest long-range
tracker ever made humans it's time for
you to understand our barking the dog
revolution is on Tracy is fully
developed and ready for mass production
all we need is the money to start now
you have two choices either hit close
and every second a dog goes missing
while illness goes undetected or click
contribute now to make this product a
reality for all dogs are loyal
loyal back join now and help me in my
crew
a couple years ago we set out to build a
family of affordable yet high-quality
smart weather station and we've done it
our weather stations are simple to
install require almost no maintenance
and automatically connect with your
smart phone your smart home and the
internet they're better than other
stations sold at twice or three times
the price finally you can have useful
weather information from your own
backyard this is air air measures
temperature atmospheric pressure and
relative humidity and air does something
else special it detects lightning it'll
not only alert you in lightning strikes
but it'll estimate the strength and
distance of the storm up to 25 miles
away and it'll tell you how fast the
storm is approaching just set it outside
in the shade air has a battery that'll
last year's and it connects wirelessly
to your smartphone tablet or home
network you don't have to think about it
when there's something you need to know
it'll alert you you can also view your
data anytime through our smart weather
app as well as other popular weather
apps like Weather Underground and this
is sky sky measures sunlight solar
radiation including UV index it also
does two really cool things it measures
rain and wind with no moving parts
unlike old-school tipping buckets that
can break or fill with things other than
rain sky senses each individual raindrop
using an innovative haptic rain
sensitive it can alert you the instant
it starts to rain tell you how hard it's
raining and how much it rained yesterday
or last week sky also measures wind
speed and direction using an array of
sonic transducers this sonic anemometer
is better in many ways in traditional
spinning cups and usually only available
in much more expensive systems like air
sky comes with a long life battery and
is completely wireless also like air sky
is simple to install just find a spot
with a clear view of the sky
both sky and air work with all the
popular smart home platforms so you can
do all those nifty smart home things
like reminding you to put on sunscreen
when the UV index is high delaying your
sprinklers when it rained optimizing
your air conditioning system to save
money turning on your lights when the
sun goes down or closing your garage
door when the wind kicks up if you've
made it this far congratulations you're
a certified weather geek just like all
of us at whether form we're on IndieGoGo
now because we want you to be the first
to get your hands on one of our new
weather stations and because we need
your feedback as we finalize production
details on the hardware and in the app
there's still time to make changes ask
us questions what did we do right what
could be better please take a look at
our perks share this page with your
friends weather geek or otherwise we
want these to be the best home weather
stations in the world because we want
you to have better weather game please
help us do that thank you
