forever changing how we clean at home
and at work you back for the minimalist
traveler making them more organized and
easy way to shop late we ended up
raising over two hundred thousand
dollars ship toiletry bags all around
the world to over 4000 happy customers
in 65 different countries changing the
way that thousands of people
after a bunch of searching we realized
it was either a giant catch-all bag a
ziplock or a weird bathroom organizer
and that was it we were wondering hot
crap we're gonna keep our toothbrush off
our shoulders so we designed our own
from scratch and launched introducing
the expeditionary we'll give you a quick
run-through we've built a
water-resistant pocket for your
toothbrush
no one likes your toothpaste juices
getting all over the rest of your stuff
if it's an electric toothbrush or a
full-size toothpaste and toothbrush
besides that there's a perfect sized
pocket for your electric razor or normal
razor and shaving cream behind that we
have a small hidden pocket for earrings
and other small items down below there
are three pockets one for deodorant
combs or other long items and two for
the rest of your random toiletries my
favorite part of the bag is the
water-resistant pocket it scales the
entire back of the bag allowing you to
fit four three ounce bottles of liquids
or larger items like a hairbrush we're
also including a clear TSA compliant bag
water resistant and to be used inside
the toiletry bag for a second layer of
added protection pull it out and set it
by the rest of your stuff for easy
passage through airport security and the
small hook allows you to use it as a
shower bag in the back is a soft fleece
pocket if it's your passport
USB cords or a small first aid kit this
bag does great laying on the counter the
top of the toilet or you can hang it up
included is a small G hook and strap so
you can easily hang it wherever
well it's hanging it's easy to store and
grab your items and when you're all done
packing just slides right on top of the
rest of your stuff our poles waterproof
zippers and all of our materials are
top-notch don't believe us we'll give
you a lifetime warranty and if something
comes on stitch send it back and then
you

companion travel anywhere hey well
