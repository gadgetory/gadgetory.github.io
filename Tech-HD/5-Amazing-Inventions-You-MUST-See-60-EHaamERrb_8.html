tempest cope I released the first
tempest code three years ago as an open
source project when I was looking for
ways to feel the tropical skies in my
daily life and ever since I received
overwhelming interest from people all
over the world I which is why we're
excited to announce our first campaign
to actually get the tempest grip into
your hands our team consists of
engineers and designers based in Tokyo
and we now have everything we need
other than the actual fun to get Jen
into mass production
I already need your help to get this
exciting new product into reality
so thank you very much for your support
you
mobile electronics are everywhere today
and the last three years alone over four
billion smartphones have been sold
globally they help us stay connected no
matter where we are and have completely
changed the way we live from concrete
jungles to the wilderness more and more
people are bringing technology with them
everywhere they go they ensure we always
have a camera to capture life's
unexpected moments or the single loved
one is just one tap away with all the
uses we have today for mobile technology
we all have one big problem battery
level hi I'm Jared with energy solar
we've been making portable solar
products for several years now and have
launched other products on IndieGoGo
before to going through those campaigns
allowed us to talk to thousands of
people interested in solar products and
we noticed a trend we kept having
customers ask for something ultra
lightweight and portable to charge their
phones and other portable electronics
after looking what was currently
available we found dozens of products
that had a few great features here and
there but none of them completely
addressed all of our customers needs we
knew what we had to do the Raptor is the
world's first solar powered USB quick
charger it incorporates all the most
advanced charging technology available
and a durable waterproof and lightweight
design the Raptor generates power using
the most advanced solar panel technology
available today that don't require
perfectly sunny skies that power is then
stored in an ultra lightweight lithium
ion battery for use any time just lay it
out in the Sun and it recharges itself
when full it can easily charge two to
three smartphones two smart USB ports on
the side of the Raptor will charge your
device at the fastest possible rate up
to 75% faster than a conventional wall
charger
in just 10 minutes you can boost your
battery level by 20%
whether it's a trip to your kids
baseball game or a two-week expedition
into the wild
let us power your passion with your help
we can make the Raptor a reality so you
can focus on what's important and not
your battery level
we've created prototypes and I've
already begun production for the Raptor
and the Raptor Pro your pre-orders will
help us pay for tooling and materials to
make this possible together we can bring
the world unlimited mobile power on
behalf of Energy Solar thank you for
your support
hi my name is Maria I'm the co-founder
of Olli I'm also working mother to three
wonderful kids I'm sure most of you can
imagine what morning's look like my
house an entire week without being woken
up way too early
forget it children under the age of
eight don't understand the concept of
time they wake up and think the day are
started on the wake up know it's still
night time but get up anyway over the
years we tried all kinds of products to
help them understand that it's too only
together we knew they had to be a better
solution so two years ago we went on a
journey to create it ourselves we
surveyed thousands of parents
interviewed sleep training experts and
read countless case studies from sleep
scientists and that is how only a spawn
only is really different from anything
else on the market it is the first I've
connected sleep training companion that
prevents your child from waking you up
too early in the morning only uses
colors to help your child understand the
concept of time using only is simple
first set up only for the night pick one
of the scientifically recommended colors
for optimal sleep quality such as red
then pick your choice favorite color for
the time together such as dream only
it's not ready to operate on its own the
only thing left is to make sure your
child understand it's okay to get up
when all these green
your child may still wake up early but
he will remember to stay in bed until
only turns dream then you will know it
can come to your room and that you will
happily let him climb in bed with you
we can also help with your child's bed
time or night time routine actually
Paulo can assist you in all your daily
routine activities it will help you as
parents is the power struggle unwind and
enjoy each other's company
everything about Olli is designed to
make it a delightful experience for you
and your child you can reduce Ali's
intensity down to the slightest clue for
a so reassuring presence the only want
an extra 30 minutes of sleep on a Sunday
morning simply make a last-minute change
with one tap on your iPad or iPhone
and weekend grandma's family vacations
only follows your child wherever he goes
no need to have an iPhone or iPad around
Ollie's battery can last up to seven
days on a single charge we created early
because we were frustrated with the
impractical products out there two years
of obsessive designing prototyping and
testing has brought us here
the result is unlike any other solution
milligan device with a seamless
experience now ready for mass production
we can't wait to bring l2 skip to join
your family thank you
this is the reason why we should keep
making these microscopes Jim right here
my name is Manuka Kosh and in the
faculty at Stanford
I'm also the co-inventor of hold scope
I'm Jim Cebulski I was a PhD student in
the news lab at Stanford University and
I'm also a co-inventor of hold scope
hold scope is an origami microscope that
you put together yourself by folding a
sheet of paper and the capabilities of
the full scope are actually equalent to
conventional microscopes that cost
thousands of dollars
but we build a full scope with one
dollar in bill of materials we live in a
world where the majority of life-forms
are actually invisible to our naked eye
there are scientific tools that allow
you things like a microscope that allow
you to experience it and really change
your perspective and turn you into a
curious observer one of the challenges
that we face is the fact that this
experience of curiosity driven science
is hindered by the accessibility of
scientific tools we care about full
scope because we want to make scientific
tools available to as broader community
as possible around the world
I literally compare something like this
to a pencil
you know I carry around a pencil and in
a moment I have a thought
and jot it down so very similarly
full-scope is literally a pencil of
Macross that we built over 50,000 units
of hold scopes and distributed them to
people in 130 countries around the world
and we had a great response to that
people posted lots of projects they gave
us emails encouraging us to keep going
so we thought why stop there we need to
be hiring and so we formed an entity
fold scope instruments in December 2015
part of our vision is not only to
provide instruments to people around the
world but also to connect them to each
other within the next year we're going
to build a millionfold space and we're
excited about bringing them out to the
community so if you are a teacher you
are a parent you are an explorer you're
a naturalist you're an office worker or
you are a students on there it doesn't
matter all that matters is is the fact
that if you care about bringing science
into the hands of people we need your
help and hope you'll join us thank you
very much for your support
you
this thing's cool
as far as this I mean it's so stable
let's bring your attic
I'm dizzy from promotion it's hard to
capture smooth video using your
smartphone we've all been there
you think you captured the perfect
moment but it turns out as a crappy
memory the camera is great
but this thing is almost impossible to
hold steady as adventures travelers and
experience force enthusiasts we believe
that great moments should be kept in the
best possible way that's why we had
evolved for more than one the world's
most versatile smartphone stabilizer
I'll turn to z1
enables you to capture smooth cinematic
videos with your smartphone its
lightweight and portable it only weighs
300 grams and fits you right in your
pocket
we made one burst out you can match to
any camera and go from out ordered
custom-made smart extension pole
but it's so much more than the
stabilizer with the full motion app you
have even more possibilities we built in
advanced auto fall technology so you
always keep your subjective frame and
never miss a moment great stunning
motion time-lapses create amazing
panorama photos and a live stream
directly to Facebook or YouTube
one is super easy DS just sliding your
phone and with one click you're ready to
go
we have iterated tested over and over
again and now we've finally made
something that we can be truly proud of
from top to bottom
all parts and components are of high
quality durable and design protection
sports
our mission is to help people tell
better service and to make professional
videography available for everyone at
anytime anywhere and this is why we need
your help back us today and help us put
an end to shaky videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
