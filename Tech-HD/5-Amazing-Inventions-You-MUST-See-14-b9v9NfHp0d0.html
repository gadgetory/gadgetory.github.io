aura X the world's first smart AR
headphones the aura X is the world's
smartest headphone that means you can
download millions of apps and games from
the Android Play Store with the aura X
you can watch music videos play casual
games on the subway or just listen to
your favorite tunes on the go the Ola X
is a brand new product category it opens
up a world of possibilities in
hands-free mobile computing it allows
you to check notifications share content
on social networks and much more the
aura X includes a patented a our display
camera position sensors 50 millimeter
speakers for a rich audio sound and a
touchpad for control and interaction if
you're into fitness you love it because
you can go to the gym and being able to
see through the glass
it combines the best sound with the best
of wearable technology this is the
world's first music headset that brings
a new dimension to mobile music
now you can see the music but I think
the most compelling reason why we're
excited about the aura acts is that it
opens up a world of new possibilities
with augmented reality that means we'll
have digital information overlaid on
everything we see every day we've been
working hard to make this happen and
we'd like your support to make this
IndieGoGo campaign a reality and take
headphones for the next level of your
acts
this is Jeff and this is his exercise
routine
he works hard to build up his cardio and
muscle he also wants to lose weight but
it takes energy and time to burn away
the pounds Jeff would stay in the gym
and continue to fight for weight loss
results but he needs to get to work
imagine if you can take your weight loss
regime with you to the office and burn
calories all day now there is a
revolutionary technology that allows you
to do just that
introducing the thin ice fast a slick
wearable embedded with cooling
technology that forces your body to burn
extra calories when I first got this
idea I had this bolted realization that
this could be a game-changer in the
weight loss industry the thin ice fest
is comfortable and lightweight and will
help you shed pounds even as you sleep
the vest can even wait until you are in
deep sleep before activating so the
technology won't make you cold
it will just make you thinner the thin
ice fest is also discreet enough to be
worn under regular clothing so you can
use it anytime day or night go to bed
wake up how does the thin ice vest help
produce calorie burning using cold
temperatures the body responds by
revving up and burning fat to keep your
blood warm the process is called cold
temperature thermogenesis that's really
ingenious solution anything that I could
just wear day to day that would help me
lose weight would be an absolute asset
there are certain people out there that
we all love to hate and these are the
people who can eat whatever they'd like
to and not gain any weight and what this
product is actually able to do is give
you those characteristics by speeding up
your metabolism
I'm a gamer so having a cheat code is
something I'm all about another
innovative part of the thin ice system
is the Bluetooth connected mobile app it
allows you to adjust the temperature of
the technology to your comfort levels
you can also track the calories you're
burning second-by-second and if you want
to take things to the next level
the app will recommend special diet and
exercise routines to help you lose
weight like a champ thin ice is getting
ready to ship out its 1.0 version this
quarter but the 2.0 version of the
technology will be sleeker have a longer
battery life and can be taught to
respond to your body temperature so it
can keep you comfortably cool or in a
weight loss zone as the environment or
your body changes then ice need your
generous support to put this
revolutionary technology into your hands
in exchange for that support you'll be
among the first to receive the thin ice
system this comes with the thin ice vest
the mobile app the e-book a body
sculpting cream and a transdermal
caffeinate bracelet to keep your energy
high and your appetite at bay the only
thing I really got left is uh where do I
buy all of these
the thin ice system is the most advanced
and effortless weight loss system on the
planet all we need now is you then ice
