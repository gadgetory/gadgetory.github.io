reinventing security for the things that
you care about it's a small light motion
detector that alerts you when someone
gets into your things every day millions
of guns and other valuables are
supposedly secure and things like
closets jewelry boxes gun safes and
storage units but who's watching your
stuff when you're not around and how do
you truly know it's safe every year up
to 600 thousand guns are stolen and many
are used in suicide accidents and crimes
despite the growing popularity of gun
safes here are the problems
Colonel arms are designed for houses and
not saves gun owners don't want smart
technology that could restrict the use
of their firearms I decided to change
that and that's why I developed sim tech
a simple and effective way to monitor
any enclosed space like your gun safe
the moment your safe is opened sim tech
sends you a text alert over a cellular
connection which is more reliable than
Bluetooth or Wi-Fi it's an extra layer
of security for the things that you care
about it's sleek and portable and it
uses infrared motion and light so there
are no false positives a common problem
for other sensors the battery can last a
full year on a single charge and because
it uses cellular connection you can take
it anywhere in the world without
additional setup I created sim tech to
help people understand what's going on
with their guns and their valuables
someone close to me almost took their
life with a gun and as an alumni of
Virginia Tech I understand all too well
what can happen when guns get into the
wrong hands my gun earning friends tell
me that there's no easy way to reliably
monitor their saves but nobody wants a
product that could potentially restrict
the use of their guns and that's why I
developed sim tech a smart sensor that
can be used anywhere in anything to help
keep you and your things safe
gun owners around the country have been
testing Simtek and we've received great
feedback engineering and design are
complete and we're ready for mass
production
so back us today and know when your
belongings are accessed wherever they're
stored
hi I'm sorry um and this is a
traditional French press it's been the
best way to make coffee for a really
long time even though this makes amazing
coffee it has its challenges one of the
biggest problems with French press is
cleanup which is also why most people
don't use it to solve the challenges of
a traditional French press I applied to
my engineering and physics background to
develop the right press with the right
press when you pressed out on the
plunger it forces the grounds to our
patented removable bottom chamber it's a
simple twist off this makes cleanup
really easy the right press has other
great tools built in to ensure a
consistent during ritual water
temperature is one of the most important
factors in brewing great coffee that's
why we built a thermometer right here in
the lid take it out and put it into your
water before you mix in your coffee blue
is too cold red is too hot and green is
perfect timing
is another critical part of the brewing
process we've built an hourglass into
the right press set for the exact amount
of time coffee should brew when the
hourglass is finished it's time to
plunge your perfect cup
the whole process is simple which is
what your morning ritual should be the
right press comes in stainless steel and
matte black it also comes in a half
liter option please consider adding the
right press to your morning ritual by
supporting this campaign because the
most important part of your day deserves
to be perfected
for several days last year my home city
of Seoul had a worst airport in the
world
ariel stayed inside where sometimes the
air was even worse
my team was already working on probable
indoor air quality monitor but this
inspired us to make one that's even
better
that's how we created Piko Piko combines
numerous sensors into one tiny i mean
nearly tiny packs that attaches to your
smartphone it includes your laser based
particle sensors for measuring cancer
closing p.m. 10:00 and PM 2.5 finders
sensors for carbon dioxide and VOCs on
hygrometer for measuring humidity we
even threw in a thermometer for to
measure we made it our smartphone
connected device so you can measure and
track everything through the app the
code is almost related promise
production we have fully tested our
prototype with have front and an
institute of technology with finalized
design and we lined up great Factory now
we just need help from in the global
trackers like you to help us bring
people to the world oh yeah if you
curious about our technology we have
details on everything on our IndieGoGo
page
you
my name is Malkovich I was born in his
Serbia in small town war and I came in
Belgrade to study industrial design when
I was a younger together with my brother
we will plant different kinds of seeds
in plastic caps I was a fascinating with
the growing with the plants with the
nature so I came up with a great idea
how to design something that it's
combining like product design and some
kind of nature element will make a lamp
that is first primary function is to
like the the living room but then I put
a grass in it so you have various of
combination with greens and lightning
I would like to be those designers that
make high quality products but also I
would like to make her some design that
has some story to to express some
emotion
all my designs is inspired by simplicity
with form with object and my thoughts of
industrial design that needs to be in
minimalistic form so you don't need you
know the famous quotes is the less is
more so that is why the design is
substrate
I totally will be a painter one day some
famous painter like Leonardo or maybe
one God but also I really like technical
drawings and 3d models so when you work
like in painting and drawing you work
just in two dimensions but when you work
with industrial product you work in 3d
dimension and you you can make products
that you can see and touch so it gives
you more freedom to experience when you
normally want to plan something you will
plant in soil but with this product you
will plant just with water and with the
help of LED lights and that's why this
product is like combination with this to
the green colors is scientifically
proven it feels relaxing for the eyes
and the whole process of growing plants
it has been officials for people similar
to meditation
each product tells some kind of story
and this story grassland provides that
you need to stop and to think about
nature that to provide some balance your
inner balance so grass lamb gives you
that balance with nature so you have
that close your connection this kind of
product is suitable for family you know
children will be very interesting to
play with plants and parents will be
taught them how to grow something
for me design is art it's maybe it's
more than that
it's a tool that express my emotion and
it's a great connector with people
you
