that enables your existing headphones or
speakers to receive wireless Wi-Fi or
from any source each user simply takes a
battery-powered sound pop from the base
station and plugs in any pair of
headphones the result instant - T
wireless audio for the whole travel most
wireless headphone systems are bulky and
expensive and often designed for only
one user we designed echo because we
believe everyone should be able to use
their headphones or speakers to enjoy a
phenomenal wireless listening experience
echo is specifically designed to
accommodate multiple users up to four or
more can listen together at the same
time it's built in Wi-Fi technology
delivers high quality ultra-low latency
sound for a real-time listening
experience it's perfect for movies music
gaming and more echo delivers a highly
customized listening experience that's
designed to fit each user's preference
each sound puck has individual volume
controls while the smart mobile app
controls equalizer settings streaming
settings and more it even has parental
controls like volume limiting to help
ensure safe listening for kids
we designed echo because we wanted to
create a high quality social wireless
listening experience that our expensive
wireless headphones simply couldn't
provide we wanted something powerful
enough to create an audiophile grade
listening experience it's simple enough
for the whole family to enjoy something
that untethered you that allows you more
freedom and better range in Bluetooth or
RF
you
that's very good extraordinary
although equipment makers produce their
products as if we all have the exact
same here when in fact just like we have
to need fingerprints we all have unique
hearing friends Emil Maps a hearing
print for each year and entails the
sound by filling in the missing
frequencies bringing a hearing to the
obstacle level and letting you
experience sound like never performed
getting started is easy first you map
out the unique hearing prints through
the app then you simply connect audio to
whatever you want to listen to and
that's actually you can watch movies
enjoy swimming music and this is the or
other audio part of your life knowing
that has been tailored just for you
there is a range of frequencies that the
human ear is sensitive to and each gear
has different sensitivities across that
range and that is the reason why audio
should not be on the size fits all is
well known that listening to sound and
large volumes damages one's hearing and
that loss can be permanent
not only can emil provide you with audio
like you've never heard it before
but because it customizes it
specifically for you
it helps you to hear at lower volumes
this will spare your hearing and provide
you with clarity of sound for your
lifetime all will accurately Maps the
killing print for each year and then
tailors the South to adhere all the
audio as it head but don't take my word
for it listen to what others have to say
here we are going to try to find out
what you're hearing printers so you
should hear loopy pings out each year we
try six times and that's where we map
out the whole year this is what your
audio sounds like without enhancement
this is for you
oh it's really cool you can really tell
the difference the trouble the bass it
was all very clear much clearer than
before I like the idea that this is also
a bit about kind of picking your ears
sound we're not a lot better with the
thing on that's good
cool I love it yeah thanks
the product is made from a solid piece
of aluminum to be extremely lightweight
yet durable we want it to make a product
that really embodies simplicity
functionality portability even Mustang
massive natural way today you hear a lot
about audio advancements such as glasses
falcomon a high on the top is a great
achievement that is good listen one
important factor your unique here we
have been working on this technology
since 2000 and we're now ready for
manufacturing with your support and help
we can now finally share audio with
world thank you and happiness
hi my name is Anthony and I'm a founding
partner of mighty Audio mighty plays
your Spotify music on the go without a
smartphone it's the perfect device for
your active life and it's the first of
its kind
no other product currently on the market
lets you play your Spotify music without
being connected to a smartphone mighty
was born from personal frustration with
the current on-the-go music experience
several years ago I ditched music
downloading for music streaming the only
thing missing after I switched was a
seamless and integrative experience
during my workouts fast forward to today
and every option to stream music still
requires a smart phone while exercising
we all know how annoying it is to work
out with a bulky smartphone the phones
are only getting bigger more expensive
and consuming more battery life and
heaven forbid if you drop your phone
iPod shuffles are still around but they
don't have any streaming capabilities
and let's not forget the painful syncing
process that requires cords and
computers smartwatches and trackers I've
hit the scene but many of them still
can't play Spotify music and the ones
that do still require you to have your
smart phone so it kind of defeats the
purpose I was shocked that there was no
product out there that solved my problem
so I thought to myself well if no one
else is gonna create this product then
I'm gonna give it a shot my tea is very
easy to setup syncing music never
requires chords and computers just
Bluetooth and your smart phone after you
download the app onto your phone and
turn on the device that will
automatically detect your vices to pair
with via bluetooth once connected you'll
be asked to sign into your Spotify
account after logging in you can sync
all your playlists onto the mighty
device in the same way that you would
sing playlists for offline play on your
phone on here you'll see all your
current playlists as well as how much
memory you're using
after a quick sync your music is on your
mighty and you're ready to go no more
phone required at this point we honestly
think a screen is unnecessary we are
proud to be the first ones to bring a
device like this to market we're ultra
focused on this one problem and we want
to solve it elegantly and simply music
is a part of almost everyone's life and
so we want mighty to be the bridge
between your music and your fitness so
if you're a Spotify member and you've
been asking yourself why doesn't this
exist please help us make this product a
reality say goodbye to your smartphones
and iPod shuffles and be mighty
you
do any of your earbuds fall out
sometimes
or worse have you ever felt that the
wires from your earbuds were
inconvenient especially when playing
sports now you have an option
