get our shoes off the dream is walking
barefoot on the beach and ideally

need to be protected flip-flops and
other type of sandals have a design that
haven't evolved for centuries they are
inefficient and old-fashioned let's
change that introducing the eggwin a
jungle like the iguana fresh shoes the
jungle is inspired by the Amazonian
Indians that used to dip their feet
directly into natural latex to create a
second skin thereby protecting their
feet with our new concept the ultra
minimal piece of technical rubber will
only wrap around your big toe and your
heel
by doing so it secures a thick and soft
ergonomic sole they assemble together
like a 3d puzzle and guess what it holds
the feeling is amazing it is literally
as if carpet was set in front of your
feet at all times the Iguana jungle lets
you walk as if you were barefoot on any
type of ground put them on and walk like
never before

percent made in Portugal there are two
types of sole available the first type

hi I'm Steve and this is my chroma
camera
I've been building and shooting cameras
for bloss 15 20 years I've always built
one-off customs and requests and very
specific cameras and excited that there
wasn't a single large for my camera that
fitted my own needs I'm a father of two
so I don't get as much time as I'd
probably like to take pictures so my
idea behind chroma camera was to build
something that's that's light that's
simple to carry and you can just pick up
and go at which here isn't that common
in large format photography so the the
beauty of the chroma is its light it
weighs just over a kilo it's unique as
it's made from laser-cut acrylic so it
can be made in any number of colors and
it also folds up small for transport and
usability technically the the chroma is
different to other offerings and their
uses a technical form standard so I have
complete independent movements on the
front standard and which can be locked
out individually which means you have
much more control over my final image
the back is a rotating back it has
embedded magnets so there's no clips to
lose brackets to break or any difficulty
to to move the back it literally snaps
off and snaps back on it's been designed
to use standard four by five dark light
holders I'm also working on brackets to
use roll film box and graph lock
accessories - I've been working on the
chroma design for the past two years
I've gone through about seven different
iterations as my workshop will show you
but I'm now at the point of up in this
working prototype if you do choose to
back my campaign your camera will be
ready to make and it will be delivered
as a spare this design if you have any
questions please do get in touch thanks
watching the video
