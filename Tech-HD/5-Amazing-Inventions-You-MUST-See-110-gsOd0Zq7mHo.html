hello kick-started responsive support by

when the new iPhone was released we saw
it as the pinnacle of modern design and
technology but then we saw the iPhone
battery case it's bulky and it looks
ugly just like all the others
we asked ourselves could it be better
the answer was yes and so we invented
thin case thin case is the world's
thinnest all-in-one iPhone battery case
this incredibly thin protective case
that's just five millimeters of
thickness to your iPhone it's extremely
durable and offers maximum protection
every case has a raised front lip that
works as a shield to prevent the screen
from hitting the ground when
accidentally dropped on top of that it's
unique design folds out into a kickstand
allowing for hands-free usage anytime
thin case is super powerful with 3000
milliamp s-- you have more than double
your iPhone's battery life that's 14
more hours of video games movies are
talktime and more than 40 hours of music
listening and speaking of listening to
music with the introduction of iPhone 7
you may be missing your favorite pair of
headphones so thin case brings back the
3.5 millimeter audio jack now you can
charge your phone and listen to music at
the same time just like the old days
thin case is also intelligent equipped
with modern charge through technology
thin case enables charge and sync
functions while connected to a computer
your iPhone recharges first and then the
thin case recharges itself the LED power
indicator lets you know at a glance how
much juice is left install thin case in
a single click and rest easy knowing
your iPhone will never let you down
again
has it ever occurred to you that the
watchband doesn't always need a buckle
in a loop because it certainly crossed
our mind being at the heart of the West
wrapped industry for the past three
decades we couldn't help but notice that
all the innovation goes into the watch
itself and never into the band even
though it takes up 75% of the reason so
we decided to shake up the industry and
create not just something new but
something that has never been seen
before I gave my team some kind of a
challenging brief the band had to be
simple solid age resistant downright
reversionary filter comfortable and of
course swiss male for months we worked
day in day out until we finally came up
with an idea patent and a brand the lab
and new moon were born we knew we want
to something big revolutionary is one
way to describe the ladder uncomplicated
is another the two half of the strap
simply pressed together an internal grip
reinforces the fastening system on the
wrist while tractive effort is spread
across the multiple elements that all
the strap in place for maximum
resistance so in one word the lab is an
Apple watch band that is so unique in
its shape and use you just have to touch
it explore it and play around with it we
got rid of some of the basics but not
everything went out the window we still
meet the toughest standard and comply
with regulation the elastomer we use
called @km is a matter here you will
normally only find on new tree watches
it does an age till soft to the touch
plus it's highly resistant and order
free no words can describe the lab
experience its symbols design the feel
the weight fasten and how you can
express yourself by mixing and matching
colors so get out there and grab you lad
experience the joy of pure simplicity
the ID is one thing manufacturing is
another that's why we teamed up with the
creative and multi award-winning
designer than jamming Huber strong and
design without compromising comfort the
lab is one-of-a-kind we want to show the
world that the idea that crossed our
mind a few months ago wasn't just pie in
the sky that the band still plays a big
role in your watch experience and there
is still room for innovation only you
can tell us if this is what's making
let's start the watch band revolution
together</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
