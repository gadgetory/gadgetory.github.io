custom perfectly fitted soundly they are
medical grade silicone custom fitted to
the exact shape of your ear not the
average here not a similar year your ear
sound holes are earbuds that deliver
exceptional sound quality and fit
perfectly to your ears so you never have
to sell I wear ear buds all the time and
I always have trouble with them falling
out a marathon runner so I get a certain
amount of distance and I get all sweaty
they just tend to slip right out love to
have something that would be more molded
to my ear this is what it's like to
exercise with regular year but they fall
out don't fit in which causes you
discomfort don't block background noise
causing you to increase the volume it's
the problem for people that work around
construction work and airplanes them but
it's also a problem for kids now more
and more kids are listening to their
mobile devices with earbuds that don't
fit we're going to start seeing 30 40
and 50 year olds with noise related
hearing loss creating perfectly fitted
molds is fast and easy press into your
ear and wait 8 minutes to them to harden
gently remove mail back and we'll create
ear buds stay in when you're active fit
comfortably and block out background of
it protecting your ears tumbles are
backed by medical science and are
available in both wired and wireless and
we just thought a broader group of
people could benefit from this I knew
that this was a solution that I wanted
to bring to more people who have the
same problems as me and that's how sound
mold is created samples we're ready to
ship as soon as the campaign ends so get
yours now right now right now
you
you
Oh
it happens when we use our computers it
happens when we exercise it happens to
all of us every day
tension modern life requires repetitive
movements that create tension
the problem with tension is that if it
isn't released effectively or often
enough it can cause injuries that
prevent you from staying active earning
a living and enjoying your life I'm a
runner I do CrossFit and I'm a dad
carrying a baby around all day and it's
tough because sometimes injuries prevent
me from doing what I love so I'm a
server at a restaurant and I'm on my
feet all day when I show up to work with
tension with my legs and in my wrist I
don't do as well so I tried the foam
roller and I didn't like it I could have
to roll around on the floor for 20
minutes I like biking to work
I like bike around to meet people in the
city sometimes because I bite a lot I
build up tension in my arm
I have tried stretching but often it
doesn't quite release the tension
hi I'm Joe Linda the creator pro squeeze
my career is a professional massage
therapist almost ended because of
injuries in my wrist and hand I tried
every felt massage tool on the market
but nothing delivered the deep targeted
pressure that my body needed to recover
and keep my daily tension from building
up foam rollers and massage balls are
great but if you have tension in your
arms or legs you have to work pretty
hard to create enough pressure and it's
difficult to pinpoint that pressure
right where you need it a couple of
years ago I had an idea so I hired an
engineer and started designing a new
self massage tool it would be more
effective for arm and leg tension I
wanted the tool to be lightly portable
and easy to use most importantly I
wanted it to deliver targeted pressure
with minimal effort
after two years of engineering and
prototyping I created prophase oh my god
just is just not alone I don't even have
to do anything that just feels great
with pro swede you can just chill on the
couch and watch a movie while your
attention is being released for you
pro squeeze really helps to target those
specific areas in which I'm feeling pain
and alleviate my symptoms fast my
favorite part is that I can flip pro
space right on the spot that's hurting
and I can just leave it there and I can
watch the show and I can chill out and I
don't have to do anything and it just
keeps working the muscle until the
tension is huge so just put the foam
pads around a tight spot on your arm or
leg give a few squeezes of the lever
until the tension is just right then
move your wrist or ankle to enhance the
stretch and feel your tension start to
melt I spend about six to eight hours a
day at my desk and I noticed that
throughout the day
I have tightness in my hand and my form
by using Pro Sweden I like how I can
remain at my desk continue working while
using it and it really lets me target in
areas that need the most work my first
time using proteins I couldn't believe
how good at health it really pointed the
exact spot that needed to be released
which was amazing I've been doing body
work for over thirty years and I've seen
a lot of massage tools out there
probably the biggest difference that I
feel with pro squeeze is that it grabs
tissue and stretches tissue that's for
most of our problems come your soft
tissue my view as raw fur is that we
want to lengthen short tissue that's
preventing the body from working the way
it's supposed to work
your body is free from tension you just
feel better
it could be more productive at work
perform better as an athlete and have
more energy for living life
proce lead alleviated my tension and
extended my career and now I need your
help
to share it with the world please back
and share this project now so we can get
the first run of pro squeeze
manufactured and into your hand thank
you so much for your support
our iPhones had become such an integral
part of our daily lives as soon as
charging it a cord plugged into the wall
gets the job done but inconveniences our
daily life whether it's having to reach
behind a table to where the cord has
fallen we're searching for the chord
among the many that clutter your desktop
everything important in your life has a
place time your iPhone does too
we worked hard reinventing the iPhone
dock during the past 15 months to bring
you pure minimalistic design combined
with cutting-edge technology and
innovation to provide your daily life
with an experience that matches your
iPhones ingenuity the lock an IO dock
the world's first might buy certified
dock featuring a lightning receptacle
and audio out the internal design was
engineered to precisely allow the
lightning connector to flex forward 15
degrees enabling safer and faster
undocking hey babe hey I noticed left
the kitchen sink on are you calling me
from inside the house maybe
works with thick or thin cases
interchangeable support pads provide
both vertical and lateral support just
use any lightning cable to connect
directly to the lock an i/o doc
available on all six iPhone colors
designed for one-handed undocking with
minimal effort undock your iPhone in one
fluid motion we set out to design a
product that gives your iPhone a place
in your life outside your pocket
hello from Como audio I'm Tom Davis oh I
started the company a year ago and
through a lot of help from our backers
at Kickstarter we successfully launched
two new products last year one called
solo and the other duet oh we had a very
successful campaign last year we did 500
percent of our goal and had thousand
people from around the world support us
and one of the most often asked
questions was when are you guys going to
come out with a portable version of this
and I like to say that our new project
is called amico which means friend in
Italian and this little friend can do
just what the other products did operate
very simply by just pressing a button
now without needing your computer or
without needing an app and listen to
music whether it be from internet radio
FM Spotify and they'll do it without
having to be plugged in a tethered to a
power system and what I did - to give a
handle without having one of these big
ugly things with creative port which
actually has finger holes in it so that
it's easy to to move it from place to
place the amico comes with a battery
operated or run for over eight hours
between charging everything works from
the unit itself however it does come
with a remote control so if you're
across the room you can turn the volume
up or down or select among different
sources and it also has an app so that
if you want to link these together with
your other combo audio equipment and
different rooms in your house and
control them from a central spot the app
is there to do that but once again you
don't need the app and you don't need
the remote control to do almost every
function that this product will do
and like we did with solo and duet oh we
spent a lot of time and attention on the
details and the cabinet construction for
instance very robust because we put a 60
watt amplifier in here and a three inch
long throw driver we get a lot of power
out of this and we need to have a very
strong box but since we know this one
could be used in some higher moisture
areas we use marine-grade plywood with
waterproof blues much like you do with
the interior of a boat so it's
marine-grade plywood with a teak coating
on it and this will allow it to be in
rather high moisture areas like we are
also done with Solo in Duetto
the control panel the knobs and
everything are metal they're not plastic
we do this not only for longevity but
for the look fit feel and finish of the
product so now with amico it's truly
great you can be listening to Spotify
and walk from the living room to the
kitchen or out on your Terrace you can
take it out by the swimming pool you can
even take it on a camping trip and
Bluetooth your music to it hook it up to
your phone as a hotspot you're really
pretty much free to do as you please to
get your music when you want it wherever
you want it
so this is what it's all about
being able to listen to your favorite
music and high-fidelity wherever you
want to whenever you want to from
whatever source you want to so
Kickstarter backers we hope you like
what we're doing we think it's a lot of
fun we love it we hope you back us
thanks very much and at the end of the
day enjoy the music</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
