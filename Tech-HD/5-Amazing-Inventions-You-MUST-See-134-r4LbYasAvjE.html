it just doesn't make sense to me that in
this day and age were still forced to
fragment where we store our files so
this is TARDIS it's what we built we
start with a solid unibody aluminum
enclosure we use the fastest mlc flash
memory modules paired with the fastest
4k flash controllers of the market would
take all that and we put it into a
package where the data is transferred
through 14-karat gold contacts and then
the cool part is what's happening on the
inside here's how it works
TARDIS pair seamlessly merges with your
MacBook so instead of having two
separate drives or later five now you
have two drives that are paired working
together as one the files can use most
of prioritize to obtain the same speed
to come to expect from there on it's
automatic nothing to manage nothing to
do it just works and it's really fast
TARDIS creates a new product category
and it's a true end-to-end solution for
anyone that's run out of storage space
on a modern macro control
everything's happening on the back end
it happens automatically I have been
seamless Lee
one of the hardest things about being a
parent is constantly worrying about if
your son or daughter is healthy and
whether or not they're being taken care
of kato is the world's first health and
wellness checkup we just for young kids
kids all the way from 3 up to 10 years
we really created this to allow parents
to have valuable insights about a
child's health and activity while
allowing kids to be kids just have fun
thrilled about technology that's
designed and built to connect parents
and children together to the rebel has
an accelerometer a PPG for heart rate
have sweat sensor to measure how active
they are and a temperature sensor we
combine all of these streams of data to
make these informed insights that the
parents can then learn from there's only
so much information you can get from a
kid especially when they're younger
sometimes they're not able to verbalize
exactly what's going on the kiddo app
takes the data and provides you not just
Vince I somehow they are in that moment
but how to make things better it gives
you steps to take to help your habit
with kiddo as the Union today I'm
couraging eating healthy and how they
have it during the day when I'm at work
and I'm curious how my daughter is doing
I can look at the app to know my child
is healthy and being active and at the
end of the day I can get a sense of how
much sleep they're getting at night
having that objective data saying your
child's heart rate is at the appropriate
rate they're healthy they're doing well
or your child is actually feeling some
stresses maybe we need to talk to them
and there's a way to kind of intervene
before things go too far along I was
able to gather from kiddo that my child
might be getting sick I would be more
concerned with what they're eating how
much water they're drinking and how much
sleeps are getting at night and make
adjustments to their scheduled
the goal was to create a device for the
kids so they end up loving it it has to
be fun it had to be cool it had to be
engaging they can change the top covers
depending on their personality they can
play tag
with it they can control the different
toys and kids can create music with it
launching this campaign now because
we've got a great team we have the
product it's just about ready we've done
a ton of research the only thing we need
is you to make this happen by reaching
out to the Kickstarter community were
basically making you part of our
founding team without you we couldn't
make this happen I think the kid is an
amazing tool to let us know that all
this hard work we've put into raising
our children is working
