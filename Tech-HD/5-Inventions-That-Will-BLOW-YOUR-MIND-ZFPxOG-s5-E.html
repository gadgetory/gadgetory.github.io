I'm Brett lead engineer designer and
inventor of super screen we all love
watching and enjoying content on our
smartphones but even large phones offer
a subpar viewing experience we rarely
use our tablets because our phones are
so much more personalized and functional
I knew there had to be a way to make a
low cost high quality touchscreen device
they could harness the powers of smart
phones you are together that's why we
created super script the most affordable
large screen device that doesn't need a
fake
okay super screen has a rechargeable
battery that lasts 12 hours and an
operating range of up to 100 feet the
integrated stereo speakers and Bluetooth
had some compatibility to provide
impeccable - led audio and the built-in
HD camera makes taking pictures and
videos easier than ever before our

and transmit with no perceived delay
super screen will ship with
compatibility for nearly all Apple and
Android devices and will be compatible
for new models in the future
our team has decades of experience
bringing products to market and we'd
love for you to join us to make super
screen success thank you for your
support
you need appearance and ability it is a
modular compact fishing rod imagine
being able to travel anywhere in the
world with it and you don't have to
worry about damaging or breaking it you
can swap parts according to what methods
you are using and what this you are
trying to catch or do you plan on taking
the smallest fishing rod the minimum
size of the smallest version for
transportation is only 10 inches so you
can even put it in your pocket all
components of the system are compatible
with each other thanks to the removable
trigger you can equip it with all types
of existing reel it weighs about 7
ounces depending on the type of spring
and the handle stainless steel springs
hold CNC machine sea water resistant
aluminum real feed hard wood handles the
result of it through the unbreakable
fishing rod which is made last for
decades and we have many different
packages available we are sure you will
find the point of a time you don't have
to worry about your choices because you
can extend your inventory at any time
with only a little after
one of the problems with
our medical system is that you only
connect with the system every now and
then we are in the biggest tsunami of
personalisation in the world but for
medicine we are still waiting in line in
an emergency room with your smartphone
you can find out about anything anywhere
but what you can't find is information
about your own body in 2005 I spent
almost a year in hospital with one of my
children I started to look at all the
machines and all the lead after a couple
of weeks I understood it and it was very
liberating to have that knowledge
I want to make company that you know
gives people this number the Scout will
allow people to see the fingerprint of
their health in very my new detail when
you have a visit with a physician or you
go to an ER the first thing they do is
check the vital signs to see where
you're at right now
this is hold it to your forehead in a
second you have all of it the Scout
gives you your heart rate your blood
pressure your temperature your
respiratory rate and your oxygen levels
in your front garden Scout works
everywhere it analyzes all your readings
and uncertainty when people have a scout
they can connect with their physician
and when it was never possible before we
are competing in the XPrize this is
important because what we aim to do with
scanadu scout is to bring the five
senses into a single recording device we
will have essentially a doctor in the
family and this is the ultimate consumer
device for medicine we put a lot of
thought into giving you medical grade
data that's easy to understand records
it and enables you to communicate with
your physician and make smart decisions
together we have a relationship with
NASA although their medicine was never
actually destined to be for consumers it
was listened to be for astronauts in the
space station this is exactly the kind
of response platform that we need this
allows us to go further and enhance for
performance right now when you buy a cup
of coffee you can see that transaction
on your smartphone even before you leave
the store with the scout
you can see the impact on your health
before you leave the store super parents
you can find out early in the day if
your child is going to be sick later
today or not it's something that's good
for all of us this is one of the most
exciting times in the history of
Medicine in the history of Health we can
finally understand our bodies and adjust
them in ways that it's never been
possible before but that takes all of us
working together to join us in making
this reality
I love getting great food and I love
sharing great food that I made cooking
can be stressful especially when making
new food cooking for a family or
entertaining guests how many times have
you made a recipe well once but can't
duplicate the results of the next time
when you serve to friends hi I'm Chris
we wanted an easy way for aspiring cooks
like me to make food perfectly every
time so we created the Paragon induction
cooktop a critical element of cooking
food rightist temperature Paragon takes
the guesswork out of cooking with this
wireless sensor that communicates the
precise temperature of your food to the
cooktop the cooktop uses a constant
stream of information to adjust the
burner power level so that your food is
cooked to perfection you just set the
temperature and walk away
one of the coolest applications of
Paragon precision cooking is called
sous-vide it's a method that's been used
in top restaurants for years because it
produces consistent results with very
little supervision simply seal the
ingredients in an airtight bag and place
them in a pot of water attach the
magnetic temperature sensor set the
desired temperature and press Start you
can use the optional Paragon mobile app
to find the right time and temperature
for your food in three simple touches
Paragon maintains precise water
temperature to cook food evenly
throughout and once it's done cooking
briefly sear and serve with sous-vide
you can achieve edge to edge medium-rare
medium well or whatever you like with
Paragons precise temperature control you
can be sure that food will be cooked
perfect every time I got into barbecue
because I have a serious passion for
consistency one of the key factors of
achieving restaurant quality is time and
temperature control and that's one of
the reasons I love the Paragon we wanted
to design a simple counter top cooker
that is both functional and elegant I
don't like having extra stuff in my
kitchen so I wanted to develop an
appliance that can do several things and
do them well Paragon is versatile it can
deep-fry sous-vide sear saute or just
maintain food at serving temperature you
can remotely check on the progress of
your food and
get notifications when it's ready
Paragon will hold food at the right
temperature until ready to serve so you
can focus on what you want to do with
the Paragon induction cooktop you can
easily master the art of precision
cooking Paragon is coming about through
collaboration with a community of
designers engineers and food scientists
who are fueling the evolution of home
cooking using our open source API
community members are already working on
additional application like brewing beer
and making candy and it's just the
beginning
with your help we will improve the app
lower cost of production and enhanced
features I've been developing appliances
for over 13 years and Paragon is the
product that I have always wanted I'm
excited to finally bring it to market so
that you can enjoy it too by backing us
on IndieGoGo you will become one of the
first people to master the art of
precision cooking</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
