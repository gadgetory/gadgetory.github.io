for thousands of years humans have been
filling their notebooks and then just
buying more since the note book industry
has given up on innovation hey what's
this the notebook Hemingway wrote on
that's cool I guess we're from rocket
book and we make notebooks from the
future at rocket book we are already
famous for inventing the wave notebook
the smart notebook that can be erased in
the microwaves we've shipped 100,000
waves to satisfied customers around the
world
others may stop there but we are maniacs
obsessed the blending old fashioned
notebooks with future and awesome so
we've spent a year in the rocket lab
designing a new notebook that feels like
pen and paper but is endlessly reusable
and completely integrated with your
digital lifestyle
introducing the Everlast notebook from
rocket book the Everlast brings cloud
scalability to pen and paper simply
write scan and erase imagine 1,000 of
your favorite notebooks in one sleek
design that fits in your backpack here's
how it works
Everlast pages look and feel like paper
but they're actually constructed from a
polyester composite rather than would
you write on the Everlast using any pen
from the pilot FriXion line which are
available in-store and online writing on
the Everlast feels perfectly natural and
smooth and as the ink dries it forms a
complete bond to the polyester page so
it won't rub off but what makes this
formulation so unique is that each page
can be wiped completely clean with a
moist towel so it can be used over and
over and over again the ever last
notebook is also compatible with the
Rocket book app so before you wipe your
notes off the page you can blast them
online to your favorite cloud services
in a fraction of a second rocket book
machine vision
scans enhances and sends each page to
the specific destination they belong on
the cloud services you already use each
ever last notebook page has seven
symbols set up the rocket book app to
assign each symbol to a location within
Dropbox Google Docs Evernote or many
other services you could configure your
diamond to send meeting notes directly
to your shared team folder in Dropbox or
students could configure their star
symbol to send notes right to a math
folder in Google Drive so you can make
your list break out that diagram or
color in that drawing then tomorrow
start your day with a brand new notebook
with the ever last one notebook becomes
one thousand notebooks the utility of
the cloud and the joy of pen and paper
that's rocket book
