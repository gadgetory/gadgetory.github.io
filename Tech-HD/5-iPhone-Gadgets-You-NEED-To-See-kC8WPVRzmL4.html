with the air case you don't have to
worry about your battery dying when you
need it most air case didn't invent
battery cases they just perfected them
at three point eight millimeters this is
the thinnest iphone battery case on the
market compared to this recently
released in popular $99 phone case file
the air case is lighter thinner and
better looking so you can have longer
lasting battery life and a fall into
fits comfortably in your pocket not to
mention the air case is a fraction of
the price air case iphone battery case
doubles your battery life which means
you can have 12 more hours of phone time
10 hours of video player 10 more hours
of gameplay eight more hours of internet
surfing and 50 more hours of standby you
can even check the current battery level
with a button on the side the best part
is that it looks and acts just like a
protective case you can charge it and
transfer data without removing it
business as usual with the quick charge
technology both your phone and the
battery case are charged simultaneously
which means is sipping in twice as much
power at the same time one more thing
we've optimized the circuit design so it
won't overheat like most battery phone
cases currently the air case comes in
three colors black white and pink and it
is compatible with your iPhone 6 6 plus
6s and 6s plus air case the all-in-one
phone case that you cannot
get one and thank you for your support
I'm Dave one of the inventors of the
fusion guitar we built this instrument
so that everybody can experience the joy
of playing guitar
creating music with an electric guitar
is an amazing experience but all the
equipment you need is not portable and
it's expensive also learning to play is
challenging to overcome these problems
the fusion guitar combines a traditional
instrument with the most advanced
technology the fusion guitar is the
all-in-one electric guitar it has an
amplifier speakers and battery all built
into the guitar so you can take it with
you wherever you go and the sound
quality is amazing the amp pumps are 20
Watts through three high quality
speakers so you can really enjoy the
awesome tone of the onboard hab and
effects now when you go away for the
weekend your electric guitar and full
guitar rig take up less room in the car
than an acoustic guitar
diffusion guitar has interchangeable
docks making it compatible with iPhone 5
and 6 and ipod touch gen 5 iphone 7 and
ipod touch gen 6 talks will be available
in 2016 the battery lasts up to 12 hours
and charges your iPhone whenever it's
docked so your iPhone won't run out
after just a couple of hours of use the
fusion guitar can also be used as a
traditional electric guitar plug into a
stage amp for live performance guitar
apps have transformed the way people
learn to play guitar learnings become
easier faster and a lot more fun when
you're trying something new the faster
you improve the more motivational it is
so I think what's going to happen with
this type of thing people learn so much
faster because all the tools are there I
mean you're hooked up to the Internet
you've got YouTube lessons tutorials you
can see how it's done it unleashes a
whole range of possibilities in terms of
people playing together recording stuff
that you play on the spot when you're
inspired so you're not losing it
medicine there's going to be an
explosion of creativity that comes out
of this
you
you
with your help we can spread the love of
music around the world with diffusion
guitar the electric guitar you can play
anyway
you
you
let's get straight to the point we
invented this to turn this into a
dual-sim capable phone so if you have to
sub guards one for personal use one for
business one for data and one for calls
one for what you travel and one for when
you're home one for Bruce and one for
Batman you can finally use one single
iPhone 6 no more need to carry a second
phone to accommodate your second line
renamed it to a simple phone sleeve that
you just snap on however its
functionality goes way beyond dual sim
you can message and you can call of
course and you can access all your
contacts from your primary line to your
secondary line and with the use of our
savvy app and these pretty lights it's
easy to know what's going on speaking of
pity we made sure to design the cover to
be subtle and in sync with the iphones
design it complements its aesthetics
without overpowering I know I'm
prejudiced like a father who thinks this
kid is the cutest up but it really is
pretty isn't it
and so are you yeah but what's beauty
without brains we all know what hot spot
does your battery too is actually really
smart it offers you a 3g hotspot it
calculates your internet activity and
adjust its signal accordingly to give
you the longest battery life possible so
that's the brains what about the Brawn
because you can't just be pretty and
smart to get by in this world so that's
why we added the power bank feature that
will fuel your iPhone when it's battery
is running low no more stressing about
getting to an electricity socket quick
beauty brains and brawn the full package
getting all these features back into
this tiny little thing took a lot of
effort two years of effort prototypes
lots of prototypes oops lots and lots of
arguing until we finally agreed on two
and it is our aim to make it as
transparent as possible so now that you
have our ducks in a row and the planning
and finalization process is over all we
need is your support your contribution
will go towards the manufacturing costs
so we can finally turn this
into this
so if you're tired of using two phones
eat a power bank to pull through your
day and want to put an end to hire
roaming goals help us fun too so we can
bring it to life for you and the world
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
