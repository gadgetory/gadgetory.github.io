different the world look I swear to God
well bar is amazing there's so much
information that's conveyed with color
and
you're eating food you're cooking food
you're out for a walk in nature
really what it comes down to is the
accessibility of information of
experiences that colorblind people have
been missing out on in a professional or
academic setting you can't follow the
information because it's color-coded if
you're traveling at 60 miles brake light
comes on you don't see it but also
there's traffic lights I mean you just
can't tell the difference when somebody
puts these glasses on they suddenly
experience colors as being much more
vivid pink like this Wow
I am actually I'm actually throwing in
cromoz grasses contain a special
proprietary material that absorbs
specific wavelengths of light people
write to us and they tell us they feel
like they finally understand color in
chroma
you got a 280-pound manic ride that is
amazing I got to see my first sunrise we
need to get this to every colorblind
child in the world so that they can have
a better educational experience to see
something that we've created go out into
the world and have such a big impact
it's really amazing he's unreal
those are like really strong feel like
I've been seeing hazing my whole life
it's so beautiful
you
awaiting from the electric computer
engineering department and George Mason
University this coming May we're here
we're just going to test out our device
that we use that uses sound frequencies
to extinguish flames I see this device
being applied to a lot of things first
off I think in the kitchen it could be
on top of stove top but eventually I'd
like to see this applied to maybe some
robotics worth it being attached to a
drone and that would be applied to
forest fires or even building fires
where you wouldn't want to sacrifice a
human life
professor Brookline MA Cruz stepped in
to help us this gave us a lot of support
I think as a whole engineering is really
just finding solutions to you know
firing simple solutions to complicated
problems you know engineering is all
about finding a way to make the
impossible possible so that's what we do
you ready whoa where'd you get although
it's time to balloon let me show you we
just connect it to the hose and then you
turn on the water and I'll fill out that
one then that's how you just give it a
shake and they all fall off they tie
himself
yep pretty cool huh yeah hi I'm Josh
Malone inventor of bunch of balloons the
fastest and easiest way to make water
balloons
my kids and I love water balloons while
I sit there for hours filling in time I
tried to think of ways to make it faster
and easier with my kids help I developed
and tested several different techniques
and prototypes finally a few months ago
I invented a bunch of balloons bunch of
balloons filled and ties 100 water
balloons in less than a minute the
design is now complete and we're ready
for production let's see how much faster
and easier bunch of balloons is which
method can make the most balloons in one
minute the old-fashioned way six
balloons tonight eight balloons zorb x'
10 balloons but with bunch of balloons
you can make 100 water balloons in a
minute which team do you want to be on
we always use water balloons for our
annual Boy Scout event we use about
thousand balloons so the day before we
spend the whole day filling and Tiny's
glens imagine the first time I was
introduced to bunch Apple Inc it is
going to save me so much time now
last year I finally learned how to tie
water balloons but it took too long and
I hurt my finger I'm so glad my dad
invented bunch of balloons water
balloons aren't so much work anymore
you're just playing fun we are excited
to launch bunch of balloons on
Kickstarter if you will back and share
our campaign we will be able to purchase
equipment and materials for mass
production
we will manufacture and ship orders to
our earliest customers in just a few
weeks please sign up for one of our
rewards and be one of the first
customers to enjoy the bunch of balloons
advantage in your next water balloon war</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
