most intuitive electric skate ever
created this new emerging market
lightweight electric skates under 15
pounds is a pretty exciting new frontier
it transforms your errands in a
weekender running to this corner store
to pick up vegetables into an activity
that you look forward to you do all the
exact same things that you do on a
traditional longboard skateboard except
now you've got the power to go up a hill
at 20 miles an hour as fans of long
boarding and electric skates we kept
having issues with the existing boards
on the market they were heavy they
looked that with their external motors
and batteries and the belts would break
down and you can't push it or ride it
like a real estate board that's why
we've created an entirely new technology
and it's called Manta drive for the
first time ever we've actually put a
motor inside the wheel of a skateboard
this has allowed us to create a powered
skateboard that feels smooth intuitive
it makes the model if amazingly easy to
use yet powerful
my name is serosa banisky I'm one of the
founder and the main engineering board
theone I've been action sports athletes
our entire lives we actually met when we
respond sir by the same brand
you know from speed flying to
paragliding surfing skating we love
these sports because of the feelings
that created us and that's in large part
due to the feel of the board with the
monoliths in order to create the highest
performance product everything every
aspect of the design had to be done
customer the mental drive technology has
allowed us to get rid of the external
motor and best break down instead of
having a motor outside of the wheel that
turns a belt and that belt turns a gear
in the neck here it turns a wheel
everything's already been integrated
inside the wheel itself so one it looks
really clean but - because there's
nothing that's binding the wheel up once
you hit your top speed you just collide
and you get that coast that's what you
get with a normal skate that's what we
wanted to create with removal of the
external belts and gears we've been able
to reduce the weight significantly to
create such a for thinking product we
knew we had to build a for thinking team
a team of action sport athletes with
engineering and product design skills to
manifest and innovative product monolith
is the only board on the market with
swappable battery packs what this means
that you essentially have a limited
range as soon as you start to run low on
one battery you can just swap the old
for the new so in designing and boards
reflex remote we wanted to focus mainly
on comfort and secondly on usability and
then storage so using this remote should
be completely effortless so we took a
different approach with the remote
design the reflex has a forward-facing
tail this feature will give the rider a
sense of security
you can adjust or even open your hand
while riding and when you close it it'll
be right where you need it to control
the board again in keeping with imports
future for product design we've added
auxiliary USB ports onto the board you
can use this for charging remote or if
you're at the beach and you know the Sun
setting and your phone just ran out of
battery you can charge your phone that
you can get that one last
shot our mobile app gives you complete
control of the electric skate experience
it allows you to customize your speeds
accelerations connect with other riders
and even recap on your latest session if
you're new to Electric skateboards our
beginner mode makes the monolith very
easy to get going for the first time in
addition our advanced and custom
settings allow their user to realize the
full potential and power of the board
we spent years developing this
technology and now we're ready to bring
it to manufacturing but we wouldn't be
here on Kickstarter if we didn't need
your help with your support we'll be
able to invest in the custom molds and
tooling to bring the model at the market
we can't wait for you to shape the
future of electric skates
I can't wait for you to shape the future
of electric states you can't wait for
you to shape the future of 1850
you
hi I'm Laura Enzo our robotic
engineering student and a commuter every
day I take the train going to my
University it takes me one and a half
hour of walking every single day really
too much time I think a lot of you are
in the same situation and we all know
that commuting is both stressful and
time-consuming this made me think how to
move more quickly and with less effort
and get something portable that I could
carry on train and even in class for
this reason I created both there's more
less and lightest electric vehicle in
the world both is more than just an
electric board is the most portable
vehicle out there it's an amazing mean
of transport powerful lightweight easy
to use as marked as more great
revolution in the world of mobility
you
malte let you save time on your daily
commute and three more for your favorite
activities it has a top speed of 21 km/h
in this just as fast as a bicycle it has
a range of about 10 kilometer more than
what you need for the short daily
commute in the city with a length of 60
centimeters is the smallest electric
skateboard in the world with a weight of
4 kilograms it's light enough to be
carried even when not in use with no
effort on your backpack or by hands to
build the balls I got help from my
father a photographer electronics
engineer and drones maker after one year
of prototyping and testing this is the
final version the battery and
electronics are embedded in the wooden
body he has a powerful motor of 2,000
watts of power and it can go up hill and
start from a full stop the inside
batteries are so powerful that can
recharge your devices on the go to the
built-in USB port you can even recharge
completely your iPhone up to 20 times
with the remote controller riving bolt
is easiest playing a video game
whoa I see thank you
where is Italian design bolt is both
modern and practical and it's deck is of
the right size for a comfortable and
safe landing it also has the brake to
stop safely you can think ball like a
compact longboard he has a larger track
for more stability he has bigger wheels
to overcome every obstacle on the street
both is marked with bluetooth for
connectivity we are going to develop a
smart phone app and also integrate it
with wearables both as extremely low
running cost and let you save money on
fuel a complete recharge for entire year
will be less than five dollars on the
and when the sun goes down turn on the
lights and continue to skate we believe
that everyone deserves a better way to
move we want to make both the most
affordable for anyone but to cut down
costs we need an economy of scale our
manufacturers are ready but now we need
your help to stop production applause
that's why we're here on IndieGoGo if
you like the project please tell your
friends and support us to receive
amazing perks thank you
Carbon series boards for evolve it was
developed because I wanted to create a
board that was light high-performance
and and it doesn't look as though it's
electric we have two boards in the
Carbon series the all-terrain is more
for the extreme rider and for the person
who can who wants to commute inner-city
environments and bad terrains and then
when you get onto the carbon street
series that's a more precise
longboarding feel when you ride the
board because it's it's got the drop
three trucks it's got such a low-profile
feel about it it just feels like you're
in total control when you're riding so
the board can actually be converted sort
of within five minutes from the the
all-terrain set up to the to the
longboard Street set up
the benefits to the all-terrain is the
fact that you can pretty much ride this
board anywhere you want without having
to stress about where you're riding I
wanted to create a board for the type of
rider who also wants to go over those
really bad footpaths or the dodgy
inner-city potholes or there's little
lips that the other boards can't really
handle
compared to other all turns on the
market you know that they weigh thirty
to forty kilos whereas this board in
only weighs about sort of ten and a half
11 kilos
I chose carbon fibers because it's light
it's strong and it can be shaped to the
design I needed to make the sport and it
just looks mean we also use a
high-performance high-power brushless
motor by being able to use professional
mountain board wheels there's a few
tires that we can use we can use the
road slicks which is which is great for
pretty much all hard surfaces but if you
want to go that little bit extra you can
also put the off-road tires on it too so
then you'll be able to get it a little
bit more traction if you're going over
the grassy areas all those materials
together aid for a fantastic performance
of the board so it really turns the
board into a super fun machine
the range on the street cabin series is
huge we can get up to about 45
kilometers which is massive it's kind of
unheard of and that's what sort of sets
us apart from other brands on the market
at the moment the the performance in the
battery or power that we get the feel
and ride of the board is fantastic
we've spent the last 18 months
developing that the Carbon series boards
it's been a challenging project but the
end result for us with this has resulted
in a fantastic product that's completely
unrivaled in the marketplace at the
moment
you
how much freedom can you fit in a bag
the freedom of knowledge the freedom
share freedom to dream freedom of
movement now it fits with linky
mobility is free with linky strong
patented folding mechanism it's freedom
in your bag
it's a last mile mobility solution that
means no more traffic no more bus
timetables no more pollution
linkie represents a new generation in
electric mobility with it we want to
improve the way we experience cities the
team behind linky is a group of
passionate travelers wherever we were in
the world we found ourselves wanting a
mode of transportation that is eco
sustainable easy to carry around and
really fun to ride with technical
engineering and sales backgrounds we've
studied last mile mobility and made
linky to fill a gap in that market but
also in our own lives nothing out there
is truly portable so that's why we need
blinky to fit in a bag
one thing that distinguishes link is the
incredible pride with taking attentions
to detail we have worked for two years
to perfect the patented mechanical
system that expands and contracts link
based on our experience in automotive
design our structure uses a layer system
polymers and carbon fiber for a perfect
balance between lightness and rigidity
weighing just 4.9 kilos it's really
sturdy we have put 160 kilos only and we
have ridden hundreds of kilometers my
experience in the electric car industry
is the inspiration behind the
electronics and the battery of linking
we wanted to be able to bring linky on
an aeroplane so we've chosen a fast
charging long-life lithium ion battery
that respects IATA regulation for air
travel
safety is our number-one priority in
designing Linkous powertrain and battery
management solutions we've optimized for
power performance and weight linkage
chargers to 85% of its capacity in just
half an hour with linky
you can ride 15 kilometers climb up 10%
slopes and reach up to 30 km/h link is
made by hand by one person who follows
the project from start to finish we are
ready to go into production but we need
a minimum number of orders to make this
possible your support right now will
have keep cost down so we can guarantee
a great level of service and a truly
exciting electric longboard
you
what challenges do most commuters have
in common they need a bag to store their
daily needs and deal with a constant
rush traffic jams walking miles to get
to public transportation or having to
carry more than just a backpack are all
challenges commuters have in common this
is why we created the best solution for
the urban commuter a backpack that you
can wear roll and ride meet the all-new
move pack we've we engineered movement
to implement not one but two motors
inside the wheel
this makes move act more powerful and
safer than ever before combined with a
beautiful and clean design we took the
time to do what we do best we design you
re prototyping re-engineering basically
reinventing
so we could bring back to you our best
product yet with our exclusive app you
will be able to connect your phone
wirelessly to move back and with a new
built-in speaker and mic you can speak
to move PAC directly like asking for
directions turn right on straight
and since move PAC comes equipped with a
powerful speaker why not connect to your
favorite app and listen to your favorite
playlist while on the go move pack
provides a built-in USB charger that can
charge your phone over 10 times on top
of that move PAC will now have built-in
tracking capability for security in case
your move pack gets stolen or lost
every little detail is important such as
internal lighting that will come in
handy when looking for something in the
bag and as far as the backpack itself
goes not only is its swappable with
different colors and styles but now you
can wear your favorite backpack
independently of the moon pad
move pack is one of
easiest vehicles to master and you don't
have to be a skateboarder to write just
stand on the board using the backpack
for extra support and use the remarkably
small remote for speed and braking and
in case of an emergency
move pack is pretty easy to get off so
there you have it a backpack a personal
transportation a smart luggage and a
personal assistant if you were to buy
all that separately you would spend well
over two thousand dollars but with move
pack you'll save over fifty percent of
that through this exclusive crowdfunding
campaign
we are thrilled to announce the most
important parts of move pack are ready
and with your support we can give our
manufacturers the thumbs up and start
the mass production and get the move
pack shipping to you soon join us for
the ride and together we will change the
way the world moves around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
