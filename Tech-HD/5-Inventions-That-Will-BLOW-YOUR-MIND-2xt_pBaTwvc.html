be a real challenge in and of itself
keeping those videos stable earlier you
can really make a breakout to create an
excellent film we have to keep the
camera steady and smooth
that's know we hope to help
videographers realize their visions
regardless of whether or not they have a
huge improvement all the equipment for
just a one-man operation
we want to give creators freedom of
movement without losing quality or
stability so we created the kyln M the
kyln M is an innovative and portable
3-axis stabilized gimbal with it you can
take mirrorless cameras action cameras
or your cell phone virtually anywhere
and capture smooth video at nearly any
the kyln M was designed for
videographers to help them catch the
perfect moment without the need for
commercial equipment the kyln M II lists
nofas multi axis stabilisation system
you can easily eliminate all camera
shake making your videos look
professional than clear that cut is all
about filming freedom we wanted the kind
of em to me an extension of the camera
itself new algorithm was paired with the
brand's view closed loop control
structure achieves a quick response time
of 16 milliseconds this results in a
high accuracy stabilization and smooth
controls we know that Gumbo's can be
heavy and recording on them for extended
amounts of time and get tiresome so we
designed the handle to rotate the whole
setup
me how the
Vulcan Airy position switching modes is
easy and the innovative design allows
you to get your shot no matter the
situation Cullen M is equipped with a 23
watt-hour replaceable battery and has at
least 12 hours of runtime the kyln M has
a universal mount which can perfectly
fit a variety of lightweight cameras
including mirrorless cameras smartphones
and action cameras we built us into the
mounting plate and handle allowing from
multiple attachments and with this
aluminum body you can take it anywhere
without worry
zoom angle shutter controls or recording
can be controlled right from the handle
the kyln em was designed to handle a
range of camera accessories on a handle
and gimbal is a port that can work with
anything from a transmitter for a remote
monitor of different types to our apps
the kyln m/v controlled wirelessly
and even charge your camera clicks in
the shooting incredibly thankful all the
backers help bring the my flush but with
the stabilizer we realized that there's
a lot of room for growth for our company
we're still very tech focused but we've
already begun improving his customer
service and our communication we hope to
not only offer the best products that we
can but also the best service to back it
up thank you for checking out our
IndieGoGo campaign and we appreciate
your support
mic mice a bit of a party starter let's
put it that way that's what he's been
doing for the past 20 years and he's
becoming pretty damn good at it well I
wish this story was all fun and games
but sometimes you gotta take action to
preserve your body Mike's ears are
paying the price whenever he is DJing
and producing he feels fatigue pain and
loss of sensitivity but not anymore now
he uses D but a pleasant let sound in
and keeps noise out ha what is this D
but thing you ask D but is what saved
Mike from imminent silence and can save
a lot of other people featuring a slider
that allows you to adjust to the amount
of decibels you want to filter out D but
gives you a clearer crisper and safer
music experience what's the difference
between D but and a regular ear plug you
might ask well here's some scientific
explanation your ear is designed to
naturally boost frequencies around 2 to
4 Q Hertz like human speech most ear
plugs simply fill out your ear canal to
block sound problem is that they alter
your years resonance frequency causing
muffle to unclear hearing as a result
with D buds you can speak feel listen
move do exactly what
our acoustic mesh is designed to reduce
volume evenly for all frequencies
throughout the spectrum while the
acoustic or mechanically enhances
frequencies in the range of human speech
diba simply brings you clear safe sound
for mic this was a decision that
dramatically changed the quality of his
life with a simple slide and he is
telling all his friends about it free
test slides it to pitch down the high
notes of joyful children and still be
able to talk to the parents ed and Paul
slides it to tone down machine noise and
keep the creative juices flowing Anna
slides it just so she can hear herself
think at the agency and still be aware
of the latest gossip
Samuel slides it to maintain sanity and
focus and make every chance of small
talk a prolific dialogue after years of
research prototyping and testing we
achieved a sleek design plug with
minimum visual impact perfect fit and
ease of use
this means crisper clearer hearing with
reduced volume every time we're ear labs
and our mission is to bring you a better
and safer listening experience no matter
who you are or what you do
help us make a difference for millions
of people around the world d bud let's
sound in keep the noise out
hi i'm jihun and this is a mon and we
started ministers fly about five years
ago right here in Boston so we know a
thing or two about being cold all the
time we tried everything
coffee jackets pens a layered and none
of it worked so we decided to invent
something better
much warmer it's an intelligent heated
jacket our most ambitious project ever
so to create the intelligent heating
system we started off with three carbon
fiber heating elements the system is
controlled by our custom chip which
allows to integrate our temperature
sensors accelerometer and also
communicate to an application over
bluetooth to use the jacket it's super
simple you just plug in this USB battery
and the jacket is in automatic mode to
control the temperature simply turn the
heat up or down or leave it just as is
the way our machine learning algorithm
works is it looks at what is the
temperature that you want maximum heat
and then what's also the temperature at
which you want the jacket to shut off
based on your input we can create the
ideal performance model for you and over
time the jacket will learn your
preferences so it'll get better and more
and more you use them I think one of the
coolest moments is when you take our
most recent sample and you pick it up
and it automatically turns on or even
coolers when you walk outside and
automatically turns up and this idea
that it knows what you want before you
can even tell it
as a two-layer waterproof breathable
membrane it allows your vapors to pass
through but not rain droplets it has 100
gram of recycled polyester insulation
which actually provides a little bit of
odor control because it has copy grounds
embedded in it there's also a very
low-profile waterproof zipper as well as
a durable water repellent to keep the
jacket dry we wanted something that
looked just as comfortable in the city
but also have the protection for the
mountain to keep a really clean profile
we use ultrasonic baffling to keep the
insulation in place but it also allows
the whole garment to stretch which is
really cute the jacket also features an
easily removable planet it has a cheech
hardening mat so if you take your while
if smartphone slide it into the
smartphone pocket next to it it'll
automatically start to charge
it's taken us a few years of dozens of
prototypes and countless hours of
garment developed but also kind of
technology development to figure out how
to create each of the components for
these you know hundreds of wash cycles
on the machine to make sure that eating
pads don't erode color fastness test
wash ability test everything you can
imagine to figure out how to make each
of these components that when we bring
it all together
it's truly both beautiful and
indestructible which is a tough
combination to find this is the first
time that we felt we can actually create
a garment that got better the more you
used it and make a garment that does a
better job of what you want it to do so
the jacket it's keep you warm that's
what the future of kind of wearable
technology should be it can seamlessly
work into our day and in many cases
anticipate you know the functionality
that we need
we launched ministries by five years ago
right here on Kickstarter and we're back
again to launch the next phase of our
company a wearable tech item that
actually has a positive impact on your
life and gets better over time and we
need your help we need your help to
launch this initial product and it would
mean the world to us if you could back
our project share the message and just
help us bring this vision to life come
join us
because
I feel
bringing this
to get us back on now where can we try
to find</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
