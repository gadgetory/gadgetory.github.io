to win the race and I'm no different but
it's believing you have the tools and
the mindset believing you can get more
out of your body and it's about
executing that race on the day the most
exciting feeling in a race is knowing
you've won and you've broken people and
they have given everything professional
triathletes come and go and you know to
say I've actually earned my living and
being a professional triathlete since
1998 not many people have had career
that long the process has changed for me
as I've got older I become stronger but
maybe slightly less fast so I need to
work on that area winning these days is
very very hard and you know World Titles
Olympic titles are won and lost by
seconds they are won and lost by
marginal gains or a sport that is
evolved at an alarming rate it attracts
the kind of person who wants to be at
the cutting edge of endurance and that's
all aspects the technology side of it
the training side of it and pushing the
human body as far as it can go to get
the best out of your body it's not just
about flogging yourself day in and day
out you need to take care of the small
things we talk a lot about aerodynamics
on the bike
every time you look down you're not very
Aero but you know the fact I can look up
where I'm going and I can stay in that
position it is fantastic when you're
doing intervals hard sessions you know
you've got the data right in front of
you I think you've got to try it you
know it's like anything this is so new
there's nothing out there in the whole
world you can get a million by computers
a million watches this is the only thing
that does what it does
you
we built in an accelerometer gyroscope
linear actuator and pressure sensors to
unleash what we think will be the
biggest leap forward in Mouse technology
since it was first invented 50 years ago
whether you're a gamer and design or
even a powered desktop user the Z will
let you interact with your computer in a
faster more precise and highly intuitive
way the Z is the first Gaming Mouse that
lets you pivot tilt and roll it knows
when it's on the table and when it's in
the air bringing a whole new dimension
of control to the mouse with the mouse
on the surface you can tilt left and
right for fast mode changes without
using your fingers you can assign any
action to tilt like leaning crouching or
reloading or use it as a modifier key on
the mouse buttons and keyboard without
actually having to press a key when
playing a game that involves driving use
tilt to take the RIC analog control of
the steering wheel we've designed
adjustable replaceable feet that can
make the tilt easier or harder or set a
large or small tilt angle or you can
lock our tilt all together the Z also
knows when the mouse is pivoting left or
right this gives you a huge competitive
advantage and many first or third person
shooters you can run straight ahead and
at the same time look left and right
with analog control the same way as you
would with a VR headset it provides
tactile feedback so you know when you're
facing forward or looking to the side
just like tilt you can assign any action
or modify to a pivot everything is
configurable for in-ear gestures lift
the mouse off the surface now you have
direct analog control of pitch roll and
use this for the ultimate control in
flight Sims or for direct camera
controllers spectator mode many mice
pack in additional buttons around the
thumb grip and all over the device but
we've figured out a new way of clicking
that means you can have more buttons and
they are effortless to click no finger
or thumb contortions required we've
created something we call straight
finger clicking and our test users just
love it the Z has a new type of trigger
button that can be used by simply
straightening your fingers slightly and
then clicking all while you're still
gripping the mouse is normal with your
fingers poised on the main left and
right click buttons they are so easy to
click that you can use them for actions
you do often like reloading jumping or
crouching we call them trigger buttons
because you can actually pull them like
a trigger as well these two buttons are
in effect four buttons
we've also added adjustable fingertip
buttons that can be accessed with very
little finger movement
combined pivot and tilt with trigger and
fingertip buttons to effortlessly access
48 single click actions while barely
moving your fingers needless to say the
Z makes the ultimate in M own Mouse in a
game like World of Warcraft you can also
use tilt left or right to easily switch
between action bars and access different
skills the trigger buttons and fingertip
button positions are all tunable and the
Z even knows how hard you click we call
it deep click you can figure the amount
of force that suits you and the Z gives
you tactile feedback and that you know
it's activated you can also use deep
click in an analog mode to have direct
floral control or speed when driving
flying or running in a first-person
shooter right click to bring up your
scope click deeper to zoom in then
deeper again to hold your breath and
steady your sights
now take the shot for games that have
light and heavy attacks use normal click
for a light attack or click harder to
launch a heavy attack and we didn't stop
there
we also wanted to make the most economic
multifunctional mouse in the world we
know that gamers don't want to worry
about batteries or wireless reliability
and latency we wanted to make the Z the
easiest Mouse to configure we added an
OLED screen and as the Z knows its
orientation lifting it to look at the
screen automatically puts it into
configure mode to swiftly change
profiles or DP up

troubling unresolved question for me was

food drink garbage vomit or even more
horrible things on your car floor all of
those make your car like a garbage dump
and very bad for your health

easy to clean and durable third soft

and fit for any cars or you can cut it
