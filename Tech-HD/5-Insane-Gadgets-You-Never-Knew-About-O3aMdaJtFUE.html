redesign a classic outdoor wearable and
see it in a whole new light introducing
the bio light headlamp an ultra-thin 330
lumen USB rechargeable headlamp
featuring 3d slim fit construction that
makes her hands-free Lite wildly capable
and so comfortable you'll forget you're
wearing it
the 3d slim fit construction is based on
three dimensions of a perfect fit a
flush front better balance and smart
fabrics seamlessly integrated housing
merges the electronics directly into the
band creating an ultra-thin front that
sits flush on your forehead with no
bouncing by reorienting the battery to
the back we keep the weight off the
front of your face
reducing slippage and creating a more
natural fit and the entire headlamp
features moisture wicking fabric that
keeps you cool and dry during activity
clocking in at only 69 grams the
headlamp features four modes and the
ability to control your light through
easy dim ability one-handed articulation
enables your light to move with you
without any disruption with easy
recharging via microUSB and run times of
up to 40 hours you can ditch the battery
swaps and power up with a bio light
energy ecosystem we're thrilled to be
back on Kickstarter and this time we're
doing things a little differently
not only will all headlamp backers
receive a free Lantern stuff sacks
you'll also get your headlamp buy
holiday 2018 one more time
free Lantern stuff sack that transforms
your headlamp into an overhead light and
delivery by this holiday season a design
in the making for over three years this
is a true passion project for the bio
light team and we're here to ask for
your support in making it a success the
headlamp world is crowded and controlled
by some big names we all know and with
your help we can shine a light on fresh
designs and new solutions and introduce
a wearable that's actually wearable and
as always at violate a portion of every
project we launch gets reinvested in our
work in
shaaka bringing safe affordable lighting
to families living off for it
meet a headlamp that feels great stays

may be practiced today and get it by
holiday
this is the perfect cut the all-in-one
utility knife for cutting complex shapes
when you're decorating your home when
you're making toys for your kids models
or props perfect cut makes you finish
the job easier quicker and precise with
a specially designed cutter we created
four modules the very angle module
controls the angle of cutting at a 5
degree interval lets you precisely cut
every single edge and pile up the tower
like a 3d printer we change the way of
holding the cutter to let you cut with
less effort it's about efficiency we
control the depth and angle of cutting
circle cutting is essential put one hand
on perfect cut the other on the material
and rotate when you're framing up your
photos perfect cut keeps the edge at 45
degrees and works on cardboard foam and
ham
we are polar lab we are designers and
engineers started from twenty years of
experience in model making we developed
through hundreds of user tests
prototypes and more tests because we
want to bring the best to you thank you
for bringing this to life and into your
hands
hi Kickstarter I'm hunter the founder
and creative director of Prague Hill the
design studio based in Brooklyn New York
we developed a manufacturer variety
distinct and thoughtful objects inspired
by experimentation and our sense of
curiosity some of our most popular
products include the Wilson keyring the
ripple opener the jack puzzle and now
introducing our newest product the Ven
puzzle Ben puzzles comprised three
identical pieces diecast and stainless
steel and weighing in at almost two
pounds the assembly of the puzzle
initially seems pretty simple but once
you get it in your hands you realize it
requires a high level of dexterity and
precision all the pieces have to align
the simultaneously and then the
unexpected success of some of our more
conceptual products has given us the
confidence to produce the been puzzled
we've been lucky enough to find an
audience for many of the strange
sometimes functional objects that we
love to make and we're hoping to
continue expanding that community
through this Kickstarter campaign we've
been working on the design for the Ben
puzzle for the better part of two years
fine-tuning the geometry finding the
right manufacturing partner and refining
the finishing process and now we're
finally ready to go into production
we've got our tooling made the first
production samples are in hand and we're
eager to bring the event puzzle to life
the finished product feels smooth cool
and surprisingly heavy
it's an oddly satisfying and meditative
distraction
we're still trying to figure out then
one can assemble it one-handed puzzle
comes with a small metal display stand
is packaged in a sturdy chipboard tube
for our Kickstarter backers we're
offering the venn puzzle at a
significantly discounted pre-sale price
and the first 500 puzzles are shipped by
November 15th we're passionate about
experimenting with industrial
manufacturing and making products that
inspire curiosity and hopefully make
your day a little more enjoyable with
your help we're excited to bring this
puzzle into the world
thanks today we're testing Lear out the
charging case has magnetic technology
built into it to keep the earbuds in
place one of the things I love about
Lyra is that they auto pair with
whatever technology I've connected them
to in the past so it's a one-time setup
and that's it they have a great design
they fit snugly in your ear and they
won't fall out during exercise
they have great sound quality their
noise cancelling and instrumental sound
amazing Lyra can play for up to 45 hours
and the case can be used to charge them
up to six times the LED light indicates
how much battery is left the other thing
that's great about these is that they're
waterproof they are ip7 certified for up
to three feet deep and thirty minutes
long let me just dry them off they also
have easy touch technology so that all I
have to do is hold my finger right here
and it integrates with Siri I've been
using Lyra every day they're the best
earbuds I've ever had</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
