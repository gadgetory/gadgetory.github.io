there don't you know that plastic straws
are bad for the environment what is this
oh if you're gonna suck suck on this
this is final straw the world's first
collapsible reusable totally badass draw
straws are supposed to be convenient
right so we decided to do something
about it this is final straw
final straw builds up to the size of a
car key and fits in this sexy case final
straw is small enough to fit in your
purse or pocket but if you don't have
pockets you can just uh-oh where'd it go
if you can remember your keys when you
leave the house you'll remember your
straw it fits on your keychain so
there's no way you're gonna leave it in
your car and there's no need to worry
about keeping it clean included in each
straw is a specially-designed squeegee
simply pull it through the straw to make
sure it's squeaky clean final straws BPA
free dishwasher safe and with our
patented design the ends are soft so
it's safe for human children and their
adults there you go little buddy this
straw may seem small but because of its
size it's actually very harmful to the
environment
straws can't be recycled so they're
often left here in the ocean where they
hurt and kill my friends in the sea Rico
go be free
since you've hit play on this video
we've discarded this many straws in the
US alone pretty bad right included in
each straw are some of these little
cards next time you're at a restaurant
leave one with the Bell and let them
know to only serve straws upon request
there's a movement happening and you can
be at the front of it together we can
make a really big impact and save our
oceans one straw at a time this is final
straw suck responsibly

hi Kickstarter's Primos designs would
like to introduce you to the ultimate
tool accessory stick with bands our
stick with bands our patent-pending
next-generation accessory that offer you
handy access organization and storage
for tools utensils or implements of any
kind these versatile bands our band of
elastic silicone that can be stretched
to snugly fit any ferrous or non-ferrous
tool socket or tool handle our bands
come in two sizes 1/2 inch and 3/8 inch
to accommodate most sizes of tools
utensils and implements stick lick bands
are made of high consistency grade
silicone that is embedded with neodymium
magnets silicone was chosen for its
durability and elasticity
unlike crude rubber use in elastic bands
plus silicone is a non allergic and
non-toxic material that is safe to use
around food neodymium magnets were
chosen as these rare earth magnets of
the strongest permanent magnets
available stick the fans can be used by
professional and weekend mechanics
gardeners RV enthusiasts handy men women
hobbyists crafters artists and anyone
who cooks are used as any implement of
any kind if you don't have anything
metal to have the band stick to some of
the rewards we'll have the option to get
the band's with one-inch metal discs or
12 inch metal pegboard strips the 1-inch
discs have adhesive tape on the back so
you can stick them to most surfaces we
began work on our stick lick bands
almost two years ago we thought of
various ideas using different materials
and magnets we mocked up our ideas into
visual and working prototypes to see
what would work best for our
applications after spending months of
designing developing refining and
testing our stick with bands we are
confident that we have a great product
that is ready for the market this is
where we need to kickstart a community
with your help
we can fund final tooling costs raw
materials and initial production costs
to meet our minimum
order quantities please spread the word
we thank you and appreciate your support</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
