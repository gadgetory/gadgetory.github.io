just having a regular terrarium is not
good enough for me I said I have to add
something at some sense of nature into
it so I started adding lights and I said
no what
just light is not allowed let's try to
make it rain and that I wonder if the
heart is caught to do is making it rain
when designing the smart air product we
really wanted to capture the essence of
what the client really wanted to do and
that was as in full open simple peaceful
atmosphere when I'm thinking about for
this project is a small theater and
we're thinking about bringing all of
these theatrics into play lights and the
front lights in the back the color of
tone sounds this is really a little
theatre and the actors are plans and we
want to give them the best production
possible working through hundreds and
hundreds of designs we went through
iteration and iteration and what we
really found was that anything that
calls too much obstruction to the
viewing angle to the experience that the
interior environment the natural
environment was going to deliver to
people we really wanted to step away
from so what we arrived that was a
really simple really elegant uplifted
platform that really kind of puts this
environment on a pedestal and that's
really what we wanted to do one of the
great things about putting all the
circuits in a circuit board is that it
gives us the opportunity to make a great
app it's beautiful that allows us to
direct all the actions of the tank
whether it's the fog or the fountain
or the lights and their color or making
it rain and having special effects like
lightning and thunder these things allow
us as a director through this app to
design our our setting and plan our day
this system is by design something that
you don't have to take care of it's
minimal effort involved on your part but
you still get this beautiful high-tech
exciting product to have on your desk
and your bedroom wherever you like it
this is really a full life support
system for these plants to create a full
natural environment that you can bring
indoors and you don't have to worry
about it I create smart Terra to bring a
better version of nature to everyone's
home with your support I can begin
manufacturing thank you for contributing
to our campaign
