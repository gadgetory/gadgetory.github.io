the MacBook was designed to encapsulate
perfection but when we designed the
macbook charger we really royally
screwed that up I bet you thought that
was a real Apple commercial didn't you
no that was us
the way it should be though Apple's
known for creating high quality products
people loved the MacBook however the
MacBook charger has a whole whopping one
star on Apple comm and we didn't make
that up the reviews speak for themselves
over and over people are having the same
problems
Bob s says it's the Achilles heel of
Apple well Bob s you'd be right the
whole point of a laptop is to be taken
wherever the heck you want so why isn't
the charger designed the same way it's
bulky clunky hard to store and is
damaged extremely easily and the only
solution is an $80 replacement at the
Apple Store introducing the Sidewinder
by fuse the Sidewinders patent-pending
design eliminates cable fray ensuring
your charger lasts as long as your
laptop its revolving shell allows you to
wind the cables in under 6 seconds its
adjustable length control allows you to
stay organized whether you're six inches
or 12 feet from an outlet the Apple s
design allows for sleek portability
making the Sidewinder the ultimate
macbook accessory
I found my true passion in design to
finally I created a complete knife I
call skid skid combines the traditional
and the modern as good as
environmentally sound stylistically pure
and elegant
dapped it for the needs and challenges
of modern uses drip forms and adjusts to
the hands economically the wood is
hardened and tempered but isn't inferior
to the natural wood surface high carbon
content coupled with exceptional
allowing into the blade sharp and
long-lasting body of the handle is more
hygienic than typical synthetic hannah's
thanks to tannic acid produced for
hardwood which has antibacterial
properties my grandfather taught me that
all organic raw materials were a gift no
matter how far society progresses
creating scared took me back into the
past but also a giant step towards the
