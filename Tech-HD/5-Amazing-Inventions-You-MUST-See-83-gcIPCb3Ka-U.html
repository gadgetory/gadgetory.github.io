completely different wireless headphones
that integrate music calls and
information so naturally into your
senses you'll hardly notice they're
there you never have to take them off
because they don't reflect your natural
hearing when they're not switched on
giving you the ability to listen to
music make calls and much more with
on-demand voice commands and unlike
other hero balls the battery life is
measured not in ours but days this is
what we think wireless headphones should
be this is high
we think the biggest problems with
headphones are that they block your
natural hearing and you have to carry
them with you putting them on and taking
them off when all you really want is
just to be able to make a call or listen
to music we solve this problem with a
completely new type of virtually
invisible earbud which combines high
quality speakers for sparkling travels
and vibrating elements for rich deep
bass this means you get amazing sound
that augments your natural hair but when
high isn't playing anything you don't
even notice it's there plus the fact
that we've put all the supporting
electronics behind your ear means that
we've managed to cram in five times the
battery power of other leading he rebels
so you can listen day after day before
recharging all day where means that you
can check the weather monitor your
well-being set reminders or search the
web with voice commands and most
importantly expand your ability to enjoy
music and conversation with anyone
anytime without ever having to take your
phone out of your pocket plus we're
working on loads more features like
being able to record and share your
audio experiences or listen to music
together wirelessly we think I will
change the way you think about personal
audio we've partnered with award-winning
product development consultancy PDT you
bring world-renowned designer
manufacturing experience on crowd funded
projects to global brands to help us
bring this revolutionary product to you
please back this project so we can
complete the final factory ready design
and start making and shipping hi to you
so you can experience what wireless
headphones can really be thank you
you

makes the plants grow larger and faster
than in common soil if you fill it up it

to worry if you go away we're a group of
entrepreneurs engineers and designers we
know what it takes to make a product we
have done it before we have made many
prototypes and are now ready for mass
production to do that we have a big
startup costs and your help to back this
project
welcome to onin and only pro the world's
best outdoor oven four years ago you
helped only revolutionize outdoor
cooking by supporting the launch of the
world's first portable good Fido it
since then we've given tens of thousands
of people the opportunity to cook and
enjoy fantastic wood-fired food in any
outdoor space this year we're starting a
new chapter in our story by launching
only pro coolies more than just the
product it's about liberating the way we
cook allowing us to enjoy simple
elements that we enrich life food fire
and cooking ooh nice tile only
revolutionized the outdoor cooking
landscape now una crow is taking on the
large traditional events by offering
incredible versatility but still being
the most affordable event of this size I
wanted to invent something that looked
amazing that was transportable so you
can enjoy outdoor cooking anywhere and
avoid the time and effort of a storm 80
the way only pro works is very simple
it's wood-fired like our other models it
takes the direct heat of the flames and
the heat stored in the stone baking pork
this way you get a well-cooked top as
well as a beautiful increased bass the
precise and multi-fuel capabilities make
it very special just like our previous
models it burns wood pellets but with
the pro you can also use regular wood
charcoal and it can even run on gas by
adding a specially designed burner which
means you're ready to go at a flick of a
switch Pro can reach temperatures of
nine hundred and thirty-two degrees
fahrenheit in just 15 minutes only pro
has twice the cooking surface of our
previous models so you can cook a
delicious 16-inch neapolitan-style pizza
in just 90 seconds it can cook just
about anything meat fish vegetables
deserts and take the perfect bread it's
tasty social and fun only pro has been
over two years in the making and we pack
some incredible functionality into it
pro is the latest in a line of
successful wounded products we have
achieved recognition that has exceeded
all expectations we have generated an
amazing community of only friends and
fans and make dependable loyal
connections in this manufacturing
industry and it all started with a
campaign just like this one now we're
asking you again to become part of the
only story by helping us frame own
approach to life it's very simple you us
only pro get ready for the world's best
outdoor oven
you
I wondered why is the record always
spinning well the stylist desperate
you
a tan Oh Jeff vowel sounds and
you
the leader is what's convinced people
for over 150 years this warmth is
soulful sound that is unique and that
cannot be replaced by something digital
so we're using the most widespread
industry standard size cartridge we've
kept those elements and we just
augmented them in a way that allows you
to do things you could never do before
you can play pause to the next track a
select the next strike you don't need
the app to use love but it's app mixing
to evolutionary once you've captured
this
what do you do well you process it in a
way that allows it to communicate to a
Bluetooth speaker to a phone in a very
high-quality way
you
streaming of the sound
change or harm the analog sound because
we're using the very best codec
available with a very best transmission
there is so the sound stays the same
that's really what a great wireless some
connectivity needs I would love love to
on table to be a synonym for quality
before you email there will be a wow
moment of look at this object that's
starting to turn but as soon as the
sound will come on I think it's still
the vinyl is still the record but sell
the music that is what you're looking
for
you
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
