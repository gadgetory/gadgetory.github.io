a timeless tool better introducing a bit
holder that allows for true one-handed
operation we put the strongest magnet we
possibly could on the collar of a bit

fastener off now you can climb a ladder
position a fixture and zip in a screw
all while having a free hand the bit
holder can be easily attached to any of
the hammer head impacting bits with a
simple threaded design not only did we
try to make setting a fastener safer and
easier but the bits are made of a bi
metal construction allowing them to
absorb impact and last long I just love
how easy it is to use since we designed
this tool with a 1/4 of an inch quick
connected collet you can change bits in
a snap I use it all the time
