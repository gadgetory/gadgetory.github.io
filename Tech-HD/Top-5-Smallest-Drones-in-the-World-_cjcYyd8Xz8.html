from morrison innovations we took the
world's smallest quadcopter and made it
even easier and fun for beginners to fly
our new patent-pending design provides a
more forgiving flight process while
protecting the blades and motors at the
same time there will be three
introductory colors to choose from on
IndieGoGo all nano drones will now come
with our new packaging that also doubles
as a protective storage case they all
new three speed calibration system
provides smoother lift and
maneuverability reducing the pogo stick
effect that new Flyers experience with
the previous design we have also
improved the six axis stabilization
which allows the Nano drone to hover
remarkably well it can now hover less
than an inch off of the surface below in
addition to higher altitudes our
patent-pending blade guard design allows
the new nano during the lightly bump
feeling good long without causing the
blades to fly off which previously
resulted in short flight times
devastating crashes and the need for
repairs while not indestructible the new
design is certainly more forgiving
software upgrades provide smoother 360
degree rotation also referred to as
y'all allowing you to easily adjust the
orientation of your drones mid-flight
we have designed what we believe to be
the perfect learner drone that will save
you thousands of dollars while you
protect the mechanic the quadcopter
flight before moving on to larger more
expensive equipment thank you for
viewing our campaign we hope you will
decide to back beyond the nanotech
my name is Robert Morrison and I am the
founder of axis drones and today I have
with me the wallet drone
knowledge onna the world's smallest
quadcopter it fits inside of the
controller itself which is the size of a
wallet but perfectly into your pocket
not only does the quadcopter fit inside
of the remote control but it actually
uses the remote control of batteries to
charge itself while not in use making it
go virtually anywhere that you can this
is the most portable compact quadcopter
on the market so we've had probably
about five or six different remote
control planes but the wallet drone
seems to last forever and maybe it's the
size of small size it but it flew longer
than just about any other top the review
the wallet drone is available in four
unique colors blue green yellow and
orange get yours today on IndieGoGo for
a simple contribution we'll deliver one
right to your pocket
you
what should now captured a bigger
picture from any angle
hello your Creator in short you are
unleashing true potential possibility
dunya religious videos can to the
graphic is Michael once all this is
possible from the boy it could be
popular
get on top all I gots to be don't look
down let it pop Kazuto just drown Fatima
did you hear that around the town when
we begin work on is that out our goal is
to make the aerial photography and video
capture truly accessible to a month
isn't it makings in a small and
lightweight enjoyable enough to be taken
with you anywhere intelligent enough so
no pollen skills are required and most
of all pricing gentle at a point that
makes it affordable here talking to is
we know exactly what takes delivery
first-class program for years between
providing solutions in the defense
technology sector specialized in nature
UAVs we now for sponsoring this
technology to the computer inside the
know we have a chorus code accelerometer
magnetometer high resolution barometric
air pressure sensor a co-founding sona
infrared also avoiding systems GPS
sensor microphone and speaker a lot of
technology or putting a very small
package on top of all of that the on
board markers controller has all the
data fusing and correction algorithms as
well as F IR and iir filters to actually
make that information worthwhile it
allows us to make Thanos gesture-based
you point to phone in the direction as
owner goes there hold position until you
instruct other life it really is that
simple so why do we need you help
amazingly truly accessible to everyone
we need to get the volumes up so the
price goes down it's as simple as that
we're really trying to bring the
technology you guys we just need some
help getting over the phone
the future is gonna be in your head you
go to sound I'll bet it needles
other professionals I like everything to
be perfect
have you ever been so farting and in
succession dispersed moments with
different perspective
he must have services or GoPro but then
again is possible that's one of them
josie grossy a small comfort zone for
youth pockets
that has to be making business camera of
snowboarders audible and clothing
it's only Holograms and techniques
instead of so it's elevated you don't
need a license to own or operate
duties not just traditional include
daily companion
Lupe's Pro and have the auto leveling
algorithm you can control with just one
scratch of the bottom so our mobile apps
you can switch between the manual mode
or autonomous mode enable the auto polar
mode with just one press the button
it's only its life is small if beautiful
and sickening things are Deportes it's
basically the best flying camera you
could ever have inside
you'll see something quick with the less
flashlights just in case I'm permitted
tonight here is ago also it makes your
style because it's camps in value

Dukey come to grips with a 3 megapixel
high-definition camera and they can be
here

video or blending outward
you
hi Kickstarter's I'm Jason we are back
on Kickstarter again with air block the
first modular and a programmer tool that
are turns into a hovercraft in the past
we've successfully kick-started projects
such as M border and decodable and were
able to bring those products to 140
countries for kids and adults to make
sing program and create with your help
we believe we can do research in you
might be thinking why are shown why
something so different from the previous
and iconic mechanical robot that we've
created Jones are popular nowadays
but another a10 photo of
professional-grade at home what is soil
versions are far too easy to press and a
brick of hot so we fingers why not all
creator tools that adult an even keel
can construct on their own with durable
modular path and the making of life not
only where your voices help tested an
idea to see if it's good or not but also
have never the John playing field for
the first time for McClung innovation
matters creativity mothers their
medication is the key your support
matters and they use an important
inspiration please that air block today
thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
