Bluetooth connection meet flip the
stylist that is as easy to use as the
pencil you grew up with flip uses an
incredibly simple and unique method of
communicating with any Apple device so

note-taking stylus ever developed it's
also a very powerful tool that digital
artists will love with flips
interchangeable magnetic tips the artist
in you will be inspired to draw sketch
and paint and all your favorite apps in
the past advanced smart stylus features
like flip to erase palm rejection and
others have required complex electronics
to improve upon this we powered flip
with magnetics our rare earth magnets
produce an exact invisible magnetic
field that is always on just like the
Earth's magnetic field flips patented
software algorithms developed by our
software partner wide Vantage use the
hardware already in your device this
sense and detect flips magnetic field
and determine the precise location and
orientation of the stylus so our palm
rejection flip to erase and other
features work perfectly want to erase
flip knows just flip it over and your
flip is now an eraser want to rest your
palm on the screen while using the
stylus flip knows since we know the
exact location of the stylus we can
perfectly reject any other object
touching the screen want to hover and
then zoom in to generate more detail
flip knows just enable the hover
functionality and we can even detect the
stylist while it is still in the air

but don't want to reenter your password
and reconnect your bluetooth stylus
every time your iPad wakes up again flip
knows we sense when you stop writing an
automatically dim your screen to help
save power and then instantly turn your
screen back on when you are ready to
make your next note

taking and drawing app called flipnotes
we also know many of our backers already
have their favorite apps so we've
developed an app developers kit that
allows any note-taking or drawing app to
quickly integrate flips features into
their apps we've already engaged with
several popular apps and we'll be happy
to keep adding to the list just let us
know your favorite apps and we will work
with them in addition to note taking and
drawing our software partner is
developing fun educational learning apps
for kids that can be activated by flip

iTunes Store this is our third
Kickstarter project and we love that our
backers continue to drive our innovation
