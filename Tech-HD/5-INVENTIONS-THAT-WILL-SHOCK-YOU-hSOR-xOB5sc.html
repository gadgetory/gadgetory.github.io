thank you for watching now let's change
the world for the better
i'm laura the creator of shape fit ultra
smoothing moisturizing collagen infused
leggings designed with integrated
shapewear to boost your booty and slim
your tummy here's the full story
frustrated with all these claims of
sculpting leggings that do little more
than be partially squat proof we decided
to reinvent the legging we started with
the issues leggings had finding they're
often spins and never offer any support
secondly we hated the way shapewear cuts
in squishing in all the wrong places and
having to hide them under clothing
introducing shape fit a new category of
leggings in fees with shapewear for the
modern woman using our innovative shape
fit technology seamlessly embedded into
our leggings these booty boosting skin
smoothing ultra comfortable leggings
shape and support you in just the right
areas it's not the 90s anymore
flat all up and down is not what we're
about we're all about that curve so we
started by taking the discomfort away
from the super tight shapewear by
focusing on supporting contours to lift
your booty tight and thigh smooth the
tummy and tone your full legs shape fit
is built with a front tummy and inner
thighs smoothing panel a booty boost
band to enhance your boo delicious
behind graduated compression to retain
smooth and tone your legs
it comes in super high and high waist
models with our patent pending reform
technology stump the waist slipping or
digging in what's even better is that
you don't need to hide it away under
clothing shake fit feels like a second
supportive skin making you feel as
freeze being naked while feeling toned
like a goddess we've thought about it
all using super high-grade materials
there's no more flashing underwear while
out and about we squat tested the hell
out of these make sure you feel
comfortable and confident no matter what
you're doing as women we wanted to take
leggings even further
that's why all our materials are
moisturizing and college and infuse to
make sure your skin is looked after and
left feeling like silk
help us make shape fit a reality and
together empower women everywhere to be
all they are
historically robot arms are seen in
large manufacturing industries they've
been using them for decades and
something that's exciting about a
technology like the X arm is that it
makes that accessible for companies like
us smaller companies opener is known for
making cool creative concepts for brands
and companies so one thing we're really
looking forward to it the robot arm is
to replace the time we spend making
small parts so we can free up time to
focus on coming up with those clever
solutions SD 3d is a 3d printing company
that focuses on prototyping and
production needs here at SD 3d we run
our machines 24 hours a day seven days a
week so having a robotic arm to be able
to work hand in hand with our machines
at any point in time is extremely
beneficial precision is also an
important part of manufacturing when we
look at a time bucket analysis of how we
assemble components so we look at the
motion waist and moving parts to make
sure that they're in the right place at
the right time reduces the amount of
waste in our assembly which saves us
money overall utilize an X arm within
our Factory can help lower costs and
increase productivity and can work well
with existing technicians frequently 3d
prints take a long time hours to finish
and they'll finish printing overnight
the major points for assembly for 3d
printing are taking the parts after
they're printed and assembling the parts
and getting them ready for shipping so
rather than having a worker come in to
have to do the post-processing in the
morning they can come in to finish parts
in the morning the quality of employees
work life is going to dramatically
increase they'll be able to focus on
absolutely the skilled work they want to
do and none of the repetitive process
that they already don't like the most
surprising thing to me regarding the X
arm is the flexibility the use cases to
be able to switch between a gripper and
a screwdriver the ability to have the
camera work hand in hand with the
screwdriver so we can actually have the
X arm help repair the printers without a
technician on site you know having a
robot arm that is small and easy to move
around is transformative for a business
like ours because we would use it say in
one location near the CNC router in the
morning and then move it over the
assembly line in the afternoon knowing
the low price point of under $10,000
I'd estimate the ex arm to be able to
save around $20,000 just in the first
year five years ten years ago a robot
arm like this would have been fifty
thousand dollars and now saying what X
arms done at a much more compelling
price point it makes that ROI a lot more
attractive especially for small and
emerging businesses introducing cipher a
powerful yet simple way to protect your
privacy security and family online today
our world is more connected to the
Internet and ever before
whether browsing Facebook adjusting nest
for shopping on Amazon we're leaving
behind trails of data that tell Internet
companies a lot about ourselves but our
privacy is just the beginning we also
need to worry about online fraud
identity theft and hackers
it can all feel overwhelming that's why
we created ciphers cipher encrypts your
data to keep it private from internet
companies and marketers it also protects
every device in your home or business
from the latest cyber threats and
finally you can rest easy knowing that
your family is protected ciphers
parental controls make the Internet safe
even for the savviest kids being
connected shouldn't be a nightmare stay
safer with cypher</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
