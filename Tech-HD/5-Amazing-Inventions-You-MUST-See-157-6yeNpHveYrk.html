thanks to the fantastic history
community I have been able to study
sleep for the past five years and
develop high technology solutions to
improve it during this time I've learned
two things first the quality of your
sleep is directly connected to the
quality of your life and second each
person's sleep patterns and sleep needs
are totally unique that's why I am happy
to introduce a new device that takes
this information to heart introducing
neuronal
wearable aimed at increasing your energy
during the day by improving your sleep
and leading meditation sessions while
monitoring your brainwaves poles and
more and the cool thing is we are going
to make it open source open source means
you'll get all the information to get to
know how the device works you can
understand it improve it and even build
everything from scratch all by yourself
our dedicated meditation app helps you
meditate by adjusting our audio guide to
your brain activity you just need to
press play and relax murren open starts
the session automatically and modifies
it depending on your mood murren open is
also an advanced lucid dreaming tool it
helps you gain control over your dreams
by providing visual vibration and audio
simulation exactly in the REM phase of
sleep when you are dreaming
near an open also allows to integrate
your sleep with your bedroom once it
detects that you are falling asleep it
will gently turn down the volume of your
music or an audio book it is better to
sleep in lower temperatures but falling
asleep in these temperatures can be
uncomfortable once you drifted off your
an open automatically lowers the
temperature by a few degrees we all hate
bright lights when getting up to use the
bathroom in the middle of the night
mural open senses when you wake up and
lightens up the room gradually just soft
lighting urine open is designed to help
you wake up gently by analyzing your
sleep and waking you up in the lightest
sleep phase using the lights and
vibrations you can then check the exact
details of your sleep engineer on up you
can truly make your bedroom smart using
your an open light in your sleep and
adjusting your bedrooms conditions to
make your sleep at the perfect
experience
that's neuron we believe that people
should be able to freely study both
software and hardware we want users to
assess our algorithms make changes and
share those changes to improve the way
our product works with this goal in mind
we have taken the decision to release
all of our electronic design files
sources for neural sphere work and sleep
staging algorithms you can already
download all of our work in progress
from the campaign site and be sure to
check the rest of the campaign to learn
about our open SDK and upcoming
applications we decided to start a new
Kickstarter campaign to reach to as many
people as possible going open-source
helps us to create a constantly rising
community developing the product
improving the way we sleep thanks to her
previous Kickstarter campaign and ten
thousand devices that we have already
sold our team has gained a lot of
valuable experience in design production
and delivery of our first innovative
product we've already tested the
production capabilities of the neuron
open so we are 100% confident that the
whole process will run very smoothly
we have won a number of great
competitions in Europe and the United
States for our first product and we've
used all of the tremendous feedback and
applied until neuron open to make it
even better we are proud to say that
European Space Agency is using our
device for some of their trials lately
the European Commission has granted us
with 1.7 million dollars for the further
development and trials of the neuron
open system coming up with a great idea
is extremely hard but so is turning it
into a working device with our
experience on the original neuron we
already have the hardware filmer
algorithms design and the assembly lines
ready now we need your support to send
our factories in top Avengers I became
interested in sleep because even today
it remains one of the great undiscovered
countries in human experience it has
profound impact on our waking life our
health and of course our dreams we like
to think about neuron open as your own
private Sleep Lab we invite you to join
us in our voyage of discovery let's make
the world a better place to sleep for
everyone
you
all over the globe the energy used for
air conditioning is increasing rapidly
in the u.s. almost all of our homes have
AC and consider that the AC use in the
US generates a hundred and seventeen
million tons of co2 each year it's a big
problem but energy problems are complex
hard to fix and usually end up costing
the consumer more while miss box is a
simple solution that helps you reduce
the environmental impacts of cooling
your home while saving you money in the
process
miss box installs to your existing AC
unit in just minutes
bring the benefits of evaporative
cooling proven in industrial
applications for decades right to your
home our new design incorporates modular
components proprietary technology and a
smart learning algorithm that
continually adapts to optimize savings
at the core of the control unit is a
unique combination of sensors allowing
this box to function completely free
from wiring a powerful logic board with
integrated cellular connection provides
miss box with a direct secure seamless
communication channel this marks a huge
step forward for connected devices by
eliminating the need for clumsy setup
and unreliable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
connections to ensure the water mist is
safe for your air conditioner we've
developed a water treatment system with
leading experts in the field and to
allow miss box to operate autonomously
we have created a wind turbine generator
the charges mist box whenever your AC is
running by monitoring AC usage and the
environment around your unit miss box
continuously optimizes its performance
to maximize savings and you can track
all of this information right now app
we've partnered with a Tier one
manufacturer which will allow us to meet
demand and deliver the product later
this summer
independent third party studies have
proven the miss box can save twenty to
thirty eight percent of energy costs
we want miss Fox to be affordable for
everyone so we're offering this box as a
service for just $99 a year your
subscription covers the hardware cell
service replacement water treatment
cartridges and a lifetime warranty and
we're offering our Kickstarter backers
the opportunity to get started with no
activation fee and a monthly payment of
just $10
this way you'll save money from the very
first month with miss box we're making
it easier than ever to save money while
making a positive impact on the
environment help us make a meaningful
difference by subscribing today
movement this is where it all begins
waves of air particles moving at various
speeds
they are called sound waves and we have
found a way to reproduce them better
than ever before
we are Mora a team of scientists
engineers and entrepreneurs with a
shared passion for high fidelity audio
and we have developed a new material
that will change the loudspeaker as you
know it
first let's go back to some of the
basics a sound signal travels through a
voice coil vibrates a thin membrane
called the cone and voila music to your
ears the quality of sound all depends on
this little guy the cone this is the
actual part of the speaker that's
responsible for converting mechanical
motion into sound and it needs to be as
light as possible
most lightweight materials will Bend and
vibrate in ways that are not intended by
the music to create an ultra fidelity
experience we needed a superlight
material that's stronger than anything
we know Rafi is a new material isolated
in 2004 and has been dubbed the wonder
material it is the thinnest material
possible and 200 times stronger than
steel basically the ultimate material
for a speaker cone now we just had to
prove it first we had to come up with an
industrial process to form graphene into
cones and we needed to acoustically
optimize the material for use in
loudspeakers that's how the team came up
with graphene cue our proprietary nano
composite formulation which is 95%
graphene by weight by the way we noticed
one of the smoothest frequency response
curves ever recorded for a headphone
driver and an impressive reduction in
power consumption this was our answer to
the perfect loud speaker membrane it was
now time to turn our proof of concept
into the ORA graphene cue headphones we
worked with product designers engineers
through many iterations to make sure we
weren't compromising on anything
we wanted them to be practical for
everyday use with an intuitive user
experience so you could have incredible
sound quality on the go we incorporated
a gesture control trackpad on the right
cup so you can control your music
without taking your phone out
there's wireless Bluetooth connectivity
but we also made sure you have the
option of using them wired so you can
always enjoy the best possible audio
experience these are the world's first
graphene headphones the sound is amazing
we're so proud and excited to finally
introduce them to the world
we have suppliers lined up and a
manufacturing process in place now all
we need is your support to help get this
project off the ground
graphene QED has a huge potential this
is just the beginning
backing water means that you're playing
a direct role in the graphene revolution
this is the first commercially viable
application for this wander material
we're already in talks with major brands
looking to incorporate our technology
inside the next generation of consumer
electronics but with your support or I
will be able to deliver the first
graphene audio experience be sure to
check out our Kickstarter page for
updates and feel free to contact us with
any questions thank you for checking us
out and thank you for your support

run Bella is a wearable belt designed
for the urban runner politely let other
people know before you pass instead of
yelling out coming through or just
surprising them let them know with a
ring
by using brass for the Bell the sound is
not just a ring its musical
run bail is made in Tokyo right down the
street from where we live we keep
production local
by using two pairs of soft silicon
inserts and having two sizes of the
rings run bail can fit up to six
different sizes
weighing in at only one ounce which is
30 grams you'll barely notice the
difference when you're wearing and not
wearing a rumba
you
you
touching down on mere tranquility toes
or seeing the spectacular ray patterns
of the Capone s landmark is an
experience reserved only for astronauts
or astronomers for the rest of us it's
just a dream
astral reality lunar brings that dream
two hundred and thirty eight thousand
nine hundred miles away within reach by
combining deep comprehensive knowledge
with advanced technologies meticulously
shaping every single crater we print the
entire moon with amazing precision a
layer height of 0.05 millimeters data
error precision of 0.025 millimeters
resolution reaching for thousands dpi we
are able to deliver at scale with a
traditional mode based manufacturing
technique the material media is is
carefully chosen to ensure both quality
and safety resulting in an object that
looks and feels as the moon should then
we have skilled artisans hand paint each
was slightly different yet stunningly
the same we are also professional app
developers so we wanted to make it even
better by using augmented reality we
created an unparalleled experience of
the moon with endless content
this is astral reality lunar unique
precise advanced experience the moon
