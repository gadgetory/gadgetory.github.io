what is Itron and why is everybody
talking about it is this revolutionary
portable charger the reason why people
are staring this is I try I know once
you look at this one
what other portable chargers take hours
to charge themselves back up with Itron
it only takes 18 minutes to reach a full
charge what is that matter to me
well imagine this your phone suddenly
rings while you're taking a refreshing
morning shower rush out being told that
your meeting has been pushed up you need
to get out in 20 minutes you just
realize you forgot to charge your phone
the night before you're upset but you
remember your portable charger family
your portable charger hasn't been used
in a while and you totally forgot to
recharge it you are screwed but with
Itron it's a little different let's
start over your phone simply rings while
you're taking a refreshing morning
shower and rush out being told that your
meeting has been pushed up you realize
you just forgot to charge your phone the
night before you're upset but you
remember your Itron charger even if you
forget to recharge it you can simply
dock Itron to its base you can enjoy
your breakfast while it's charging and
in only 18 minutes it gives you a fully
charged nine thousand milliamp per hour
or double charger that can charge your
iPhone or other similar device about
three times over
you can simply grab it and charge your
phone whenever you want what if it's an
emergency and you don't have that 18
minutes well when you use your phone a
lot for games apps social media online
dating and such it loses a lot of power
while it's losing power your boss calls
you oh yeah I'm still on my way sir then
you realize that that last phone call
made up all of your phone's power you
don't have time to charge your phone nor
recharge your dead portable charger you
have to go out with your dead phone and
then you're screwed
but with Itron when you use your phone a
lot it dies when your phone dies you
need your ID Ron even if you forget to
recharge your ID Ron you just put it
back on the base only a couple of
minutes later Itron has the power to
fully charge your phone you can just
grab the Mingo
oh yeah I'm right here sir what else
they ask if you have kids yes I do have
kids loli and Shiloh nine and five well
living in Shiloh imagine one day you get
home with a dying phone lily is being
dressed by your wife for her first role
in school play as a teapot that gives
Shiloh the whole afternoon wait these
are my daughters that's fair let's start
over again
lutely is Shiloh imagine one day you get
home with a dying phone Lily is being
dressed by your wife for her first role
in school play as a teapot I can Shiloh
the whole afternoon to crawl around on
the floor and play with whatever she
sees when Shiloh plays with whatever she
sees your chargers and cables seem to
disappear then you blame your daughters
and demand that they find the Chargers
it ends up with Lily missing her first
school play which makes your wife blow
up the wife blows up she throws you out
of the car and leaves you stranded in
the middle of nowhere
well let's start over again with Itron
Vivian Shiloh the day you get home with
your dying phone Lily is an adorable
teapot being dressed by your wife I
could Shiloh the whole afternoon of
crawl around on the floor and play with
whatever she sees now the I Tron hub
dock keeps all of your cables in one
place so you don't need to worry about
where to find your charger anymore it
has multiple ports so you can charge all
of your family devices at the same time

even if you're disconnected from the
fast charging base it is still a fully
functional portable charger can I have a
try
it's done it's done how can I get one
now we can talk

reef aquarium design a family business
has been making custom aquariums since
1954 to make significant improvements to
that product but we didn't stop there

hi I'm Doug Forman and I'd like to
introduce to you the first and only
spray that uses real butter and goes
from butter stick to butter spray in
just a few seconds
it's called bean
if you love cooking eating and
entertaining like I do then you probably
love using real butter now I've been
involved in launching a number of
healthy food brands Benito's for one and
I've also been around long enough to
remember when butter was given a bad rap
and we were all told to eat margarine
and now we know that margarine didn't
have such a great impact on our health
just like you I like to use real butter
while I'm cooking or just eating toast
but the problem with butter is that when
people keep it in the fridge it's always
hard cold it tears up toasts or if
you're cooking with it by the time it
melts in the pan you burn it
so we've decided to invent a better way
to store and use butter and here it is
the bean butter sprayer we wanted
something that was beautiful simple and
easy to use something that you'd be
proud of to have in your kitchen or
dining room and we think we've done it
just insert a stick of butter here and
in seconds being liquefies only the
butter you need not the whole stick and
you're ready to spray in a steady even
feeding you can bean pans for cooking
and food release you can bean bread and
rolls or make the perfect grilled cheese
sandwich you can beam vegetables with
just the right amount of butter and my
favorite bean popcorn for perfect
coverage without getting soggy you can
even use the bean with your favorite
cooking oils even coconut oil if that's
what you like the beam has a
patent-pending nozzle design that won't
clog and a high-density rechargeable
battery you can store it on the
countertop or in the fridge it's easy to
clean with water and a drop of detergent
and it rinses clean with just the push
of a button
you
this is the American press born in
Chicago and raised in Detroit ii nearly
5 years every petty friends and family
would lend to create it originally i was
inspired by solving the problem of
coffee presses that were messy and
frustrating to clean and pot based
brewers that were messed free but
provided no connection with the brewing
experience and generated thousands of
tons of landfill waste along the way I
discovered the visual Beauty cramping
hand pressed coffee within an American
press watching water transform into
coffee as you press it's really unlike
anything you've seen or experienced
before it's a hands-on experience that
engages sight and touch an anticipation
of the smell and taste a fresh brewed
coffee the coffee itself is clean and
complex but the aromas and flavors
preserved by forcing water through an
enclosed reusable pod and an ultrafine
little filter setup is quick and easy
and because the American press brews as
you press there's no waiting just press
import and when you're done through to
solving the original problem that
inspired us our patented reusable pod
technology keeps must contain and waste
out of landfills so the American press
is easy to clean and
- it also operates the hand side control
kind of sores loaf the American press
quite literally puts green control in
your hands you control the speed
pressure and timing of extraction the
way you want and now after working for
years to create a machine that we make
brewing high quality coffee as enjoyable
as drinking it there's just one step
left we need to raise most of the money
required for tooling and our first
production run and we genuinely need
your help so please back our campaign
now and join us as we work to finish
during the idea of the American press
into a reality together
