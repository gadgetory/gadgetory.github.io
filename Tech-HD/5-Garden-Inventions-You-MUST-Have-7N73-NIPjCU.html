earth and water it's a living breathing
thing a good gardener has to be mindful
you have to understand the interaction
between all of nature's elements and
what those mean for your plants 18
months ago I set out to create something
that could change how people interact
with their land their plants in their
garden something that could help them
better understand their environment
because understanding your environment
is the first step to conserving it I
created a company called Eden and this
is our first product the Eden Garden
sensor Eden assess the soil nutrition in
your garden tracks how humid or dry it
may be the temperature the kind of
sunlight you're getting throughout the
day then Eden takes all that information
about your garden and cross-references
it with meteorological data from the
area you live in
Eden can tell you what type of
fertilizer is best for your soil and
what vegetables will thrive in it
when to plant them and how often to
water and that advice isn't just based
on generalities it's based on what's
happening in your garden right now the
end result is healthier more sustainable
plants and hopefully a deeper connection
to your garden it's really easy to
overwater or underwater your garden our
sprinkler systems just aren't that smart
we want it to change that this is the
Eden water valve
it's a smart controller that manages
your existing watering system unlike
other watering systems the evening valve
doesn't use a preset schedule Eden knows
exactly what your garden needs on any
given day and the valve automatically
manages your sprinkler system to make
sure your plants get precisely that that
means no more waste no more under
watering no more over watering your
plants get just what they need if you're
a novice gardener we can help you grow
something beautiful if you're a Master
Gardener even can give you insight into
what's happening beneath the surface of
your soil my new changes in acidity and
moisture the kind of plant stressors
that you wouldn't otherwise notice until
it's too late together we can take steps
to change our food system for the better
and make it more sustainable for
generations to come
we're really excited to share eaten with
you

one of the biggest problems for
gardeners throughout the world is
containing and disposing of hedge
clippings cleaning up debris from a
traditional hedge trimmer is a time
consuming chore which means many
gardeners often delay the inevitable
and hedges grow out of control in
addition traditional hedge trimmers
typically have an exposed blade which is
not only a safety risk but is also
off-putting to many people this age old
gardening problem needed a unique
solution and so we developed a truly
unique garden grooms safety hedge
trimmer the garden grew not only cuts
and trims a wide variety and depth of
hedge but also shreds and deposits waste
into its unique collection unit
this shredding action reduces the waste
volume by ten to one which makes the
disposal of the hedge clippings a far
simpler task especially useful when
cutting thorny or spiky growth in
addition the shredded clippings are
ideal for composting the collection of
the hedge clippings also promotes a much
healthier hedge as the dead waste is not
left in the hedge in developing our
solution we also placed safety as a
major priority the garden grooms
patented handle arrangement requires a
two-handed operation in order to
activate the unit
it's totally concealed blamed virtually
eliminates the fear factor that many
gardeners face when using conventional
hedge trimmers it also dramatically
reduces the risk of cutting through the
mains cable
four areas of large hedge growth a
convenient volume bag attachment has
been developed and is fitted in the same
manner as the standard container a
unique solution
and hunt safety
a stunning design
highly-acclaimed
we're sure you'll agree garden grooms
safety hedge trimmer is a cut above the
rest
