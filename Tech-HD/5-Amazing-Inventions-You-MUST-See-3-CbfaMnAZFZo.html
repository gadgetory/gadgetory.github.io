electricity from plants using the very
nature of leaves as a solar panel months
of investigation and development here in
BO have shown successful results but
anyways let's just get to the point this
is my phone charger a plant yes and no I
am NOT crazy just bear with me and I
will explain how all of this works we
generate electricity from plants
photosynthesis and this is all you need
the cable a phone and a plant this
system collects electricity during the
whole day and night and uses it to
charge your smartphone whenever you need
it just like with any other phone
charger which isn't to plug in the USB
cable for the system to work use the
cable you already own like your device
because any phone works just fine and
there you go you're awesome plant is
recharging your awesome phone creating
the greenest and most efficient
electricity ever seen now let's take a
look deeper inside we have created a
binary biological cell with a solid
biomass layer and the biological micro
organic solution which activates in
touch with water between these layers we
find the internal electrical circuit to
store the energy and the cavity to
create an oxygen flow inside above the
system we have installed a special
semipermeable grillage to contain the
soil and allow the water to filter and
purify
firstly remove the USB cable from the
inside of the plant pot then add some
water to begin the activation process
other microorganisms allowing them to
distribute around the system now is the
moment for you to add a plant and cover
up the gaps with some extra soil then
the organic substances generated from
photosynthesis are attracted downwards
without harming the plant in any way
these substances serve as nourishment
for our bacteria which have been
previously isolated using our patented
secluding process they break up the
waste and some electrons are set free
and travel through the nanowires created
by these bacteria from one electrode to
the other in the most efficient way at
the same time water is generated due to
an excess of hydrogen the current is
driven towards the accumulator supplying
the USB connection for you to charge
your device now is the time for you to
place your beer light wherever you want
charge your smartphone your tablet ebook
or similar devices so now that you
understand how all of this works let's
rewind a little bit after row our main
goal doesn't only consist in selling
plant pots by supporting us with bio
light you're contributing for a much
greater goal our aim is to be part of a
revolution to cover the whole world with
trees so the plants nourished ourselves
in the past they will nourish our cities
in the future
you
home the last place on earth where we
can think freely speak freely build
freely dance freely fight freely and
love freely it's the only place where we
are truly free to be human and
technology has often supported this by
connecting us to a loved ones saving us
time or keeping a home safe but these
days a few secs mark technology is
overwhelming us like it's slipping out
of our control and starts controlling us
hi my name is Ali and I'm the chief
revolutionary office at protonate we
founded this company on the belief that
technology shouldn't just make our lives
easier more comfortable but that it
should support of freedom and make us
more independent that is why we have
invented the world's first smart home
companion a device that listens learns
and protects you independence at home
it's in this house so let's check it out
this home is run by Zoe it's like a hub
for your smart home once I enter it
wakes up magically in the background
though it connects organizes and steers
all my smart home devices it's an open
platform not a wall charger and while it
supports the most popular devices it's
not limited to them integrating the most
important standards it is the perfect
basis for all your smart on projects but
unlike all other products on the market
it does that without having to rely on
somebody else's
and she doesn't share your most private
information with outside world now
inside of your home we wanted to make
sure that Zoey fits right in with a
unique form factor and beautiful
materials she looks more like a design
object and a tech device interchangeable
front plates allow you to customize her
appearance to fit your style and 26 fold
cover back light LEDs allow her to
interact and communicate with her
surroundings now the most natural way to
interact with the homes is with our
voices so we taught Zoey to listen hey
Zoey play the next song okay
I really like this one now we don't live
our lives just in our living rooms so we
wanted to make sure that Zoey can be
wherever you are and we've created small
beautiful devices called voice drops and
these voice drops can be placed all
around the house and make sure that
whenever you have a voice command in one
room it only applies to that room like
this one Zoey set this room temperature
to 68 degrees the temperature in the
dining room has been set to 68 degrees
what a smart home only truly becomes
smart once it starts to learn but I
recognizing your pattern or learning a
new skill with an incredible tablet
application we made teaching an actually
fun experience for once and it's really
simple you choose what events are
triggers or sugar God for and you show
her what should happen once these
triggers have been activated find a name
save it that's it four simple rules you
can even use your voice like this hey
Zoey learn this when I leave this room
turn off the lights okay I learned a new
skill
other smartphone devices listen to all
our conversations they are fully
protected and sending that data all over
the world with Zoe
we aim to change that and we've got the
experience to do that in the last few
years we've built these amazing devices
these are private cloud servers for
small businesses and with the push of a
button they're able to run their own
systems with full data serenity now with
the help of a previous backers these
servers are now running all over the
world and now it's time to bring this
technology home with your help and your
support we create the smart home of the
free home free home
you
hey guys anyone
you
at hoof animal health and safety is our
top priority we wanted to fight against
the problems that face our pets at the
forefront of this were two major
concerns the first was lost pets one in
three will go missing during their
lifetime
the other was health over 50% of pets do
not get enough exercise but after two
years we proudly present the solution
the bean and the pea they're the most
versatile activity and pet tracking
devices on the market first is the beam
it is tiny about the size of a pill in
fact it's the world's smallest activity
tracker meaning it can fit on any pet
even puppies and kittens and even though
it's tiny we didn't compromise on
performance most pet trackers have a
battery life of 7 to 10 days
well the beam lasts up to 60 days and
then there's the pea it's a size of a
quarter and it uses a replaceable coin
cell battery which provides an even more
amazing six month battery life keeping
you worryfree our devices connect with
the proof app to track daily activity
and rest times it's a great way to
develop an exercise routine and you can
track progress over time they'll love it
too you can also use the Activity
Monitor as a preventative measure
extended rest patterns can be an early
sign of an illness our devices can also
help find missing pets if scruffy
wanders off the proof app can instantly
generate a poster that you can print
share on social media or message to your
contacts you'll also instantly receive
the contact information of nearby
shelters so you can see if he is there
once scruffy is reported missing any
phone with the proof app will be able to
receive a signal from his caller it's
like having thousands of people looking
for your pet without them even knowing
you can also reach out to the person who
will accidentally found scruffy to see
if they can keep an eye on him while you
make your way to the destination it's a
technology we call social GPS we've also
made some great friends along the way
and we are proud to announce our
national nonprofit partnership with
greater good org
hi I'm Liz Baker executive director of
greater good org we work with over 5,000
animal welfare groups across the country

announce our partnership with poop whose
new devices promote healthy lifestyles

part where we ask for your help whether
you're a pet owner or not we'd love it
