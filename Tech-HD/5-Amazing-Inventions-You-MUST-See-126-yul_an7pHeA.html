proud to introduce our latest EDC item
the Tri pack EDC pen we spent months
designing the perfect blend between a
tactical pen and an EDC pocket knife
we wanted to have all three features
included in the design but we also
needed it to be as functional and
comfortable to use as possible
we wouldn't consider using any other
encourage in the Fisher Space Inc that
allows you to write in all different
conditions like upside down or on a wet
surface
we've spent countless hours focused on
the curvature of the pen grip making it
as a ergonomically correct as possible
so you could write comfortably for long
periods
we've made the knife blade razor sharp
out of 440c stainless steel and easy to
pull out even while wearing heavy gloves
we'll be using the same factory that
manufactures many of our other
top-selling products and have a complete
fulfillment team on hand to get these
out to you without a hitch

the battery life sucks
however standard battery packs aren't
designed to support the power-hungry
switch and the cables are a pain it is
also not possible to charge while you
play on tabled mode and the building
kicks down its unstable and flimsy to
combat these problems the switch charge
is born a multifunctional battery case
designed to get the best out of your
Nintendo switch the case is built around
a twelve thousand milliamp hour battery
that has been specifically designed to
match the high power requirements of the
switch this gives you up to 12 hours
additional battery taking the switch in
and out of the cases easy due to our
simple locking methods the kickstand has
been completely redesigned with
increased ability to play on any surface
and of multiple angles it also allows
you to charge whilst on tabletop mode

bring your favorite games with you on
the go with multiple LED lights on side
always know how much charge you have
left

both lightweight and slim perfect to
take with you on the go

prototype source of correct components
and build relationships with
manufacturers who can bring this product
to market we have an experienced team of
engineers and designers who work for
companies such as Apple and Tesla and
they are busy preparing sweet charge for
mass production but we need you the
Indigo your community to help make this
product a reality because with your help
we can finally bring all-day battery
life to the switch
you
the devices we carry help us enjoy our
lives that little bit more our cameras

drones the speaker for the party the
headphones for the Train or even the
bubble machine for the park often we
have to compromise how we use our
gadgets we take less photos Russian
email or dim our screens all to save
power before our device dies nukes power
