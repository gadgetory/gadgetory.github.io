exist so we built it
this is erupt we've taken everything
we've learned in over a decade building
world-class audio products and put it
here into a rut erupt is the first
gaming headset with aluminum magnesium
drivers for crystal-clear truly high
five great sound all in a rock-solid cnc
milled aluminum chassis and last but not
least a detachable noise cancelling
microphone for great chat so I guess the
first thing I noticed when I put them on
was how copper
normally with glasses you just
these have so much cushion
it sounds like he's like right there
they made it so much more suspenseful
all the details
pigeon waffles just like that one violin
is just like it's like stands out that
was crazy
that was so intense oh my gosh I fall I
goes there
each erupted will be machined and
assembled by hand right here in our shop
in st. Louis Missouri
now we need your help Arnie is complete
and with our experience in the industry
we've been able to create multiple
production ready prototypes at this
point
all we need is funding for tooling with
that we'll be able to begin production
be sure to check out our other videos
down below to learn more about erupt and
follow our progress along the way here
and on Facebook Twitter and Instagram at
local audio
you
inside each of us there's a fundamental
desire to be creative and a unique need
to use our hands
when we reflected on those needs we
recognized that there is an inherent
relaxation that comes from these
activities
it's exciting to bring something to life
something you have personally made
earlier this year we set out to create a
new type of lego experience and we
wanted to apply those same fundamentals
we wanted to bring something to life but
infused creativity and customization
into the experience that's how a
performer was born and we're excited to
debut it for you right here on IndieGoGo
the Performa is a premium lego
experience that was designed for adults
it's made with sturdy ruts and paths and
combined with customizable skins that
comes in different colors patterns and
shapes it's designed to be a relaxing
creative challenge it takes a couple of
hours to complete one fully customized
project when we were designing the
product we spent a lot of time observing
nature
we watched the movements of living
creatures and took notes under colors
and their patterns but also looked at
how we could take that creativity even
further not only did we want to harness
the beauty that these creatures innately
have we also focused on adding a sense
of realism to each skin through
intricate and lifelike movement without
losing the creativity Lego forma
provides the perfect creative outlet
while you're unwind and relax it gives
you that meat time but also a thoughtful
creative challenge you can build it
alone or with a friend when you're done
it's something you'll be proud to show
off in your home
we're really excited Liga former could
be the beginning of a new nature
experience for the legal group we're
starting with the koi fish and three
different skins the shark skin the
splash course kim &amp;amp; the Ink course kim
let's see where that will take us
legal forma we wanted to give adults the
ability to disconnect and tap into the
fundamental pleasures of using your
hands and imagination to build something
beautiful
join us and as splash of creativity to
your day
so I'm here with Ben from BRS offroad
now he's brought along the shipper and
this is such a unique little product
talking about the concept behind this
bin we thought we would build a small
little pod that you could just jump in
and and pull up for the night and not
have to set it up and it would be a hard
shell that would there was no real
opening of it now what I've loved about
this particular product is just how
quick and easy it is to set up yeah you
can fit four people and you can be
literally set up within what two minutes
yeah it's pretty quick so you can just
pull up roll the awning out if you've
got kids you can lift the top up and
you're done that's it if you need a
shower you can you can open up a quick
pitch shower and and that's it so the
shell is also I find to be a really
awesome product yeah yeah it's not a
contains yeah so it's got a drop-down
canvas it just rolls out it's got a
diesel hot water system so it's really
quick to heat up and a couple of minutes
you got a bit of you got some hot water
and you ready to be going so and
completely off-road but yeah you've also
got that hot water system you were
saying to me before can also a couple
where's diesel heater inside as well so
right yeah so it's a heater as well in
case you want to go to the high country
and somewhere you know the deserts do
get cold so the hard shell again is good
for that and you can crank that little
heater and it's locking up and in there
now you got something pretty special
inside I mean when you're out off road
and you want to be to luxury you've got
something you can lay in bed have that
diesel heater on and as long as you've
got channels or a DVD or something yeah
you chuck something on the TV okay yeah
so you got the tele stereo and you know
some back rest air fan and you can sit
down and be out of the weather and and
the dust and the dirt for the night and
and the fly and the flies so yeah and
the kitchen at the back is awesome
favourite two features that I've noticed
there so you've got one could it be here
and you've got one for you
and then you've got this little
drop-down and you can pop you to burn a
gas stove or something so we've gone to
a portable device because of gas and
carrying gas bottles and stuff like that
so you can put any kind of portable
cooker in there and we've got a two
burner common in there which also has a
hot plate no construction underneath is
pretty unique what are the benefits of
that it's just got its single beam going
right through under two it's independent
suspension keeps their camper
lightweight you only really need that
single beam going right through on this
kind of weight it's it's under a ton
where do you see these sort of fits it's
a it's a full off-road rig so you can
definitely take it anywhere I would say
the Sherpa families couple of who's it
for
it's for the younger families that the
mum and dad that still might have the
kids at home but they might leave
further down the track and you can get
rid of that rooftop tent and you've left
with the pod there was so much to like
about the show so number one would be
that ensuite shower that just pops down
down the side so you can her shower
under the sod it was the main thing kids
really loved that secondly would be the
shadow warning that comes out the side
goes out really quickly no poles
touching the ground so it's not in your
way kids are tripping over it and the
third would be just a little simple
detail there's a little window just
above the main cap so when you lay down
you can look out and see the stars
overnight nothing that was a really nice
touch we took it through some rocky
terrain and yeah handle really well
really light on the back it was it was
good
what you guys have tried to achieve is
the simplicity side of things but having
those luxuries and I think you guys have
really nailed it you know you've got as
you said the diesel heater the TV but
you've also just got that simplicity of
you jump in there's a bit you know
you've got these brilliant ording that's
out here yeah it doesn't need poles or
anything like really strong yeah and
then you've got the option of you know
popping that rooftop tent on there if
you wanted to do that or just having it
as a pod like it yeah it's so versatile
so Ben thank you so much for bringing
this along he's such an awesome little
unit yeah I hope you've had a good trip
great great trip</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
