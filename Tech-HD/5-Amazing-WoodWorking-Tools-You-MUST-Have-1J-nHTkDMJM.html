we could all use a hand now you can save
time and your sanity
this simple yet effective clamp holding
fixture buys you extra time during glue
ups by streamlining the process and
positions your clamps to optimize
pressure across panel or puts clamp
pressure just where you want it as in
raised panel door glue ups the CSS 24
comes in two models one nests three
quarters of an inch or smaller pipe
clamps and the other holds one quarter
inch and heavier 3/8 inch parallel jaw
clamp bars the four sides of the CSS 24
are quickly assembled using notches in
each bar that forms a sturdy egg-crate
joint and for longer panel glue ups
simply use two or more to handle your
needs clamping with pipe clamps couldn't
be easier since the CSS 24 elevates the
handle for easy cranking plus the powder
coat paint finish cleans right off the
woodpecker's CSS 24 the best glue up
buddy a woodworker can have
the wheel style marking gauge has earned
its place for tight tolerance joinery
layout you just can't beat that crisp
cut but let's face it there are times in
the shop when an accurately drawn pencil
mark is even better
introducing the approved woodpeckers
marking gauge and pal marking gauge both
ingeniously designed with an integrated
mechanical pencil so now you can make
either hairline cuts or easily readable
pencil marks with dead-on accuracy
machine from aircraft grade aluminum
these upgraded marking pages are built
to last and enable greater control and
more precise marketing plan by using the
optional spacers and second marking
wheel you can lay down dual scribe lines
in sixteenth inch increments from eight
inch to half inch all in one pass the
large neural locking knob features a
built in hex wrench to tighten or loosen
the wheel cutter and spacers and you can
conveniently keep all of the extra
components inside the tool and now
included with the metric gauges are
metric scribe wheel spacers ideal for
scribing both mortar shoulders
simultaneously when using a Festool
Domino the anodized aluminum bar has two
precision laser engraved 32nd inch or
metric scales one for the wheel marker
and one for the pencil mark the bar
itself is three quarters of an inch in
diameter giving you a solid grip on the
tool
a new-and-improved marking gauge and
panel marking gauge from woodpeckers
precision built in the USA for fine
woodworkers everywhere
woodpeckers newest one-time tool the
ultimate doweling jig significantly
broadens the scope of dowel joinery
possibilities like Center holes for face
frames offset holes for 1/8 inch reveals
and double hole offsets for robust T
joints and miter joints furthermore it
can be used for non Dowling chores like
drilling precisely spaced and aligned
rows of shelf pin holes our jig is
certainly the bra Gnaeus twunt thick
aluminum beefy stainless steel and solid
brass produce a rock-solid foundation
that will not distort when applying full
clamping pressure to your stock you can
be sure your dowel holes are drilled
dead nut square this baby weighs in at
more than 4 pounds and that doesn't even
include the end stop edge guide and
attachment bars the ultimate doweling
jig comes with hardened stainless steel
drill guide bushings mounted in the 1/2
inch thick by 4 and 1/4 inch wide by 7
inches long solid aluminum base plate
drill guide bushings come in two sets of
four in both 1/4 inch and 3/8 inch
diameters also available in optional
five six eight and 10 millimeter
diameters as well guide bushings travel
in a slot in the base plate and are
always perfectly spaced thanks to the
innovative stainless steel cam plate the
cam plate features a scale and pointer
that indicates hole Center spacing the
spacing range is 3/4 inch to one and 1/4
inch
below the baseplate are a fixed clamping
jaw and a unique adjustable jaw
stainless steel and brass clamping
screws are fitted to the fixed jaw and
can be used in three different positions
for holding narrow or wider stop the jig
holds stock up to two and 3/8 inch thick
the adjustable jaw can be set for either
centered or offset hole drilling
perfectly spaced double rows of dowels
are not only possible they're easy jaw
adjustment is achieved by selecting one
of four jaw faces a b c and d and where
the face is positioned on the base plate
face a and c allow 1/16 inch adjustments
and face b and d allow 1/32 inch
adjustments proper positioning is
guaranteed thanks to engraved scales on
the base plate and matched serrated
grooves milled into the base plate and
jaw and once the jaw is fastened in
place the grooves prevent unintentional
movement of the jaw the adjustable
clamping range from hole Center is from
1/4 inch to 1:13 30 seconds of an inch
the ultimate doweling jig adjustable end
stop delivers repeatable perfection it
functions in three different ways
front face for tall boards notch corner
for longer boards and with the round pin
installed for offsets less than 2 inches
it's the perfect solution for drilling
precisely aligned holes in mating pieces
think drilling face frames for joining
and grain rails to edge grain styles the
end stop is primarily used at the end of
the jig in combination with 4 3/8 inch
by 12 inch long stainless steel
attachment bars that easily thread
together for extension up to 48 inches
they can also be attached to the side of
the jig for other applications
easy-to-read laser engraved scales are
on the bottom of the base plate for
setting the end stop to the whole center
of the drill guide bushing which is
reflected by the zero line either mark
your first hole location on your board
and align it to the zero mark or use the
scale and align the board's edge to the
desired distance yet another unique
feature is the adjustable edge guide a
major limitation of all other Dowling
jigs is they only work near the edge of
the workpiece
woodpeckers ultimate doweling jig sports
an adjustable edge guide that blows this
challenge out of the water now you can
use dowel joinery on the face of wide
stock and plywood simply remove the
clamping jaws attach one or more
extension rods to the base plate then
slide the edge guide on to the rod now
you're set to use dowels to join parts
that were virtually impossible before
and the edge guide can also be used to
drill a series of accurately spaced
repeatable holes in case work parts like
bookshelf sides for shelf supports this
task is easily accomplished using the
supplied 1/4 inch and 3/8 inch guide
pins just insert the guide pin and the
first drill guide bushing to index from
your first or last hole drill it's that
simple
and for those of you who use the 32
millimeters system this ultimate
doweling jig can easily be set for
thirty two millimeter line boring
woodpecker's ultimate doweling jig has
it all our latest one-time tool has
everything you could ever want in a
doweling jig
highest quality materials made to
exacting tolerances stout construction
and easy to use with great features no
other doweling jig is ever provided make
it feel at home in your shop introducing
woodpeckers angle gauge the angle gauge
is designed to measure the bevel angle
of your woodworking chisels and playing
blades and some turning tools the
woodpeckers angle gauge is machined from
aluminum for strength and accuracy and
anodized for durability
then laser engraved with one degree
scale markings for precise measuring the
angle gauge is easy to use set your
cutting tool on the base holding a
flattened level as you slide it towards
the arm when the bevel is aligned with
the bottom of the arm you can read the
main bevel angle at the top of the arm
now push your tool further to measure
the secondary micro bevel which is
usually two degrees greater the angle
gauge covers all your chisel and plane
measuring needs from paring chisels and
low angle plane blades to
general-purpose chisels most smooth and
Jack planes as well as jointer planes
for heavy chisel work by chopping
mortises in hardwood or really high
angles for sharper blades in certain
plane blades tailored for difficult wood
grains the bottom line a small precise
tool that does a big job
woodpeckers angle gauge like all
woodpecker brand woodworking tools
woodpeckers angle gauge is manufactured
in our plan just outside of Cleveland
Ohio in the USA
