jar and press the open jar button the
outer arms gripped the jar while the
inner arms clamped tightly around the
lid and rotate effortlessly loosening

release lid button and the arms let go
of the lid the open ease opens a variety
of glass jar sizes from small to large
it's compact so it fits in any drawer
