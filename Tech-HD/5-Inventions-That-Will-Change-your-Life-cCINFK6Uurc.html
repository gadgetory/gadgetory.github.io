we love our cats but we hate dealing
with their litter boxes and they're
hardly user-friendly I mean your choice
is either the box with the scoop or some
expensive contraption that still needs
to be emptied but there is a better way
introducing the loop litter box here's
how it works to clean the litter box
just lift the top tray and the waste is
separated from the clean litter turn the
tray 180 degrees place it at the bottom
of the stack and that's it cleaning your
litter box takes seconds with no mess or
hassle what makes loop better three
identical slotted trays individually
each tray acts as a sift but when any
two are stacked together they form a
solid tray add the third tray and they
create a perpetual sifting loop you'll
never have to scoop again no more
wasting cat litter simply top it up from
time to time in the spring of nineteen
ninety-four i went to the hairdresser's
when I walked in there was a guy on his
hands and knees with the litter box what
are you doing I said well it's a new
kind of litter box and I'm looking for
an investor and when he showed me how it
worked I was absolutely amazed and I put
up my hand and I said hello I'm dini
patty I'm your new investor a few years
later went to the US it was a huge hit
and sold almost two million units and
unfortunately like a lot of television
products in the nineties it disappeared
in an interesting twist of fate I am now
working with my son to bring back the
best cat litter box ever made we've
redesigned the product using the
insights and consumer feedback from the
original version this allowed us to
create a new and even better litter box
we've created a durable product of the
highest quality that's aesthetically
pleasing as it is functional while still
being affordable we created it to be the
last litter box you'll ever have to buy
it's an exciting time because we are
really close to bringing back the
world's best cat litter
with your backing will begin production
immediately upon reaching our funding
goal everything will be produced locally
to ensure its of the highest quality all
we need is your support to make it
happen the loop litter box the litter
box reinvented
