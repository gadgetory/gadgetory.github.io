honestly I feel like a wallet is a
person's most basic tool
it carries a person's identity money
business and for an object that carries
such precious things I want someone to
take pride in what they're carrying we
started an NGO to take everyday products
and breathe new life in them but we want
to really do it through materials
different manufacturing processes taking
it and really kind of pushing it over to
talk
along with quality I wanted to offer
some functionality to the wallet so we
wanted to offer a multi-tool that has
more than ten functions
I think you have an entangled wallet
means that you appreciate good design
good materials you appreciate style
fashion and you're just a badass person
I think it's really important that we
make this wallet locally to support
local vendors local businesses and to
really maintain quality control and make
sure we bring the best product to our
customers we want to thank the
Kickstarter community for your support
on bringing this project to life we
can't do it without you thank you
we use the internet to make plans
connect work and play together the
internet hosts our lives so why do we
entrust it to organisations who
typically don't have our best interests
at heart
most of our communications flow through
centralized web servers where
corporations control our online
experience they collect our information
limit our access to it and then sell it
to advertisers and because a centralized
internet concentrates power it's
vulnerable it can be censored hacked and
manipulated the internet is broken but
what if no one stood between you and
your data or dictated how you connect
with friends family and community if the
internet were free from central control
it would vastly expand humanity's
potential for creativity and
collaboration it would change the whole
game we know this world is possible
which is why we created polo polo is a
community rebuilding the internet by and
for the users rather than running
information through centralized
corporate servers like Amazon and Google
holo offers peer-to-peer web
applications that replace the middleman
with the spare computing power from our
own devices this creates a cloud run by
users like you and me holo gives you
back control of your data and online
relationships this isn't just file
hosting this is distributed crypto apps
small and large all the way up to
Facebook scale but we can't launch this
alone we need you to run a slice of this
new net and we don't want venture
capital to take control of this space
that's why we've built all this without
it and now we're asking you and your
friends to step up get a hosting box and
take back the internet simply get a holo
hosting box enable yourself and others
to access distributed apps through a web
browser and get paid in our secure
cryptocurrency
hello fuel holo fuel can then be used to
pay hosts for data storage and
processing plus it makes in-app
purchases and micro payments easy apps
available on holo are built on holo
chain an alternative to blockchain
technology that is massively faster more
energy efficient more scalable and
10,000 times cheaper holo chain
architecture is so lightweight that you
can operate a full Facebook scale note
from a single smartphone that's great
news for developers who can build fast
applications that scale organically the
easiest way to help launch holo and
participate in its growth is to purchase
a holo port a pre-configured computer
we've optimized to host crypto apps just
plug it in connect it to the Internet
and start earning we've teamed up with a
world-class hardware supplier to produce
three different holo ports each with a
different capacity for earning holo fuel
choose the holo port that works best for
you and quickly earn back the cost of
your purchase if you claim one of the
first 1,000 you'll become a founding
member at holo we're building the future
of the Internet one that doesn't impose
or exploit but empowers join our
community
run holo earn crypto together
we can build a better Internet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
