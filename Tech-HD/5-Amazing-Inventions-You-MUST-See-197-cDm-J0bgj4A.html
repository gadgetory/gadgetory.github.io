my name is Hamish smart I'm Jesse Reid
and we're the partners that order design
in New York City we're at graphic design
firm and we specialize in branding but
we also found it standards manual which
is publishing imprint specializing in
graphic design titles Jesse and I spent
about five or six years working under
Michael Burt a pentagram New York a
pentagram we were socially apartness
and we worked on a number of big
branding campaigns I went on MasterCard
Jesse got to work with Michael on
Hillary Clinton branding in 2016 our
first title which was a reissue of the
New York City Transit Authority graphic
Stan's manual is loosely what inspired
us to design this watch a big part of
that system is the notion of lines in
circular icons and it's become an iconic
part of New York City's social fabric
really were the watch with Anna Cohen we
tried to represent time in its most
simple form and for us that meant
reducing it to its graphic form in terms
of hours and number of hours so we took
each hour is represented by a dot each
of those hours added up to 78 dots or
one full day you know it is either when
I o'clock two o'clock or three o'clock
and then in 15 intervals past that this
watch has no hands instead of hands the
face rotates so your perception of time
over 12 hours is so slow that you
actually can't see this what we're
moving at all
hopefully this watch kind of takes some
of the pressure off of knowing exactly
what minute is or what's second and it
is and you can just kind of be and see
and kind of hear instead of rushing to
the next thing apart from being just a
beautiful timepiece we wanted the order
watch be a beautiful piece of design
that you could wear</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
