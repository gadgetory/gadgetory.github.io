writers to stay focused using
traditional computers and that's why we
created traveller the portable
disruption free writing tool the travel
enables you to finish your novel finish
your blog post finish your paper finish
your screenplay whatever you're working
out whatever your writing and enables
you to get that done faster and more
creatively traveller is our brand-new
distraction free writing tool that we've
taken all of the feedback and all the
comments about our original free right
smart typewriter and put it into a
brand-new ultra portable small compact
folding product that's also available at
a lower cost so the way the traveller
works is it really is as simple as
turning it on and you can start writing
you sit down you start writing it's all
saved locally on the device and as soon
as you're connected to a network it
seamlessly backs up to the cloud I think
laptops rightfully so have gotten a very
bad name for their keyboard designs as
we've kind of gone for slimmer and
slimmer of keyboards we've lost through
this typing experience and so for us
when we were designing traveller it is
really important for us to think about
how can this be the best keyboard for
this toward the right extreme in making
one of the things that was really
important to us when we design a
traveller was the battery life we knew
that writers love to travel they love to
be inspired by the environments they're
in the traveler has about 30 hours of
battery life of continuous use so this
is the device you really can't take with
you unlike a traditional LCD that's
found in your laptop or your phone we
used eh ink is a unique type of
technology that allows actual ink
particles to come to the surface of the
display the best thing about e ink is
that you can use it outside and it works
in every environment with a long battery
life and the e-ink screen it is the
ultimate
we've shipped the original three right
smart typewriter to customers in over 50
countries all around the world and what
we've heard consistently from them is
that it's helping them actually double
their hourly work on so whereas before
some of writers may have written in four
to five hundred words now they're
writing 800 to a thousand words per hour
and that dramatically improves their
productivity and is able to actually
help them get their writing done
for me one of the things that has
continuously inspired me continuously
kind of has enabled me to put like my
whole heart into it is that the people
that are using free writes and the
people that will be using travelers are
making amazing things so making works of
art they're literally pursuing their
dreams with our product and I think that
is just the most inspiring thing the
traveler is in prototype form and
working great it's based off of the free
right platform and so we have a clear
path to production but we still need
your help to be able to deliver the
product to you in the spring of next
year join us and be part of our mission
to help writers everywhere break free
from distraction join our campaign and
let's revolutionize how the world writes
yes sir
because
bringing this
I care about my skin that's why I use
photo cream
it makes all my skin problems disappear
and it makes me look ten years younger
ten years younger so what like six man I
hate these commercials promising a
flawless complexion and showing a 16
year old girl whose only skin defects
are a few frickin freckles the truth is
our skin is gonna get old all we can
really do is look our very best now this
is Janelle personal an oxygenation
beauty device for home use oxygenation
what's that why aren't you go home and
ask your mommy little girl
oxygenation is these trend these days
we've enrolled and for a good reason
it's a real breakthrough in skincare in
case you've missed it
oxygenation brings oxygen to skin cells
helps boost the circulation and tiny
blood vessels and makes the skin look
fresh and glowing so obviously a lot of
companies started selling home
oxygenation treatments only that they
don't really work that's because most of
them just throw oxygen at your skin but
oxygen can't penetrate your skin and
enter yourself if it could we probably
wouldn't need to breathe I only breathe
organic oxygen
Janell personal is the latest product by
Paula Jean inventors of the proven
medical grader oxygenation technology
already used in tens of thousands of
clinics worldwide now I'm gonna explain
the science behind Gao personal but for
that I'm gonna wear a lab coat because
apparently people believe a scientific
explanation when it's done by someone in
a lab coat real oxygenation of your skin
happens when oxygen reaches the skin
cells from inside the body
Paula jeans unique technology doesn't
put oxygen on your skin but creates a
layer of co2 bubbles on the face causing
the body to release oxygen to the skin
cells in science we call it the Bohr
effect the oxygen of the skin cells then
increases the flow of blood and tiny
vessels and encourages skin rejuvenation
that's real oxygenation with Jo
personnel they've found a way to shrink
their technologies so you can also use
it at home yield signs high-five
here's how it works first you exfoliate
the skin then the co2 molecules are
released so the oxygen molecules in the
body flow towards them
lastly you pamper your skin with
nutrient-rich active ingredients and
that's it just a few minutes and your
skin looks very best for days you look
good
I know Thanks and thank you for it don't
rue the moment so if you want to look
yourself only better in just a few
minutes with home oxygenation that
actually works get Geneo personal</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
