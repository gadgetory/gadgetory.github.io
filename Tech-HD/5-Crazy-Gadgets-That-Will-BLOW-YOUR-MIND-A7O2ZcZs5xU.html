and shoulders with the time that we
spend with technology bad posture
driving long hours as an inventor I saw
that there was definitely a need to have
some sort of a really simple home device
where you could spend 10 minutes a day
with a gentle slope to extend your neck
for good posture take Michelle for
instance she's been visiting
chiropractors and massage therapists to
help with her tension headaches and the
knots that she has in her neck and
shoulders you know I was so used to my
chronic pain that I had kind of lost
sight of just how much it was impacting
my life
before it used to be that I woke up
stressed I was stressed all day at work
stress and I came home to cook dinner
when I lean back I feel my full body
relaxed and it's really helped me get
back to living a normal stress and
tension free life no more worries about
bad mood and for performance at work the
best part of it is that I can use it
every day after just 10 minutes of using
it I'm feeling more freedom it's got an
adjustable decline so it really supports
my neck and upper back so now my neck
and shoulders feel just really clear I
just don't feel that tension all the
time that I was carrying with me
it's day-to-day struggle just to stay
happy and focus the tension and
discomfort of my neck is
what I can do that discovery of the
triangle 2.0 has given me my life back
I'm able to work out the way I want to
I'm a calmer driver I go to work and
focus and be productive I feel really
great I just feel happier in general and
when I get home I get that 10 minutes
with tranquil 2.0 I can go from one
setting to another it feels better as I
go through the settings even though I
punished my body working at computers
for years now I have a way out it's just
amazing we made sure that the design is
portable instruction free and shareable
with family members we knew that we had
to make the second generation and the
second generation has an all new heating
pad and it really increases the comfort
and relaxation even more the heat level
is adjustable so I don't have to be
locked into one option I can immediately
feel when I turn on the heat the
difference that it makes it really
allows my neck muscles to relax now that
I've been using the tranquil 2.0 I feel
calmer I'm in a better mood I'm happier
I don't feel this weight on my shoulders
all the time it's been really amazing we
want to get this awesome product out to
people everywhere but we can't do it
