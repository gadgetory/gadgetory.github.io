tripod solution when we travel we always
pack a tripod but we got tired of
lugging around heavy bulky tripods to
take forever to set up that's why we've
created the 1-pound with a simple pull

optimize them for different demands

project back us today I'll bring them
upon to the world
straight down Hajj excellent hi I'm John
a founder of hero inflatable shirts in
recent years we've been refining a
product to help save the lives of people
who experience difficulties in water
it's designed for children and adults
alike and is suited for all water based
activities according to the World Health
Organization global estimates of 360,000
people die from drowning annually these
situations are preventable with
lifejackets but they're often stowed
away are not easily accessible and are
also bulky and restrictive we believe
we've developed an alternative solution
our hero inflatable Raschi has been
designed not only for boating but for
all water based activities if the
unexpected occurs the hero is
user-friendly and simple to activate you
can instantly inflate the hero and
signal for help the hero is equipped
with an easy-access replaceable co2
cartridge for instant inflation and an
aural inflator for manual backup
it can be used for swimming snorkeling
body boarding surfing stand-up paddling
hike surfing kayaking boating
waterskiing I think you get the idea
hero rushes are constructed using a soft
and flexible polyester like accomplished
and our double lining ensures your shirt
will not rub against you the adjustable
waistband keeps the shirt snug against
your body preventing it from riding we
are certifying our prototypes to ISO
standards to provide wearer's confidence
in knowing a hero works in the last 12
months we've been refining the look of
the shirt and are now ready to go into
production
while we believe we have a great product
and then it has huge potential in saving
lives around the world we really need
your support to make it a reality with
your support the hero Russia will become
the hero that saves lives</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
