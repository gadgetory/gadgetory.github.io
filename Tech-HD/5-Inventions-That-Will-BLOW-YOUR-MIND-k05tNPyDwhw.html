passionate about connected home and
expert in hardware software and through
design like you we love tech and it's
now all connected and smart but every
single device comes with its own mobile
app or remote control whatever was a
simple way to control everything
meet Smart Remote the most advanced
control system for your home Smart
Remote gives you the ability to control
any device via Wi-Fi Bluetooth are
infrared simply point at the device you
want to control and smart remote screen
adapts instantly black magic
we have also integrated your favorite
services you can point at your door to
order Newberg
or at your window to check the weather
the possibilities are endless
Smart Remote comes with a charging base
and prayer room sensors which are used
for indoor positioning setup is super
easy just place the sensors in the room
where you would like to use Smart Remote
and that's it our patent-pending
technology combines an indoor
positioning system with motion tracking
sensors allowing Smart Remote to be
incredibly accurate and highly
responsive after years of research and
development we are now ready to start
production for the design jealous party
would save Alex new ipod is also
possible - Irina dotty teapot is a
cellular reasonably smart phone with a
tilaka multi-national William Ford is an
extremist up with Lee as Philip is
attractive you see with possible Ares to
build a perfectly designed product we
tested dozens of prototypes we worked
with a leading global manufacturer to
build a fantastic high-definition screen
for the Smart Remote
what you have seen is just the beginning
we want a smart remote to be the only
reemerge we'll ever need
be the first to receive it and help us
build an amazing product that you will
love using every day join us thank you
in today's fast-paced world we hardly
had time to get ready in the morning let
alone brew a fresh cup of coffee in the
comfort of our home buying our cup to go
on the way to work or to school has
become a staple of our daily routine
unfortunately instead of enjoying the
unique flavors of our favorite blends
we're often forced to race through our
cups before they cool
for someone who buys his cup of coffee
on a regular basis it really bothered me
that I wasn't able to enjoy my beverage
- as much as I'd love to by the time I
sat down started drinking only to
realize minutes later done my beverage
is already cold I wanted to develop a
beverage warmer that was more tailored
towards consumers buying their to-go cup
of coffe like myself at the same time I
wanted to make it light portable and
rechargeable meat lava clip a coffee
warmer that is going to reinvent the
coffee experience light portable and
rechargeable vla'ben Flint is a coffee
warmer that simply clips to the bottom
of your cup and goes with you wherever
your coffee goes no more racing again
this time no more cold coffee simply
clip and go it's that simple
existing beverage warmers offer
variations of a flat based heating
element but with the elevated basic
paper cups how does the coffee stay warm
lava clips unique clipping mechanism
adjusts to fit and secure to the bottom
of most paper cups of different brands
and sizes by creating a space for the
base of the cup to sit in the heating
element is always in full contact with
the base of the cup maximizing heat
transfer keeping your coffee warm
designs to suit students and
professionals lava clip uses a standard
USB port to recharge on whichever power
source is most convenient whether that's
your computer at work or an outlet at
home our team of engineers and designers
have spent countless hours developing a
product that isn't just functional but
is also eye-catching among all the
tested prototypes we were finally able
to implement a clipping mechanism that
firmly secures to the bottom of most
paper cups served at coffee shops
without compromising ease of use or
design
lava clip is equipped with a world-class
heating element that is not only energy
efficient but is also waterproof the
typical paper cutter cups are made of
heavy paper material which is a fair
insulator but it only allows you to
enjoy little hot beverage for about 10
to 15 minutes before it's temperature
drops below optimal drinking point the
serving temperature of coffee is about
seven degrees in system and it drops by
roughly one degree per minute in order
to maintain the temperature of coffee
above 60 degrees
we developed a healing mechanism which
is capable of recovering the heat loss
from the car and keeping the coffee ball
now we're ready to take tama clip to the
next step we need your help in order to
do that your contribution will go
directly towards covering the cost
for adoption this is those papers as a
plastic mold it slows production
assembly and packaging if your support
we can bring lovely tonight so we can
all enjoy your coffee one step at a time
first we made a heart rate monitor that
was infinitely more accurate we taught
it to talk with virtually any device or
application we gave it a memory so you
don't need to have your phone nearby and
a brain so it knows exactly what you're
doing and for how long and designed it
to fit effortlessly into your life all
day every day it's smart enough to know
when you're in danger of overtraining
and when you can push it to the limits
amp strip train to the edge
now you can help revolutionize the way
athletes train hi I'm Dave Monahan CEO
of Fit links and an avid runner fit
links has been in business for over 20
years
traditionally we've embedded our
technology inside other companies
devices including very popular consumer
fitness devices and trip is a thin
waterproof sensor that could be worn all
day you can wear it while you're working
while you're sleeping while you're
exercising and provides information to
the user on our activity levels their
heart rate their respiration their sleep
in their posture it's not just to be
used or an exercise can actually
provides information on your rest of
recovery as well the amp tip is our
first consumer device and we want to get
it right we're almost done with
development of the product and we're
looking for people to provide feedback
to make the product perfect by
contributing to our IndieGoGo campaign
you will get one of the first amp strips
and a chance to be part of our beta
program thanks for being part of our
journey we couldn't do it without you
you
one of the problems with the current
medical system is that you only connect
with the system every now and then we
are in the biggest tsunami of
personalization in the world but for
medicine we are still waiting in line in
an emergency room with your smartphone
you can find out about anything anywhere
but what you can't find is information
about your own body in 2005 I spent
almost a year in hospital with one of my
children I started to look at all the
machines and all the readings after a
couple of weeks I understood it and it
was very liberating to have that
knowledge I want to make a company that
you know gives people these numbers the
Scout will allow people to see the
fingerprint of their health in very
minut detail when you have a visit with
a physician or you go to an ER the first
thing they do is check the vital signs
to see where you're at right now this
just hold it to your forehead in a
second you have all of it the Scout
gives you your heart rate blood pressure
your temperature your respiratory rate
and your oxygen levels in your blood
this kind of scout works everywhere it
analyzes all your readings and then
stores it in when people have a scout
they can connect with their physician in
ways that was never possible before we
are competing in the XPrize this is
important because what we aim to do with
scanadu scout is to bring the five
senses into a single recording device we
will have essentially a doctor in the
palm of your hand this is the ultimate
consumer device for medicine we put a
lot of thought into giving you medical
grade data that's easy to understand
records it and enables you to
communicate with your physician and make
smart decisions together we have a
relationship with NASA although their
medicine was never actually destined to
be for consumers
it was listened to be four astronauts in
space station this is exactly the kind
of responsive platform that we need this
allows us to go further and enhance our
performance right now when you buy a cup
of coffee
you can see that transaction on your
smartphone even before you leave the
store with the Scout you can see the
impact on your health before you leave
the store so for parents you can find
out early in the day if your child is
gonna be sick later than they are not
it's something that's good for all of us
this is one of the most exciting times
in the history of medicine and the
history of health we can finally
understand our bodies and adjust them in
ways that it's never been possible
before but that takes all of us working
together so join us in making this
reality
they
for watching our video my name is Colby
and I built the best pair of gloves
possible I know that's a pretty bold
statement but there's something you need
to know about me I have a hereditary
muscle disorder similar to Reynaud
syndrome that causes me to lose motor
function when I get cold most people can
warm their hands back up fairly quickly
and go on about your business
unfortunately when my hands get cold it
may take several hours for me to regain
motor function this has been a problem
my entire life especially since I love
the outdoors I've struggled for years to
find a glove that was truly warm
waterproof and provided reasonable
dexterity for cold weather activities
that glove didn't exist until now the
steelhead glove
utilizing the one-piece patented out dry
construction process creates the
ultimate waterproof breathable barrier
in gloves this impenetrable layer is
permanently heat bonded directly to the
outer fabric leaving no seams no gaps
and no way for water to get in this
allows us to build a thinner lighter
glove with maximum dexterity and feel
traditional waterproof gloves use a
membrane that is nothing more than a
giant bag inserted between glove layers
moisture is trapped inside the glove
creating a cold damp feeling your hands
are dry but they are still cold because
you literally have a moisture barrier
that inhibits breathability and acts as
a cooling layer inside the glove how
much does this cooling effect have on
your hand temperature in a controlled
test we submersed a traditional membrane
glove and our steelhead glove in 50
degree water for 5 minutes and used a
military-grade thermal imaging camera to
record the results our steelhead gloves
outperformed the leading competition by
an astonishing 10.8 degree difference in
hand temperature
in the real world these are the only
gloves that allow me to function in cold
weather outdoor activities if they work
for me they'll work for you by
supporting our campaign you'll not only
receive our gratitude but the answer to
my lifelong dilemma the ultimate pair of
gloves</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
