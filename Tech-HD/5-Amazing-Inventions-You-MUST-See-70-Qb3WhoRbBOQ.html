many products at home and at work have
been around forever but as convenient as
they are it's impossible to completely
empty them until now we all have
accepted the struggle to get everything
out of these tubes
amazingly they can take up to twenty
percent of their precious contents to
the landfill
look around your house how many tubes
can you find you'll be surprised let's
end this nonsense once and for all and
start saving you money squeeze tubes get
ready to feel the big squeeze hello I'm
Steve and I'm Clark we're mechanical
engineers from Denver Colorado we're
pros at designing new products the idea
of wasting anything really bugs me the
squeeze tubes no matter how hard I tried
I know I'm not getting everything I paid
for there are a lot of prague's out
there that come in tubes and many them
are really expensive so a few years ago
we set out to design a product that
could completely empty any tube
including medications cosmetics and
moisturizers sunscreens art supplies
food items and of course toothpaste and
today we are excited to announce the
world and we have finally created these
simplest and best way to empty tubes the
big squeeze is a patented hand tool
specifically designed to eliminate waste
and save you money on all your tubes
here's how it works take any partially
empty tube open the jaws give you the
end of the tube in between the gears
squeeze the handles and turn the crank
the gears do all the work it's that easy
all the contents are pushed forward
ensuring you get every last bit it took
many rounds of prototypes to arrive at
the ultimate solution but we knew it had
to feel comfortable in your hand and be
extremely easy to operate so we spent
months fine-tuning the ergonomics for a
great grip a quality feel it's also
engineered to last a lifetime with
diecast zinc handles and extruded
aluminum gears to handle the toughest of
tubes we are proud to say that the big
squeeze will be backed with a lifetime
warranty and made entirely in the USA
it's a tool just like a can opener it
doesn't stay with the tube you just use
it as needed
one big squeeze around your household or
business you have all your tubes and
extended lease on life it's like
squeezing money right back in your
wallet
mr. Finn's please
even I hate that sound then just like me
would likely comes out people helped my
turn up letís what we do mostly is
repairing T's when it's too late the
Germany over 12 million teeth had to be
extracted last year we want to change
that I tell all my patients that for
healthy teeth it's mandatory to use
floss or interdental brushes using the
toothbrush only is not enough the
problem is people just hate to do into
them to clean all devices like floss our
irrigator and interdental brushes are
too inconvenient to use them every day
this is why we invented during wash with
the intelligent feeler you can easily
find the interdental spaces and slide
from one gap to another by pushing the
wing brush together the brush runs
through the fila in between your teeth
we are mark lewis and Barack we found
our company last year mark and I have a
business background and Louis's a
dentist he convinced us of this
incredible idea combines the easy
handling of an oral irrigator with the
effectivity of an international brush
today the wing brushes the revolution of
interdental cleaning we did a scientific
study on 1000 internet spaces and
decided to bring the wing brush on the
market ourselves the results were clear
with the wing brush test process could
reach significantly more interdental
spaces than with a conventional
interdental brush and top the test
persons preferred the wing rush of a
common interdental brushes scientific
research has shown the peculiar
responsible for the most all diseases if
we find a way to eliminate these
bacteria we are able to prevent carriers
and hold on titles various cleaning aids
exist to fight is bacteria but how come
that over fifty percent of all people
have periodontitis and ninety-two
percent of all grown-ups had experience
with carriers using floss is cumbersome
it is really hard to reach all
interdental spaces even more important
this the floss does not have effective
cleaning power interdental brushes have
the highest affectivity unfortunately
they usability
is more difficult the wire inside the
brush can hurt your gum and advance in
all directions the wing brush is the
solution
yah fan and fan hamburger is dead the ed
is so simple gustav von Trotta he is
prob late he asked photo to conventions
a group above a harvard study see one
film i evoke a document and Ji Won and
report in leaving Washington following
guns education within survived confirmed
apology on staff we are ready to start
we need your help to boost winger
support us to really find oil care make
it more simple the wing brush is just
the beginning

hey Kickstarter life gets busy life is
good life is fun we all have ordinary
days and once in a while an
extraordinary day they all start the
same you've got to get ready things are
just too complicated there have been
lots of attempts to fix the Bell
something as simple as a belt shouldn't
have a bulky mechanism for adjustments
one step better was a plain webbing belt
the thing is you can't wear that to
every occasion it gets old weaving them
in and out and adjusting them every time
we put them on how many times do you
have to adjust your belt only to use the
exact same hole then you're left with
that flap just a little out of place
hanging out what if the holidays were
good to you and you have to add a hole
just to make your belt work we weren't
okay to just improve the belt so we set
out to make the best belt for you we
wanted a belt you didn't have to cinch
down every time you put it on we wanted
a belt that wasn't big and bulky but
great for every occasion we made
prototype after prototype working out
all the kinks 12 different designs 30
prototypes too many sleepless nights to
count and we've got it perfected with an
aircraft grade aluminum buckle we then
took military-grade webbing and to make
it fit for every occasion we wrapped it
in ballistic nylon we started in a
garage upgraded to the basement and
ended up partnering with some of the
best people in the world Kickstarter
we're excited to bring to you the belt
adjusted low profile and always adjust
it it's the fastest on and off belt out
there it's easy to adjust and once you
have it where you need it it's there
ready to go every time
with the best materials available you
don't have to worry about cracking or
stretching we are offering you black
gray and brown for your fourth color we
want you our backers to help us choose
buckles come in four different options
to let you build your belt how you want
it we're the little guy where the reason
kickstarter exists we've done the work
to make this project more than just a
dream our manufacturers are ready to go
and we need your help backers to help us
get over that last hurdle we've taken
the steps to ensure that your rewards
will exceed your expectations help us
launch by buying a venturi belt with
your help we can get this project off
the ground choose your favorite pledge
thanks backers

hi I love giving gifts I love giving
this up the holidays for birthdays but
what I don't like is wrapping gifts I
don't like getting on the floor chasing
my paper having the roll of paper roll
back up on me while I'm trying to wrap
it or get stuck under something I'm
Brett Wortman and that's why i invented
rap buddies rap buddies come in two
pieces and they attach on either side of
a roll of gift wrap clipping it to the
side of a table they break down for easy
storage simply unscrew the post that
holds the gift wrap in place and you can
store them with the rest of your gift
wrapping supplies we're bringing these
to Kickstarter because while I can
produce them using 3d printing
technology in small quantities it
doesn't scale well we need you to help
us produce injection molds that we can
use to make them in high quantities so
that we can fulfill our Kickstarter
backers and get them into retail stores
as well for every pledge we will send
you a pair of rap buddies in your choice
of several colors and you will know that
you have helped us achieve our goal of
bringing these to the market the hardest
part of giving gifts should not be the
gift wrapping so rap fast rap fun rap
buddies
