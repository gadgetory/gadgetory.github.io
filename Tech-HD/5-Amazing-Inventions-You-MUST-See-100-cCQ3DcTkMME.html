we are eating our fleece we're eating
our yoga pants and we're eating our gym
clothes
my name is Rachel Miller and this
problem I'm talking about it's
microfiber pollution our clothes are
breaking up into tiny little pieces and
flowing out our washing machines into
our public water ways these pieces of
microfiber are so small smaller even
than a red blood cell that they're eaten
by creatures of all sizes and in all
levels of the marine food web and what
they eat we eat everyone who wears in
washes clothes is part of this problem
but don't be overwhelmed we have a
solution meet the core of all the core
of all is the first microfiber catching
laundry ball it's a human scale consumer
based solution to the problem of
microfiber pollution the core of all is
inspired by coral because coral does
what we need coral allows water to flow
and picks little things out of that
flowing water the coral ball is really
really easy to use you just throw or
drop it in a washing machine it works in
any washing machine you don't need a
plumber there are no installation costs
and you don't need extra space this is
what coral looks like while doing her
job
once your laundry's done you clean coral
like you clean a hairbrush you just pick
out the bits of fuzz and throw them in
the trash bin there is a big bonus the
core ball catches hair that is a big
deal in this household and I am only
one-third of the story our team has been
working on the solution for over a year
Cora was born out of our work on the
water this is a true social enterprise
the success of the Cora ball first and
foremost means a cleaner ocean secondly
proceeds support Rizal you project swear
cleaning and protecting the ocean and
developing and implementing more
solutions to the problem of marine
debris our backers are really important
to this project and to the team we've
already had the funding to order the
mold and file the patent so this
Kickstarter it's all about production
you will help us get the core ball out
into the world if 10% of US households
use a core ball we can keep the plastic
equivalent of over 30 million water
bottles out of our public waterways
every year that's a big impact for a
clean ocean we hope you'll help us get
the core ball out into the world so
together we can make a difference
this is upright go a small wearable that
helps the slouches become upright it is
the simplest way to improve your posture
just stick it on your back and press the
button that's it a bride would vibrate
everytime slouch look at the effect it
has on the screen slouches such a smile

long time since upright go sits directly
on the back it is the only device that
truly senses the back it's also the only
posture trainer that works no matter
what you're doing sitting standing or
walking oh look one of the screen
slouches has discovered that if you
press the button once more upright go
switches to tracking mode a mode that
doesn't vibrate when you slouch but
still keeps all your daily posture data
in the upright app incredible to
conclude our research we return to the
office two weeks later the results were
astonishing after two weeks being
