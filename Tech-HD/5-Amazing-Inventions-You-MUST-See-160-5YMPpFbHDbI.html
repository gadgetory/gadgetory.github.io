a good solution to sleep in nature rhino
wolf is an all-around incredible
solution that's just incredible
yeah we repeated the word incredible can
attend do this no it can't
oh and when you laid down to sleep in a
tent you need a sleeping bag and a
mattress you know what rhino wolf has to
say about that stupid tent Ryan the wolf
is a modular attachable what do I call
it not a tent because it's so much
better than a tent it's a modular
attachable rider wall because there's
nothing like it
lino wolf is amazingly built every scene
is precisely the primary key the
strongest possible with extra thought
the weight that all those right
materials and a built-in sleeping bag
and mattress rhino wolf weighs only five
pounds that's at least two pounds less
than carrying a sleeping bag mattress
and tent separately and you also don't
look like a snail when carrying it ah
look at that snail man mailman Rhino
wolf also weighs less than other all in
one tent but it's also better than them
because it's not a tent it's a writable
Ryan wolf has a main arch that gives the
entire structure its solid strength and
allows for straight sides which enables
great airflow and a fit for the human
body you're human right yeah you are
Rhino wolf can withstand very low
temperatures and feels very cool in warm
one
of course it's wind proof rain proof and
bug food it's a rhino it's strong and
yes it also comes in pink
Rhino will can pull up any color the
setup Rhino will you just use one pole
yeah one that's less than any other
number just push the pole through the
sleeve and you're done now thanks to the
Rhino wolf part you can easily attach
your incredible Rhino to other
incredible rivals and create a pack of
Rhino walls get it
a rhino wolf pack take a look at the
Rhino wolf sleeping bag that wave less
but keeps you warmer we took some
filling from the bottom added it to the
top and put an insulating air mattress
instead so you sleep like in a bed not
like you're stuck in a cube like some
two feeds or something you're not
toothpaste you're human and you deserve
comfort riding warm comfort when you
attach another Rhino wolf you can also
attach the blankets to create a double
bed for you know things you do in a
double bed need some privacy
just close your own rhino wolf and
you've got your own room
yup a double bed with privacy is that
better than your home probably not
that's a stupid comparison be we have a
vision
no more tents no more carrying extra
sleeping equipment just rhyme rules
everywhere because a tent that's okay
rhino wolf is incredible get one and be
happy it's simple

these days more and more people are
getting out it's a great outdoors and
whether they're hiking or biking or just
taking a casual stroll like I am right
here you've got to be prepared my
knapsack I got a first-aid kit with some
suntan lotion some water in case I get
thirsty and I've even got a cell phone
with a GPS locator on it but even with
all this stuff I'm not quite as prepared
to say this guy here you know I like
Harrison Jones he's an inventor who's
come up with a nifty solution The
Bodyguard it houses a phone a camera GPS
tracker so it's kind of like a 911 call
with eyes and all sorts of other goodies
in a hard shell that acts as a shield
there's not even a crack oh he also
added a little something extra to
protect you well help is on the way
Kevin Costner invested six figures into
the project and attracted further
financing from his connections the brown
shocker became the bodyguard
Kevin and his associates also helped
Dave see the potential of his invention
as the next big thing in law enforcement
the laser sighted camera flashlight GPS
all are great tools for cops the
hardshell can come in handy too what is
this bump for one protection so if I
were to stab me with a knife right now
where would your hand go so if I had a
knife and I started doing this you
actually have a shield here okay but
it's the new way Dave devised to use a
defensive stunner that really brought
attention to his multitasking glove the
LA County sheriff's technology
exploration unit has expressed interest
in several features of the bodyguard and
plans to field-test the device in the
near future a mom is designed for
outdoor enthusiasts and regular folks
who want to feel safer is in the final
phase of development</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
